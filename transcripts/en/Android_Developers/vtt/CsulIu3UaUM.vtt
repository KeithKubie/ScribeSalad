00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710
 

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.782
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome to what's
new in N-- not the real name.

00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:05.490
FEMALE SPEAKER: But
we can talk about all

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.420
of the new features added
in this version of Android.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.410
For example, Marshmallow brought
you Doze and App Standby,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.230
and now N is bringing
new Doze again.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.780
But it's so much more.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.640
The goal here is to coalesce
back on activity whenever

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.860
the screen is off
and not necessarily

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.360
when the device is stationary.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.010
So this brings Doze out of
the "tablet on a shelf" model

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.330
and into the "user out about
and needs her battery" scenario.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.320
So shortly after the
screen is turned off,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.490
Doze will be activated, and all
network access and background

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.740
jobs will be restricted into
maintenance windows that

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.530
happen every "N" minutes.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.270
But in this lighter wait
mode, alarms, wake clocks,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.440
and Wi-Fi scans will
all happen normally,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.800
and all of the other Doze
best practices still apply.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.030
Cloud messaging.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.460
Of course, this is all an
extension of Doze mode.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.070
So if the device
is stationary, then

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.626
the Marshmallow-flavored
Doze will kick in.

00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:56.750
MALE SPEAKER: If you're
actually using your device,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.300
there's also a ton
of cool new features,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.890
like two apps on screen
at the same time.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.670
That's right.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.870
Smartphones and tablets will
support split screen windows,

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.810
where two apps are placed
right up next to one another.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.590
Now this doesn't change the
usual activity lifecycle,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.130
though.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.440
There's still only one app
that's resumed at a time.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.124
The other app will be
paused and not stopped,

00:01:18.124 --> 00:01:20.290
so it should be able to
update you with new messages

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.320
and keep a video
playing, for instance.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.320
There's a new resizable
activity attribute

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.530
you add to your manifest
entry to control how you work

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.800
with multiple window
mode and also attributes

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.060
for setting a minimum size.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.620
There's also a fancy new
LAUNCH_ADJACENT intent flag

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.000
to hint that you'd like the
launched activity to be opened

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.580
alongside the current activity.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.950
And there's a little something
extra for Android TV users--

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.860
Picture-in-Picture.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.570
Now your app can continue
to run in miniature form

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.589
on top of everything else.

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:55.130
Of course, that
means you should hide

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.700
things that are
totally unreadable

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.270
in Picture-in-Picture.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.360
There's new callbacks for
when you enter and leave

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.440
this mode if you
choose to support it,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.156
which you should, particularly
for video apps out there.

00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:08.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: So yeah,
multi-window wins the day.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.090
But there are so
many new features

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.930
that have nothing
to do with the UI,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.980
like Data Saver, which was
introduced on a per-app basis

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.200
a while back so that
the user can specify

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.040
certain apps to be Wi-Fi only
and keep their data costs down.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.580
But with N, we added
a device-wide option.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.824
This means your app really needs
to be good at not wasting data

00:02:26.824 --> 00:02:29.490
and at failing gracefully if you
cannot access the network right

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.130
now.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.890
So to help you, we
added an API call

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.430
so you can check if your
app is network restricted

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.760
and maybe try a header to
let the user know your app is

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.310
in "save data" mode.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.180
MALE SPEAKER: One of the most
noticeable things in Android N,

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.840
particularly for
end users, is going

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.880
to be the total visual
redesign of notifications.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.870
Yup, all the standard
templates have

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.186
changed quite significantly.

00:02:51.186 --> 00:02:52.810
You'll also notice
some of the features

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.390
from Android Wear are
being expanded upon

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.000
and making their way onto
other Android devices.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.580
For example, you'll
be able to use

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.410
remote input to send
replies directly

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.420
from the notification shade.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.350
You'll also be able to
show the sent message

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.950
history in the notification,
so you'll always

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.700
know exactly where you
left the conversation.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.720
Now grouping notifications
make it a lot easier

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.390
to handle multiple
notifications from the same app

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.030
by creating a single summary
notification now allowing users

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.000
to expand it into individual
actionable and dismissable

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.690
notifications.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.330
Grouping is enabled
by default on all app,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.400
but you'll want to
customize the summary

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.294
notification to make for a
great notification experience.

00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:42.710
FEMALE SPEAKER: Speaking of
making things great for users,

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.590
encrypting your phone is
great and secure and awesome,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.280
but it does mean
that you have to be

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.580
around to help it boot up.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.790
So if your phone restarts
while you're sleeping,

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.890
your alarm clock
has died as well.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.270
Direct Boot will
allow the device

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.080
to fully wake up, to have
alarms, and to receive calls.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.830
This way, users won't
be stuck in alert,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.455
and then they can
put in their password

00:04:02.455 --> 00:04:04.160
when they go to
use their device.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.700
But it also means that if
your app handles calls or SMS

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.660
messages, uses TalkBack,
or triggers an alarm,

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.720
you will now need to be crypto
aware, which means state it

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.450
in your manifest
when targeting N,

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.550
and you will need to
specify which files should

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.380
be device encrypted or
credential encrypted

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.910
so that you can receive
special treatment.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.070
MALE SPEAKER: And speaking
of special treatment,

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.750
Marshmallow brought permissions
requests to the user in context

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.590
with run time permissions.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.720
But for storage, taking
it a step farther,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.190
instead of having to request
access to everything,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.380
apps can now request access to a
specific folder, such as Alarms

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.260
or Pictures, with full support
for both internal and removable

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.060
media volumes.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.620
FEMALE SPEAKER: Also, heads up.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.200
Some of your implicit
broadcasts are changing.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.590
As part of our continued
focus on Project Svelte,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.670
we want to make background
activity even more efficient.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.090
So all apps targeting the N that
listen for connectivity action

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.770
broadcasts in their
manifest and rely

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.300
on it to launch their process
will no longer be woken,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.940
because a single network switch
can result in a bazillion

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.866
apps all waking up
when maybe two of them

00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:12.990
will actually do something.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.500
And this is horrible
for performance,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.424
and the time has come to fix
it because "perfmatters."

00:05:19.424 --> 00:05:21.090
However, if your app
is already running,

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.750
it can still receive
this broadcast

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.470
with context registerReceiver.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.820
But as of N plus,
you will no longer

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.470
be able to send or receive a new
picture or new video broadcast.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.550
Instead, JobScheduler has
been extended to trigger jobs

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.880
on a constant provider update,
which is a much better way

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.190
to handle a response to
a picture being taken

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.920
and which means users won't
wonder why the camera app keeps

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.710
freezing.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.650
Time to migrate to JobScheduler.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.970
But if you're afraid of
JobScheduler, just tweet me.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.200
We can chat.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.690
Android N also allows users
to specify multiple locales

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.370
and settings, which
means apps can all

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.560
show search results
in multiple languages

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.890
or avoid offering
translations for languages

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.620
that the user already knows.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.270
So the full list of
locales for a user

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.159
can be accessed via
Localelist_getDefault.

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.450
MALE SPEAKER: So check out
the links in the description

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.970
for everything, and
I mean everything

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.190
you need to know about
Android N-- ot the real name.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.690
Not-- not yet.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.940
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:26.750
