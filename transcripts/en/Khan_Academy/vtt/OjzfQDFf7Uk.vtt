00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.874
- [Voiceover] As we start
exploring the world of statistics,

00:00:04.874 --> 00:00:06.043
it's worth asking ourself,

00:00:06.043 --> 00:00:09.713
what is the word statistics even mean?

00:00:09.713 --> 00:00:12.880
Statistics is really a
broad category of things

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.645
that you might do with data.

00:00:14.645 --> 00:00:18.568
So it generally deals with
data, collecting data.

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:19.660
So actually let me write these down.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.085
It's involving collecting data,

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:23.765
collecting data.

00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:26.725
You could present data
in tables or charts,

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:28.141
or just as lists of numbers,

00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:30.138
or however you might do it.

00:00:30.138 --> 00:00:32.483
It is analyzing the data,

00:00:32.483 --> 00:00:36.285
analyzing, analyzing,

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:37.715
presenting and analyzing data.

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:40.306
So this whole class of just all this stuff

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:43.595
that you might do with
data to answer a question

00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:45.330
or try to figure out what's going on,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.073
or just to learn about the world,

00:00:47.073 --> 00:00:50.020
the whole class of things
is called statistics.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.068
Now an idea that will
come up very frequently

00:00:53.068 --> 00:00:57.117
in statistics is the
notion of variability.

00:00:57.117 --> 00:00:59.950
Variability.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.899
In everyday language, variability,

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.161
it's how much something is ...

00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:05.624
How much does it vary?

00:01:05.624 --> 00:01:07.197
How much does it change?

00:01:07.197 --> 00:01:09.172
It's the same notion in statistics.

00:01:09.172 --> 00:01:12.299
In statistics, variability
is the degree to which

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.711
data points are different from each other,

00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:16.741
the degree to which they vary.

00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:18.366
Just as an example of that

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.223
to just make it a little
bit more concrete,

00:01:20.223 --> 00:01:22.243
let's say you were to go to five people,

00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:24.101
and you were to ask them,

00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:28.528
how many bricks did you eat yesterday?

00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:30.076
Each of the people say, well I ...

00:01:30.076 --> 00:01:32.274
Person one says, "I
don't eat bricks at all.

00:01:32.274 --> 00:01:33.914
"I don't even know how to do that.

00:01:33.914 --> 00:01:34.983
"I ate zero bricks."

00:01:34.983 --> 00:01:36.198
Then next person says zero,

00:01:36.198 --> 00:01:37.330
the next person says zero,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.589
fourth person says zero,

00:01:38.589 --> 00:01:40.400
and the fifth person says zero.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.035
Fair enough, so that was our data point

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:43.814
on the different data points on ...

00:01:43.814 --> 00:01:45.045
And I'm already doing statistics

00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:46.444
just by going out there and asking them

00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:48.295
how many bricks they ate.

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:51.758
Then I ask them how many grapes

00:01:51.758 --> 00:01:53.467
did you eat yesterday?

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:56.514
The first person says "I ate zero grapes."

00:01:56.514 --> 00:01:58.603
But the next person says
"I survive on grapes.

00:01:58.603 --> 00:02:00.808
"I ate 235 grapes."

00:02:00.808 --> 00:02:02.766
The next person says, "Yeah I like grapes.

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:04.270
"I ate 17 grapes."

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.642
Then the person after that
says that they five grapes.

00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:10.468
Then next person also survives on grapes,

00:02:10.468 --> 00:02:11.460
even to a larger degree.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.345
They ate 318 grapes.

00:02:14.345 --> 00:02:16.089
So if you look at these two data sets,

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:18.725
one is the number of bricks
someone ate yesterday,

00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:20.975
the other one is how many
grapes they ate yesterday,

00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:22.943
you immediately see that
there's more variability here.

00:02:22.943 --> 00:02:24.631
All of these data points are zero,

00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:26.798
while these, they change a good bit

00:02:26.798 --> 00:02:28.795
from data point to data point.

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:31.783
So we have a sense that
there is more variability

00:02:31.783 --> 00:02:33.610
in this data set.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.304
Now one of the things we will start doing

00:02:35.304 --> 00:02:38.178
a lot in statistics is try to measure

00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:40.233
how much more, how much variability is.

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:41.467
How can we can quantify that?

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:42.744
How can we put a number on it?

00:02:42.744 --> 00:02:44.207
How can we measure variability?

00:02:44.207 --> 00:02:47.208
This is a big aspect of statistics,

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:48.642
but we won't do that in this video.

00:02:48.642 --> 00:02:50.879
There are future videos for doing that.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.580
But just as we go into
the world of statistics,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.391
we should think about
when should our brain

00:02:57.391 --> 00:02:59.275
even start getting into statistics mode,

00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:02.060
thinking about the tools
that we have at our disposal,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.412
about collecting data and
measuring variability,

00:03:05.412 --> 00:03:07.331
and measuring and finding numbers

00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:11.909
that somehow represent a pool
of data that has variability.

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.160
So the question we should ask ourselves is

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.550
what questions in the world
are statistical questions?

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.202
So statistical,

00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:23.085
statistical questions.

00:03:24.255 --> 00:03:25.092
So let's come up with a

00:03:25.092 --> 00:03:26.925
definition for statistical questions,

00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:28.897
the type of question
where we would want to

00:03:28.897 --> 00:03:33.267
start bringing out our
statistical toolkit.

00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:34.733
One possible way to think about

00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:36.679
when you need to bring out
your statistical toolkit

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:39.755
is these are questions
that to answer them,

00:03:39.755 --> 00:03:41.323
to answer,

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:46.153
you need to collect data with variability.

00:03:46.153 --> 00:03:48.584
To answer, you need

00:03:48.584 --> 00:03:50.207
to collect

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.512
data with variability.

00:03:55.512 --> 00:03:57.440
I apologize for my handwriting.

00:03:58.378 --> 00:04:00.458
Data with variability.

00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:02.100
That's W-I-T-H.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.131
Data with

00:04:06.176 --> 00:04:08.354
variability.

00:04:08.354 --> 00:04:10.930
So you're saying, okay
that kinda makes sense,

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.762
but I need to see some tangible questions

00:04:12.762 --> 00:04:14.552
or tangible examples of things

00:04:14.552 --> 00:04:16.177
that are statistical questions

00:04:16.177 --> 00:04:18.524
and things that are not
statistical questions.

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.032
I would say fair enough.

00:04:20.032 --> 00:04:21.776
Let's look at some examples.

00:04:23.038 --> 00:04:25.636
So here I have six questions,

00:04:25.636 --> 00:04:28.050
and I encourage you to
pause this video right now.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.019
Before I work through it, think about it.

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:32.482
Based on this definition
of a statistical question,

00:04:32.482 --> 00:04:34.757
which of these questions are statistical,

00:04:34.757 --> 00:04:37.591
would require your statistical toolkit,

00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:39.878
and which of these are not statistical?

00:04:41.155 --> 00:04:42.517
So assuming you had a go at it,

00:04:42.517 --> 00:04:44.490
let's go through these one by one.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.514
So the first question,

00:04:45.514 --> 00:04:48.174
how much does my pet grapefruit weigh?

00:04:48.174 --> 00:04:49.367
You know, it's bizarre to begin with

00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:50.968
to have a pet grapefruit,

00:04:50.968 --> 00:04:53.877
but is this a statistical question?

00:04:54.847 --> 00:04:56.053
What do I need to do to answer it?

00:04:56.053 --> 00:04:57.779
I have to take my pet grapefruit out.

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:59.179
I have to weigh it.

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:00.673
Then I have to just write that down.

00:05:00.673 --> 00:05:03.094
Just doing that I am collecting data,

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:06.234
so you could argue that
maybe I'm kinda starting

00:05:06.234 --> 00:05:07.944
to mess with statistics a little bit,

00:05:07.944 --> 00:05:09.988
but I'm just getting one data point.

00:05:09.988 --> 00:05:11.451
So I might weigh it and I might see

00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:14.879
my grapefruit weighs one pound,

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.333
but that's not data with variability.

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:18.564
That's just one data point.

00:05:18.564 --> 00:05:19.845
In order to have
variability you have to have

00:05:19.845 --> 00:05:21.241
multiple data points

00:05:21.241 --> 00:05:24.607
and should be at least
possible that they could vary.

00:05:24.607 --> 00:05:27.502
So, for example, all of
these folks ate zero bricks

00:05:27.502 --> 00:05:30.961
but maybe it was possible that
someone actually ate a brick.

00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:32.874
But here I have just one data point.

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:34.848
With one data point, you
can't have variability,

00:05:34.848 --> 00:05:37.216
so this is not a statistical question.

00:05:37.216 --> 00:05:38.841
I just collect a data point.

00:05:38.841 --> 00:05:41.339
Next question, what is the average number

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:44.165
of cars in a parking
lot on Monday mornings?

00:05:44.165 --> 00:05:46.269
To think about whether it
is a statistical question,

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:47.153
we just have to think about

00:05:47.153 --> 00:05:49.318
what do I have to do to
answer that question?

00:05:49.318 --> 00:05:51.060
I would have to go out to the parking lot

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.345
on multiple Monday mornings,

00:05:53.345 --> 00:05:55.466
and measure the number of cars.

00:05:55.466 --> 00:05:56.761
So on the first Monday morning

00:05:56.761 --> 00:05:58.409
I might see there are 50 cars.

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.635
The next Monday morning
I might go out there

00:06:00.635 --> 00:06:02.226
and count there's 49 cars.

00:06:02.226 --> 00:06:04.997
The next Monday morning I
might see 50 cars again.

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:08.575
The next Monday morning
I might see 63 cars.

00:06:08.575 --> 00:06:10.446
So I'm collecting multiple data points

00:06:10.446 --> 00:06:11.586
to answer this question.

00:06:11.586 --> 00:06:13.304
Then I'm going to take
the average of all these,

00:06:13.304 --> 00:06:15.315
but I'm collecting multiple data points

00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:17.452
to answer this question.

00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:21.910
It's definitely possible that
there could be variation here,

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.382
that there could be variability,

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:26.590
so this is a statistical question.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.026
Next question, am I hungry?

00:06:29.026 --> 00:06:30.264
It's an important question.

00:06:30.264 --> 00:06:32.539
We ask it to ourselves multiple times.

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:36.014
In fact, sometimes our
bodies just tell it to us.

00:06:36.014 --> 00:06:37.641
But I am definitely not collecting ...

00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:38.849
I guess you could say I'm collecting

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.215
some type of feelings from my stomach

00:06:41.215 --> 00:06:43.437
or how weak I feel or not,

00:06:43.437 --> 00:06:45.715
but it's definitely not
data with variability.

00:06:45.715 --> 00:06:48.733
I'm either hungry or not
hungry on a given day.

00:06:48.733 --> 00:06:50.311
I mean if you said broader,

00:06:50.311 --> 00:06:52.290
how does my hunger change from day to day

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.448
and you came up some type of a
scale for rating your hunger,

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:57.314
all right maybe that's more statistical.

00:06:57.314 --> 00:07:00.028
But just am I hungry, a yes-no question.

00:07:00.028 --> 00:07:01.181
This is not ...

00:07:02.104 --> 00:07:03.615
To answer this I do not have to

00:07:03.615 --> 00:07:05.481
collect data with variability,

00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:08.121
so this is not a statistical question.

00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:10.466
How many teeth does my mother have?

00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:12.431
To do this I would have
to go find my mother,

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:15.344
and then I would have to
ask her to open her mouth,

00:07:15.344 --> 00:07:16.916
and count the teeth in her mouth.

00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:18.797
Maybe I'd get a number like 30.

00:07:18.797 --> 00:07:21.436
So it's kind of like how much
does my pet grapefruit weigh.

00:07:21.436 --> 00:07:25.393
I do have to collect one data point,

00:07:25.393 --> 00:07:28.431
but one data point is not
going to have variability,

00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:30.879
so I am not collecting
data with variability,

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:32.978
so this is not a statistical question.

00:07:32.978 --> 00:07:35.441
If I said how many teeth
do all of the mothers

00:07:35.441 --> 00:07:37.132
that I know have on average,

00:07:37.132 --> 00:07:39.275
or what's the range of number of teeth

00:07:39.275 --> 00:07:40.432
of the mothers I know have,

00:07:40.432 --> 00:07:43.055
that would be statistical.

00:07:43.055 --> 00:07:45.941
But this is just one data
point, so not statistical.

00:07:45.941 --> 00:07:48.703
How much time do the members of my family

00:07:48.703 --> 00:07:50.834
spend eating per year?

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:55.987
Once again, what do I need to
do to answer this question?

00:07:55.987 --> 00:07:58.399
I would have to go either observe

00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:00.256
or survey my family members,

00:08:00.256 --> 00:08:03.289
maybe my mom, my wife, my children,

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:05.523
and my uncles, aunts, whoever else,

00:08:05.523 --> 00:08:07.540
and I would say how much
do you eat each day?

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.863
I would add them all up to figure out

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.216
how much they eat in a year.

00:08:10.216 --> 00:08:12.299
Maybe family member A

00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:15.552
eats 813 hours in a year.

00:08:15.552 --> 00:08:18.561
Family member B ate, I don't know,

00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:22.938
732 hours in the year.

00:08:22.938 --> 00:08:25.718
So you see the general notion
that I will be collecting

00:08:25.718 --> 00:08:28.823
multiple data points from
the different family members.

00:08:28.823 --> 00:08:30.115
There very well, and in fact,

00:08:30.115 --> 00:08:32.947
there's very likely to
be variation in that.

00:08:32.947 --> 00:08:35.009
In fact, I might even see
variation from year to year.

00:08:35.009 --> 00:08:36.170
Person A is probably going to eat

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.581
a different number of
hours in the next year.

00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:41.230
So I'm definitely going to
collect data with variability

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.321
in order to answer this question.

00:08:43.321 --> 00:08:45.527
So that is a statistical question.

00:08:45.527 --> 00:08:47.297
Then finally, I have the question,

00:08:47.297 --> 00:08:50.570
how many times have I watched Star Wars?

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.591
This is very similar to how
many teeth does my mother have,

00:08:53.591 --> 00:08:55.395
or how much does my pet grapefruit weigh.

00:08:55.395 --> 00:08:57.413
I just have to count the number of times

00:08:57.413 --> 00:08:58.599
that I watched Star Wars.

00:08:58.599 --> 00:09:01.061
Maybe I watched it seven times.

00:09:01.061 --> 00:09:02.330
Just one data point.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.755
No variability here.

00:09:03.755 --> 00:09:06.268
If I said on average how many times

00:09:06.268 --> 00:09:07.879
have my co-workers watched Star Wars,

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:09.967
then I'm gonna have to
collect data with variability.

00:09:09.967 --> 00:09:11.184
I'm gonna collect multiple data points,

00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:13.610
and it's definitely
possible that my co-workers

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.463
have watched it different
numbers of times.

00:09:15.463 --> 00:09:17.082
But for this question in particular,

00:09:17.082 --> 00:09:18.967
where it's just one
data point to answer it,

00:09:18.967 --> 00:09:20.958
how many times have I watched Star Wars?

00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.496
My answer in this case
actually I think is seven.

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:25.175
Then not a statistical question.

00:09:26.083 --> 00:09:27.760
So hopefully that gives you a sense

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.501
of statistics variability

00:09:29.501 --> 00:09:33.045
and what a statistical question even is.
