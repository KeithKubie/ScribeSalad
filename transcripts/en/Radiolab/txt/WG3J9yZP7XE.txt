Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast. And today we thought we would, we would tell a lie, right? That's we're looking at, we're going at, we're going to, we're going to, yeah, no, I think we should get on with it. Yes. This one comes to us from an producer, Lulu Miller. All right, so I'm going to tell you a story. [inaudible] takes place in Germany who can talk at an old folks home. Hello. That's not where we are right now, but, and we brought two of the people who work at the home flow into a studio. We have to close the door. It sounds like you're having a party over there. So the story really belongs to this guy. Richard knew right there. Yeah. He's the director of the home, which is called Ben Wrath senior center in Philadelphia. But we've also brought [inaudible] who also works at the home and speaks more English.

Speaker 1:          00:51          I just held Mr [inaudible] talked to today. We do it like this. Yeah. Okay. So Mr New right there has a problem. John [inaudible], Lloyd as houseful. It's a problem. Most nursing homes face. I meant to mention this house, my lesson, which is that many people who develop dementia, Alzheimer's, they'll become disoriented and confused and suddenly think, why am I am? Where am I? This is not my world and I have to go back to my house. My children are waiting for me. And usually you know, nurses will intercept them. Relax, you are living here. But occasionally people somehow slip out the front door. Yeah. Escapes. They happen. And then they wander.

Speaker 2:          01:39          [inaudible] they had one woman make it onto a bus and she escaped about how many kilometers she eventually made it to a town about 20 miles away. Yeah, they've had people turn up at grocery stores, wandering in the forest. They've even had people make it all the way back to their old houses and find new people living there. Yup. And for the people who work at the home says regain Yo yo get crazy not knowing ways

Speaker 1:          02:04          first. And then where did she go? Test, test, test, test. This is something we all know about you. Do you guys know I'm working on this story about the Alzheimer's? Yes. And while reporting this piece, so I was checking in with my parents about some stories like this. What happened to my grandpa. Wow. Wow. And they told me when I never heard one morning, this was in February. Yes. This was on a very, very frigid cold morning. My grandpa got up five in the morning, left the house and walked to the train station. You probably got the earliest tea ticket all the way up to Cambridge cause he thought he had to teach a class at Harvard. Did he used to teach at home? No, but he'd given lectures there. So anyway, that's my pitch. Dark early in the morning, frigid Boston weather and he was only in his long underwear with his coat and hat and scarf on over that he didn't even have shoes on. He was just wearing a slipper. He was picked up by the police because he was, you know, um, hypothermic. Yeah, he was hypothermic. He was hypothermic. I mean his, when they brought him into the hospital and his temperature was too low down to none on that, it was the moment when I knew that, um, you know, that everything was going to have to change, that he would have to move into a place that had a floor for people who are set for locked floor. That's what it meant.

Speaker 3:          03:30          So

Speaker 1:          03:32          essentially is the problem. Some people have to to be locked in, which just feels cruel. Yeah. That's horrible. Yeah, it is. And then in walks of fellow named Mr Google. No, no, no. Good, bad. No. Good, good. Really awful. Oh really? Okay. Try to make it more like Gerber goodbye. Yeah. Okay. No good that. Oh, okay. We'll just like, we'll just use you saying it. We'll do it. Your Mr. Mr. Good. Okay. So Ms [inaudible] good. It was an older gentleman. He sat on an advisory board of the senior center and one day he came up with this idea. Yeah, that's Richard. No, right there. Again, I'm at Michelin and it's one of these ideas that's so out there and yet so simple that you think it just couldn't possibly work. When Mr Gerber came into the office of the shot and presented his idea, Chad was just laughing.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Ally's come Altius he thought it's very funny. What a funny idea. Well, what is it already? What's the idea? Well, Mr Google thought that right in front of the home they should build a bus. Stop the bus stop. What? Build a bust. I, I don't understand what, what would that do? Well, think about what a bus stop is. When you see a bus stop. It's a, the first step into the wide world from the little bus stop, you get a anywhere. Yeah. Bergene says that in a lot of these wandering cases, the first place people often head is to a bus stop. Ah, and so back to our friend Mr Gerber, he thought what they should do is build a bus stop right in front of the home that has just one crucially odd feature. There's snow bus coming, no bus, never. It's the best stuff to nowhere. So his thought was moment, it would be a way of catching people who happened to wander. Okay. They'd see the bus stop, go and sit on it waiting for a bus that would never come to. And then eventually a staff member could see them and bring them back. No chief officer. So while Richard's first thought was, this is ridiculous. Second thought, hmm, maybe not that bad.

Speaker 4:          06:00          Right.

Speaker 1:          06:02          So they bolted in a bench, made off Iran, put up the sign in yellow and green, just like every government issued bus stop. And when you get out of the home, you see it immediately

Speaker 4:          06:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          06:16          and the staff as I'm, or does she leave? Say Richard and Regina just thought this was a stupid idea. Oh, it's not appropriate. Or it's even cynical and most of all that it probably just wouldn't work. Yeah. And at first it looked like they were right. [inaudible] I've also one by one, the neighbors, you know, normal people, they said, oh, new bus. And they waited there for the bus. And so one by one Richard would have to run out and explain this. Not for you. That's fascinating. That sticked his name. There was this period of adjustment. Yeah, and then one day and now old lady, an actual patient from the home. He started having an episode. She was very troubled in her mind. She was a little girl and she needed to get home to her parents. My mother waits for me. I have to go home. Her mom very quick. The nurses talk to her and try to calm her down, but she began to cry so they thought, well, let's just let her walk out. It was fall. It was brother cold, so she went to the best of in her coat and her head and she said, they're very patient and she waited for the bus in the fresh air, Sun shining and eventually a nurse came over and sat with her and they weighted together side by side.

Speaker 1:          07:59          Eventually she forgot why she was there. The nurse said, we go in and have a cup of tea together and then she came back and everything was fine. She was relaxed. She was in the present time, not longer. In the past time,

Speaker 2:          08:23          it's been two years since the bench first went up and Richard and regain, say they use it all the time, every couple of days. Sometimes the nurses will take someone who's upset and wants to go home. The nurses say, let's go to the bus stop, let's see what we will do and how we plan the day. And or sometimes the nurses, they don't see that somebody escaped and they say, Oh way's Mrs. Smith. And then they look out over the wall. She's waiting for the boss. Yeah, and somebody go out there. But one thing is always the same. When the people get to

Speaker 1:          08:56          the bus stop, the mood is very dark. I'm feeling so lonely. I want to go home and also urgent. My parents wait from me, my children wait for me. I have to go there quick, quick, quick. But then after awhile as they're sitting there thinking their escape is on the way, that urgent feeling disappears. Did, do you know why or can, I guess, can you describe it disappearing? Like does it go away slowly or suddenly be, forget the Denzel's [inaudible] almost undersigned where his start and [inaudible]. It's like another thought comes up and then you forget what you wanted. Yeah, no, it's like a fish is coming up to as a surface of a water going down again and disappearing thoughts come up and they disappear. You don't know that they have ever been there. Oh yeah. You'll forget which is, it's interesting. It's the forgetting is both the problem and the solution. Yeah. The Lulu, I mean isn't this maybe a little bit cruel because it is a lie that's happening here. I mean they are lying to these people. Well, sure. It's definitely a lie. There's no way around that, but what's the alternative? I mean, take that woman at the bus stop. What are you supposed to say to her?

Speaker 1:          10:43          I know that you're utterly convinced of this, but actually you're not a little girl. You live in a nursing home. As you can imagine, these kinds of conversations don't go well. No. They say sometimes they have to restrain the people, hold them back, call the police. They don't accept it because it's not their world. It's two completely different world. And so they say, why not just allow that other world to be true for just a beat and then gently coax them back beds. The aim of the whole thing to lead those memories very gently into this. Now this today and this idea has sort of spread at the nursing home. It changed the atmosphere in the home. Now they try to do this sort of time shifting in all different ways. Sounds a little bit complicated, but it isn't. Like for example, they had this guy who's a baker who was used to want to get up at two o'clock in the morning and they used to say, no, you know, go back, go back to bed. We're, we're working. Yeah. But now they just say, okay. And they let them get up at two o'clock they take him the kitchen and let him bake a van. He says, well, I'm always in time and I'm proud I never miss an hour of mine. And the interesting part for me is that I think about my grandpa wandering through the cold and his slippers, and here's this way in which people can be somewhat lost in their memories and yet exist in the present, safely, safely
