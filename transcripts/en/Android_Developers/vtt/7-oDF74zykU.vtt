SHAZIA MAKHDUMI: So
I'm Shazia Makhdumi,

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.480
and I'm part of our Google
Play Apps and Games BD team.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.490
And I lead our effort
for kids and family apps.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.315
So how many people here are
kids and family developers?

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.370
Excellent.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.860
So if I'm blocking any
of you, just let me know.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.240
So I always like to start
by showing-- and some of you

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.000
may have seen this,
but this is kind

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.670
of when you think about building
great kids and family apps,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.430
this is what we're trying to do.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.020

-Now do we need butter?

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:54.301
-Uh, no.

The other way.

00:00:55.035 --> 00:00:55.836
Like that.

00:00:55.836 --> 00:00:56.502
That's terrific.

00:00:56.502 --> 00:01:00.403
For this one we
fold it like this.

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:00.903
Wow.

00:01:00.903 --> 00:01:02.859
What we cover.

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.326

00:01:04.326 --> 00:01:07.630
Where is the black one?

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.118
-Oh, it's in my eyes.

00:01:09.118 --> 00:01:10.602
Is that what my hair looks like?

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:11.102
-Yeah.

00:01:11.102 --> 00:01:11.602
-Yeah?

You do that one.

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:28.462
-All right then.

00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:29.103
-That's it.

00:01:29.103 --> 00:01:31.103

[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:56.880
SHAZIA MAKHDUMI: I've watched
that video so many times,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.090
and every time I get goosebumps.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.640
But so what we're
here to do is help you

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.640
guys build more of those
moments for families,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.370
and Google's made
a big investment

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.520
in the kids and family space.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.370
How many people here have heard
of our Google Play for Families

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.250
program?

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.500
We announced it Google I/O. OK.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.250
So that's quite a few
people in the audience.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.030
Sorry, let me try and
get to the next slide.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.830
So it's basically a new
discovery experience on Play.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.930
So a separate section for
kids and family content

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.770
where you can opt in to being
in that section in addition

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.270
to being in the main Play Store.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.079
And what that does
is it allows parents

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.870
to go to a particular
place where they want

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.400
to search for content for
kids, either by browsing

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.180
top collections for kids,
or by age group, or even

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.790
popular characters.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.080
So I'll talk a little bit
about some of the key elements

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.220
of what we've done in that.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.780
So again, search results
are more relevant.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.960
So for example, if you do a
search for, let's say, music.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.730
In the Family section,
as you can see,

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.330
the results are going
to be very different,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.130
because we understand
that you're looking

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.900
for kids and family content.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.030
And it's only going to give
you results from the apps

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.090
and games that have been opted
into our Families program,

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.540
whereas the same search
anywhere else in Play

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.840
gives you very
different results.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.970
And on that related
search note, no matter

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.220
where you are, if you're doing
a search-- and as you've known,

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.340
Google really knows search.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.450
So if we understand you're
doing a search for kids

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.340
content-- so educational
games for kids, or apps

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.720
for three-year-olds, or
in this case coloring

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.400
for kids-- the results you
will get will be boosted.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.856
Or the apps and games that are
created for kids-- because we

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:46.480
understand it's a kids search--
are going to get a search boost

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.350
and will show up
high in the results

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.070
no matter where
the search is done.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.440
So again, search, which is a
really main way for parents

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.620
to search for content
for their kids,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.969
in addition to
browsing or characters,

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:01.510
we've put a lot of
effort into making

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.840
sure we get it right to get
your content in front of them.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.450
And I mentioned
characters earlier.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.220
We know characters are very
important to kids, right?

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.580
Everyone has their
favorite character,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.520
they want all the
content, they're obsessed.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.010
I have two boys,
seven and eight,

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.970
and they've been through
their different obsessions.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.079
But what we did was we wanted
a place-- from a parent

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.190
perspective, you have one place
to go and get all the content

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.940
you want related
to Peppa the Pig,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.045
or related to Dora, or Elmo,
or "Frozen," or what have you.

00:04:31.045 --> 00:04:32.670
So you have your apps
and games, you've

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.780
got your movies and TV
content, you've got your books.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.140
And so this is a way for
parents to find that content.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.000
And then for developers,
like yourselves,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.260
who have invested in
licensing, it really

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.280
gives a chance to get
your licensed content

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.500
in front of users
in additional ways

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.910
than them just searching for it.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.050
And then lastly, we've also put
in a lot of tools and controls

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.540
that make it easier for parents
to find great safe content

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.430
for their kids.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.050
So for example, we
have content ratings

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.870
that we launched
earlier in the year,

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.610
and everyone in the store-- so
not just kids and family apps,

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.750
but everyone-- has
a content reading.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.570
And you can only be
in the Family section

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.100
if you have an E or E10 rating.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.000
We also let parents know
which apps or games have

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.940
ads or in-app purchases
in case they care.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.619
If you're a parent
looking for something

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:28.160
in a particular
category, or you want

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.576
to see if it's age
appropriate, we

00:05:29.576 --> 00:05:31.480
have badging that
helps you get there.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.350
And then finally, we also
have put in more password

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.990
protections or password
controls for reducing

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.350
accidental in-app
purchases by kids.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.700
So that's kind of on the
design and development side.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.220
We're also investing a lot from
marketing and the promotions

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.720
side.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.210
We're really trying to get more
users to the Family section

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.940
and then in front
of your content.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.750
So for example, of
course, a lot of email

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.450
and social sort of
marketing campaigns,

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.790
we're working with
curators who are

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.430
curating expert
collections on Play, doing

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.020
a lot of seasonal themes.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.930
And then we actually
did a first of its kind

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.540
physical event with
digital content in New York

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.740
a few months ago with content
from some of our key partners

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.310
where, as you can
see in the picture,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.200
kids really enjoyed working
with the physical and digital,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.830
similar to what you
saw in the video.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.980
So we've talked about the
design and development part,

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.530
but from our
perspective, working

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.050
with a lot of people
in the audience

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.170
as well as from
the store itself,

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.290
we got some insights on that--
how do you build a great app,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.980
how do you market
it, monetize it?

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.750
And I wanted to share that with
you, including the experiences

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.260
from some of our developers.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.640
So some of this may
seem really obvious.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.926
Thank you.

00:06:47.926 --> 00:06:50.172
You're understanding
your audience.

00:06:50.172 --> 00:06:52.130
And in the kids space
it's a little bit tricky,

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.744
because you've
got two audiences.

00:06:53.744 --> 00:06:55.160
You've got the
parent, who's going

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.390
to be the purchaser
of the content,

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.830
and you've got the child,
who's going to be the consumer.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.420
And you really need to
please both in the case.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.280
Parents are looking
for educational value.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.900
They care about something
that stimulates their kid's

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.650
creativity and allows
them to explore,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.310
but kids are not looking
for boring, dry stuff that

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.140
is "educational."

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.700
They want to be engaged.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.250
So you really need to kind
of walk that fine line.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.620
Another thing that I
tell developers is,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.820
try not to be all
things to all people,

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.570
because it really
isn't possible.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.144
We know middle schoolers
are different from toddlers,

00:07:29.144 --> 00:07:30.560
but even there's
a difference been

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.730
like a five-year-old
and an eight-year-old,

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.930
or an eight-year-old
and an 11-year-old.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.260
So at Google our
research has shown--

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.670
think about the key audience
that you're going after

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.300
and really optimize
for that key audience

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.030
for their developmental levels,
for their language ability,

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.454
for their motor skills, and
really get it right for them.

00:07:50.454 --> 00:07:51.870
And that's why we
have age groups,

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.980
as you can see, in
the Family section

00:07:53.980 --> 00:08:01.410
where you can opt your app up
to two adjacent age groups.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.630
Also, involve kids in
your research early,

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:07.085
like even as the thinking
part of it, so to speak.

00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:09.460
Budge Studios, which is one
of our partners we work with,

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.890
has hundreds of kids
involved all the way early

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.790
on from testing.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.857
They do play testing, they do
focus groups, online surveys.

00:08:16.857 --> 00:08:18.440
And really when you
think of the apps,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.780
make sure the end of
it-- what comes out--

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.006
is something that the
audience cares about.

00:08:23.006 --> 00:08:24.630
And this is also
especially beneficial,

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.360
because these early
kids and parents who

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.090
are engaged with
your content and have

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.880
been with you from
the start are going

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.520
to be your most avid sort
of proponents and customers

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.870
and influences in the
space telling other kids

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.285
and parents about your content.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.590
And kids especially
are very visual,

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:50.580
and you want to really
capture their imagination

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.840
and hold their attention.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.190
And part of how you do that is
through large, colorful icons,

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.250
illustrations, characters,
screenshots, and videos

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.050
that are high quality.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.840
In a very informal survey
we've done with kids

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.032
and we asked, what's the
main thing that you look

00:09:09.032 --> 00:09:10.670
for when you choose an app?

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.003
And I was thinking it could
be a lot of different things

00:09:13.003 --> 00:09:16.580
with my adult hat on, and the
number one answer actually

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.520
came back as the icon.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.530
Kids choose an app
based on the icon.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.060
How many people are
surprised by that?

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.110
Maybe I was the only one.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.220
Because I thought,
oh, well, what

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.640
does it do and does it matter?

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.750
And I had my parent
hat on, I think.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.790
But anyway, so
make sure you think

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.723
about what works for them.

00:09:34.723 --> 00:09:37.300
And also especially think
about kids' vocabularies

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.370
and their finger
size-- so small words,

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.660
large fonts, lots of color.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.190
The Smart Study, which is
one of our partners in Japan,

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.100
actually says that
they use no text.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.790
They only use images
in their menus,

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.360
and they also have
large enough buttons

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.382
that kids who can't read or
have very little motor skills

00:09:57.382 --> 00:09:58.965
are still able to
engage and interact.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.537
So you need to make education
fun, otherwise it won't work.

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:06.120
Because remember the
parent also needs

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.120
to be convinced that this
is something that they

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.820
want to purchase for their kid.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.950
So it needs to be educational
kind of in an appealing way.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.900
And [? IntelligeOA ?], which
is one of our most successful

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.650
developers on the Play
platform for kids,

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.442
really thinks
about-- they're very

00:10:23.442 --> 00:10:26.940
ruthless about, is this thing
adding educational learning

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.260
value to what I'm doing?

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.120
So even if it's a really
cool 3D effect or something,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.927
if it's detracting from
your value and learning,

00:10:33.927 --> 00:10:35.010
they just don't put it in.

00:10:37.449 --> 00:10:38.990
Also, together with
that, though, you

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.710
want to make it simple.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.230
Simplicity, clarity are
really sort of paramount.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.010
So Avokiddo when they were
designing Thinkrolls 1 and 2

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:50.000
told us that they took out
all the complicated scenarios,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.890
and the complex UIs, and
the multi-screen levels,

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.030
and they just kept
it really simple.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.430
Because for kids to be engaged,
it has to come naturally.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.720
It can't be from kids
and parents poring

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.219
over manuals trying to
figure out, oh, my god,

00:11:03.219 --> 00:11:04.260
how does this thing work?

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.509
They're going to abandon it
before they figure it out.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.540
And then again, as you probably
heard in the earlier session

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.400
today, focus on quality.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.790
Quality really matters.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.810
Quality matters because
people pay for it.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.150
You can see the jump in
revenue just with the addition

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.370
of a single star.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.870
But in the kids space
it matters a lot.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.250
Because when you're
buying for someone else,

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.910
as a parent who is
buying for their kid,

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.170
they want any signal
that tells them

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.940
that your kid is
going to like this.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.430
And they use ratings as one of
those signals to say, oh, wow,

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.670
this is highly rated.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.499
I think chances are high
my kid will like it.

00:11:41.499 --> 00:11:43.040
So you want to make
sure that, again,

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.270
back to your loyal users,
your initial beta users, what

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.450
have you, make sure
people who love

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.545
your app or game go into the
store and give it a rating.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.400
So now we've talked about
designing a great app,

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.400
but now how do you monetize it?

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.690
And monetization, as I
think we're all aware,

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.580
is tricky in the kids
and family space.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.430
So these are some of
the models that we've

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:11.580
seen for kids apps--
subscriptions, ads,

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.846
in-app purchases, premium.

00:12:13.846 --> 00:12:14.720
I'll talk about them.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.400
They all have their
pros and cons,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.780
and I think that you'll
find something that suits

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.660
your content the best.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.740
So premium-- so what's
great about premium

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.780
is every time someone gets
something, you get money.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.390
They download it,
they pay for it,

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.910
and that's revenue in the bank.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.710
But it really works well if
you are a well-known brand,

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.280
if you spend the money to
establish yourself as a brand.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.220
In fact, Toca Boca
and Sago Sago actually

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.640
do really well in this.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.210
Because when something
new comes out,

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.730
the user knows the quality
of what they're going to get.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.982
Try before you buy works
in anything in life.

00:12:49.982 --> 00:12:51.440
That's why we have
return policies,

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.010
and you want to check it out
before we commit to it forever.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.920
Why should apps and
games be different?

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.610
But in the family space, this
matters a lot because back

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.190
to the question that I
was asking earlier-- when

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.110
you have someone buying
for someone else,

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.340
the stakes are higher.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.490
You want to give them
signals that they want it.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:16.750
So another piece of
research I was reading,

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:21.170
parents apparently were like,
I would spend $99 on something

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.820
that I know my kid will
love and use and engage

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.570
with for a long time,
but I don't want

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.520
to spend $0.99 on
something they'll just

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.210
get bored with in 10 minutes.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.120
So how do they know that their
kid is going to enjoy it?

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.470
So this is a model
that works really well,

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.190
because the parent
has a sense that, yes,

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.470
my child will like it.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.950
But then the pesky
part of this is,

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:47.867
I'm constantly
getting notifications

00:13:47.867 --> 00:13:49.700
to spend more and spend
more and spend more,

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.370
and then I need to purchase
this for the next level.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.080
StoryToys has actually
done a great job

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.330
in solving for this, where
they make the content free

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.960
initially, but then a
single in-app purchase

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.500
helps you get the
rest of the app.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.220
So they get the benefit
of the child trying it out

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.720
and the parent knowing
that their child is going

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.040
to enjoy the content, but
without then notifying

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.010
the parent again and again
on multiple pieces of content

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.390
they need to buy.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:20.620
Subscriptions is also becoming
very popular in the kids space.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.340
So actually I want
to do a quick survey.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.880
On the kids developers
in the audience, how many

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.000
have premium apps?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:28.500
OK.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.390
How many have in-app purchase?

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.920
How many have subscriptions?

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.670
How many have ads?

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.900
So subscriptions is
getting very popular.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.590
And of course, the
good news about this

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.600
is a lower cost of acquisition
for the user, which is great,

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.900
and then recurring revenue
stream for the developer,

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.360
because then they can continue
to invest in the product.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.080
But part of the
challenge here is

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.790
you need to have something new
in there, or something fresh,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.200
or some way that parents
are willing to continue

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.200
to pay on a recurring
basis, because they're

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.260
getting something.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.870
By the way, if you
do subscriptions,

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.190
just sort of as
an FYI, you don't

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.930
have to process
financial transactions.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.480
Google takes care
of the checkout,

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.690
just like we would in premium
or in in-app purchases.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.870
And while this is not
necessarily a business model

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.360
per se, I want to
touch on IP licensing.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.255
How many people here have
licensed IP from others?

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.760
And this is part of
why for that investment

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.600
we've actually made
character pages.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.350
So while this is really
great in the sense

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.062
that, yes, you get a
sort of target audience,

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:39.270
sort of preexisting audience,
in fact, for the brand.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:42.170
You've got marketing of the
brand already being done,

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.730
and it helps you
with the challenge

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.720
of use-acquisition discovery.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.070
But then you also have a
certain standard or quality

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.680
of the app that you
need to adhere to,

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.840
because fans of the
brand expect that,

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.140
or the brand owner is going
to have some control over what

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:56.720
you produce.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.800
And obviously,
also the economics

00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.920
are going to be different.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.336
So something to
think about if you

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:04.470
go into the licensing space.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.865
So we've talked about
designing the app,

00:16:06.865 --> 00:16:08.365
and now you're going
to monetize it.

00:16:08.365 --> 00:16:09.910
How do we get users to the app?

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.395
And how do they know
that they want it?

00:16:13.395 --> 00:16:14.770
So one of the key
things for this

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.170
is create a compelling
store listing,

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.635
and especially in
the kids space,

00:16:18.635 --> 00:16:21.010
I was talking about icons
being really important to them.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.210
So make sure that it's
something that's appealing.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.290
Make sure that if someone is
looking for someone like you,

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.900
they actually find you.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.000
So the title needs to be very
clear, because then you show up

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.240
and stand out in search results.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.430
In your store listing,
first, describe very clearly

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.240
what it does.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.280
And then you can add all
the accolades it's won,

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.910
but it should be very clear
about this is what I am

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.330
and this is what I'm not.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.160
And now that you have
people's attention,

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.590
have compelling
screenshots and videos,

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.950
because that's what's
going to then convert them

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.060
from getting to that page to
then downloading, installing

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.170
your content.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.140
How many people here have
tried our A/B tests and store

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.020
listings yet?

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:04.579
OK.

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:07.520
So it's something we
launched at Google I/O.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.577
And I think just
across the board,

00:17:10.577 --> 00:17:12.910
you've probably heard in the
earlier presentation, also,

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.800
people are seeing great
success with this.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.839
So what happens, for
those who don't know,

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.839
you can actually test
any part of your listing

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.940
through A/B tests and
see what works better,

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.634
if it's icon, or
different title,

00:17:24.634 --> 00:17:27.020
or different
graphics, et cetera.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.220
And BabyFirst actually has been
using this really aggressively

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.550
and found out that when
they changed their icon,

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.280
they actually got
10% more installs.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.570
So they changed it
permanently at once.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.990
So I would definitely recommend
using this for something that's

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.936
as important as an
icon in the kids space.

00:17:44.936 --> 00:17:46.560
And then developer
pages, another thing

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.200
we launched at I/O, and
this is a way for you guys

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.800
to build a brand for
yourself on Play.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.521
So how many people here
have developer pages?

00:17:55.521 --> 00:17:57.270
So for those who don't,
I would definitely

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.750
encourage you to look at this.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.380
Because you can have a banner,
an icon that represents

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.140
your brand, a featured app.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.190
And also importantly, when
you do marketing campaigns,

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.220
especially if they're
not about a specific app,

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.340
you can then direct people
to your developer page

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.336
instead of having to decide
which part of your content

00:18:14.336 --> 00:18:15.460
you want to direct them to.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.700
And then we've all heard the
saying it takes a village.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.660
It takes a village also
to get the best apps

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.220
and games to kids.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.964
So build the
community, get users

00:18:27.964 --> 00:18:29.380
who you know who
love your content

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.190
to leave reviews on there.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.412
Especially in the kids and
family space-- for those of us

00:18:35.412 --> 00:18:36.870
parents who have
probably also done

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.550
this-- where you hear from other
parents what they like and you

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.890
go check it out, or kids hear
from kids what they're playing.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.840
So this is a place
where parents want

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.340
to read what other
parents are doing

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.881
and use that as a way to find
something that their kid, who's

00:18:49.881 --> 00:18:51.340
similar, might like.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.890
And also respond to reviews--
if users have left reviews,

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.250
if they like something, if
they're giving you feedback,

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.610
respond to them and really
create that connection

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:00.560
to build your village.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.170
Now, how many people
have a channel on YouTube

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.380
for their apps and games?

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:09.940
OK, good.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:14.170
That's actually higher than when
I talked about this in the US.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.320
So kids are on
YouTube, we know that.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.880
I think there was an increase
of 200% in our family channels

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.840
just on YouTube.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.490
Kids are connecting
with other creators.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.160
Kids are putting
user-generated content.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.710
Kids are watching
gameplay from other kids.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:30.840
So you want to be there.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.370
You want to have
your own page where

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.450
you have game
trailers, or gameplay,

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.470
or you can even have
user-generated content,

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.390
or give out tips,
or inform people

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.970
about new products in there.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.430
And now we have something
that's cards-- when I say now,

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.639
I actually mean a few months.

00:19:49.639 --> 00:19:51.179
This has been out
for a little while.

00:19:51.179 --> 00:19:52.820
But it's an evolution
of annotations,

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.570
where within the
video itself you

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.540
can have a card directing
people anywhere,

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.611
including to your app.

00:19:58.611 --> 00:20:00.360
So if they're watching
a video for the app

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.592
and they must have it
then, literally with one

00:20:02.592 --> 00:20:04.300
click they just go
there and get the app.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.830
And then lastly, you need to
be where your audience is, so

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.980
promote on
family-friendly channels.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.700
So if it's a parent
blogger, or the moms groups,

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.790
or other communities, because
these influences and curators

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:19.710
are really important.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.780
They're going to help
you build that audience

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.250
and get in front of the
people that you need to reach.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.460
So do your best
to figure out who

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.080
these influences for
your particular regions

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.030
or your particular
content are and get

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.870
them to tell their
audiences about your app.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.500
We're actually also doing that
on Play in the Family section

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.410
with expert collections from
experts like Levar Burton

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.770
and other entities where
they are talking about apps

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:52.030
and games they like and
helping validate your content

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:52.725
to other users.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.530
How many people already are in
the Design for Families program

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.245
on Play?

00:21:01.245 --> 00:21:02.870
So given the number
of kids developers,

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.870
that's actually a
very low number.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:08.920
So if you guys are not, and
you are in the kids and family

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.920
space, I'd encourage you
to get more information

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.690
at
developer.android.com/families

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.640
on the program.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.040
But then also if you go
into the developer console,

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.450
and you literally under the
All Applications section

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.600
go into the Pricing and
Distribution section,

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.220
and just check a
box to say, I want

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.000
to be in Play for Families.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.527
And what that does is it
also puts your content

00:21:28.527 --> 00:21:30.610
in Play for Families, and
you get all the benefits

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.910
I was talking about earlier
regarding search, et cetera.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.940
And you also are wherever you
are in the regular Play store.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.580
So it's like double-dipping.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.464
You're not taking away from
one to be in the other.

00:21:42.464 --> 00:21:43.255
I can't believe it.

00:21:43.255 --> 00:21:44.338
I finished actually early.

00:21:44.338 --> 00:21:45.620
I never do that.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.670
