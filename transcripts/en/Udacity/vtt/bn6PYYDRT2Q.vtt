00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.940
Over the next two projects,

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.490
you're going to create a ruby simulation
game that we're calling Survivor.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.150
Where contestants compete in tribes
to be the last person standing.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.090
We'll dive more into the rules later.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.180
When you're done it will look
a little something like this.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.872
Look, I won.

00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:17.520
Because there's so much text going on

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.930
we're going to colorize the output
to make things a little bit clearer.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.990
Colorizing output is definitely
something that we could reuse in

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.780
a future project.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.400
So we're going to turn it into a gem.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.860
Yes, we know there's already
a colorized gem, but we don't care.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.730
This is a chance to learn.
