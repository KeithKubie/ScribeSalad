00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.000
Did you know that there was a country that would sterilize its own citizens if they scored low on an IQ test?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.300
What kind of monstrous nation would do—

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.140
Oh OK. It was the United states from the 1920s until the 1970s.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.440
Yikes.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.720
Well, at least nowadays people are not trying to use IQ to rationalize policies that harm people.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.960
OK they still are, and that's totally immoral,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.420
even if the IQ test is a completely comprehensive measurement of general intelligence,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.120
OK it's not.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.060
Alright.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.240
While there may be some value to IQ tests,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.440
they’ve also been used to falsely justify hurting people based on, well, racism and classism.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.000
Hey guys, I’m Sana, and this Sunday we’re talking about how the IQ score came to be

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.800
and how, while it can be useful in some ways, it’s been used in some pretty awful ways,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.420
including in so-called “race science,” which isn’t really a science.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.560
And if you think this is an interesting topic and want more, don’t forget to subscribe.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.360
So, the IQ—or Intelligence Quotient—was developed in the early 1900s,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.900
and since then, most folks see it as THE test to determine how smart a person is, or isn’t.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.080
And this was around the same time that Eugenics - aka controlling the population through selective breeding -

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.780
was gaining popularity as a means of “protecting” the future of the country against things like quote:

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.120
“indiscriminate immigration, criminal degenerates and race suicide.”

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.620
And the IQ test ended up playing a pretty big part in the Eugenics movement.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.500
In 1927, the Supreme Court ruled on a landmark case—Buck vs. Bell

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.220
—which legalized the forced sterilization of more than 60,000 Americans

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.940
for “reasons” like developmental disabilities and low IQ scores.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.960
And that practice continued through the mid 1970s, which wasn't that long ago.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.220
Like, when the Brady Bunch was on the air.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.240
Remember Marcia?

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.820
Now, IQ still matters today in the U.S.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.480
Scores are used to set kids on education tracks that define the trajectory of their entire future.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.640
And some police departments have a maximum IQ limit, because they say they don’t want police who will get bored and quit.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.720
Okay?

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.360
And one U.S. president even bragged about the IQ score that he thinks he probably has

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.640
despite the grammar-mistake-laden tweet he used to brag about it. But we won’t name names.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.660
So, what is an IQ exactly and how is it measured?

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.120
Neuroscientist Kevin Mitchell of Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, breaks that down for us:

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.740
IQ tests measure a range of different cognitive abilities or aptitudes

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:40.340
such as quantitative reasoning, verbal abilities, processing speed, memory, language and so on.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:48.440
And, really what they find is that people vary on each of those, uh, different sorts of cognitive areas.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.700
But underlying that, there's some general factor that contributes to all of those.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.680
And that's where the IQ score comes from.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.760
But here’s the thing: IQ tests don’t measure all types of intelligence.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.660
They don’t do a great job of accounting for cultural bias in the tests.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.860
They don’t take into account the highly variable environmental factors that impact IQ scores,

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.980
And on top of all that, people use IQ scores to waaay overgeneralize

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.420
about individuals’ and populations’ cognitive abilities.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.360
And that last point is by far the most nefarious one, and underlies some of the most detrimental public policies.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.860
And I’ll explain why, but first, let’s talk about how IQ tests don’t exactly measure how generally smart a person is.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.060
IQ scores are a proxy. They're an imperfect proxy for some sort of general intelligence.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.060
For example, social intelligence is not well-captured in IQ tests,

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.800
and that's something that is extremely sophisticated cognitive processing that we're doing

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.440
when we're interacting with people, trying to understand what they feel,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.840
what they think, what they know I think, and so on.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.900
IQ tests also don’t measure things like long-term memory, kinesthetic, or creative thinking,

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.840
all of which are important facets of general intelligence despite being ignored on IQ tests.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.560
In other words, IQ tests are only measuring a certain type of general intelligence

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.820
that is decontextualized from actual general intelligence.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.240
But even general intelligence isn’t necessarily the best indicator of what you’re capable of.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.860
Because you can totally kick ass in one area that happens to be measured by an IQ test

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.620
but your overall score would be lowered if you scored low in another area

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.960
meaning you could be a genius in one thing, but a generalized number is keeping you back.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.280
And then, there’s the question of the bias in IQ testing being baked in—consciously or not—

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.180
along with the values of the people who wrote the test.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.420
Not every culture has the same criteria for defining and measuring intelligence.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.820
For instance, some cultures place more value on practical or social thinking

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.000
rather than the abstract thinking that IQ tests focus on.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.040
Even our comfort levels with tests—especially written tests—is a product of cultural conditioning.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.100
So the IQ test is, to a certain extent, a cultural background test.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.800
And context matters outside of culture too - like environmental factors.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.440
Factors that can be as small as not getting enough sleep

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.320
and forgetting your morning coffee before taking the exam to, well, your socio-economic status

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.340
and even how industrialized your country is. We’ll get to that in a second.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.760
And that’s super important for the people in the back who still think race is genetically linked to intelligence.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.400
Cc: Charles Murray and Richard J. Hernstein who are the authors of the famous book “The Bell Curve”

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.340
that makes that ignorant—I mean, argument.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.520
It’s worth pointing out that Murray works for a libertarian think tank, the American Enterprise Institute,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.980
which—according to FAIR—is against multiculturalism, bilingual education, welfare and affirmative action.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.020
Murray also went on the Colbert Report where they had this exchange…

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.880
COLBERT: You took a little bit of heat because in in The Bell Curve, um,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000
you cited researchers and research that was funded by white supremacists and nazi groups.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.160
MURRAY: Oh come on.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.220
COLBERT: Uhh, no. Evident—I uh,

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.360
MURRAY: No no, I know what you’re referring to, Stephen.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.520
COLBERT: Yeah, you had 17 researchers you cited, contributors to the racist journal “Mankind Quarterly”

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.440
and 13 scholars cited were grant recipients from the Pioneer Fund,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.540
which was established and run by nazi sympathizers, eugenicists and white supremacists.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:16.060
MURRAY: Stephen, I can’t tell you how hard it is after 17 years to see this nonsense brought up again.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.300
COLBERT: Well, I think it’s refreshing that following this book,

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.220
you’re writing a book that contains no black people in it whatsoever.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.080
And it’s also received funding linked to the right-wing billionaire Koch brothers.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.080
And Murray’s work has been credited as foundational for the Welfare Reform Act of 1996,

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.260
that removed an economic safety net for millions of Americans til this day.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.520
And he’s the same guy who the Southern Poverty Law Center lists today as a White Nationalist

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.300
and who’s said that it’s genetics that cause poverty.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.880
Yeah, he actually did say that in The National Review

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.800
in 2000. Here’s the quote, scrolling over my face.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.140
Please read this.This guy helped take away welfare.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.880
You okay?

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.760
But Murray has the cause and effect reversed.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.880
Studies have found that exposure to poverty leads to a significant IQ drop.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.040
And so taking away welfare creates this vicious cycle:

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.000
People are pushed into poverty because of factors outside their control

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.180
like the legacy of institutional racism,

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.420
but then they’re kept there in part because poverty has an impact on their cognitive ability.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.640
The people who are pushed into poverty in the first place tend to be black and latino communities in this country because

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.840
again, institutional racism.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.100
And then people like Charles Murray blame genetics - aka racial differences - on low IQ

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.980
while ignoring the findings that IQ can be lowered by circumstances like poverty.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.060
The idea that we should expect there to be intelligence differences

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.480
between these large continental racial groupings, again, is really wild speculation.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.220
For that to happen, what you would have to have is very strong, consistent and sustained

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.360
directional selective pressure. And what that means is that groups in one area would,

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.240
because of their environment, have to have been exposed to strong selective pressure

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.900
to push intelligence one way or another.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.820
Meaning, environments across entire continents would have to be the same somehow

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:12.080
to make the continent’s entire population evolve different intelligences from the entire population

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.080
of other entire continents... which would also need to have a single environment.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.600
And maybe you’re thinking “skin color evolved differently on different continents, so why not intelligence?”

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.740
Well, because brains don’t work that way.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:29.380
Skin color is an interesting one because it has evolved multiple times from light skin to dark skin,

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:34.860
back to light skin, back to dark skin and so on, but it's a much, much simpler trait genetically speaking

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.480
than something like intelligence, which involves thousands and thousands of genetic variants.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:46.360
Basically brains can’t evolve as easily as changing a small handful of genes like with skin or hair color

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.660
because brains are made of so many genes.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.820
So, saying you think different races could have different innate intelligence levels

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.540
may be like saying you think different races have different amounts of fingers.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.260
And going back to environmental factors, even identical twins—who are genetic clones—

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:07.580
have shown up to a 29 point IQ gap when raised in different social classes with different education levels.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.840
The average IQ scores have risen over the past century or so

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.920
consistently in every country where IQ tests have been done, and actually at a more rapid rate

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:23.940
in developing countries than in developed ones - and that is attributable people think to increase nutrition,

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.600
to better healthcare, both maternal health care and infant health care, more education

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.560
and also probably to industrialization, urbanization.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.120
Mitchell uses the example of Ireland, Scotland and England

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.560
to show how much of a role environmental factors play in measuring IQ more than genetics.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.300
In the seventies and eighties, the average IQ scores in Ireland and Scotland were significantly lower

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:49.900
than in the neighboring country of England, and that has completely shifted over the years

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:55.080
as there's been increasing urbanization, increased move to cities, increased industrialization,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:03.400
change from agricultural practices so that the populace really has become more prone to these habits

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.620
of abstract thought. Education has increased and also nutrition and healthcare have increased,

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.600
and so the IQ scores now in Ireland and Scotland are on a par with those in England.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:19.500
And that really shows that cultural factors can have a huge impact on average IQ scores.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.900
The average IQ scores between Ireland and England were not due to genetic differences.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.580
They weren't an immutable biological fact.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.820
They were just due to cultural differences which have gone away over time.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.360
Another example are the average IQ scores among Kenyan children, which rose by over 26 points

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.560
between 1984 and 1998—and not because they evolved impossibly fast in half a generation:

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.800
It’s because there were massive improvements in health, nutrition, and parental literacy.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.000
IQ is in many cases more of a measure of socioeconomic class

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.580
than it is a measure of innate intelligence.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.480
IQ and wealth are correlated with each other.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:01.800
Now that may be because more intelligent people do better in the economy and therefore have higher wealth.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.540
But it's also probably true that people in a more wealthy areas,

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:12.160
more wealthy families, have more access to education, more habits of valuing education.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.240
That advantage may be amplified over time because of the experiences that they have.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:22.340
So you get a sort of, in that case, a vicious circle which amplifies an intelligence, but at the, you know,

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:27.140
on the flip side, in areas where education is not well-funded, then that can lead to a vicious circle

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.980
that just a cements, those sort of social inequalities.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.220
So, there you have it: The measurement of IQ is sometimes more useful as a tool

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:40.300
for some pretty heinous political goals than it is as a measurement of your actual intelligence

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.080
and mental ability.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.500
So, how do you like them apples?

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:48.340
So, one of the crazy things that I learned in the course of researching for this video

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:56.840
was that California led the way for eugenics—sterilized 20,000 people, leading the nation in eugenics.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.900
Let us know what you guys think in the comments, and don't forget to like, share and subscribe,

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.840
