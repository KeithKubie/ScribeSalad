00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.090
physicist said no the evidence is really
clear and Einstein said I was burned

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100
clear and Einstein said I was burned
 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.949
clear and Einstein said I was burned
once before with that lambda and the

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959
once before with that lambda and the
 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.630
once before with that lambda and the
expansion of the universe I'm not gonna

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640
expansion of the universe I'm not gonna
 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.940
expansion of the universe I'm not gonna
be burned again so he dug in he doubled

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950
be burned again so he dug in he doubled
 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.759
be burned again so he dug in he doubled
up and as time went on the evidence for

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769
up and as time went on the evidence for
 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.130
up and as time went on the evidence for
quantum mechanics for this randomness

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140
quantum mechanics for this randomness
 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.320
quantum mechanics for this randomness
and probability on the ultra-small that

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330
and probability on the ultra-small that
 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.880
and probability on the ultra-small that
evidence became stronger and stronger

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890
evidence became stronger and stronger
 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.150
evidence became stronger and stronger
but Einstein I'm saying was stuck he

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160
but Einstein I'm saying was stuck he
 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.310
but Einstein I'm saying was stuck he
couldn't let go he just thought if I

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320
couldn't let go he just thought if I
 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.620
couldn't let go he just thought if I
held my my confidence for ten years

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630
held my my confidence for ten years
 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.900
held my my confidence for ten years
before I would have been okay well maybe

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910
before I would have been okay well maybe
 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.190
before I would have been okay well maybe
it might be twenty years maybe it might

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200
it might be twenty years maybe it might
 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.500
it might be twenty years maybe it might
be beyond my lifetime but I'm sure

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510
be beyond my lifetime but I'm sure
 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.270
be beyond my lifetime but I'm sure
Einstein thought I'm sure that the

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280
Einstein thought I'm sure that the
 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.400
Einstein thought I'm sure that the
universe can't be disordered that's why

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410
universe can't be disordered that's why
 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.199
universe can't be disordered that's why
he said God does not play dice with the

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209
he said God does not play dice with the
 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.120
he said God does not play dice with the
universe and it's good friend nails Bohr

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130
universe and it's good friend nails Bohr
 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.130
universe and it's good friend nails Bohr
said Einstein stop telling God what to

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140
said Einstein stop telling God what to
 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.860
said Einstein stop telling God what to
do

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870
