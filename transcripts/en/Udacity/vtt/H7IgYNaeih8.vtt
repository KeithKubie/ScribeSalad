00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.630
It turns out that less than 2% of our genomes actually code for protein.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.430
&gt;&gt; 2%? That's nothing.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.050
&gt;&gt; I know it really does seem that way, but when you

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.280
remember our ABO mRNA example where you were in the parking lot?

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.050
&gt;&gt; Only 10% of the ABO gene actually has turned into any

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.570
kind of coding region that's turned into protein. Now at large in the

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.750
genome, there's a lot of other reasons why that number's so small,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.990
so let's go talk to somebody who knows a bit more about that.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.430
&gt;&gt; Okay.
