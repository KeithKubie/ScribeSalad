00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.250
Complete the table to show
equivalent measurements

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.510
in feet and inches.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.430
So they gave us the
measurements in feet,

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.790
and they want us to
figure out how many inches

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.330
this number of feet are.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.927
So we know that 1 foot is
equivalent to 12 inches,

00:00:13.927 --> 00:00:16.010
so we can fill out this
first one right over here.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.450
12 inches make up 1 foot.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.400
1 foot is 12 inches.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.890
Now, what about 2 feet?

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.890
Well, that's just going
to be 2 times 12 inches.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.800
12 inches per foot times
2 feet gives us 24 inches.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.130
Well, here I have 5 feet.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.590
I have 12 feet--
here I have 5 feet.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.350
I have 12 inches per foot,
so 5 times 12 is 60 inches.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.230
And then finally, 10 feet.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.965
10 feet times 12 inches per
foot gets us to 120 inches.
