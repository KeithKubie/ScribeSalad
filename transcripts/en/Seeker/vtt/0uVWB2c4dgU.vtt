00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.299
I'm not altruistic, but I am an animal.

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:09.769
Hey there selfless shellfish, Jules here for
DNews!

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.190
In 2012, researchers in Monterey Bay, California
observed a group of humpback whales protecting

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.332
the body of a gray whale from being eaten
by a group of killer whales for six and a

00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:20.440
half hours.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.570
That sounds pretty counterintuitive, since
the humpbacks seemingly got no benefits from

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.440
defending another species of animal, but risked
their own safety nonetheless.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.260
Isn’t that against evolution and “survival
of the fittest”?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.199
This altruistic behavior is puzzling, but
it is not unique.

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.989
A July 2016 study in Marine Mammal Science
notes at least 115 times that humpbacks have

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.219
attacked killer whales, sometimes allowing
the killer whale’s prey to escape.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.230
Humpback whales are not the only ones in the
animal kingdom to show altruism.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.889
And to be clear, this isn't philosophical.

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:54.940
Biologists have defined altruism in nature
as: any behavior that that improves another

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.639
animal's health and chances of reproduction,
at the expense of their own.

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:02.299
Dolphins have been noted to protect human
scuba divers from sharks, certain monkeys

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.280
will make noise to warn for predators, giving
away their own position, and bats have been

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.380
observed sharing food with members of their
group who don’t have any.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.880
According to age-old evolutionary theory,
anything that prevents a species from procreating

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.450
will likely be phased out in favor of attributes
that increase chances of procreation.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.359
And for a long time, scientists have pointed
to a sort of “selfish gene”, which is

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.579
not actually one specific gene, but rather,
the fact that animals that act selfishly,

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.509
at the expense of other members of their species,
will be more likely to procreate and pass

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.299
along whatever heredity made them more selfish.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.250
Selfishness begets selfishness!

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.140
In this light, altruism should be a recessive
trait, and logically would have been phased

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.960
out altogether in evolution, turning us all
into parking spot grabbing, line cutting,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.909
Halloween candy hoarding jerks.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.750
But clearly that’s not the case, at least
not in the animal kingdom.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.140
So, why do some animals show signs of altruism?

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.220
In the case of the humpback’s from the beginning
of this video, one hypothesis suggests they’re

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.370
actually responding to the killer whale's
predatory calls, on the off chance that it

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.789
is attacking another humpback.

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.850
Because if it was, altruism would be a useful
tool, since they would then be protecting

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.789
more of their clan, and increasing their mutual
chances of survival.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.430
Other forms of altruism, like, a monkey picking
bugs off another’s back, or bats feeding

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.540
those without food, are actually reciprocal
behaviors.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.420
So even though you might think, "wow that's
so nice!" in reality, a bug-picking-monkey

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.239
will likely get their own bugs picked off
by another monkey, and the same is true of

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.540
bats sharing food.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.760
In short, some expressions of altruism may
just be communally paying it forward so that

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.250
everybody stays healthy and fed, and is then
able to reproduce in a better environment.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.540
It's almost as if behaving altruistically,
is a bit selfish!

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.780
Studies have shown that more closely related
animals can be expected to behave more selflessly

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.340
with each other, which makes sense in the
context of promoting a species.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.209
Mothers must act selflessly to their children
to keep them alive, mates must try and protect

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.500
each other for procreation, and so on.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.549
Ultimately, while animals may seem to be acting
altruistically, they’re still really just

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.879
looking out for themselves and their species.

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.269

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.370
So animals help others to help themselves,
but what about animals that are actually hybrids

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.370
of two species?

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.360
We talk about why evolution makes hybrid animals,
right here.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.400
And what about you?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.849
Are you altruistic or just trying to help
yourself?
