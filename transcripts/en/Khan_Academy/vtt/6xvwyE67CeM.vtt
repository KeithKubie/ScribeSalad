00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.050
I've been asked implicitly
differentiate the equation

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:10.390
tangent of x over y is
equal to x plus y.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.150
And I've done several implicit
differentiation videos, but

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.440
this tends to be one of the
biggest sources of pain for

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.720
first year calculus students.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.040
So I thought I would give
at least another example.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.860
It never hurts to see
as many as possible.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.290
So let's do this one.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.680
So to implicitly differentiate
this, we just apply the

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.363
derivative with respect to x
operator to both sides

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:29.970
of the equation.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.290
The derivative with this
respect to x -- the derivative

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.420
of the left side with respect
to x is the same as the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.580
derivative of the right
side with respect to x.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.790
The right side's going to be
very straightforward, but

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.770
the left side is a
little bit tricky.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.380
So let's do that on
the side over here.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.020
Let me write the left hand side
a little bit differently.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.990
I'm going to do it in
a different color.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:00.410
Let me say that a is equal
to the tangent of b.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:09.380
And let me say that b
is equal to x over y.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.620
Then a is clearly
the same thing.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.860
I mean if I just substituted
b back in here, a, this

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.090
whole thing I could
re-write as just a.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.930
So if we're taking the
derivative of a with respect

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.740
to x, that's what we
want to do right here.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.570
Let me just take the derivative
of both sides of this.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:36.500
This would be the derivative of
a with respect to x is equal to

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.610
the derivative of x
with respect to x.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.210
Well that's pretty
straightforward, that's just 1.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.390
Plus the derivative of
y with respect to x.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.430
So let me write it like this.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.820
I'll write the derivative
operator, the derivative

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.770
oh y with respect to x.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.350
That's all we did.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.520
We just applied the derivative
operator to y, and we don't

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.650
know what this thing is,
we're going to solve for it.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.180
But obviously, I can't just
leave this here, the derivative

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.360
of a with respect to x.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.610
We just solved for a, and
a is just this thing

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.930
right here, right?

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.450
a is tangent of b, and
b is just y over x.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.730
The reason why I wrote it this
way is because I wanted to show

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.870
you that when you take the
derivative of this, it just

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.500
comes out of the chain rule.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.840
It's not some type of new
voodoo magic that you

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.090
haven't learned yet.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.200
So the derivative -- let
me just write down the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.990
chain rule right here.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.930
The derivative of a with
respect to x is equal to the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.280
derivative of a with respect
to b times the derivative

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.580
of b with respect to x.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.720
That's just the chain rule and
it's very easy to remember,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.040
because the db's cancel out and
you're just left with the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.800
derivative of a with respect to
x, if you just treated these

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.470
like regular fractions.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.275
So what's the derivative
of a with respect to b?

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.570
Well, that's just 1 over
cosine squared of b.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.570
And if you don't have that
memorized, it's actually not

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.400
too hard to prove to yourself
if you just write this as sine

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.670
of b over cosine of b, but this
tends to be one of the trig

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.130
derivatives that most
people memorize.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.230
I think I've already made a
video where I proved this.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.840
And some books still write this
as secant squared of b, but we

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.070
know that secant squared is the
same thing as 1 over

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.340
cosine squared.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.320
I like to keep it in kind of
the fundamental trig functions,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.360
or trig ratios as opposed to
things like secant

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.490
and cosecant.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.090
Then what's the derivative
of b with respect to x?

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.260
So this is pretty interesting.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.710
Let me re-write b, actually.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.730
Let me write b is equal to
x times y to the minus 1.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.520
So the derivative of b with
respect to x, we could do a

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.470
little bit of chain
rule right here.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.680
We could say -- let me write
this -- the derivative of b

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.530
with respect to x is equal to
the derivative of x times

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.790
y to the negative 1.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.300
So the derivative of x is 1.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.360
times y to the negative 1 plus
the derivative of y -- so

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.030
let me just write this.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.320
Plus the derivative with
respect to x of y to

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.930
the minus 1 times the
first term, times x.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.470
So this thing right here, and
clearly I haven't completely

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.190
simplified it yet.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.890
I still have to figure out
what this thing is here.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.010
But I just simply applied
the product rule here.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.990
Your derivative of the first
term, derivative of x is 1

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.380
times the second term plus
the derivative of the second

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.310
term times the first term.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.700
That's all I did there.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.170
So the derivative of b
with respect to x is just

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.560
this thing right there.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.290
So it equals -- let me do it in
the yellow -- so it's times --

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.520
oh, I'll do it in the blue
since I already wrote it.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.290
This is the blue, derivative of
b with respect to x is y to the

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.580
minus 1, or 1 over y plus the
derivative with respect to

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.590
x of 1 over y times x.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.180
So let me write that down here.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.330
So we just figured out, or
we're almost done figuring

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.400
out, what the derivative of a
with respect to x is, and we

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.450
could throw that in there.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.230
But we're not done.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.280
What's the derivative of 1
over y with respect to x?

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.990
Well, do the chain rule again.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.830
And I want to be very
clear with this.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.570
I know this might seem a little
bit cumbersome what I'm doing

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.020
here, but I think it might
make a little bit of sense.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.390
Let me just set c is
equal to 1 over y.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.550
So the derivative of c with
respect to x, just from the

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.580
chain rule, is equal to the
derivative of c with respect

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.090
to y times the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.140
What's the derivative of
c with respect to y?

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.930
Well this is the same thing
as -- I could re-write

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.350
this as y to the minus 1.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.160
So it's minus y to
the minus 2 power.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.910
That's what this thing is.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.740
This thing is that right there.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.220
And I don't know what the
derivative of y with

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.020
respect to x is.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.690
That's what we're
trying to solve for.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.390
So it's that times
the derivative of y

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.540
with respect to x.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.340
That just comes out
of the chain rule.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.400
So this thing right here, this
is the derivative of this thing

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.830
with respect to x, which is the
same thing as derivative

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.770
of c with respect to x.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.210
So I can write this little
piece right here, I can

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:25.240
re-write this little piece as
minus y to the minus 2 dy

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.910
dx, and then, of course,
that there is times x.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.910
And then we had the plus 1 over
y, and all of that was times

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.050
the 1 over cosine squared of b.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.660
So now we've simplified
this a good bit.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.840
I hope going into the chain
rule didn't confuse you,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.020
because I really want to hit
the point home that all of

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.320
these implicit differentiation
problems, these dy dx's just

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.570
don't, it's not some rule
that you should memorize.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.890
They come out naturally
from the chain rule.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.930
So we solved da dx,
that is equal to this

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.230
expression right here.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:07.130
Let me write it, it's equal to
1 over cosine squared of b.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.880
Well what's b?

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.640
I wrote it's cos x over y.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.920
Cosine squared of x over y
times all of this stuff over

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.840
here, times all of this mess.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.670
1 over y plus, or maybe I
should say minus, minus -- if I

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:32.486
just simplify this, this is x
over y squared times dy dx.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.000
Then that is equal to
the right hand side.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:48.490
It is equal to 1 plus dy dx.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.420
And now all we have to
do is solve for dy dx.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.990
So let me just review
how we got here.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.300
I went through the chain rule
at every step of the way, but

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.170
once you get the hang of it,
you can literally just go

00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:59.360
straight down this way.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.380
The way you think about
it is -- the right hand

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.033
side I think you get it.

00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:04.380
The derivative of x is 1, the
derivative of y with respect

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.560
to x, well that's just dy dx.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.010
But the left hand side, you
take the derivative of

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.630
the whole thing with
respect to x over y.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.100
So that's just the derivative
of tangent is 1 over

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.020
cosine squared.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.620
So it's 1 over cosine squared
of x over y, and you multiply

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.530
that times the derivative of
x over y with respect to x.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.770
And the derivative of x over
y with respect to x is the

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.970
derivative of-- and it gets
complicated, that's why it's

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.590
good to do it on the side here
-- but it's the derivative of

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.150
x, which is 1 times 1 over y.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:39.680
Which is that term plus the
derivative of 1 over Y with

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.200
respect to X, which is minus
1 over y squared dy dx, from

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.620
the chain rule, times dx.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.140
That's why it was good to do
over to the side so we don't

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.360
make a careless mistake.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.410
But once you get used to it you
could actually do that in your

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.980
head, and of course, that
equals the right hand side.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.520
So from here on out it's
just pure algebra.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.140
Just to solve for our dy dx.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.490
So a good place to start is to
multiply both sides of this

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.910
equation times cosine
squared of x over y.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.420
So obviously, that'll
turn to 1 on this side.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:14.970
And the left hand side will be
1 over y minus x over y squared

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:23.690
dy dx is equal to -- I have to
multiply both side of the

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.730
equation times this denominator
right here -- is equal to

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:32.530
cosine squared of x over y plus
cosine squared of

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.190
x over y dy dx.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.190
Now what can we do.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:44.210
We can subtract this cosine
squared of x over y from both

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:52.110
sides of the equation, and we
get 1 over y minus cosine

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.710
squared of x over y.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.780
All I did is I subtracted
this from both sides of the

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.590
equation, so essentially I
moved it over to the

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.040
left hand side.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.040
What I'm trying to do is I'm
going to try to separate the

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.810
non dy dx terms from
the dy dx terms.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.750
So I want to bring this
dy dx term over to

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:07.950
the right hand side.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.550
So let me add x over y
squared dy dx to both sides.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:17.260
So then that is equal to x over
y -- let me write that in the

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.070
color that I originally wrote
it in, a slightly

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:21.470
different color.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:27.110
So that is x over y squared --
I'll write the dy dx in orange.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:34.120
dy dx, and then you have this
term, plus cosine squared

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.880
of x over y dy dx.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.000
I think we're in
the home stretch.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.410
Let's factor this dy dx out
from the right hand side.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:56.770
So this is equal to dy dx
times x over y squared plus

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:01.220
cosine squared of x over y.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.180
And that is equal to this thing
over here, it's equal to

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:09.250
1 over y minus cosine
squared of x over y.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.240
Now to solve for dy dx, we just
have to divide both sides of

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.450
this equation by this
expression right here.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.900
And then what do we get?

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.970
We get, if we just divide both
sides by that, we get 1 over y

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:27.210
minus cosine squared of x over
y divided by this whole

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.720
business right there.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:36.190
x over y squared plus cosine
squared of x over y is

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:42.150
equal to our dy dx.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.370
And then we're done.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.460
We just applied the chain rule
multiple times and we were able

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.600
to implicitly differentiate
tangent of y over x is

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.600
equal to x plus y.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.980
The hard part really is getting
to this step right here.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.470
After this step it's literally
just pure algebra just to solve

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:04.730
for the dy dx's, and then you
get that answer right there.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.380
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
