00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.540
 What I would like to do in this episode is to achieve 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.540
 Conditions conducive to the continuation of the vector field 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.350
 Or integrated line with vector and 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.670
 Be independent of the path 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.420
 Let me assume I will take this line 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.780
 Integrated along the "C" path of point "P" "D" "T", 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.310
 Let's say the path looks like this 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.020
 Here are the cursed "X" and "Y" and say that the path seems to be 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.530
 So: Let's start from here and then end up 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.510
 Point "C" 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.050
 Endpoint, the curve here is "Si" 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.210
 So I will evaluate the integrated line, the field of this vector 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.640
 Along the track 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.420
 This is an independent vector 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.890
 Or we can call it a conservative vector area, if it is equal 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.370
 The same is integrated for another different track 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.240
 Which he shares with him at the same end point 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.250
 So let's call it "C1" and this is the "C2" 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.680
 The vector field is conservative if it starts 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.530
 From the same point but by taking a different path 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.050
 Suppose I go like this: if I took a different path 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.600
 But "C2" I get the same value 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.190
 Hence it is clear to me that all interested in the process of evaluation 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.980
 These integrations are the starting point and the end point 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.750
 What do we do? 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.410
 I also do not care how to start from the starting point 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.140
 To the end point 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.610
 Because these two integrals have the same starting point and end 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.320
 , So regardless of their actual course, they are 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.350
 They will be identical (same) 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.530
 This is precisely what P means as a conservative field 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.670
 What this integral means is that it is an independent track 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.080
 So before you prove the conditions, let's start building 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.560
 Tool kit slightly 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.750
 Let's say you saw or did not see 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.590
 Multi - Probability Value Series 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.850
 Which I did not prove in this episode, but 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.390
 I think it will be an incentive for you 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.000
 So I will not need to prove it to you, or I will 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.560
 In the end, but I want to inspire your conclusion 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.610
 All it says is that when I have certain jobs 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.860
 I have (for example) "P" from "X" and "Y", but "X" and "Y" are two functions 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.220
 The third, "v", so the "q" of the "x" of "v" and "y" of the "v", this is 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.720
 Derivative (branching) due to multiple differences 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.000
 I now have two variables in the "X" and "Y" 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.810
 This will be equal to the fraction of the "P" 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.350
 For "X" 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.130
 The speed range that does not change with the change and X times is derived from 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.120
 Regarding T - this is the only variable function 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.780
 Here, you can even take a regular derivative. 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.140
 Calculate the speed of the "X" change for "T" 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.680
 This is a standard derivative, this is a partial derivative, 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.290
 Because at that level we deal with two variables. 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.280
 We have not finished yet. - In addition to the speed of changes and in relation to 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.960
 B "Y" Calculate the variables "Y" for the "T" 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.110
 "DDT" 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.490
 I will not prove it, but I think it makes 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.730
 Good intuition. 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.950
 This is to say, whenever we move DT a bit, and what are 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.290
 The value of "A", "P" and "any" we get 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.200
 Or how fast is this change and regarding t? 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.400
 She says, well there are two ways and can change 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.670
 For "X" or for "Y"
