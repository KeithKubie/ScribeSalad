00:00:00.874 --> 00:00:03.095
Voiceover: In the last video,
we already got an overview

00:00:03.095 --> 00:00:05.842
that if you give me a stock price,

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:08.143
and an exercise price,

00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:11.603
and a risk-free interest rate,

00:00:11.603 --> 00:00:14.428
and a time to expiration

00:00:14.428 --> 00:00:19.025
and the volatility or
the standard deviation

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:21.021
of the log returns,

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:26.970
if you give me these six things,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:36.457
I can put these into the
Black-Scholes Formula,

00:00:36.457 --> 00:00:38.858
so Black-Scholes Formula,

00:00:38.858 --> 00:00:44.345
and I will output for
you the appropriate price

00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:48.370
for this European call option.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.607
So it sounds all very straightforward,

00:00:50.607 --> 00:00:52.205
and some of this is straightforward.

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:55.129
The stock price is easy to look up.

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.284
The exercise price,

00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:57.263
well, that's part of the contract.

00:00:57.263 --> 00:00:58.260
You know that.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.763
The risk-free interest rate,

00:00:59.763 --> 00:01:01.007
there are good proxies for it,

00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:02.639
money market funds,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.054
there's government debt, things like that,

00:01:06.054 --> 00:01:07.731
so that's pretty easy to figure out,

00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:09.527
or at least approximate.

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:11.601
The time to expiration,

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:12.339
well you know that,

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:13.670
you know what today's date is.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.205
You know when this
thing's going to expire,

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:17.211
so that's pretty straightforward.

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:19.735
Now let's think a little
bit about volatility,

00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:22.556
so how do you actually
measure the standard deviation

00:01:22.556 --> 00:01:23.858
of log returns.

00:01:23.858 --> 00:01:26.215
Now, one of the assumption
about Black-Scholes Formula

00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:27.459
is that this is a constant thing.

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:31.739
This is just some intrinsic
propety of this security.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:33.925
Well, the only way that
you can at least attempt

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:36.857
to estimate it is by
looking at the history

00:01:36.857 --> 00:01:39.741
of the standard deviation of log returns.

00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:41.636
The way that people
would normally do it is

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:44.208
they'll say, "Okay, what
has historically been

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:46.967
"the standard deviation of log
returns over some time period

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:49.801
"where that security has not
changed in some dramatic way?"

00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:51.730
And then use that as the input,

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.292
and then they would
come up with some price.

00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:57.142
Well, that's all interesting,
but it's very important to know

00:01:57.142 --> 00:01:58.797
that this is an estimate.

00:01:58.797 --> 00:02:00.135
This right over here is an estimate.

00:02:00.135 --> 00:02:03.325
There's no way of us actually
knowing the actual intrinsic

00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:05.489
and it's even up for
grabs whether there is,

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:07.256
whether you can even as assume

00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:09.863
that there's some constant
intrinsic property

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:12.334
as this volatility that's
going to be constant

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:13.793
over the life of this option.

00:02:13.793 --> 00:02:16.563
So this is just an estimate.
It's important to know that.

00:02:16.563 --> 00:02:19.989
But what is interesting is that
these things are being traded.

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.126
These call options are being
traded all of the time,

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:26.062
and so you could actually look
up the price of this call option.

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:29.323
You could look up a call
option with this stock price,

00:02:29.323 --> 00:02:30.397
this exercise price.

00:02:30.397 --> 00:02:31.948
You know what these two things are,

00:02:31.948 --> 00:02:35.700
and you could say, "Hey, look.
This traded for $3 just now."

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.985
So you actually can
figure out what this is,

00:02:38.985 --> 00:02:41.727
which raises a very, very
interesting question.

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:43.674
If you know exactly what this is

00:02:43.674 --> 00:02:46.945
because you know what the
market is pricing this at,

00:02:46.945 --> 00:02:47.947
so let me write this.

00:02:47.947 --> 00:02:51.700
You know what the market
believes this price should be,

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.017
so the market belief,

00:02:55.017 --> 00:02:57.217
and it's based on their
actual transcations,

00:02:57.217 --> 00:02:58.665
so it's based on transactions.

00:02:58.665 --> 00:03:01.665
This is what the market is
saying the correct price is.

00:03:01.665 --> 00:03:03.725
You can figure that out,
you can just look that up.

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.687
You can figure out all
of this other stuff.

00:03:05.687 --> 00:03:09.020
Can you then take this
output plus all of these

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.351
to work backwards through
Black-Scholes to figure out

00:03:12.351 --> 00:03:15.101
what the market is guessing about this,

00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:18.189
or what the market is
estimating about that.

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.724
The answer is yes.

00:03:20.724 --> 00:03:23.615
This is where this whole idea

00:03:23.615 --> 00:03:26.681
about when people talk
about what is the volatility

00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.487
in the market, or even where
are carton volatility rates,

00:03:29.487 --> 00:03:32.541
or even what does the market
expect volatility to be?

00:03:32.541 --> 00:03:35.771
How do we know what the market
expects volatility to be?

00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:39.294
Well, we can look at what
markets are trading options at.

00:03:39.294 --> 00:03:41.289
We could look at all of
this other information

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.263
that would be inputted into
Black-Scholes equation,

00:03:43.263 --> 00:03:44.877
and we can say, "Hey,
look. Based on the fact

00:03:44.877 --> 00:03:47.755
"that the market is
paying $5 for this option,

00:03:47.755 --> 00:03:49.132
"and all of these other variables,

00:03:49.147 --> 00:03:52.215
"they must assume that the
standard deviation of log returns

00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:54.539
"for this security is now this."

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.972
Now, let's say that
things get really scary.

00:03:56.972 --> 00:03:59.495
The market becomes a
lot dicier and choppier.

00:03:59.495 --> 00:04:01.676
Well then, people are gonna
pay more for this option.

00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:05.607
It's gonna drive the
implied volatility up.

00:04:05.607 --> 00:04:08.578
So when you hear people talk
about implied volatility,

00:04:08.578 --> 00:04:10.542
or implied vol, and there are even people

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:15.850
who will actually trade
on implied volatility,

00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:18.260
This is what they're talking about.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.003
They're saying, "Look. Options
are trading all the time."

00:04:21.003 --> 00:04:23.934
Can we use that price, the market belief

00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:25.996
of what those prices should be,

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:28.868
and then work backwards
through Black-Scholes

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:30.994
to figure out, because we
know these are all facts.

00:04:30.994 --> 00:04:32.748
We can look these things up,

00:04:32.748 --> 00:04:35.494
but based on what the market
is trading these options at,

00:04:35.494 --> 00:04:38.931
can we figure out what
the implied volatility,

00:04:38.931 --> 00:04:42.599
what the implied market
belief about volatility

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.001
for that security is,

00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:45.421
and then we can actually aggregate it

00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:46.861
across many, many securities,

00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:48.673
and come up with an implied volatility

00:04:48.673 --> 00:04:51.743
for given markets at a time.

00:04:51.743 --> 00:04:54.001
So it's a very, very,
very interesting idea,

00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:56.528
but in some levels, it's
kind of a basic one.

00:04:56.528 --> 00:04:59.420
You're just working backwards
through Black-Scholes.
