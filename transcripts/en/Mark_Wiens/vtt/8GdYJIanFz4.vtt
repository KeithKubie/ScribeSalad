00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.664
- You gotta just see a
close-up of this noodle

00:00:02.664 --> 00:00:04.939
and in that chili oil.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.189
Look at that beautifulness.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:15.859
(rhythmic music)

00:00:18.097 --> 00:00:19.581
Good morning, everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:23.398
with migrationology.com in New York City.

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:28.340
Ying and I are walking over to
the subway near Times Square.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.991
And today we're on our way to Queens,

00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:34.494
or more specifically, to Flushing, to eat.

00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:37.244
(rhythmic music)

00:00:50.228 --> 00:00:53.410
We actually just waited on
the wrong track for like

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.380
15 minutes until Ying figured it out,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.941
that we need to go downstairs
one more level to get

00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:00.645
to train number seven.

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:03.945
Definitely on the right
track now, train number seven

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:05.737
heading towards Queens.

00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:07.240
Oh, here it comes immediately.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.990
(rhythmic music)

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.803
To Flushing Main Street
Station, I think that took

00:01:20.803 --> 00:01:23.516
about an hour, although
we took the local train.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:26.259
I think it would've been
faster had we taken the

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:27.654
express train.

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:30.305
But the good news is, we are here.

00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:33.121
We are heading straight for
the Golden Shopping Mall.

00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:35.704
(lively music)

00:01:41.273 --> 00:01:45.440
Okay, I think this is it,
the entrance to Golden Mall.

00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:48.662
Oh, I'm loving this place.

00:01:51.252 --> 00:01:54.661
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:57.525
Made it to Flushing and then
made it down to the basement

00:01:57.525 --> 00:02:01.214
of the Golden Shopping
Mall, and this is an amazing

00:02:01.214 --> 00:02:02.047
food court.

00:02:02.047 --> 00:02:04.646
You can smell the spices as
soon as you step down here,

00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:06.662
particularly the cumin.

00:02:06.662 --> 00:02:11.325
And the first place I had to
come is Xi'an Famous Foods,

00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:15.133
and this is a very, very
well known restaurant

00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:18.453
within New York, and they also, this is,

00:02:18.453 --> 00:02:21.380
if I'm not mistaken, I think
this is the original branch,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.318
but then they have branches
in Manhattan, quite a few now,

00:02:25.318 --> 00:02:28.393
but I wanted to come to this branch here.

00:02:28.393 --> 00:02:31.608
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:02:31.608 --> 00:02:35.478
Okay, they do have a row of
seats and one long table,

00:02:35.478 --> 00:02:36.540
where you can sit down here.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.313
The menu is all on the wall.

00:02:38.313 --> 00:02:41.025
I ordered two things, I got
that spicy cumin lamb noodles,

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:42.940
which is one of their signature dishes,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.465
and then I also got a side of pickles.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.731
When I asked you all where
to eat in New York City,

00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:49.614
this was one of the top recommendations,

00:02:49.614 --> 00:02:51.995
so thank you all for your
recommendation as well.

00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:55.355
And now I have a plate of
the spicy cumin lamb noodles

00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:56.373
in front of me.

00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:59.593
The noodles are on the bottom
and they are flat and wide

00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:03.173
and handmade, and then you
can smell the cumin coming

00:03:03.173 --> 00:03:05.702
off of it, the chilis, the Sichuan pepper.

00:03:05.702 --> 00:03:08.079
I think there's some cabbage
in here, some onions,

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.946
some chilis, and then pieces of lamb.

00:03:10.946 --> 00:03:12.591
And I gotta begin with this.

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:14.091
Hohohohohoho, yes.

00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:16.254
The noodles are,

00:03:16.254 --> 00:03:20.543
oh, the noodles are in a
lumpy pile at the bottom.

00:03:20.543 --> 00:03:23.293
Very thik, very, very widely cut.

00:03:24.594 --> 00:03:28.761
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:03:33.205 --> 00:03:35.139
That is insanely good.

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.235
Oh, it's so flavorful.

00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:38.891
And you taste that cumin in there,

00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:40.266
and taste a little bit of chilis,

00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:42.575
but I also really like the green chilis

00:03:42.575 --> 00:03:44.856
that are chopped in there,
as well as the onion.

00:03:44.856 --> 00:03:48.428
And then the texture of that
noodle, the handmade noodle,

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:50.007
it's a little bit chewy.

00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:53.495
We can taste the, like, doughiness of it.

00:03:53.495 --> 00:03:57.340
And then just that oily
chili-filled, chili-infused

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.590
and cumin-infused gravy is just insane.

00:04:03.462 --> 00:04:04.619
Follow that with a pickle.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.785
And now the pickles are also
marinated in lots of chili oil

00:04:07.785 --> 00:04:11.565
and garlic and maybe some Sichuan pepper.

00:04:11.565 --> 00:04:13.185
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:14.018
Mmmm.

00:04:15.883 --> 00:04:17.599
That has a nice sourness to it,

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:21.208
a vinegary, but then
also with the chili oil.

00:04:21.208 --> 00:04:22.547
You can taste the garlic in there.

00:04:22.547 --> 00:04:24.941
The cucumbers are incredibly crisp,

00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:26.441
and juicy as well.

00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:30.092
You gotta just see a
close-up of this noodle

00:04:30.092 --> 00:04:32.351
and in that chili oil.

00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:34.601
Look at that beautifulness.

00:04:41.938 --> 00:04:43.718
It is unbelievably good.

00:04:43.718 --> 00:04:47.218
I'm gonna add on just a
little bit of black vinegar,

00:04:47.218 --> 00:04:49.727
give it a little bit of a sourness.

00:04:49.727 --> 00:04:50.905
Okay.

00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:53.326
This is just such an unbelievably
good plate of noodles,

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:56.976
the mixture, the combination,
the freshness of the noodles.

00:04:56.976 --> 00:05:00.865
And I love these tangly-like
sheets of noodles,

00:05:00.865 --> 00:05:03.947
the lamb, the fresh
chilis in there as well.

00:05:03.947 --> 00:05:07.282
It's just ridiculously
good, but that chili oil

00:05:07.282 --> 00:05:11.291
with the cumin is just what
wraps everything together,

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:15.773
what makes it complete,
what just holds this dish

00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:18.142
full of flavor together.

00:05:18.142 --> 00:05:22.309
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.668
I did not want that plate of food to end,

00:05:25.668 --> 00:05:27.938
but I have reached my last final bite.

00:05:27.938 --> 00:05:29.380
There's still a little bit of lamb.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.111
And there's also celery in
here, which I didn't realize

00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:31.944
at first.

00:05:36.382 --> 00:05:40.549
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:58.473
A couple of notes that I was
just reading on the wall.

00:05:58.473 --> 00:06:02.174
Number one is that there's a
big warning that the noodles

00:06:02.174 --> 00:06:06.833
taste the best within 15 minutes
of the assembling of them

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.292
or preparing of them.

00:06:08.292 --> 00:06:11.171
And so they recommend that
you eat right on the spot,

00:06:11.171 --> 00:06:13.868
and I would recommend that,
not only because the noodles

00:06:13.868 --> 00:06:17.335
will taste better, but because,
after you smell the aroma

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:20.419
of them, there's no way
that you can go longer than

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:22.928
a couple of minutes without
starting to eat them.

00:06:22.928 --> 00:06:24.993
And then I also love the sign
over there where it says,

00:06:24.993 --> 00:06:27.328
chili oil is your friend.

00:06:27.328 --> 00:06:29.569
And it really is your
friend, it's your best friend

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:30.499
when you are here.

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:35.363
But he, they say that he, the
chef, he perfected his recipe

00:06:35.363 --> 00:06:38.116
for the chili oil and he makes
it fresh every other day,

00:06:38.116 --> 00:06:41.764
and the oil contains no
trans fat and no cholesterol.

00:06:41.764 --> 00:06:45.864
So it is almost worth
drinking, you should actually

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.854
almost drink it, it's so
good and so flavorful.

00:06:48.854 --> 00:06:51.822
That was just an amazingly
good plate of noodles.

00:06:51.822 --> 00:06:55.239
I am feeling exuberantly happy right now.

00:06:56.254 --> 00:06:58.621
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:06:58.621 --> 00:07:01.070
Right next door to Xi'an Famous Foods

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.365
is Tianjin Dumpling House.

00:07:03.365 --> 00:07:06.062
And I actually, I was reading through the

00:07:06.062 --> 00:07:09.942
Serious Eats blog, and they
recommended this place.

00:07:09.942 --> 00:07:12.139
They have a full menu at the
top where you can mix and match

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:13.898
your different dumplings
and they will make it

00:07:13.898 --> 00:07:15.061
on the spot for you.

00:07:15.061 --> 00:07:17.375
So you can choose your own combination,

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:20.100
but I just decided to go for
one that they already have

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.669
made up, which is the pork dumpling

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:25.997
with chives, shrimp, and
egg, which sounds like a

00:07:25.997 --> 00:07:27.298
beautiful combination.

00:07:27.298 --> 00:07:29.331
So I just ordered one plate of that,

00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:32.729
and it should be hot
and fresh, coming soon.

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:35.437
That's one of the greatest
types of steam baths

00:07:35.437 --> 00:07:39.111
you could possibly have,
a dumpling steam bath.

00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:41.424
Okay, I'm gonna eat these
while they're hot and fresh.

00:07:41.424 --> 00:07:45.341
Chopsticks, and you gotta
add on that chili oil

00:07:46.213 --> 00:07:50.296
in this, what a beautiful
canister, tub of chili,

00:07:51.215 --> 00:07:52.548
dried chili oil,

00:07:53.811 --> 00:07:56.894
which I am going to generously apply.

00:07:57.817 --> 00:08:00.734
We just go with half of them first.

00:08:01.962 --> 00:08:02.795
Oh, yes.

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:04.732
Okay.

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:08.069
All right.

00:08:09.525 --> 00:08:11.488
I think it would be a
poor decision on my part

00:08:11.488 --> 00:08:14.829
to take the whole thing in one
bite, as it is flaming hot.

00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:18.996
So I should, I'm gonna just
bite it in half right now.

00:08:23.547 --> 00:08:25.574
Yeah, that is a good dumpling.

00:08:25.574 --> 00:08:28.137
The skin is gooey and doughy.

00:08:28.137 --> 00:08:32.304
Inside you got the minced
pork, the chives in there.

00:08:34.861 --> 00:08:37.444
And that dried chili oil, mmmm.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.331
You can taste the fragrance

00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:44.121
of the dried chilis, the
oil, the garlic in there.

00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:47.954
I think I might add a
little bit of soy sauce.

00:08:49.038 --> 00:08:51.038
A little bit of vinegar.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.057
Oh, that's a lot of vinegar.

00:08:54.057 --> 00:08:55.832
That's okay, too.

00:08:55.832 --> 00:08:57.612
And then some more chili oil.

00:08:57.612 --> 00:09:00.029
The chili oil is actually not very spicy,

00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:02.648
but it is extremely fragrant.

00:09:02.648 --> 00:09:06.815
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:09:13.084 --> 00:09:14.979
I think it cooled off enough,
I think I can take it all

00:09:14.979 --> 00:09:15.979
in one bite.

00:09:18.485 --> 00:09:20.402
Oh, that vinegar, mmmm.

00:09:21.357 --> 00:09:22.946
That is the touch it needs.

00:09:22.946 --> 00:09:26.110
This is an absolutely wonderful
little food court below here

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.865
in the Golden Shopping Mall.

00:09:28.865 --> 00:09:31.631
Incredibly good food, I
wanted to taste everything,

00:09:31.631 --> 00:09:33.998
but we have a few more places to try,

00:09:33.998 --> 00:09:35.823
so time to move on.

00:09:35.823 --> 00:09:37.872
Flushing is just amazing.

00:09:37.872 --> 00:09:41.329
So many markets and restaurants.

00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:43.599
It's hard to believe you're
still in New York City here.

00:09:43.599 --> 00:09:46.182
(lively music)

00:09:51.305 --> 00:09:55.138
Ying is gonna stop at
CoCo for her bubble tea.

00:09:56.825 --> 00:10:00.261
It's not my favorite thing,
but Ying really likes it,

00:10:00.261 --> 00:10:01.741
so that's our next stop.

00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:04.824
Bubble tea, medium, no sugar, please.

00:10:06.298 --> 00:10:07.131
(Mark speaks in a foreign language)

00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:09.798
(Ying exclaims)

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:15.344
Mmm, it is pretty refreshing on a hot day.

00:10:16.178 --> 00:10:18.394
We're walking up the road
now, on our way to a place

00:10:18.394 --> 00:10:22.555
called White Bear, and they
are also famous for dumplings.

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:26.138
Gotta have another
plate of dumplings next.

00:10:29.153 --> 00:10:31.896
And this place is well
known for their dumplings

00:10:31.896 --> 00:10:34.885
in chili sauce, and this
was a recommendation from

00:10:34.885 --> 00:10:39.305
foodiehub.tv and Joe
DiStefano, who is a blogger

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.527
from Queens.

00:10:40.527 --> 00:10:42.801
Thank you for the recommendation,
I just ordered my plate

00:10:42.801 --> 00:10:43.770
of dumplings.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:44.603
Thank you.

00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:50.308
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:10:53.207 --> 00:10:56.141
This is just a really, really
small little restaurant,

00:10:56.141 --> 00:10:59.251
and the kitchen is in the
back, there are two of them,

00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:02.505
and they work kinda
slowly, taking their time,

00:11:02.505 --> 00:11:05.351
but expertly preparing
the different dishes.

00:11:05.351 --> 00:11:08.174
They have, they do have a full
menu, but I just came here

00:11:08.174 --> 00:11:09.811
to have the plate of dumplings.

00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:12.012
And one thing I immediately
notice about this dumpling

00:11:12.012 --> 00:11:16.643
is that the flour in the
wrapper is very white in color,

00:11:16.643 --> 00:11:19.260
so they might be using a
mixture of different flours,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.517
I'm not sure exactly, but
it's very white in color,

00:11:21.517 --> 00:11:24.100
and they've dressed it with the chili oil,

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.018
as well as dried chili flakes.

00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:28.437
I think these are some kind of pickled,

00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:31.962
maybe pickled mustard greens,
and onions and green onions,

00:11:31.962 --> 00:11:35.212
and, yeah, what a, what a piece of art.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.044
I'm gonna go ahead and stab the one

00:11:38.044 --> 00:11:39.935
right in the middle there,
keep getting some of those

00:11:39.935 --> 00:11:42.768
preserved greens, and oil as well.

00:11:43.648 --> 00:11:47.815
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.931
They didn't look that
hot from the outside,

00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:57.258
'cause they're not steaming,

00:11:57.258 --> 00:12:00.684
but on the inside,
they're flaming dumplings.

00:12:00.684 --> 00:12:03.100
I think it's a combination
of minced port in the middle,

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.783
and then the wrapper is very kinda sticky,

00:12:06.783 --> 00:12:08.336
rather than doughy.

00:12:08.336 --> 00:12:10.048
It's more sticky and thinner.

00:12:10.048 --> 00:12:12.571
And then, despite all of that
chili, it's not really spicy,

00:12:12.571 --> 00:12:14.500
but it is very fragrant.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.745
And the other flavor
that really adds to this

00:12:16.745 --> 00:12:19.400
are the pickled mustard
greens, or the pickled greens.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.572
You can taste that kind of fermented,

00:12:21.572 --> 00:12:24.261
preserved pickle flavor to it.

00:12:24.261 --> 00:12:25.338
A little bit of vinegar.

00:12:25.338 --> 00:12:29.230
Let me add a little bit of,
I think this is the vinegar.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.063
It's that vinegar?

00:12:30.063 --> 00:12:30.896
- [Ying] I don't know.

00:12:30.896 --> 00:12:32.114
- It looks like fish sauce.

00:12:32.114 --> 00:12:36.160
Okay, I better start off
with a little bit first.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.077
And for this one, I will attempt to

00:12:40.778 --> 00:12:42.111
bite half of it.

00:12:43.379 --> 00:12:46.500
Oh ya, that is vinegar, I can smell it.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.241
Okay, come take a look inside.

00:12:48.241 --> 00:12:49.701
I think it's a combination of minced pork

00:12:49.701 --> 00:12:51.333
and maybe some chives in there.

00:12:51.333 --> 00:12:54.374
And then you can see the layers,
the wrapper is very thin,

00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:56.761
but it's wrapped a couple of
times so it has multiple layers

00:12:56.761 --> 00:12:57.678
of wrapper.

00:12:59.631 --> 00:13:01.381
Get some of that oil.

00:13:05.939 --> 00:13:09.485
This is a wonderful plate
of dumplings as well.

00:13:09.485 --> 00:13:12.342
Just finished with that plate
of White Bear dumplings.

00:13:12.342 --> 00:13:14.268
That was again a delicious
plate of dumplings,

00:13:14.268 --> 00:13:15.766
but it was totally different
from that other plate

00:13:15.766 --> 00:13:18.338
of dumplings that we had,
especially the wrapper.

00:13:18.338 --> 00:13:20.488
The wrapper was really different.

00:13:20.488 --> 00:13:22.820
I'm in a little bit of a
debate right now where to eat

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.035
our next meal.

00:13:24.035 --> 00:13:26.138
I think we're gonna sit
down at a restaurant.

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:28.406
And right behind me, that big yellow sign,

00:13:28.406 --> 00:13:30.297
that's a restaurant called Fu Run.

00:13:30.297 --> 00:13:34.464
They are well known for
serving lamb chops with cumin.

00:13:38.308 --> 00:13:40.437
Okay, I'm flipping though the menu here.

00:13:40.437 --> 00:13:44.052
Oh, here it is, the Muslim lamb chops.

00:13:44.052 --> 00:13:45.498
- But we don't have the salmon today,

00:13:45.498 --> 00:13:48.950
and the watercress, spinach,
baby cabbage, baby bok choy.

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.033
- Sauteed string beans.

00:13:50.033 --> 00:13:50.866
- Okay.

00:13:50.866 --> 00:13:51.699
- Yeah.

00:13:51.699 --> 00:13:53.461
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:13:53.461 --> 00:13:56.294
(water splatters)

00:14:00.181 --> 00:14:02.727
This restaurant serves food
from the northeastern part

00:14:02.727 --> 00:14:04.244
of China,

00:14:04.244 --> 00:14:08.105
kinda north of Beijing, which is near to,

00:14:08.105 --> 00:14:11.464
approaching Russia, and then
also part of inner Mongolia,

00:14:11.464 --> 00:14:14.497
so you have Mongolia to the west.

00:14:14.497 --> 00:14:17.800
And they serve a lot of lamb dishes,

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.614
and have a lot of chili-filled
dishes, it looks like,

00:14:20.614 --> 00:14:22.062
on the menu as well.

00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:25.498
But I came here mainly to
eat the lamb and cumin.

00:14:25.498 --> 00:14:28.208
We're starting off with a
bowl of hot and sour soup.

00:14:28.208 --> 00:14:32.744
Oh, I love that aroma, that
vinegary and spicy aroma.

00:14:32.744 --> 00:14:36.197
I think there's also some
bamboo shoots in here as well.

00:14:36.197 --> 00:14:38.513
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:14:38.513 --> 00:14:39.346
Mmmm.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.902
Yeah, that's very sour, vinegary.

00:14:43.902 --> 00:14:46.576
Mmmm, it's very soothing.

00:14:46.576 --> 00:14:49.289
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:50.122
And hot.

00:14:50.122 --> 00:14:50.955
- [Server] String beans.

00:14:50.955 --> 00:14:51.955
- Thank you.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.538
I want the rice, yes, thank you.

00:14:57.538 --> 00:15:01.062
Wow, look at the size of
that plate of green beans.

00:15:01.062 --> 00:15:03.229
Oh, that smells delicious.

00:15:04.932 --> 00:15:05.765
Thank you.

00:15:09.236 --> 00:15:10.862
Got two different dishes.

00:15:10.862 --> 00:15:14.744
One is fried string beans,
and then the main dish,

00:15:14.744 --> 00:15:18.436
the main event of this meal,
the reason I came here,

00:15:18.436 --> 00:15:22.733
is to eat the lamb, the Muslim
lamb, with cumin just piled

00:15:22.733 --> 00:15:23.609
on top of it.

00:15:23.609 --> 00:15:26.050
And as soon as he brought it
to the table, just the aroma

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.518
of the cumin filled the
table, maybe even the whole

00:15:28.518 --> 00:15:29.836
restaurant.

00:15:29.836 --> 00:15:31.746
Oh, that smells incredible.

00:15:31.746 --> 00:15:35.579
It's marinated in many
things and then deep fried,

00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:37.080
and you can see how crispy it looks.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.938
I think it's maybe even
coated in a little bit.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.177
Let me pull one of these guys out.

00:15:40.177 --> 00:15:43.054
And then you can actually just
see all of this cumin seed,

00:15:43.054 --> 00:15:44.463
the chilis.

00:15:44.463 --> 00:15:46.703
Wow, this smells unbelievable.

00:15:46.703 --> 00:15:48.612
Woho, look at that.

00:15:48.612 --> 00:15:50.025
Oh, yeah and you can
even see on the inside,

00:15:50.025 --> 00:15:53.143
it's like stuffed with
redness, and then deep fried

00:15:53.143 --> 00:15:56.342
all the way to its core,
with cumin just protruding

00:15:56.342 --> 00:15:57.836
through it.

00:15:57.836 --> 00:16:00.532
I think I'm just gonna
bite this like a drumstick.

00:16:00.532 --> 00:16:04.699
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:16:12.915 --> 00:16:15.628
All the cumin comes in nicely.

00:16:15.628 --> 00:16:19.249
I think there's a little bit
of Sichuan pepper in there,

00:16:19.249 --> 00:16:21.780
and then that lamb is so tender.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.302
Maybe that's a lot of garlic
as well, and dried chilis

00:16:24.302 --> 00:16:25.653
which are fried on top.

00:16:25.653 --> 00:16:28.096
But I really love that cumin.

00:16:28.096 --> 00:16:29.486
The cumin is so strong.

00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:31.370
And also I can see, I think
those are sesame seeds,

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.335
both white and black sesame seeds.

00:16:34.335 --> 00:16:38.169
But then you can see those
cumin seeds all over there

00:16:38.169 --> 00:16:41.139
that just shining beautifully.

00:16:41.139 --> 00:16:45.306
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:16:49.462 --> 00:16:51.478
Absolutely beautiful.

00:16:51.478 --> 00:16:53.522
And that was a fatty bite.

00:16:53.522 --> 00:16:56.855
It's so creamy, so lamby, and so cuminy.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.063
I'll try to take my last
piece off this bone.

00:17:01.063 --> 00:17:04.058
Oh, that just slides right out.

00:17:04.058 --> 00:17:05.914
(Mark laughs)

00:17:05.914 --> 00:17:09.164
That just slides right out like a sock.

00:17:11.915 --> 00:17:13.665
Mmmm, an edible sock.

00:17:16.378 --> 00:17:19.378
Wow, look at how clean that bone is.

00:17:20.664 --> 00:17:23.831
The next step, for those string beans.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:28.452
Mmmm.

00:17:29.853 --> 00:17:32.671
That's really good, too,
nice and salty and garlicky.

00:17:32.671 --> 00:17:34.825
And you can actually taste like,

00:17:34.825 --> 00:17:37.171
the skin of the green beans

00:17:37.171 --> 00:17:39.207
are blistered because
they've been fried on such

00:17:39.207 --> 00:17:40.056
a high heat.

00:17:40.056 --> 00:17:43.120
I was just eating my second piece of lamb,

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.180
but you have to get a
close-up look at this lamb.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.915
I took my first bite over here,

00:17:47.915 --> 00:17:50.471
but look at this lamb under here.

00:17:50.471 --> 00:17:54.915
It's so tender, it's so juicy,
it's so everything you want

00:17:54.915 --> 00:17:59.014
in lamb, and then more, with
all that cumin and chilis.

00:17:59.014 --> 00:18:01.483
I'm gonna break up that piece of lamb

00:18:01.483 --> 00:18:03.662
and I'm gonna dip it.

00:18:03.662 --> 00:18:06.515
Some of my crust, all that cumin fell off,

00:18:06.515 --> 00:18:07.925
so I'm gonna,

00:18:07.925 --> 00:18:08.758
oho, yes.

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:12.297
(people chatter in a foreign language)

00:18:12.297 --> 00:18:15.295
I finished with that plate of lamb,

00:18:15.295 --> 00:18:18.851
and this is another
case of the lamb sweats.

00:18:18.851 --> 00:18:21.485
I'm definitely feeling the lamb sweats.

00:18:21.485 --> 00:18:25.370
Flushing is a place that's
worth it to get a hotel room

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.423
and stay here just to eat.

00:18:27.423 --> 00:18:30.268
Oh, I would love to just go
to my hotel room right now

00:18:30.268 --> 00:18:33.024
and then come back out to eat again.

00:18:33.024 --> 00:18:34.619
Oh, that was good.

00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:36.286
Gonna go right here.

00:18:37.313 --> 00:18:39.987
But I think we are walking
back to the metro station,

00:18:39.987 --> 00:18:41.231
to the subway.

00:18:41.231 --> 00:18:43.778
Gonna head back to Manhattan.

00:18:43.778 --> 00:18:47.625
Flushing, you have been
insanely fantastic.

00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:49.845
There's so much good food here.

00:18:49.845 --> 00:18:52.595
(rhythmic music)

00:19:15.818 --> 00:19:19.815
(pedestrians chatter)

00:19:19.815 --> 00:19:22.086
- We're gonna walk all the
way through Times Square

00:19:22.086 --> 00:19:24.264
on our way to Central Park.

00:19:24.264 --> 00:19:27.895
I think today is a fantastic
day to do a little walking

00:19:27.895 --> 00:19:31.702
around Central Park
after all of that food.

00:19:31.702 --> 00:19:34.452
(rhythmic music)

00:19:43.986 --> 00:19:46.071
This is a monstrous park.

00:19:46.071 --> 00:19:48.423
We're just gonna kinda
take it easy, walk around

00:19:48.423 --> 00:19:51.017
and just enjoy the park for a while.

00:19:51.017 --> 00:19:53.767
(rhythmic music)

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:01.411
The weather is fantastic today.

00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:03.057
Enjoying the Central Park.

00:20:03.057 --> 00:20:05.296
Central Park is huge, I've
been looking at the map,

00:20:05.296 --> 00:20:08.711
and we've been walking around
for about 10 or 15 minutes,

00:20:08.711 --> 00:20:12.557
and we've barely even
covered maybe about 10%

00:20:12.557 --> 00:20:13.928
of the first part of Central Park.

00:20:13.928 --> 00:20:18.059
It goes way over that
way, but we are enjoying

00:20:18.059 --> 00:20:19.699
the relaxation right now.

00:20:19.699 --> 00:20:22.449
(rhythmic music)

00:20:29.818 --> 00:20:31.807
And just like the rest of
New York City, there's always

00:20:31.807 --> 00:20:35.441
so much going on and so much
happening in Central Park,

00:20:35.441 --> 00:20:38.803
people running around, people
playing musical instruments

00:20:38.803 --> 00:20:43.018
and singing, people dancing,
people laying in the grass.

00:20:43.018 --> 00:20:46.733
Some people walkin' around and
just talking to themselves.

00:20:46.733 --> 00:20:49.652
Everything going on in Central Park.

00:20:49.652 --> 00:20:52.402
(rhythmic music)

00:21:04.203 --> 00:21:08.460
I had a lot of meat today
already, that entire rack of lamb.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.822
So I thought for dinner, we're
actually very, right around

00:21:10.822 --> 00:21:13.372
the corner from our hotel
there is a place called

00:21:13.372 --> 00:21:14.205
Fresh&amp;Co.

00:21:16.035 --> 00:21:17.469
I think they serve salads.

00:21:17.469 --> 00:21:19.418
I've looked through the window
and I think you can choose

00:21:19.418 --> 00:21:21.227
your own salad and your mixture.

00:21:21.227 --> 00:21:24.188
That sounds like a
fantastic dinner tonight.

00:21:24.188 --> 00:21:25.344
I'm gonna go have a salad.

00:21:25.344 --> 00:21:27.383
It's not a fully vegetarian
restaurant, but they do have

00:21:27.383 --> 00:21:28.831
many vegetarian options.

00:21:28.831 --> 00:21:31.103
It's a little bit expensive,
but looks like really good,

00:21:31.103 --> 00:21:32.841
high-quality ingredients.

00:21:32.841 --> 00:21:35.061
I got this salad and I
got the gaucho salad.

00:21:35.061 --> 00:21:38.723
I didn't film inside 'cause
I wasn't so sure about their,

00:21:38.723 --> 00:21:40.544
if they would allow filming inside.

00:21:40.544 --> 00:21:42.903
But, anyway, I got this
salad, he mixed it up,

00:21:42.903 --> 00:21:46.542
and I'm gonna take it up to
the hotel room and eat it.

00:21:46.542 --> 00:21:49.947
(pedestrians chatter)

00:21:49.947 --> 00:21:50.780
All right.

00:21:52.369 --> 00:21:55.137
Oh, that just smells of freshness.

00:21:55.137 --> 00:21:57.714
Uh, there is kale in here, there's corn,

00:21:57.714 --> 00:21:59.947
there are kidney beans, cucumbers,

00:21:59.947 --> 00:22:04.010
avocado, and it's vegan so
there's no meat in here.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.502
And then he added crispy
onions, oh yeah, crispy onions,

00:22:06.502 --> 00:22:07.335
and lemon.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:11.207
I think that's what, I
think I got that correct.

00:22:11.207 --> 00:22:13.040
All right, salad time.

00:22:17.221 --> 00:22:18.054
(Mark munches)

00:22:18.054 --> 00:22:18.887
Mmmm.

00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:22.708
That's really good because
it's all coated in avocado,

00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:24.903
so it has that creamy factor to it.

00:22:24.903 --> 00:22:27.373
And then I think down below here

00:22:27.373 --> 00:22:31.524
are more, oh yeah, more
kidney beans and corn.

00:22:31.524 --> 00:22:32.357
(Mark munches)

00:22:32.357 --> 00:22:33.190
Mmm.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.773
(Mark munches)

00:22:38.694 --> 00:22:42.861
In the videos, I often
show a lot of meaty dishes,

00:22:43.709 --> 00:22:47.371
but I do really, really
love vegetables and,

00:22:47.371 --> 00:22:49.341
oftentimes, when I'm
not filming, I am eating

00:22:49.341 --> 00:22:52.214
a lot of salad, a lot
of vegetables, a lot of

00:22:52.214 --> 00:22:53.656
healthy food.

00:22:53.656 --> 00:22:55.742
But I do love meat as well.

00:22:55.742 --> 00:22:58.061
But vegetables are fantastic.

00:22:58.061 --> 00:22:59.303
Good salad.

00:22:59.303 --> 00:23:03.220
Expensive, an expensive
salad but a good salad.

00:23:04.499 --> 00:23:05.332
(Mark munches)

00:23:05.332 --> 00:23:08.218
And on that bite of kale,
I'm gonna end today's video.

00:23:08.218 --> 00:23:10.742
If you love to eat, and
especially if you love

00:23:10.742 --> 00:23:13.904
Chinese food, I think making
a trip out to Flushing

00:23:13.904 --> 00:23:16.626
when you come to New
York City is mandatory.

00:23:16.626 --> 00:23:21.187
Amazing food, great place, well
worth the trip to Flushing.

00:23:21.187 --> 00:23:23.975
