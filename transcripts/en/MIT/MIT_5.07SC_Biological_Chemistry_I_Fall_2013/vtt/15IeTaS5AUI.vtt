JOHN ESSIGMANN: There are
many different treatments

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.420
for diabetes.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.700
I'll just use myself
as a case study.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.410
One of the things
I did to myself

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.880
is I measure my blood sugar at
different times during the day,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.220
and my blood sugar
this morning was 116.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.240
And my blood sugar at about
five o'clock this afternoon

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.450
will probably be in
the high 80s or 90.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:31.380
My blood sugar after I have a
meal might go up to 160, 170,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.480
and it shouldn't go that high.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.580
And some mornings, like
a couple of days ago,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.410
my blood sugar was
146, which is too high.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.867
And that reflects two things,
what I ate the night before,

00:00:43.867 --> 00:00:45.450
but the second thing
is the one that's

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.700
my problem, which
is gluconeogenesis.

00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:54.980
Gluconeogenesis technically
means new synthesis of glucose

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.960
from non-carbohydrate
precursors.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.090
For example, I could take
the amino acid aspartate,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.000
and I could find a path by
which I could convert that

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.320
into glucose.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.900
I could take lactate, and I
could convert it into glucose.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.070
OK, so during the day, I use
my glucose, and I stay active,

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.510
and I walk around.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.960
I ride my bike and so on.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.620
So my glucose level, it's
pretty reasonable by the time

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.210
I go to bed.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.300
But then at night, when I
stop moving around a lot,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.900
this gluconeogenesis
process continues in me,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.770
and that's what causes
my blood sugar to go up.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.065
The medicine I take
is called Metformin.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:41.990
It has a number of
targets, but one of them

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:51.530
is one of the enzymes, called
PEPCK, Pyruvate Carboxykinase,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.640
that's in the
gluconeogenic pathway.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.060
Let me say a word about
gluconeogenesis, another word

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.950
actually.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.380
So we all have dinner, like say
six to nine o'clock at night.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.090
We go to bed, and there
are certain organs

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.870
in the body, the
brain, our red blood

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.590
cells, that require glucose.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.210
They can't work
with anything else.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.120
So gluconeogenesis, by
principally the liver,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.360
provides a constant
stream of glucose

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.990
to these organs that absolutely
require it, like our brain.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.800
Now, when we go to sleep at
night, as time gets longer

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.710
and longer and longer,
after the meal,

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.750
our glucose level, our
natural glucose level,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.480
is going to start to fall off.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.510
And the liver then
compensates by increasing

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.090
the amount of
gluconeogenesis in order

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.390
to keep our blood
glucose at about 100

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.770
while we're not eating.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.280
What I do, during the night,
is to take this drug that

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.610
will prevent the switch to
produce more and more sugar

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.100
by gluconeogenesis.
