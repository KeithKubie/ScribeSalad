00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.430
Okay let's take a look at the answers to

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.720
these questions. So for the first aid kit question,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.170
there are actually 2 bands named first aid kit

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.920
one of them being in Sweden and I forget actually

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.950
where the other one is from. What's the begin

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.270
area name for queen? This is actually a pretty easy

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.930
one. It is London. Okay? The Spanish alias for

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.320
Beatles. This happens to be Los Beatles. There's actually a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.640
BBC recording where they talk about the Spanish alias for the Beatles. It's an

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.009
interview with John, Paul, George and Ringo.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.220
Okay, enough Beatles nerdery. Alright, the Nirvana Disambiguation.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.670
So there are actually a few bands named Nirvana. The Kurt Cobain Nirvana is

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.640
disambiguated in music brains with the label,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.230
"90s US Grunge Band." Okay? And when was

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.857
One Direction formed? 2010.
