00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.800
Hello!

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.280
I’d like you to think about how I’m doing
this right now.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.060
Not why I’m doing it, because of course,
I’m doing it because I like music and I

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.190
like science and I like to do both those things
at the same time.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.260
But how can I play music? How can I be hearing
it right now?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.240
And how can I walk around and play my guitar
at the same time without falling on my face?

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.720
And what is even sound anyway?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.600
These are all good questions. Let’s start
with the last one, first.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.880
The basic answer to “What is sound?” goes
like this:

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.820
Sounds create vibrations in the air that beat
against the eardrum, which pushes a series

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.150
of tiny bones that move internal fluid against
a membrane that triggers tiny hair cells -- which

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.130
aren’t actually hairs -- that stimulate
neurons, which in turn send action potentials

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.220
to the brain, which interprets them as sound.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.690
But there’s a lot more to our ears than
allowing us to experience the pleasure of

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.410
birdsong, or the pain of grindcore.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.120
The ear’s often overlooked, but even more
vital role is maintaining your equilibrium,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.840
and without THAT, you wouldn’t be able to
dance or strut or even stand up.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.080
And you definitely could not do this!

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.740
At least not without throwing up.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.399
In order to really get to the nitty-gritty
of how your ears pick up sound, you’ve got

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.030
to understand how sound works.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.819
The key to sound transmission is vibration.
When I talk, my vocal folds vibrate. When

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:33.030
I slap this table top, or strum a guitar,
those vibrations cause air particles to vibrate

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.590
too, initiating sound waves that carry the
vibration through the air.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.430
So this, sounds different than this, because
different vibrating objects produce differently

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.640
shaped sound waves.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.060
A sound’s frequency is the number of waves
that pass a certain point at a given time.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.549
A high-pitched noise is the result of shorter
waves moving in and out more quickly, while

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.609
fewer, slower fluctuations result in a lower
pitch.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.119
How loud a sound registers depends on the
wave’s amplitude, or the difference between

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.499
the high and low pressures created in the
air by that sound wave.

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:05.599
Now, in order for you to pick up and identify
sounds from beeping to barking to Beyonce,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.920
sound waves have to reach the part of the
ear where those frequencies and air-pressure

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.880
fluctuations can register and be converted
into signals that the brain can understand.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.940
So once again, it all boils down to action
potentials.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.700
But, how does sound get in there?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.680
Your ear is divided into three major areas:
the external, middle, and inner ear. The external

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.260
and middle ear are only involved with hearing,
while the complex hidden inner is key to both

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.170
hearing and maintaining your equilibrium.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.600
So the pinna, or auricle, is the part that you can see,
and wiggle, and grab, or festoon with an earring.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.510
It’s made up of elastic cartilage covered
in skin, and its main function is to catch

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.200
sound waves, and pass them along deeper into
the ear.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.920
Once a sound is caught, it’s funneled down
into the external acoustic meatus, or auditory

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.989
canal, and toward your middle and inner ear.

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.590
Sound waves traveling down the auditory canal
eventually collide with the tympanic membrane,

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.790
which you probably know as the eardrum.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.349
This ultra-sensitive, translucent, and slightly
cone-shaped membrane of connective tissue

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.489
is the boundary between the external and middle
ear.

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.659
When the sweet sound waves of your favorite
jam collide with the eardrum, they push it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.360
back and forth, making it vibrate so it can pass those
vibrations along to the tiny bones in the middle ear.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.580
Now, the middle ear, also called the tympanic
cavity, is the relay station between the outer

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.519
and inner ear. Its main job is to amplify
those sound waves so that they’re stronger

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.239
when they enter the inner ear.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.279
And it’s gotta amplify them, because the
inner ear moves sound through a special fluid,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.920
not through air -- and if you’ve ever gone
swimming you know that moving through a liquid

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.140
can be a lot harder than moving through air.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.159
The tympanic cavity focuses the pressure of
sound waves so that they’re strong enough

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.969
to move the fluid in the inner ear.

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:46.590
And it does this using the auditory ossicles
-- a trio of the smallest, and most awesomely

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.950
named bones in the human body: the malleus,
incus, and stapes, commonly known as the hammer,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.689
anvil, and stirrup.

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.189
One end of the malleus connects to the inner
eardrum and moves back and forth when the

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.129
drum vibrates.

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.200
The other end is attached to the incus, which
is also connected to the stapes.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.609
Together they form a kind of chain that conducts
eardrum vibrations over to another membrane

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:12.109
-- the superior oval window -- where they
set that fluid in the inner ear into motion.

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:17.629
The inner ear is where things get a little complicated,
but interesting and also kind of mysterious.

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:21.469
With some of the most complicated anatomy
in your entire body, it’s no wonder it’s

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:22.979
known as the labyrinth.

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.299
This tiny, complex maze of structures is safely
buried deep inside your head, because it’s

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.460
got two really important jobs to do:

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.400
One, turn those physical vibrations into electrical
impulses the brain can identify as sounds.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.870
And two: help maintain your equilibrium so
you are continually aware of which way is

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.280
up and down, which seems like a simple thing,
but it is very important.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.699
To do this, the labyrinth actually needs two
layers -- the bony labyrinth, which is the

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.930
big fluid-filled system of wavy wormholes
-- and the membranous labyrinth, a continuous

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.020
series of sacs and ducts inside the bony labyrinth
that basically follows its shape.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.680
Now, the hearing function of the labyrinth
is housed in the easy-to-spot structure that’s

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.900
shaped like a snail’s shell, the cochlea.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.480
If you could unspool this little snail shell,
and cut it in a cross-section, you’d see

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.250
that the cochlea consists of three main chambers
that run all the way through it, separated

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.639
by sensitive membranes.

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.520
The most important one -- at least for our
purposes -- is the basilar membrane, a stiff

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.419
band of tissue that runs alongside that middle,
fluid-filled chamber.

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.669
It’s capable of reading every single sound within
the range of human hearing -- and communicating

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:34.080
it immediately to the nervous system, because
right smack on top of it is another long fixture

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.860
that’s riddled with special sensory cells
and nerve cells, called the organ of corti.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.110
So when your cute little ossicle bones start
sending pressure waves up the inner fluid,

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.630
they cause certain sections of basilar membrane
to vibrate back and forth.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.350
This membrane is covered in more than 
20,000 fibers, and they get longer the

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.800
farther down the membrane you go.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.800
Kind of like a harp with many, many strings,
the fibers near the base of the cochlea are

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.250
short and stiff, while those at the end are
longer and looser.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.160
And, just like harp strings, the fibers resonate
at different frequencies.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.660
More specifically, different parts of the
membrane vibrate, depending on the pitch of

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.789
the sound coming through. So the part of the
membrane with the short fibers vibrates in

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:13.690
response to high-frequency pressure.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.169
And the areas with the longer fibers resonate
with lower-frequency waves.

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.520
This means that, all of the sounds that you
hear -- and how you recognize them -- comes

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.419
down to precisely what little section of this
membrane is vibrating at any given time. If

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.000
it’s vibrating near the base, then you’re
hearing a high-frequency sound. If it’s

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.080
shakin’ at the end, it’s a low noise.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.940
But of course nothing’s getting heard until
something tells the brain what’s going on.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.889
And the transduction of sound begins when
part of the membrane moves, and the fibers

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.560
there tickle the neighboring organ of corti.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.910
This organ is riddled with so-called hair
cells, each of which has a tiny hair-like

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.810
structure sticking out of it. And when one
is triggered, it opens up mechanically gated

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.590
sodium channels. That influx of sodium then
generates graded potentials, which might lead

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.210
to action potentials, and now your nervous
system knows what’s going on.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.099
Those electrical impulses travel from the
organ of corti along the cochlear nerve and

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:04.229
up the auditory pathway to the cerebral cortex.

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:08.400
But the information that the brain gets is
more than just, like, “hey listen up.”

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.729
The brain can detect the pitch of a sound
based solely on the location of the hair cells

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:13.759
that are being triggered.

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:17.780
And louder sounds move the hair cells more,
which generates bigger graded potentials,

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.250
which in turn generate more frequent action
potentials.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:25.139
So the cerebral cortex interprets all those
signals, and also plugs them into stored memories

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:30.050
and experiences, so it can finally say oh,
that’s a chickadee, or a knock at the door,

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.620
or the slow burn of an 80s saxophone solo,
or whatever.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.940
So that’s how you hear.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.129
But we’re not done with you yet -- we gotta
talk about equilibrium. The way we maintain

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:43.580
our balance works in a similar way to the
way we hear, but instead of using the cochlea,

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.909
it uses another squiggly structure in the
labyrinth that looks like it’s straight

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:51.610
out of an Alien movie -- a series of sacs
and canals called the vestibular apparatus.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.439
This set-up also uses a combination of fluid
and sensory hair cells. But this time, the

00:07:56.439 --> 00:08:00.490
fluid is controlled not by sound waves but
by the movement of your head.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.830
The most ingenious parts of this structure
are three semicircular canals, which all sit

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.319
in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes.

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:11.030
Based on the movement of fluid inside of them,
each canal can detect a different type of

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.470
head rotation, like side-to-side, and up-and-down,
and tilting, respectively.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.230
And every one of the canals widens at its
base into sac-like structures, called the

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:24.000
utricle and saccule, which are full of hair
cells that sense the motion of the fluid.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.520
So by reading the fluid’s movement in each
of the canals, these cells can give the brain

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.760
information about the acceleration of the
head.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.300
So if I move my head like this, because I’m,
like, super into my jam, that fluid moves

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:38.349
and stimulates hair cells that read up and
down head movement, which then send action

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:42.669
potentials along the acoustic nerve to my brain, where
it processes the fact that I’m bobbing my head.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:46.529
And, just as your brain interprets the pitch
and volume of a sound by both where particular

00:08:46.529 --> 00:08:50.629
hair cells are firing in the cochlea and how
frequent those action potentials are coming

00:08:50.629 --> 00:08:55.000
in, so too does it use the location of hair
cells in the vestibular apparatus to detect

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.079
which direction my head is moving through
space, and the frequency of those action potentials

00:08:59.079 --> 00:09:01.559
to detect how quickly my head is accelerating.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.400
But things can get messy.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.930
Doing stuff like spinning on a chair, or sitting
on a rocky boat, can make you sick because

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.810
it creates a sensory conflict. In the case
of me spinning around on my chair, the hair

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:16.130
cells in my vestibular apparatus are firing
because of all that inner-ear fluid sloshing

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.790
around — but the sensory receptors in my
spine and joints tell my brain that I’m

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.820
sitting still. On a rocking boat, my vestibular
senses say I’m moving up and down, but if

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.381
I’m looking at the deck, my eyes are
telling my brain that I’m sitting still.

00:09:27.381 --> 00:09:31.401
The disconnect between these two types of movement,
by the way, is why we get motion sickness.

00:09:31.401 --> 00:09:36.160
It doesn’t take long for my brain to get confused,
and then mad enough at me to make me barf.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.760
Aaand I’m sorry that we’re ending with
barf.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:44.050
But, we are. Today your ears heard me tell
you how your cochlea, basilar membrane, and

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:49.470
hair cells register and transduct sound into
action potentials. You also learned how different

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.040
parts of your vestibular apparatus respond
to specific motions, and how that helps us

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.580
keep our equilibrium.
