00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
All right, all right, all right.
Okay, so I guess

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.463
it just goes to show that

00:00:04.463 --> 00:00:06.924
sometimes the early bird
not only gets the worm,

00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:08.550
it also gets a jet ski.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.010
See you next time on
Every Damn Day.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.428
Cut. Fine work everyone.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.055
Brian, your body
wears clothes wrong.

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:16.099
Remember, every one's scripts
are due by 2 PM today.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.976
No.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:20.479
Get it done everyone!
No distractions.

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:21.813
Don't you guys like working?

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:23.523
No.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.407
I think I'm doubled parked.
Ooh! New chair.

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:39.831
Finally. Our old chairs
were bullshit.

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.625
Our old chairs
are perfectly fine.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:42.876
Let's not get distracted.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.127
It's so sturdy.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:45.462
It's so smooth.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:48.090
And it swizzles like
a goddamn champ.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.259
Oh my God. What? Okay.

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:52.928
We've been talking and I think
it likes me.

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:55.180
Permission to marry the chair.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.555
No.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.765
Come on.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:58.725
If anybody should get to marry
the chair it should be me.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.978
I too am sturdy and reliable.

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:03.355
I have a family,
one girlfriend, one dog.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:05.023
It's just a chair.
It doesn't have feelings.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.275
Thank you Hannah.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:09.653
That being said, either I get
the chair or I give it a UTI.

00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:11.947
No, don't rub your gross parts
on the chair.

00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:13.657
Screw it, I'm taking the chair.

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:21.498
Did someone shit in this chair?
Who shit in this chair?

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:22.165
- Me.
- Me.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:23.375
Me.

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:25.460
All of you shit in this chair?
When?

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.712
- Earlier in the sketch.
- Just now.

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:29.047
I'm literally always shitting.
I can't stop eating lactose.

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:31.800
How did this escalate
to shitting so quickly?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.636
And why do y'all still want a
chair that everyone has shat in?

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.805
Not everyone. I didn't shit in
this chair.

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:38.223
But I'm going to shit
in this chair.

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:40.142
I'm going to shit
all over your shit.

00:01:40.142 --> 00:01:43.145
And I'm going kiss on Jordan's
shit by shitting on Jordan.

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:44.438
I'm going to shit on you.

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:45.647
Yeah.

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:47.899
Enough.
All of you want the chair?

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.610
Then all of you get the chair.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.864
I'm going to cut the chair
up into five little pieces.

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:55.449
Every piece
will have shit on it.

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:56.700
Is that what you want?

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.909
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.161
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:00.871
So be it.

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:09.379
I think they delivered my chair
to your office by mistake.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.630
Oh, there it is.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.425
I see you guys started
shitting on the chair before me.

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:15.135
Well, I'll have to catch up.
