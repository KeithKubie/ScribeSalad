[Captions by Y Translator]
We've got a really cool project
coming up for you today.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.800
Today's video is
sponsored by Casper.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.200
They make fantastic mattresses,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.600
and I thought if we're going
to have a great mattress,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.400
we should have something
great to put it on.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.000
So today we are building
the world's coolest bed frame.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.922
This is not your
ordinary bed frame.

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:13.400
Trust me.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.300
It's going to be amazing.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.460
[Music]

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.700
We've got all our supplies.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.400
You've got a bunch of tools.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.312
So it's time to get started,

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.700
and the first thing I
actually did was to draw

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.600
the whole frame on SketchUp.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.300
This is something I'm going
to use as a reference

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.662
to make sure I'm getting all
the right number of pieces,

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:30.500
and the right sizes,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.300
and the right shapes,
and all of that good stuff.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.900
But for now,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.380
I think what we need to do is
take some of these 4x4,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.800
and cut them down to size.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.120
[Music]

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.860
At Home Depot,

00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:47.100
I requested that they cut
these boards to 23 inches,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.400
and they were pretty close.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.500
I got 1/8 of an inch
under 23 inches.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.900
That's why I measure to make sure

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.322
so I don't end up
with these posts being too long.

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:58.600
So now, we're going to measure
just under 23 inch segments,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.892
and cut those off
of our 4x4 beams.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.640
[Music]

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.860
Beautiful.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.020
Perfect fit.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:40.340
[Music]

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.460
Now, you can see the very
beginning of what we're going for.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.900
The box is definitely
not finished.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.600
But this will be one
of the front pieces,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.000
that will be near the back.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.240
There's actually going to be
an extension beyond this.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.200
But this is the size

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.000
of the storage
that we're going to have inside.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.700
Next, I'm also going to cut
a piece that goes right along

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.225
in between these two 4x4 posts,

00:01:58.505 --> 00:01:59.600
that will divide it
right in the middle,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.900
and offer support
down the middle of the bed.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.772
You've seen that I used a lot
of screws to attach the 4x4

00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:08.800
to these boards here
these ones do not have that,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.800
and although there
will be a 4x4 beam

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.200
about in the middle on this,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.300
what I'm going to do

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.900
to attach it to these is
drill holes all the way through,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.300
and use some carriage bolts,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.500
and that will give a really
strong connection to the post,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.300
which will make it
so there's no play,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.000
there's no wobble,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.100
but it also makes it

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.800
so I can easily take it apart
when I need to move this.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.600
This piece here can fit through
pretty much any door frame,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.200
and through any hallway
that I need.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.100
The whole bed
in its entirety can't,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.200
but it should easily
dismantled down into pieces,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.022
that I can carry or move.

00:02:39.212 --> 00:02:40.400
After discussing it
with a friend of mine

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.100
who's an electrician,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.440
I started working on the
electrical portions of the bed.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.700
This thing is going
to have lights,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.032
electricity, speakers,
the whole works.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:55.420
[Music]

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.620
Two hours later.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:22.220
[Music]

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.760
The main frame of the bed
is now assembled.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.940
We've got all of the stuff
to install into the headboard,

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.100
but I think at this point,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.800
I'm going to throw
the mattress on,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.562
but it's time for the unveil.

00:03:33.492 --> 00:03:35.600
I have been using it Casper
mattress for several months now,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.200
and I love it.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.500
It's got like layers,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.400
of different densities
of foam to give,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.600
like just the right balance
between bouncy and soft.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.300
So there's like
no pressure points and stuff.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.100
It is a super great mattress.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.300
I definitely love it.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.800
Guys, if you're doing
what you're supposed to,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.700
you should be spending 1/3
of your life asleep in bed,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.580
getting 8 hours of sleep.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.600
So you want to make sure

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.200
that you spend that time well
and be comfortable.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.400
I also really appreciate

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.200
how convenient they
make it to order.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.700
It comes delivered straight
to your door in a box

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.800
that's surprisingly small.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.500
You're not really sure

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.640
how they squished it
mattress down like that,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.300
and you get a 100 night
sleep on it trial.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.200
So you actually get
to you it for like 3 months.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.000
If after your 100-day trial
you decide it's not for you,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.192
they have hassle-free returns,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.300
shipping to you

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.900
and returning it is free,
if you're in the US and Canada.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.200
If you want to get your own very
cool, super comfortable mattress,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.800
head over to
Casper.com/TheKingofRandom,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.400
and use promo code,
thekingofrandom to get 50 bucks,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.902
off of selected mattresses.

00:04:32.912 --> 00:04:34.700
Guys, the bed is done.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.700
This has been a crazy big,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.000
very fancy,
very complicated build.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.800
But I am very excited
to have it all finished,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.720
and to show you what it can do.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.600
First off,
its a king-size mattress,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.400
and you can see
that there's space on it.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.700
In fact, if you look
underneath the bed cover,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.900
there's actually just
a little bit of extra space

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.900
going all the way around,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.240
and that was intentional.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.600
I am quite tall.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.400
I can quite easily
get into this bed

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.500
without any effort,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.472
but a shorter person may want
something to put a knee on

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.920
as they climb up into the bed
or something like that.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.400
So there is just a little bit

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.900
of a border going all the way,
around on the end here

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.940
that also works to help
lift up and down.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.600
Now, the whole point
of this box shape,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.600
and everything, was

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.000
that there's storage
underneath it.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.362
And we have a 6 foot wide,
6 foot long,

00:05:17.362 --> 00:05:20.800
2 foot tall storage room
underneath this bed.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.700
Because it does have
the two gas struts installed,

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.000
it lifts up pretty easily even
with the mattress on top of it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.340
You can see I've got a lot
of space down there.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.160
You can throw whatever you want.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.000
It's going to be well
protected, well secured,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.700
and you're not going to have
to worry about whether

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.800
this platform is going
to collapse onto it or anything,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.442
because it is super sturdy.

00:05:39.692 --> 00:05:41.900
Overall, this thing is strong,

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.600
and has just a lot
of space underneath it.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.200
I've got some lights,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.000
just in case you need
more visibility down in there.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.200
There's actually not a lot
of need for it.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.900
You can see on this side.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.100
You can look all the way
into the back of it,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.862
and you have pretty
good lighting but just in case.

00:05:57.342 --> 00:05:57.900
You can see I've got

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.400
LED strip lighting going
all the way around.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.532
Let's take a closer look at
how that's being installed.

00:06:01.912 --> 00:06:03.200
Plugged into a power strip

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.192
that I will show
you in a minute.

00:06:04.192 --> 00:06:06.300
It's just an LED control box,

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.720
that's got some wires
that come over to here.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.100
This right here is the IR
receiver for the remote control.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.400
This was just a role

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.600
of strip lighting
that I bought online.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.700
It didn't come
in these plastic sheets.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.780
So I actually bought
the track as well.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.700
So I installed the track,

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.600
and then I installed
the lighting inside that.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.100
I had to solder in a little bit
of wire as a joint,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.500
so it would be able
to go around the hinge

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.600
when I open the bed,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.400
and then of course,

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.900
goes back into
more track lighting.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.920
So this goes all the way
around to the other side.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.400
Let's take a look at it
with the lights off,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.382
because it looks pretty cool.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.612
Beautiful under lighting.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.300
It's very fun.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.100
All sorts of colors.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.600
It comes pre-programmed

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.600
in the remote with a whole bunch
of different colors.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.700
I actually often like to use red
before I'm going to sleep.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.812
It makes it easier
for you to fall asleep,

00:06:51.192 --> 00:06:54.200
blue lighting is going to keep
you awake a little bit more.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.900
But if you're not trying
to go to sleep,

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.512
then it has just so many colors.

00:06:59.132 --> 00:07:00.500
Party room!
What!

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.200
While I've got the lights off,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.072
I can show you
another handy little thing.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.680
It's got these two gooseneck
lamps that I can turn on.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.700
These are just nice
little reading lights.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.900
You can control it
from one side.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.240
If you find
that it's too bright,

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.000
they're actually
dimmable as well.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.400
So if I just hold
my finger on it,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.300
it can get brighter.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.800
Tap it again and hold,
and it gets dimmer.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.900
Both sides of the bed have
an outlet with two plugs

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.120
and 2 USB ports.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.100
It's very convenient for
anything you may want to charge

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.400
or leave plugged in on your bed.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.400
We've also gone ahead,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.500
and included some cup
holders on each side.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.800
Sometimes, you just get thirsty.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.900
It holds it really nicely,

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.000
and the cup holders
are collapsible.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.900
So if you've got nothing

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.700
in there, you don't have
to worry about accidentally

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.500
bumping into it as you get
in and out of the bed.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.000
I also have a couple

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.100
of speakers built
into both sides of the bed,

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.700
and the controls are built

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.420
into the center
of the headboard here.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:08:11.200
[Music]

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.500
The speakers are set up so you
can either use an aux cord,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.300
or you can just run it
all through Bluetooth.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.500
[Music]

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.600
Casper foam mattresses.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.800
They sleep pretty cool.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.700
You don't tend
to over heat in them,

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.700
like you doing some kinds.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.200
I however actually tend
to run fairly cool anyway,

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.500
which means that I like
a little bit more heat.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.600
So what I've done is I just have
a heated blanket all over my bed

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.060
underneath the cover,

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.000
and the control for that just
sits right here next to my head.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.300
The cord is running
under the mattress to here,

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.600
and then the power
cord comes down.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.300
I have two power
outlets on the top.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.400
But I've also added power outlets
on the inside of the legs here.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.000
This is partly
because I've covered

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.100
up the outlet in the middle
of the wall behind the bed,

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.400
and I didn't want to make it

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.500
so you can't use it anymore.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.600
So I've wired both of these,

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.200
there's one on each side,
into that center outlet,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.400
and so we still have power.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.200
You know, if you're vacuuming
the room or something like that,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.200
you need to be able
to plug stuff in.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.100
Or if you have a heated
blanket on your bed,

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.700
you need to be able
to plug it in somewhere.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.700
That's why I've also added
some outlets here,

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.300
and I did put them on the inside

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.000
so that they
aren't really obtrusive.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.500
They don't get in the way.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.400
You don't see them too much,

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.000
but they are there
when you need them.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.840
I've added 4 workbench casters
on to the bed.

00:09:22.842 --> 00:09:24.200
2 here in the back,

00:09:24.242 --> 00:09:26.672
and 2 on the inside
of the storage box.

00:09:27.432 --> 00:09:28.900
Workbench casters are the type

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.100
where the wheel is actually
not in contact with the ground.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.500
It looks like it is because of
this carpet is pretty thick,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.992
but the wheel is not in
contact with the ground

00:09:37.342 --> 00:09:38.582
until we engage it.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.272
When we do that,
the wheel engages,

00:09:41.272 --> 00:09:43.902
and it actually lifts up
the frame that it's on.

00:09:44.712 --> 00:09:46.652
With all 4 casters engaged,

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:49.232
tt's possible to actually just
roll the bed a little bit.

00:09:49.232 --> 00:09:52.300
It's not a great system
because it is on carpet,

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.400
and it's still
really big and heavy,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.980
but it's a lot easier

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.000
than if you didn't have
those on there.

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:00.900
With that pulled out,
we can also take a look

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.500
behind the bed and see
what's going on.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.900
Here are the plugs,

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.700
and you can see
that this outlet would really be

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.400
pretty inaccessible
for behind this bed.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.100
So what I've done is I've set
up everything to be wired

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.460
into the bed itself.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.800
One plug is coming
into this big old power strip

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.300
that I have attached with
these two makeshift brackets,

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.500
and most everything
plugs into that.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.100
We've got our to bed
lights plug into that.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.540
We've got our speaker system
plugged into that,

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.800
and we have the under
lighting all plugged

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.600
into this power strip.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.100
The other plug is

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.400
what's powering the 4
outlets going around.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.000
The outlets aren't on the same
circuit as the speakers,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.612
the lights, and under lighting.

00:10:37.172 --> 00:10:38.400
They have their own circuit,

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.200
and it just goes
all the way around.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.000
So the 4 are on one circuit.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.700
Obviously,

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.992
I can't run too much power
out of all of them at once,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.400
but they're mostly for things
like the electric blanket,

00:10:48.622 --> 00:10:51.512
or charging my laptop overnight.

00:10:51.512 --> 00:10:53.000
You can also see
I've got a little piece

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
of foam right here.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.200
This is a furniture slider,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.100
and it's just to make sure

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.600
that if the bed does touch
the wall itself,

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.900
it's not going to I
should have too much.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.680
Quick note about the bed frame,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.300
first off, thanks to my friend Travis for
helping me come up with a design.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.300
Second, if you are interested
in building one of these for yourself,

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.600
I have posted
the SketchUp file design

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.400
of this bed in description
for the video.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.700
It doesn't have instructions
on how to build it.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.100
It just shows you
all the pieces,

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.140
and where they go.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.400
You will have to do a little bit

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.200
of figuring out of how to
attach everything yourself.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.900
Thanks again to Casper,
