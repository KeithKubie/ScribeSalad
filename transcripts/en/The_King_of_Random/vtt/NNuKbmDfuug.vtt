00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
In today's video,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.300
we're revisiting something
we've tested in the past.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.500
What happens if you
take all of the moisture

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.060
out of soda, specifically,

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.855
is it different
from regular soda,

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:10.200
soda made with cane sugar,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.710
and soda made
with artificial sugar?

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.260
[Music]

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.900
Guys, while back,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.200
we did a test where we
tried to take Coca-Cola,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.500
and we dehydrated it.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.100
We put it in
our homemade dehydrator,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.800
and we let it run
for several days.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.690
The result we got was
a sort of thick syrup

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.084
that was a very
concentrated flavor.

00:00:32.084 --> 00:00:34.000
I had several people request

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.050
in the comments
something like this,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.116
that we try out
using Mexican Coca-Cola,

00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:39.600
which is supposed to be made

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.431
with cane sugar rather than
high fructose corn syrup.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.753
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:46.400
We've got normal Coca-Cola,
Mexican Coca-Cola,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.860
and diet Coca-Cola,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.173
and we're going to compare
all three by heating them up,

00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:51.085
dehydrating them,

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:52.140
and freeze drying them.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.500
This particular comment

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.800
from YouTube user
useazebra also suggested

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.626
that we try dehydrating
our Coca-Cola in low pressure,

00:00:58.626 --> 00:00:59.450
or freeze dry.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.180
Well, we now have
a freeze dryer,

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.757
and I did think it was a cool
idea to test the difference

00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:05.382
between the high
fructose corn syrup

00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:07.100
and the cane sugar
types of Coca-Cola.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.000
And while we're at it,
I also got some Diet Coke.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.300
I've got some frying pans,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.939
and we can try heating
them up on a stove.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.190
That'll be a really quick way

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.700
to try and get all
the moisture out.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.100
We've got our dehydrator,
the homemade Dehydra-Tron 5000.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.823
So we're going to try
all three types of this soda

00:01:21.823 --> 00:01:23.000
using those methods.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.948
The American Coke has
high fructose corn syrup,

00:01:25.948 --> 00:01:28.000
the Mexican Coke has cane sugar,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.400
and the diet coke has
an artificial sugar

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.400
called aspartame.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.700
We are also going to do
some side-by-side taste test

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.000
to see what the difference is
between all these,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.550
and in fact, we're going to see

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.400
if I can taste the difference
between these two

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.000
if I don't know
which one I'm drinking.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.900
Standard Coca-Cola.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.500
[Music]

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.480
Okay.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.200
There's a bottle opener, right?

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.280
Mexican Coca-Cola.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.800
[Music]

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.160
I'm not sure if those tasty
differently or not.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.900
Diet Coca-Cola.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.880
[Music]

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.260
I don't know.
To me that was pretty similar--

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.700
Oh.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.263
Except I'm now
getting the aftertaste

00:02:13.263 --> 00:02:15.760
from the aspartame
in the diet Coca-Cola.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.500
So that's something that I
find particularly unpleasant.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.970
So first, we're going to put
these in identical frying pans,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.800
same amount of liquid
in each one,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.500
and we're going to see
what happens to them

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.046
as we boil off all the water.

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:27.846
Here we go.

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:29.500
This is our standard Coca-Cola.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.300
[Music]

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.100
Got it on the stove,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.000
and the stove
is set too high.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.838
Let's see what happens to this.

00:02:39.838 --> 00:02:41.520
I've got two more frying pans.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.457
So we're actually going
to leave whatever's left

00:02:43.457 --> 00:02:44.200
in the frying pan.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.851
So we can do a side-by-side
comparison of all three.

00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:47.750
It's pretty crazy.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.200
As the water boils off,
it gets more concentrated.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.400
Some of these bubbles
are getting really big.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.192
Like I've seen bubbles that are
three or four inches in diameter

00:02:55.192 --> 00:02:55.969
before they pop.

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:56.849
I actually thought

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.000
that I would see less
and less of the bottom

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.764
as it boiled.

00:02:59.764 --> 00:03:01.870
I thought maybe you'd
for more of a skin

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.200
or coating on the bottom,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.000
but I'm seeing through
to the white pan more and more

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.540
as the water boils off.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.600
Then there's less volume,
so that makes sense.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.700
I just hadn't quite anticipated
what it was going to do

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.500
as it boiled.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.900
It's been about
7-8 minutes going,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.400
and I'm smelling just
a little bit of burning.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.480
Okay, regular Coke finished.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.060
Mexican Coke on now.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.520
[Music]

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.400
Think about where we
stopped the other one.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.560
There's no more steam
coming off of it.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.070
[Music]

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.100
Well, we've got one more pan.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.860
One more type of cola.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.500
[Music]

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.600
Our diet Coke is, I think,
just about finished,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.800
and it's behaving much
differently than the other two.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.400
Since it doesn't have
any real sugar in it,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.400
it's-- it really
is reacting differently.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.100
Before, we were getting
bigger and bigger bubbles,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.980
and then it started
finally dissipating away.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.054
But we still had quite a bit
of material in it.

00:04:03.054 --> 00:04:04.520
This is now dried up,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.800
and I'm frankly just baffled by
what I see here.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.900
This is super weird,

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.100
and not what I
expected at all.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.000
I thought we were going to have
something like the other two.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.800
This is super surprising.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.932
I did not see this coming.

00:04:16.932 --> 00:04:18.500
I had no idea this
was gonna happen,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.400
and so, let's talk
about what did happen.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.260
The first two,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.682
one which has plenty
of high fructose corn syrup,

00:04:23.682 --> 00:04:25.500
and one of which
has plenty of sugar,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.160
really left quite a bit behind.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.300
The high froctus corn syrup,
this is kind of interesting.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.400
We have a very
thick liquid here.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.500
It is still liquid.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.900
You can see I can push
it around really easily.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.280
The one from the sugar,
I could push it,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.700
and then it just sort of stays
where I left it.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.700
Whereas this, I push it,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.260
and then it just
puddles immediately.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.340
The high fructose corn syrup
has a liquid sweetener in it,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.275
whereas the Mexican Coca-Cola
has a solid sweetener,

00:04:52.275 --> 00:04:53.475
cane sugar in it.

00:04:53.475 --> 00:04:55.700
And so, when we extract
all the extra liquid,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.582
what we're left
with is liquid over here,

00:04:58.582 --> 00:05:01.340
and not so liquid over here.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.000
Very surprising to me
though is the fact

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.600
that the Diet Coke ended up
with almost nothing.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.640
There's so little left.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.280
All right, taste test.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.180
Concentrated, and possibly
slightly burned Cola syrup.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.340
Here we go.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.140
[Music]

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.480
Ho!

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.780
Yeah, concentrated is right.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.420
Wow.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.900
Let's move on to the kind
made with sugar.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.360
[Music]

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.320
Pretty similar flavor.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.000
Similar to that one.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.200
I get a lot more of the tang
than I did before.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.900
This one I think has also
caramelized a little bit.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.620
There's real sugar in this,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.440
and I think cooking it
that high temperature

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.900
when all the water was gone,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.020
it start to get a little bit
of caramelization.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.020
It's not bad.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.420
I'm going to try
to lick the pan.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.680
See if I can taste anything.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.460
Oh, man.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.260
Oh, that's so bad.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.800
These spots here,
where it's not just splatter,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.360
there's actually like
kind of a puddle,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.860
is very very concentrated.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.540
Just came with a kick

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.460
of that aspartame
artificial sugar flavor.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.220
So that was quite unpleasant.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.440
It's really really strong.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.780
It doesn't get
to you immediately.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.520
So I was like licking it
for a couple of seconds,

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.960
really wasn't getting much,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.760
and then all of a sudden,
just a wave of that flavor.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.080
I think we need to try
a couple more things.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.180
We've got our dehydrator,
and we've got a freeze dryer.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.800
We want to put some of each
of these into those as well.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.338
Let's get it set up.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:50.540
[Music]

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.880
There. 55.05.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.220
That's close enough.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.460
All right.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.600
55 grams of our diet.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.040
That's gonna do it.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:22.200
[Music]

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.700
All three types of Coke
have now been dehydrated

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.760
and freeze-dried,

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.934
and the results are
pretty fun to see.

00:07:26.934 --> 00:07:29.784
We have lost, of course,
just so much moisture.

00:07:29.784 --> 00:07:30.900
Let's take a look.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.480
Our regular soda.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.000
This was 55 grams.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.600
At 7.4 grams,

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.880
that means we've lost
47.6 grams of water.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.100
Let's do the same test
with our Mexican Coke.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.120
I was pretty careful
to make sure I had 55

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.060
of each of these.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.620
So, this one, 7.75.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.140
Very very close.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.860
We have 0.35 grams,

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.400
very little difference
between the Mexican

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.900
and the regular Coke.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.800
Let's take a look at the diet.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.300
Just first, let's
look at this cup.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.288
Like there is almost
nothing in there,

00:08:06.288 --> 00:08:08.927
compared to the regular,
which is full of syrup.

00:08:08.927 --> 00:08:11.420
It is now barely registering.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.600
This is within like the margin

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.720
of error of the weight between
two different cups 0.05 grams.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.980
Easily less than one percent
of the mass is left

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.620
after all the water is removed
from our diet soda.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.760
That's pretty crazy.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.650
I'm just gonna do a quick
taste test of all of them.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.660
Here's the regular.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.180
This is with the high
fructose corn syrup to start.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:36.040
[Music]

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:36.640
Very powerful.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.700
Similar to when we boiled it,

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.920
although there's no burned
to taste to it.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.700
So it's a little bit
nicer, very sweet.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.517
It's quite tart.

00:08:42.517 --> 00:08:43.467
I like it actually.

00:08:43.467 --> 00:08:44.160
All right.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.580
Here's the Mexican Cola.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.760
[Music]

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.920
Very very similar.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.620
In my head,

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.840
I think maybe it has
more of a sugar flavor

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.580
that could just be
a confirmation bias,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.100
because I know it has
real sugar in it.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.860
But it's got the cola flavor.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.020
It has the sugar flavor.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.320
It has that tangy flavor.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.400
It's very strong.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.080
Diet.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.300
Now, I'm not even sure
how to taste this

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.820
because there's really
hardly any liquid in it.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.834
Looks like I scrape it
off the bottom of burnt pan.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.100
See what this tastes like.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.660
Oh my gosh.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.200
Wow.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:19.700
Okay.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.940
That is disturbingly sweet.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.620
Aspartame is approximately
200 times sweeter than sugar.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.320
Well, because there's
not much in here,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.500
when I scrape up just
a finger full of this,

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.600
I'm getting like 200 times
the concentration of sweetness,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.700
and that is really powerful.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.180
There's a little bit of liquid,

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.260
and then a little bit
of the solid stuff,

00:09:40.263 --> 00:09:41.615
and just scrape it
off on your finger,

00:09:41.615 --> 00:09:42.860
and then---

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.460
Do I even wanna know what this is?

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.520
It's literally freeze
dried Diet Coke.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.340
That's mostly aspartame.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.900
Oh, I thought we were friends.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.480
Isn't that like a kick?

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.920
It would make
a really good candy

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.720
&gt;&gt; if it was like 1/8 of that sweetness.
&gt;&gt; Try the Mexican one,

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.100
because that's
just actual sugar.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.860
That's freeze-dried Mexican Coke
made with cane sugar.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.260
It's much more pleasant.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.520
[Music]

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.820
So this is mine now.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:12.940
It's not bad.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.660
No, no. No, no.
I like this one.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.540
Now, we've also

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.000
got the ones that we put
through the dehydrator,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.500
and I gotta say, it looks

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.000
like we've got pretty much
the same thing going on.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.100
We've got some slightly
runny syrups going on here.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.392
It's actually pretty thick,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.680
that maybe the additional heat
from the dehydrator

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.800
as opposed to the freeze dryer.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.400
It may have burned
off a little bit,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.000
and even started
to cook it a little.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.200
So I've got some flakes.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.800
This is our Mexican soda.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.000
[Music]

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.060
Really sticks to
your teeth a lot.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.460
Pretty much the same.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.660
Yeah, it tastes like Cola,
a definite tang to it.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.040
Smell is not very powerful,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.040
and it's not a liquid
so there's going to be

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.200
less coming off of it.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.640
So that's not too surprising.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.600
The regular soda made

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.840
with the high fructose
corn syrup is much more liquid.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.720
Being a liquid,
it doesn't get as solid.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.960
And then, we have our diet,
which is just gone.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.080
There's residue down
at the bottom,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.040
completely dried up.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.200
There's just nothing to it.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.040
I'm going to add water

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.200
until this gets
up to 136 grams, and see

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.400
if it reconstitutes it all.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.960
I already see it's getting
a little bit of the color.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.560
Start to swirl around a bit,

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.975
pulling that color
and flavor off of the bottom,

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.240
where it's turned into a solid.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.800
Let's try and encourage
this a little bit.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.760
It looks like we've now pulled
everything off of the bottom.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.000
Now, I'm going to give
this a little taste,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.700
and see how it taste
compared to a normal diet Coke.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.280
I think it looks a little
bit lighter in color,

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:37.860
but not much.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.220
This is a fairly thin layer
on a reflective surface.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:45.220
[Music]

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.240
It seems weak.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.840
Like it seems like it's
missing a lot of the flavor.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.260
I don't know where
that would have gone,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.200
because it should have all
just stayed down in here.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.900
Unless there are other chemicals
that evaporate with the water

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.480
in our diet Coke.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.720
Diet Coke versus Mexican Coke
versus regular Coke.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.900
A lot of people had been asking
to see what would happen

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.500
if you did it
with sugar cane Coke

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.520
as opposed to the high
fructose corn syrup kind.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.240
And while it did harden
up quite a bit more,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.566
neither with the freeze dryer

00:12:11.566 --> 00:12:15.180
nor dehydrating it did it
fully turn into a solid.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.260
We can't turn this
into a powder.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.800
I can dig my finger
down into it.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.741
I can stretch it out.

00:12:19.741 --> 00:12:22.200
You can see that it
forms these strings.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.200
So it's not something that's
going to turn into a powder,

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.200
but it does get closer than
the high fructose corn syrup.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.720
Surprisingly to me,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.932
the diet coke actually
does completely turn down

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.240
into something dry and powdery.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.640
So concentrated that it's
like almost offensively strong

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.840
if you taste it,

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.760
and then adding
water back into it,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.300
I didn't really think
it had all the flavor.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.279
Something got lost in there,
and of course,

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.400
it's not carbonated
the way we mix it up here.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.000
Guys, that's not all,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.140
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.980
That box up at the top
is going to take you directly

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:51.704
to our last video.

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:52.940
You should go check that out.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.078
The other box
is going to show you

00:12:54.078 --> 00:12:55.846
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:12:55.846 --> 00:12:56.900
Hit this bomb in the middle,

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.046
you'll be subscribe
to the channel.

00:12:58.046 --> 00:12:59.700
That way, you're never going
to miss a cool video.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.809
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:13:00.809 --> 00:13:01.991
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.080
Talk to you then.
