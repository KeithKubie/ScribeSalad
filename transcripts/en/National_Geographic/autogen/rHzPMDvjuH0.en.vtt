and Google Earth were a big challenge

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
and Google Earth were a big challenge
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.249

was called Google Earth so a lot of the

of these things broke assumptions about
you know that the software makes about

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
you know that the software makes about
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.880

we had to enhance a lot of those things

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530
we had to enhance a lot of those things
 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.139
we had to enhance a lot of those things
one of the reasons that we put wanted to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
one of the reasons that we put wanted to
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.880
one of the reasons that we put wanted to
put Mars and Moon inside of Google Earth

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
put Mars and Moon inside of Google Earth
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.230

additional features that we haven't even
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.539
additional features that we haven't even
gotten to yet but the 3d models that

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
gotten to yet but the 3d models that
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.780
gotten to yet but the 3d models that
we've included are Sketchup models and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
we've included are Sketchup models and
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.810

Google Earth the language that you use

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
Google Earth the language that you use
 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.600
Google Earth the language that you use
to talk to Google Earth is KML and so

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610
to talk to Google Earth is KML and so
 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.710
to talk to Google Earth is KML and so
using KML you can put your own data

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720
using KML you can put your own data
 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.760
using KML you can put your own data

stood in place and rotated around and
 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.960
stood in place and rotated around and
took photos and we reconstructed those

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970
took photos and we reconstructed those
 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.970
took photos and we reconstructed those
into panoramas besides having the
