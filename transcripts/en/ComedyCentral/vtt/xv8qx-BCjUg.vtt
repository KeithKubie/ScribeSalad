00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:03.537
Last week, the Internet got its
first look at the movie remake

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.939
of anime favorite <i>Ghost in the
Shell,</i> which is really awesome,

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:08.308
and you should watch the
original if you haven't seen it.

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.244
People can't stop talking
about the casting

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:11.745
for this new movie.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.714
The roll of ass-kicking
Japanese cyborg

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.816
Major Motoko Kusanagi
will be played

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.952
by notable Japanese actress,
Scarlett Johansson.

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:20.521
(laughter)

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:24.358
-Look how Japanese she is not.
-(laughter)

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.726
Now, maybe
the movie will be good.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.027
I don't know.
I haven't seen it yet.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.295
But why did they do this?

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:29.696
Did the studio misread
Scarlett Johansson's

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.532
-last name as Johan-san?
-(laughter)

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:35.335
Like, I don't know
how they made this mistake.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.371
Between this,
Emma Stone in <i>Aloha,</i>

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:38.705
and Natalie Dormer
in <i>The Forest,</i>

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.440
we almost have enough actresses

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:43.544
to do an all-white-female
<i>Seven Samurai</i> reboot,

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:46.513
so let's really
get behind this, guys.

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.582
Come on. It's time.

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:51.385
(applause and cheering)

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.522
So, since apparently,

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:57.024
studios will cast
just whomever--

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.593
parenthesis, white people--
as whatever,

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:01.261
comedians, what's another
controversial casting choice?

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:03.030
Anna.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.965
-Kevin James as Godzilla.
-(laughter)

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.467
(applause and cheering)

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.003
Yup. Points.

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:13.006
-Ben. -Kylie Jenner
as someone with human lips.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.274
HARDWICK:
All right, points.

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:15.676
(applause and cheering)

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:18.378
-Flula. -Donald Trump as the
president of the United States.

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.147
-HARDWICK: Oh, don't go...
-AKANA: Oh!

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.582
Okay. Okay.

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:24.484
-Okay. Points.
-Is this...?

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:26.520
-HARDWICK: Yeah. -Wait.
Is this fiction or non-fiction?

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:28.222
-Is it fic...?
-HARDWICK: It's actually...

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:29.590
It <i>wa</i> fiction.

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:30.958
It's slowly becoming
non-fiction.

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:32.492
-AKANA: I know.
-BORG: That is very scary.

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:33.727
-HARDWICK: It's turning.
-Oh, it's a new...

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.728
HARDWICK: Everyone thought
it would be fiction,

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.029
and now it doesn't seem...

00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:37.998
We don't (bleep) know what's
gonna happen anymore.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.400
GLEIB: Trump probably thinks
he can be in this movie.

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:41.735
(imitating Trump):
I'd be a great Asian girl.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.637
HARDWICK:
Yeah, I could be an Asian girl.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.639
What's wrong?!
I've been evicting ghosts

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:45.739
-from shells for years!
-(laughter)
