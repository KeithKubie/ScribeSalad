IEIN VALDEZ: Hi.

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.090
I'm Iein Valdez, a developer
advocate with Google.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.810
And I'm here to talk to you
about Google App Engine.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.650
App Engine helps you build
your apps, whether you're

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.770
building an app in the cloud,
on Python/Java/Go, you're

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.660
building a mobile application
with Android or IOS, or you're

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.930
going to build an HTML5
or Chrome Web

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.540
App/Extension, or even Dart.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.560
So the traditional approach to
application development has

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.860
been painful and cumbersome.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.030
You've had to manage machines,
figure out how to get a

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.160
database running,
scale your load.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.860
And at the end, you don't really
spend a lot of time on

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.970
your users.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.430
So App Engine is easier.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.530
We help you run your apps on
Google's infrastructure.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.680
We make it easy to build, easy
to maintain, and easy to scale

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.920
your application.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.620
And we give you everything
you need.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.910
So we have a local SDK.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.790
In Java, Python, Go you can
download it, install it on

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.520
your machine, and get up
and running quickly.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.590
We have a series of powerful,
managed APIs for data

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.960
persistence, queues, everything
you need to get

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.450
your app up and running.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.830
We also have our fast,
secure cloud runtime.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.470
So once you get the app
built locally, you

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.680
can deploy it quickly.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.790
And we have the admin console,
where now you can manage your

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.040
application and make
changes to it.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.390
Some of the core features of App
Engine, we have a series

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.770
of compute services you can take
advantage of, frontends,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.550
backends, task queues, cron.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.970
This is where you're going to
process your web requests.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.490
We have a bunch of storage and
persistence mechanisms from

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.580
our non-relational datastore
to cloud SQL, as well as a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.410
high performance in-memory
cache called Memcache.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.240
We also have a series of
services and APIs that you can

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.920
take advantage to manage
your users, image

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.920
manipulation, and so forth.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.740
So what's special about App
Engine is that you, as a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.480
developer, can focus on
being productive.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.810
We give you the SDK.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.380
You have near zero
configuration,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.440
no servers to manage.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.460
And it's an application platform
where you can build

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.390
your app and make it
very powerful.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.370
It's also free to get started,
and you only pay

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.240
for what you use.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.800
App Engine's ready
for business.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.240
We're a fully supported
Google product now.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.310
We have 99.95% uptime SLA.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.240
We have paid support.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.840
And we also have a series of
platform certifications, so

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.450
you have confidence that
your app is going

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.830
to be up and running.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.470
There has been tremendous
developer momentum.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.480
As of January this year, we have
over 100,000 developers,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.135
300,000 apps, and
we serve over 3

00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:07.280
billion daily page views.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.880
And you can take advantage of
that with your application.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.750
There are four different
categories that we see these

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.570
300,000 apps fit into.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.340
And you can probably think
about where you fit here.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.690
So we have our mobile,
tablet, HTML5 apps.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.500
We have social, mobile games,
consumer web apps where you

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.190
have to handle unpredictable
traffic and scale, as well as

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.860
business applications.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.020
So what will you build?

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.646
Come visit us on
appengine.google.com, and let

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:30.480
us know how it goes.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.730
Thanks.
