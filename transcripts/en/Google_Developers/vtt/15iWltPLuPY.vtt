00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:02.667
Dodge: Hello.
Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:03.834
Thank you for coming,

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:06.434
last session of the day
of a two-day conference.

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:07.734
Hope you had a great time,

00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:11.434
and thanks for
hanging in there with us.

00:00:11.434 --> 00:00:13.167
We saved the best for last.

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:15.334
This is going to be the best
session of the conference.

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:18.000
We have some superstar--
Kraus: No pressure.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.033
Dodge: We have superstar
panelists here

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:24.734
who have started companies,
started multiple companies,

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:29.934
and invest and get more
companies going, VCs here.

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:32.100
So, we've got
some great panelists.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.501
A few things to start.

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:35.634
There are two microphones
out here,

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:38.567
and we want you
to ask questions throughout.

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:40.801
So, I'm going to start
with a few questions.

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:42.367
I'll be looking at the mics

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:45.801
to see if you're up there
to ask questions,

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:48.767
and we want to do that
throughout the session. Okay?

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:51.067
So, don't make me ask
all the questions.

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:52.868
All right?

00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:54.667
Let me ask a couple of questions
right now.

00:00:54.667 --> 00:01:00.400
How many of you are not
from Silicon Valley?

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.100
Oh, awesome.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.934
How many of you are not
from the United States?

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:10.467
Awesome, that's great.
Okay, great.

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:14.334
First, let me introduce
our panelists.

00:01:14.334 --> 00:01:19.901
Paul Buchheit,
the inventor of Gmail,

00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:23.701
left Google
and started FriendFeed.

00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:27.667
FriendFeed was acquired
by Facebook.

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:30.701
He stayed at Facebook
for a while, then left,

00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:35.367
and now he's a venture
capitalist at Y Combinator,

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:40.033
one of the premier startup
incubators in Silicon Valley.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:45.434
Joe Kraus, founder of Excite,
one of the very first

00:01:45.434 --> 00:01:49.434
search engine portals
on the web, very successful,

00:01:49.434 --> 00:01:54.267
merged with @Home,
so it became Excite@Home.

00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:59.501
Later, the founder of JotSpot,
a really cool startup

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:02.067
that was acquired by Google,

00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:03.601
stayed with Google
for several years,

00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:08.133
and now is a venture capitalist
at Google Ventures.

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:11.400
And to my right here,
Seth Priebatsch.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.234
He's the founder
of Scavenger.

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:16.667
He'll tell you a little bit more
about that,

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:20.000
but it's a really cool game
that you can play,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.801
based on location,

00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:24.534
and go around and find things
like a scavenger hunt.

00:02:24.534 --> 00:02:26.033
It's a really cool game.

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:31.767
And Scavenger is a portfolio
company of Google Ventures.

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:33.968
So, he's in the family.

00:02:33.968 --> 00:02:38.267
So, this session is about
how to take an idea

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:42.234
from a nights and weekends
kind of project

00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:46.334
that you're hacking on
to a funded startup,

00:02:46.334 --> 00:02:48.033
and how do you get there?

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:51.734
All three of these guys
have done it several times,

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:54.200
so I think that's
the first question.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.968
Tell us how you did that.

00:02:55.968 --> 00:03:02.267
How did you go from idea stage
to hacking something,

00:03:02.267 --> 00:03:05.367
to finding another cofounder,

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:07.467
to getting some
angel investment,

00:03:07.467 --> 00:03:11.100
to getting venture capital?
Let's start with Seth.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.567
Priebatsch:
Cool.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.033
Just want to make sure
I'm doing this right.

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:16.300
Can everyone hear me okay?
Cool.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.934
So, I started Scavenger when
I was a freshman at Princeton,

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:24.367
and started working on it there,
doing math and computer science.

00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:27.167
And, basically,
the lineage of the idea

00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:29.067
was about taking
game mechanics,

00:03:29.067 --> 00:03:30.434
moving them
into the real world,

00:03:30.434 --> 00:03:32.501
trying to play a game
literally everywhere.

00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:35.968
And taking it from that
to actually being something

00:03:35.968 --> 00:03:37.434
that looked a bit more
like a company

00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:39.601
was sort of
a messy process.

00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:41.567
I brought it to one of
my computer science professors,

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:43.234
this guy Adam Finkelstein,
and said,

00:03:43.234 --> 00:03:44.834
"Hey, I have this cool idea.

00:03:44.834 --> 00:03:47.400
There's a Princeton business
plan competition coming up.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.033
Will you help me put
together just enough

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:52.000
to make it look like
the product sort of works?"

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.367
And we did that.

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:54.934
We hacked together
a few scripts in Python,

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:57.367
and it was literally running
on a server underneath my bed

00:03:57.367 --> 00:03:59.534
in my dorm room, which,
if we had ever vacuumed,

00:03:59.534 --> 00:04:00.868
the circuit would've blown,

00:04:00.868 --> 00:04:02.534
and the whole thing
would've gone down.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:05.100
But I ended up winning
the business plan competition,

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.133
and that was sort of
a key turning point for us,

00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:10.267
and then sort of made
the leap of faith

00:04:10.267 --> 00:04:12.033
and decided to drop
out of school,

00:04:12.033 --> 00:04:13.534
because that's what
all the cool kids

00:04:13.534 --> 00:04:14.934
were doing at that point,

00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:16.968
and I figured
I should follow along.

00:04:16.968 --> 00:04:20.601
And I think that's probably
the best short answer

00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:23.267
I have to it, that I found
a couple of friends at college.

00:04:23.267 --> 00:04:24.934
I found one professor,

00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:26.567
got into a business plan
competition,

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:29.601
which gave us some credibility,
and then sort of took

00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:32.734
a leap of faith to jump into
one of the incubator programs.

00:04:32.734 --> 00:04:34.267
We went with Dream Adventures

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:37.234
and sort of
started it from there.

00:04:37.234 --> 00:04:38.667
Dodge:
Great. Joe?

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:40.801
Kraus: Yeah, for me, I'll talk
about my first company,

00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:43.901
which was Excite,
back a while ago now, 1993.

00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:45.868
I started it
right out of college.

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:49.667
We did the route where
we borrowed money from our,

00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:51.367
each of--
we had six cofounders.

00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:53.400
We borrowed money
from our parents.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.567
We borrowed $15,000 total,

00:04:55.567 --> 00:04:58.400
and basically
set up shop in our garage.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.367
And the kind of two things
that I would basically say--

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:03.634
one is that persistence
played a huge role for us

00:05:03.634 --> 00:05:07.501
in moving from nights and
weekends to a funded company,

00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:12.100
and that we just never gave up
trying to get money.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.734
And the second
is that opportunity

00:05:13.734 --> 00:05:16.033
creates opportunities in ways
that are hard to predict.

00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:18.334
Our funding cycle
literally went like this.

00:05:18.334 --> 00:05:22.701
I got a book, when I graduated,
from my then college girlfriend,

00:05:22.701 --> 00:05:25.167
which was by a guy
named Bob Cringley.

00:05:25.167 --> 00:05:26.467
He still writes
an online column.

00:05:26.467 --> 00:05:28.067
And it was called,
"Accidental Empires,"

00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:30.801
and it was about a gossip
history of Silicon Valley.

00:05:30.801 --> 00:05:32.400
In the book, it said,
"Tips for Entrepreneurs:

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.701
Call me,
I'm a cheap date."

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:35.300
I call him,
we go out to lunch.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.200
He's interested in
what we're doing.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.834
He says,
"I want to join the company."

00:05:38.834 --> 00:05:40.000
I said, "Great."

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.267
I didn't know anything
at this point.

00:05:41.267 --> 00:05:43.067
I'm, you know, brand new,
and I thought,

00:05:43.067 --> 00:05:45.667
"Oh, this author
wants to join our company.

00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:47.701
We've made it."

00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:49.601
He eventually doesn't join,
but he introduces us

00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:52.434
to his parent company,
which was IDG,

00:05:52.434 --> 00:05:54.400
a big publishing company
at the time.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.901
They give us our first $100,000
contract back in 1994

00:05:57.901 --> 00:06:00.334
to put all their archives
online.

00:06:00.334 --> 00:06:02.334
One of the people I met there
said, "If you do a good job,

00:06:02.334 --> 00:06:04.300
we'll introduce you
to our board."

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.367
And so we did a good job,

00:06:05.367 --> 00:06:06.634
and they introduced us
to their board,

00:06:06.634 --> 00:06:08.200
and one of their board members
happened to be

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.133
a venture capitalist
named Steve Coit,

00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:12.801
out in Boston
at Charles River Ventures.

00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:14.400
Steve said,
"I'm kind of interested

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.868
in what you guys are doing, but
I need a West Coast partner."

00:06:17.868 --> 00:06:19.234
So, he introduced us
to a guy named Jeff Yang,

00:06:19.234 --> 00:06:22.367
who was then at IVP,
now at Red Point.

00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:24.601
Jeff said, "Yeah, I don't really
know what to do with you,"

00:06:24.601 --> 00:06:26.501
but he introduced us
to Vinod Khosla.

00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:29.100
Vinod, we met with Vinod,
and his first question--

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.868
unlike everybody else's,
which was,

00:06:30.868 --> 00:06:32.300
"How are you
going to make money?"--

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.133
his first question was,
"Does your technology scale?"

00:06:34.133 --> 00:06:35.567
We said, "We don't know.

00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:37.467
We can't afford a hard drive
big enough to test."

00:06:37.467 --> 00:06:39.734
He buys us, right then,
five minutes later,

00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:42.734
a $10,000 hard drive,
which, by the way, in 1994,

00:06:42.734 --> 00:06:45.300
was 10 gigs.
[laughter]

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.467
And, basically,
that led to us getting

00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:50.868
a $3 million financing
from Kleiner Perkins,

00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:52.801
in that case,
without a business plan.

00:06:52.801 --> 00:06:55.601
And the reason I tell that story
is you could not predict

00:06:55.601 --> 00:06:58.868
from a book that I received
from my college girlfriend

00:06:58.868 --> 00:07:01.934
to a $3 million financing
from Kleiner Perkins,

00:07:01.934 --> 00:07:04.400
how that chain of events
would've happened.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.601
But one thing
led to another.

00:07:06.601 --> 00:07:07.701
Opportunities created
opportunities

00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:09.000
in ways I couldn't predict,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.734
and the second is
we were persistent.

00:07:10.734 --> 00:07:12.467
To me, it's the number one
characteristic

00:07:12.467 --> 00:07:14.901
of amazing entrepreneurs
is they persist.

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:20.067
So, that'd be my nights
and weekends of transition.

00:07:20.067 --> 00:07:23.400
Buchheit: All right,
so, that's a great answer.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:29.267
But my story
is a little different.

00:07:29.267 --> 00:07:31.100
That makes noise.
All right.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.167
So, I was very interested in
startups when I moved out here,

00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:37.934
but I didn't know
anything about them

00:07:37.934 --> 00:07:39.767
or anything like that.

00:07:39.767 --> 00:07:41.467
So, I did the only thing
I could.

00:07:41.467 --> 00:07:42.767
And, again,
the idea being

00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:44.634
you don't really know
where the path leads.

00:07:44.634 --> 00:07:46.567
I decided I would
simply join a startup

00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:49.400
and then, hopefully,
learn in that way.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.434
And so, luckily, the startup
I joined was Google. [laughter]

00:07:53.434 --> 00:07:54.968
So, that's just
a simple matter of--

00:07:54.968 --> 00:07:55.968
Kraus:
Good choosing.

00:07:55.968 --> 00:07:57.934
Buchheit: Yeah,
joining Google in 1999.

00:07:57.934 --> 00:08:00.601
Kraus: Nice dart.
Buchheit: Yeah, and, you know,

00:08:00.601 --> 00:08:02.334
I was there for a long time,
obviously,

00:08:02.334 --> 00:08:04.400
and a lot longer
than I expected.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.434
I never thought Google
would really last.

00:08:06.434 --> 00:08:07.701
It seemed like a--

00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:09.400
Kraus: Flash in the pan.
Buchheit: Yeah.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.934
I mean,
with AltaVista there,

00:08:10.934 --> 00:08:12.968
it's hard to see how Google
could really make it.

00:08:12.968 --> 00:08:14.834
Dodge: I was at AltaVista
at that same time.

00:08:14.834 --> 00:08:15.834
Buchheit:
Yeah.

00:08:15.834 --> 00:08:18.033
Dodge: And look
where I ended up.

00:08:18.033 --> 00:08:19.567
Buchheit:
AltaVista was huge.

00:08:19.567 --> 00:08:20.801
Kraus: I've got you all
beat there.

00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:22.968
I had the opportunity
to buy Google,

00:08:22.968 --> 00:08:25.000
and I failed to do so.
So, how about that?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.033
[laughter] How's that
for egg in the face?

00:08:27.033 --> 00:08:30.601
[laughter/applause]

00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:32.033
Buchheit:
Anyway, so, I mean,

00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:34.000
that was obviously
a great experience for me,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.400
and it achieved my goal
of learning something

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.901
about startups

00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:40.734
and also just meeting
a lot of great people.

00:08:40.734 --> 00:08:45.133
So, sometime after
I left FriendFeed,

00:08:45.133 --> 00:08:47.033
I was getting together
with friends from Google,

00:08:47.033 --> 00:08:50.267
first Sanjeev Singh, who is
the second person from Gmail,

00:08:50.267 --> 00:08:51.701
and we started talking
about startup ideas

00:08:51.701 --> 00:08:55.200
and also other people
who we might be interested in,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.701
you know, having come onboard
with the startup, as well.

00:08:57.701 --> 00:08:58.901
And so we kept an eye

00:08:58.901 --> 00:09:00.701
on who else might be coming
out of Google,

00:09:00.701 --> 00:09:02.601
because there were lots
of good people at Google,

00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:06.901
and ultimately ended up talking
with Bret Taylor and Jim Norris,

00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:09.033
who were also interested
in doing a startup,

00:09:09.033 --> 00:09:12.801
and the four of us together
finally formed FriendFeed

00:09:12.801 --> 00:09:14.300
sometime later.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.934
And so, you know, at that point,
I think our story differs

00:09:16.934 --> 00:09:21.300
quite a bit from most startups
because of our history,

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.067
which is a little bit unusual.

00:09:23.067 --> 00:09:27.667
Bret had started, more or less
started Google Maps,

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:30.133
and Sanjeev and I
had done Gmail.

00:09:30.133 --> 00:09:32.501
So, we had an advantage
over most startups,

00:09:32.501 --> 00:09:35.934
in terms of being able
to raise money and such.

00:09:35.934 --> 00:09:39.100
We actually tried
to avoid raising money.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.467
But still, just that idea
of never knowing

00:09:41.467 --> 00:09:42.734
where the road leads,

00:09:42.734 --> 00:09:44.467
and you always just
kind of have to go forward.

00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:48.701
And certainly the deal with
selling the company to Facebook

00:09:48.701 --> 00:09:50.067
was sort of a surprise,

00:09:50.067 --> 00:09:51.901
because they were
always trying to buy us,

00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:53.334
and we always said no, never.

00:09:53.334 --> 00:09:58.400
And then one day we sold,
kind of by surprise.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.534
And, again, where I am now,
in terms of Y Combinator,

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:03.334
just kind of happened
spontaneously

00:10:03.334 --> 00:10:06.133
out of that same process
of just meeting people,

00:10:06.133 --> 00:10:08.634
talking to people.

00:10:08.634 --> 00:10:10.601
In the case of YC,
I've actually been involved

00:10:10.601 --> 00:10:13.067
since about 2006,

00:10:13.067 --> 00:10:14.801
initially just investing
in the companies.

00:10:14.801 --> 00:10:17.300
In every batch, I would invest
in more and more companies.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.100
And at some point,
I was already invested

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.834
in so many of the companies,
it just made sense for me

00:10:20.834 --> 00:10:25.701
to join full-time, and that's
how I got to where I am now.

00:10:25.701 --> 00:10:29.501
Dodge: So, Paul, you had
four founders in FriendFeed.

00:10:29.501 --> 00:10:30.801
Buchheit:
Right.

00:10:30.801 --> 00:10:33.801
Dodge: Joe, you had
six cofounders in Excite.

00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:38.133
Seth, you did it by yourself.
Why don't you have a cofounder?

00:10:38.133 --> 00:10:39.400
Priebatsch:
No one liked me.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.734
It was--
[laughter]

00:10:41.734 --> 00:10:46.067
No, well, maybe, but I'm not
sure that was totally relevant.

00:10:46.067 --> 00:10:49.467
For me, Scavenger is,
by far, the most successful

00:10:49.467 --> 00:10:51.334
and most interesting startup
that I've done,

00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:53.367
but I'd done
two previous ones.

00:10:53.367 --> 00:10:56.100
Giftopedia, I founded
when I was much, much younger,

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.434
and it failed gloriously.

00:10:58.434 --> 00:11:02.567
The thing just totally blew up,
but I'd sort of been used

00:11:02.567 --> 00:11:04.367
to doing things by myself
on that,

00:11:04.367 --> 00:11:09.167
and I think a lot of the stories
you hear are about founders

00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:10.434
looking for founding partners.

00:11:10.434 --> 00:11:12.901
And that's one
very successful model,

00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:14.734
and there's obviously
a huge amount of data,

00:11:14.734 --> 00:11:18.300
a huge amount of stories, too,
to showcase the success on that.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.834
For myself, personally,
I sort of wanted to get it

00:11:20.834 --> 00:11:24.400
to a stage where I knew at least
what I was doing,

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.467
where I had some level
of proof of concept

00:11:26.467 --> 00:11:28.434
and then went the route of

00:11:28.434 --> 00:11:29.968
looking for really
solid advisers

00:11:29.968 --> 00:11:32.133
and looking to build out
a team very quickly.

00:11:32.133 --> 00:11:35.567
So, by the time I started
building out a team, we had--

00:11:35.567 --> 00:11:37.133
I knew what the product
was going to be.

00:11:37.133 --> 00:11:38.601
I knew at least sort of
what it looked like.

00:11:38.601 --> 00:11:40.100
It's obviously evolved
a tremendous amount

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:45.267
and continues to evolve,
but for me, the founding portion

00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:47.801
was something that I'm much more
comfortable doing myself

00:11:47.801 --> 00:11:50.300
and then realizing
what I'm very weak at--

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.801
sales was a big thing
I was weak at.

00:11:51.801 --> 00:11:53.567
Marketing was a big thing
I was weak at,

00:11:53.567 --> 00:11:55.968
and finding the right people
to help me do that,

00:11:55.968 --> 00:11:58.133
but at a slightly later stage

00:11:58.133 --> 00:12:00.701
than looking for
a founding partner.

00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:02.534
Kraus: Actually, for anybody
who is out there

00:12:02.534 --> 00:12:04.334
starting companies,

00:12:04.334 --> 00:12:08.367
I talked to somebody
about this last night.

00:12:08.367 --> 00:12:11.801
The data actually suggests
and supports the notion

00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:14.968
that there is a positive
increase in successful outcome

00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:17.234
as you add numbers
of cofounders

00:12:17.234 --> 00:12:19.033
up till about four.

00:12:19.033 --> 00:12:20.868
There's just no data
past four.

00:12:20.868 --> 00:12:24.067
So, you are more likely
to succeed

00:12:24.067 --> 00:12:27.033
as you add cofounders
to your business.

00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:28.767
Nobody knows exactly why,

00:12:28.767 --> 00:12:30.467
but there is
that positive correlation.

00:12:30.467 --> 00:12:32.167
Buchheit: We've certainly
noticed this at Y Combinator,

00:12:32.167 --> 00:12:34.133
because we have,
at this point,

00:12:34.133 --> 00:12:35.667
I don't know,
300 or 400 startups,

00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:40.033
and two or three cofounders
seems to be the sweet spot.

00:12:40.033 --> 00:12:43.701
One is just very difficult,
a lot of times,

00:12:43.701 --> 00:12:46.000
because ultimately
startups end up having

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.501
really difficult times,
and it's easier

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:52.501
if you're not all alone
when things are awful.

00:12:52.501 --> 00:12:55.767
And we're not really sure
why going up four or five,

00:12:55.767 --> 00:13:01.701
six is bad,
but...our sort of theory

00:13:01.701 --> 00:13:03.534
is that it's just
sort of an indication

00:13:03.534 --> 00:13:07.734
that there's almost like a
little bit of fear in the group.

00:13:07.734 --> 00:13:10.701
I mean, obviously,
now I'm talking about

00:13:10.701 --> 00:13:12.434
both of our companies,
which worked out okay,

00:13:12.434 --> 00:13:16.567
but we've seen that sometimes,
when there's that many people,

00:13:16.567 --> 00:13:18.801
it kind of indicates
that none of them

00:13:18.801 --> 00:13:20.400
is quite as committed.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.467
They don't have what it takes
to make it with two or three,

00:13:23.467 --> 00:13:25.400
and so they kind of get
more and more people,

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.968
almost out of fear.

00:13:27.968 --> 00:13:29.968
Dodge: Paul,
I believe Y Combinator

00:13:29.968 --> 00:13:33.400
doesn't accept companies
of one founder.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.868
Buchheit:
Oh, no, we absolutely do.

00:13:34.868 --> 00:13:36.267
Dodge: Do you?
Buchheit: Yeah, in fact,

00:13:36.267 --> 00:13:37.901
probably one of the most
successful

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:39.501
Y Combinator companies
of all time,

00:13:39.501 --> 00:13:43.067
which is Dropbox,
was originally a single founder,

00:13:43.067 --> 00:13:45.133
and then he found
a cofounder.

00:13:45.133 --> 00:13:46.701
So, he was accepted
as a single founder,

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.567
and then he found
a cofounder later on.

00:13:49.567 --> 00:13:53.133
But we have several single
founders in every group.

00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:54.734
Dodge:
Joe, as a venture capitalist,

00:13:54.734 --> 00:13:59.234
when you look at investments,
do you like it

00:13:59.234 --> 00:14:02.534
when there are cofounders
or several cofounders,

00:14:02.534 --> 00:14:04.968
or how do you look at that?

00:14:04.968 --> 00:14:06.901
Kraus: Well, obviously,
it depends on the stage,

00:14:06.901 --> 00:14:09.300
but if we're talking about
something early stage,

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.901
seed or A round, the things
that we definitely look for

00:14:12.901 --> 00:14:18.734
and that we have in a pretty
broad analysis of a lot,

00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:20.968
a lot, a lot of companies
and data have found is,

00:14:20.968 --> 00:14:23.501
one, is yes,
there's a positive correlation

00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:24.767
between number of cofounders.

00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:26.968
Second is have you worked
together in the past

00:14:26.968 --> 00:14:28.267
is really important

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:31.701
as a kind of predictive
indicator of likely success.

00:14:31.701 --> 00:14:32.834
And that's just primarily,
like,

00:14:32.834 --> 00:14:35.067
have you gone to battle
together before?

00:14:35.067 --> 00:14:36.801
Do you like each other
at the end of it?

00:14:36.801 --> 00:14:39.067
Can you communicate honestly
with one another?

00:14:39.067 --> 00:14:40.367
Can you resolve disagreements

00:14:40.367 --> 00:14:42.000
without just striking
the middle ground

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.300
and having the easy answer?

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.167
But, oftentimes, somebody
winning an argument

00:14:46.167 --> 00:14:47.701
is actually more important

00:14:47.701 --> 00:14:50.067
than trying to kind of
thread the middle.

00:14:50.067 --> 00:14:52.000
So, having worked together
and then, lastly,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.701
the thing that is positively
correlated to success is,

00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:57.234
you know, this is obvious,
but, like,

00:14:57.234 --> 00:15:01.534
do you actually know
the domain you're pursuing?

00:15:01.534 --> 00:15:05.133
You know, startup founders
who do their second startup

00:15:05.133 --> 00:15:08.067
are actually no more likely to
succeed in their second startup

00:15:08.067 --> 00:15:09.701
if they're in
a brand-new domain.

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:11.901
So, like, for me, I was--

00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:14.467
I did a consumer
internet startup in Excite,

00:15:14.467 --> 00:15:16.067
when I went and did JotSpot,

00:15:16.067 --> 00:15:18.968
which was really focused on
small to mid-size business.

00:15:18.968 --> 00:15:21.634
By the numbers, I was at
no greater an advantage

00:15:21.634 --> 00:15:23.567
having done a startup before,

00:15:23.567 --> 00:15:27.133
mainly because the market
strategy is so much different.

00:15:27.133 --> 00:15:29.534
The way you sell,
the way you market,

00:15:29.534 --> 00:15:31.968
how you understand your
customers is so much different.

00:15:31.968 --> 00:15:33.868
But bottom line,
in early stage companies,

00:15:33.868 --> 00:15:35.501
the stuff that we like to see,
obviously,

00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:37.767
if you've done it before,
that's great.

00:15:37.767 --> 00:15:40.601
Multiple cofounders is good.

00:15:40.601 --> 00:15:42.100
Having worked together
in the past,

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.701
and hopefully in a domain,

00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:46.434
that you're operating
in a domain you understand

00:15:46.434 --> 00:15:47.767
and have some deep
expertise in.

00:15:47.767 --> 00:15:49.100
Those are all kind of
obvious things,

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.100
but some of the stuff
that we certainly look for.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.567
Dodge: I look at cofounders
as validation, right?

00:15:55.567 --> 00:15:57.601
If there are several
cofounders,

00:15:57.601 --> 00:16:01.334
that means that
more than one crazy person

00:16:01.334 --> 00:16:03.601
agreed that this is
a great thing to do.

00:16:03.601 --> 00:16:05.634
Kraus: Yeah, you cast a good
reality distortion field

00:16:05.634 --> 00:16:07.601
over a large number of people.
That can be helpful.

00:16:07.601 --> 00:16:09.701
Dodge: Right, 'cause
there's lots of crazy people,

00:16:09.701 --> 00:16:12.801
myself included,
who have ideas every day,

00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:14.801
but I think the validation
of an idea

00:16:14.801 --> 00:16:17.467
is when you can convince
someone else

00:16:17.467 --> 00:16:22.367
to drop what they're doing
and join you in your idea.

00:16:22.367 --> 00:16:24.501
If you can get two or three
people to do that,

00:16:24.501 --> 00:16:26.133
then that's pretty
good validation

00:16:26.133 --> 00:16:28.033
that you might be
onto something.

00:16:28.033 --> 00:16:30.000
And if you can't convince
two or three people

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.100
to drop what they're doing
and join you,

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.634
you should think really hard
about what you're doing.

00:16:35.634 --> 00:16:38.767
Now, Seth and others
are exceptions to that,

00:16:38.767 --> 00:16:42.601
but as an investor, that's--
I weight that pretty heavily.

00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:45.467
So, we have questions here.
So, let's start over here.

00:16:45.467 --> 00:16:46.968
man:
Quick question.

00:16:46.968 --> 00:16:49.801
So, any ballpark information as
far as does adding cofounders

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:52.968
increase your chances
by 10%, 500%?

00:16:52.968 --> 00:16:54.901
Also, you said
there's no data past four.

00:16:54.901 --> 00:16:56.834
Is there any drop off,
sort of leveling off?

00:16:56.834 --> 00:16:59.200
So, adding one cofounder
quintuples your chances,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.667
but adding the fourth one
is only a 10% increase.

00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:03.567
Kraus: Yeah, I don't know
the data explicitly.

00:17:03.567 --> 00:17:06.968
This is actually public research
that's been done,

00:17:06.968 --> 00:17:08.234
academic research
that's been done

00:17:08.234 --> 00:17:09.467
on this particular point.

00:17:09.467 --> 00:17:11.100
I don't know the name
of the paper, but--

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.300
and I don't know how to get you
the name of the paper.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.734
Maybe out of the Google
Ventures Twitter account

00:17:15.734 --> 00:17:17.167
we can Tweet
that particular paper

00:17:17.167 --> 00:17:19.767
that details
the answers to that.

00:17:19.767 --> 00:17:21.100
And the reason
there's nothing above four

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.534
is there's just
not many companies

00:17:22.534 --> 00:17:24.300
that start with
five cofounders,

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.968
or six, or whatever.

00:17:26.968 --> 00:17:28.767
man: Hi, today
what do you think

00:17:28.767 --> 00:17:31.467
is more important,
traction or product?

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:33.400
Kraus: Oh, in my opinion?
man: Mm-hm.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.968
Kraus:
Traction, for sure.

00:17:34.968 --> 00:17:37.000
I mean, look, there's always
the internal debate

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.667
in a company--
what matters more?

00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:40.767
Does the team matter most,
does the product matter most,

00:17:40.767 --> 00:17:41.934
does the market matter most?

00:17:41.934 --> 00:17:43.667
And, oftentimes, I think
most people understand

00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:45.901
that it's an interplay
of the three

00:17:45.901 --> 00:17:47.868
and that oftentimes
it's heavily dependent

00:17:47.868 --> 00:17:51.033
upon what stage you're actually
making that evaluation.

00:17:51.033 --> 00:17:53.501
So, a company that's doing
200 million in revenue,

00:17:53.501 --> 00:17:55.367
and, you know, $50 million
of free cash flow,

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:57.033
well, their market
matters a lot,

00:17:57.033 --> 00:17:58.868
because it's an ongoing concern,
and you want to know

00:17:58.868 --> 00:18:01.000
how much expansion there's going
to be into the company--

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.434
I'm sorry--how much expansion
of the revenue,

00:18:03.434 --> 00:18:06.367
of the marketing of the company
there can be.

00:18:06.367 --> 00:18:08.634
Way down back
to the early stage,

00:18:08.634 --> 00:18:10.367
what's really interesting
is anybody here read a book

00:18:10.367 --> 00:18:12.701
called
"The Checklist Manifesto"?

00:18:12.701 --> 00:18:16.300
No? I don't recommend it,
actually. [laughter]

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.868
But I can summarize it
in a word,

00:18:18.868 --> 00:18:20.400
in like a few sentences,

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.968
which is people who are really
expert at something

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:24.667
are great at telling
other people how to do it

00:18:24.667 --> 00:18:26.801
and really bad at following
their own advice.

00:18:26.801 --> 00:18:29.367
So, the classic example here
is medical doctors who are--

00:18:29.367 --> 00:18:30.868
let's say,
you're a pulmonologist.

00:18:30.868 --> 00:18:33.400
I can tell Don here,
"Here's how I screen

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.100
for whether somebody
has lung cancer."

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.734
And we watch what that doctor
actually does--

00:18:36.734 --> 00:18:40.701
Nothing related to what
they actually told Don to do.

00:18:40.701 --> 00:18:42.334
And that's why pilots
have checklists, right?

00:18:42.334 --> 00:18:46.601
So, there's just no notion
of expertise bias.

00:18:46.601 --> 00:18:51.701
Well, the thing here is
that if you actually ask

00:18:51.701 --> 00:18:53.868
and survey wide swaths
of venture capitalists,

00:18:53.868 --> 00:18:55.300
especially in the early stages,

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.834
"What's the most important thing
in the very early stages?"

00:18:57.834 --> 00:18:59.200
they'll all say team.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.767
When you watch
what they spend their time

00:19:00.767 --> 00:19:02.033
doing due diligence on,

00:19:02.033 --> 00:19:04.501
they do diligence
on the product and the market.

00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:06.067
And so there's a mismatch
between what people

00:19:06.067 --> 00:19:08.334
say is important
and what they actually do.

00:19:08.334 --> 00:19:10.467
So, the question,
as an investor,

00:19:10.467 --> 00:19:12.300
is how do you create
a system or a bias

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.467
towards doing what you know
to be important?

00:19:14.467 --> 00:19:17.000
And so, sorry,
longwinded answer,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.634
but in my opinion,
in the early stage,

00:19:18.634 --> 00:19:21.767
for me, at least,
is all team.

00:19:21.767 --> 00:19:25.767
man:
Thank you.

00:19:25.767 --> 00:19:28.000
man: So, this is mostly,
I think, an ethical question.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.434
How do you know
when your product

00:19:29.434 --> 00:19:31.634
is too big
for your current company?

00:19:31.634 --> 00:19:32.934
You talk about Gmail
specifically.

00:19:32.934 --> 00:19:34.167
That was something.

00:19:34.167 --> 00:19:35.834
How did you know
that was right for Google,

00:19:35.834 --> 00:19:37.167
versus striking it out
on your own,

00:19:37.167 --> 00:19:38.501
whereas with FriendFeed,

00:19:38.501 --> 00:19:40.434
that was something, you know,
that social networking

00:19:40.434 --> 00:19:42.534
has always been kind of
something Google might do.

00:19:42.534 --> 00:19:45.033
How did you have the clarity
to know that that was right

00:19:45.033 --> 00:19:48.133
to do on your own?

00:19:48.133 --> 00:19:49.834
Buchheit: I think
doing Gmail as a startup

00:19:49.834 --> 00:19:52.100
would've been
a lot harder.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.067
The resources required,
I mean, just in terms of

00:19:55.067 --> 00:19:57.734
all the hardware,
everything else,

00:19:57.734 --> 00:19:59.868
not too much in just
the brand value of Google.

00:19:59.868 --> 00:20:02.868
Are you going to trust
your email to some company

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:04.701
you've never heard of?
I think that's less likely.

00:20:04.701 --> 00:20:08.434
By the time we launched Gmail,
Google was pretty well known

00:20:08.434 --> 00:20:11.067
and pretty well respected,
and people trusted it.

00:20:11.067 --> 00:20:12.801
People trusted
switching over.

00:20:12.801 --> 00:20:15.767
If it was FriendFeed mail,
you might be, like,

00:20:15.767 --> 00:20:18.701
"Well, I'll give it
a few years," right?

00:20:18.701 --> 00:20:21.067
So, and obviously
there's counter examples.

00:20:21.067 --> 00:20:23.334
Hotmail was a startup,
but at the time,

00:20:23.334 --> 00:20:24.901
they didn't really have
any competition.

00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:27.400
So, I think it would've been
a lot harder to do that,

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.334
as a startup,
because it benefited a lot

00:20:29.334 --> 00:20:31.868
from Google's brand
and technology,

00:20:31.868 --> 00:20:33.300
and everything else.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:37.434
Other startups,
I think having an attachment

00:20:37.434 --> 00:20:41.667
to a big company like Google
could even be a hindrance.

00:20:41.667 --> 00:20:43.834
You know, maybe--I don't know,
I'm not going to go

00:20:43.834 --> 00:20:46.167
into the Google
social experimentation,

00:20:46.167 --> 00:20:49.033
but certainly
you can see where people

00:20:49.033 --> 00:20:51.267
might actually be
more comfortable thinking

00:20:51.267 --> 00:20:52.567
this is like a new product,

00:20:52.567 --> 00:20:55.467
and the ability
to move very quickly

00:20:55.467 --> 00:20:58.734
and take unusual directions
and not be hindered

00:20:58.734 --> 00:21:01.934
by a lot of
the big company apparatus,

00:21:01.934 --> 00:21:05.067
and Facebook might be
a good example of that.

00:21:05.067 --> 00:21:06.734
You know,
it's written in PHP,

00:21:06.734 --> 00:21:09.901
which would never
have been allowed at Google.

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:11.400
But, you know,
it's very successful.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.567
But I think if it were subjected
to a big company process,

00:21:15.567 --> 00:21:18.067
they wouldn't have been able
to make the big bets,

00:21:18.067 --> 00:21:21.634
take the big gambles, you know,
anger millions of people

00:21:21.634 --> 00:21:25.200
and whatever else it took
for them to become number one.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.534
man: Thanks.
Dodge: Over here.

00:21:27.534 --> 00:21:31.868
man: Hi. Can you give your views
on working with archangels

00:21:31.868 --> 00:21:37.801
versus working with
early stage VCs?

00:21:37.801 --> 00:21:39.834
Buchheit: Archangel,
like super angels?

00:21:39.834 --> 00:21:42.067
Is that the--
you know, I don't know.

00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:45.601
I think the lines
have gotten pretty blurred.

00:21:45.601 --> 00:21:48.734
I don't know that there's
any simple answer.

00:21:48.734 --> 00:21:51.267
It really depends on how much
money you're needing to raise.

00:21:51.267 --> 00:21:53.601
You know, if you're going to do
a large series A

00:21:53.601 --> 00:21:54.901
or something like that,

00:21:54.901 --> 00:21:57.100
you're probably going to end up
at a standard VC.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.100
Also, in terms of how much
you're going to have to give up.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.400
If you do a series A,
typically, you're going to give

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.434
a board seat
or maybe two board seats.

00:22:03.434 --> 00:22:07.000
You're going to give away
20% to 30% of your company.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.734
But if you're doing a seed round
with regular angels

00:22:09.734 --> 00:22:12.801
or super angels, you might be
giving away much less.

00:22:12.801 --> 00:22:15.934
You might only sell off
5% or 10% of your company.

00:22:15.934 --> 00:22:18.300
But, typically, you're getting
a lot less money.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.133
It probably won't last you
until profitability

00:22:21.133 --> 00:22:26.100
or even maybe more than
6 to 12 months.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.400
Kraus: I personally view it as
who do you fundamentally believe

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.834
can help you
build your business?

00:22:30.834 --> 00:22:35.400
Like, it comes down
to your choice of

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.801
who you want to help fund you,
should, in my opinion,

00:22:38.801 --> 00:22:43.033
not be based at all on firm,
on position,

00:22:43.033 --> 00:22:46.067
on whether they fit,
you know, super angel,

00:22:46.067 --> 00:22:48.033
angel, early stage VC.

00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:50.701
It's fundamentally about
do you have a good relationship

00:22:50.701 --> 00:22:51.767
with that person?

00:22:51.767 --> 00:22:53.701
And I always use
the Caller ID test,

00:22:53.701 --> 00:22:55.767
which is if
that person calls you

00:22:55.767 --> 00:22:56.901
and you look at the Caller ID,

00:22:56.901 --> 00:22:58.267
are you excited
to pick up the phone,

00:22:58.267 --> 00:22:59.834
or are you like,
"Oh, crap"?

00:22:59.834 --> 00:23:03.767
And the investments that I've
always kicked myself for

00:23:03.767 --> 00:23:06.234
failed the Caller ID test,
but where I get greedy.

00:23:06.234 --> 00:23:08.868
I'm like, "Oh, it's going to be
an awesome business."

00:23:08.868 --> 00:23:10.534
And then invariably, you know,
stuff changes,

00:23:10.534 --> 00:23:12.100
but I'm still
getting the calls.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.234
And, you know, so it really
is fundamentally, can people--

00:23:16.234 --> 00:23:20.434
do you believe that you've got
the people that can help you,

00:23:20.434 --> 00:23:23.601
give you advice,
and kind of steer you right,

00:23:23.601 --> 00:23:28.367
more than, you know,
one bucket or another?

00:23:28.367 --> 00:23:31.734
Dodge: So, Seth, you raised
angel capital money

00:23:31.734 --> 00:23:34.434
and venture capital money,

00:23:34.434 --> 00:23:37.767
so you've gone through
both processes.

00:23:37.767 --> 00:23:40.167
What kind of decision
did you go through

00:23:40.167 --> 00:23:42.033
in choosing your investors,

00:23:42.033 --> 00:23:44.100
or did you just take any money
that would come,

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.567
or how did you go through that?
Priebatsch: Sure.

00:23:46.567 --> 00:23:48.734
So, from our perspective,

00:23:48.734 --> 00:23:51.067
we went through an incubator
at Dream Adventures,

00:23:51.067 --> 00:23:52.601
which was based
in Philadelphia.

00:23:52.601 --> 00:23:54.133
It's now based in Philadelphia
and New York.

00:23:54.133 --> 00:23:57.501
And they're sort of,
they're structured like a VC,

00:23:57.501 --> 00:23:59.234
but they're really an angel.
You know, it's a tiny round.

00:23:59.234 --> 00:24:00.601
They give you 35K.

00:24:00.601 --> 00:24:02.968
They take 6%,
sort of the standard model.

00:24:02.968 --> 00:24:04.534
You sleep on the floor,
eat Ramen noodles,

00:24:04.534 --> 00:24:06.534
build things as fast
as you possibly can.

00:24:06.534 --> 00:24:07.801
And then we basically
had a choice

00:24:07.801 --> 00:24:11.100
to sort of what to figure out
after that.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.968
I decided I wasn't going back
to school at that point.

00:24:13.968 --> 00:24:17.300
And we looked at the angel
versus VC sort of dichotomy,

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.501
and our initial reaction
was to go with an angel round.

00:24:20.501 --> 00:24:23.000
We were looking to raise
about $3/4 million,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.767
and we figured that's probably
more of an angel size thing

00:24:26.767 --> 00:24:29.267
than a VC thing,
but we went out,

00:24:29.267 --> 00:24:32.701
and we talked to a bunch of VCs,
and what we found was--

00:24:32.701 --> 00:24:34.834
you know, we went
sort of the unusual route.

00:24:34.834 --> 00:24:36.133
I think, at this point,

00:24:36.133 --> 00:24:37.968
a lot of people are going
the super angel route.

00:24:37.968 --> 00:24:39.868
We ended up going
with Highland Capital,

00:24:39.868 --> 00:24:41.400
which is a large VC.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.834
They've got $2 or $3 billion
under management,

00:24:43.834 --> 00:24:46.467
and they agreed to do
a tiny round.

00:24:46.467 --> 00:24:48.234
You know, they're not
used to writing checks

00:24:48.234 --> 00:24:49.701
for that small
amount of money.

00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:51.334
They've actually gotten
into it a little bit more now,

00:24:51.334 --> 00:24:55.601
but we figured if a company
or venture firm

00:24:55.601 --> 00:24:57.067
that's used to investing
in businesses

00:24:57.067 --> 00:24:58.367
that are much, much bigger

00:24:58.367 --> 00:25:01.067
was willing to spend
their time with us,

00:25:01.067 --> 00:25:03.133
even if they weren't putting
that much money to work,

00:25:03.133 --> 00:25:04.834
that that was probably
a very good bet for us.

00:25:04.834 --> 00:25:06.434
And so we ended up
going with them,

00:25:06.434 --> 00:25:09.534
and they've since participated
in our two follow-on rounds

00:25:09.534 --> 00:25:11.167
and have been hugely helpful,

00:25:11.167 --> 00:25:12.667
and we've now raised
about $20 million

00:25:12.667 --> 00:25:15.367
from Google Ventures
and also Balderton Capital.

00:25:15.367 --> 00:25:18.667
And from our perspective,
again, Scavenger is the only

00:25:18.667 --> 00:25:20.200
serious company
that I've really done,

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.234
but my recommendation would be
if you can get a large VC

00:25:24.234 --> 00:25:25.901
to put a small amount of money
in you,

00:25:25.901 --> 00:25:27.901
the real value you're getting
is the time,

00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:29.467
and so you can get
a lot of leverage for that,

00:25:29.467 --> 00:25:32.133
if they'll do terms
that are reasonably equivalent

00:25:32.133 --> 00:25:35.567
to what an angel might do.
Dodge: Over here.

00:25:35.567 --> 00:25:37.767
man: Hello.
A question across the board.

00:25:37.767 --> 00:25:39.868
I was curious if you could
speak a bit about

00:25:39.868 --> 00:25:41.467
what has kept you motivated
over the years,

00:25:41.467 --> 00:25:44.534
both before and after
your success,

00:25:44.534 --> 00:25:48.934
other than massive amounts
of money. [laughter]

00:25:48.934 --> 00:25:51.601
Kraus: You know, when I did
my second startup,

00:25:51.601 --> 00:25:55.300
almost every employee
that I was trying to hire

00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:00.567
asked me this question,
and the truth doesn't sound--

00:26:00.567 --> 00:26:01.801
it is the truth.

00:26:01.801 --> 00:26:03.667
It's just not satisfying
for most people,

00:26:03.667 --> 00:26:05.234
but it is what it is,

00:26:05.234 --> 00:26:09.501
which is I love
the personal relationships

00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:11.100
that you form
in a startup,

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.133
when you get a group of people
trying to do the impossible.

00:26:15.133 --> 00:26:17.501
It is the closest--

00:26:17.501 --> 00:26:19.200
I'm now married
with three kids,

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.634
and like I just,
I don't get to spend

00:26:21.634 --> 00:26:25.534
a lot of time with people
that aren't in my family.

00:26:25.534 --> 00:26:29.200
And the kind of closest
to that collegiate experience,

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.834
where you're spending
a ton of time with people,

00:26:31.834 --> 00:26:35.501
there's kind of this--
it's this crucible moment...

00:26:35.501 --> 00:26:37.334
that's what I get
out of startups.

00:26:37.334 --> 00:26:41.934
And so all of my closest
relationships

00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:45.868
really come from the companies
that I've done,

00:26:45.868 --> 00:26:48.834
because you go through
these experiences where,

00:26:48.834 --> 00:26:51.968
like, literally,
you don't have--

00:26:51.968 --> 00:26:53.534
we had this at Excite.

00:26:53.534 --> 00:26:57.033
You literally don't have
the next payroll in the bank,

00:26:57.033 --> 00:26:59.901
and you're trying to figure out
what to do.

00:26:59.901 --> 00:27:02.067
You go through these ups,
the celebratory experiences

00:27:02.067 --> 00:27:03.567
where something great
happened

00:27:03.567 --> 00:27:06.000
and where something bad,
horrible happens.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.367
And so for me, at least,
it's the relationships

00:27:08.367 --> 00:27:10.868
that you form when you try
to do these things.

00:27:10.868 --> 00:27:12.167
Dodge:
How about you, Paul?

00:27:12.167 --> 00:27:13.501
Buchheit:
Yeah, that's right.

00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:15.767
I mean, I think that's actually
one of the things that,

00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:19.701
in my mind, is the big
differentiator from startups

00:27:19.701 --> 00:27:22.534
versus some other environments
is the extent to which

00:27:22.534 --> 00:27:24.400
you're really close
to the team,

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.367
and you're kind of choosing
the people you're around,

00:27:27.367 --> 00:27:29.000
especially if you've started
the company.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.067
You literally choose the people
you're working with.

00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:34.868
But also, there's just
the creative aspect

00:27:34.868 --> 00:27:39.901
of launching new things
all the time, and I don't know.

00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:43.234
That's just fun for some people,
and it's certainly something

00:27:43.234 --> 00:27:47.267
that I think enjoyed
most just at FriendFeed

00:27:47.267 --> 00:27:51.200
is that every day I'd go in,
I'd write something new,

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.934
and I'd launch it.

00:27:52.934 --> 00:27:55.200
And just being able to get
things out there that quickly,

00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:00.067
to have an idea and move from
idea to implementation,

00:28:00.067 --> 00:28:02.300
to having it out to the world
and people telling me

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.667
that they hate it,
or they love it, or whatever,

00:28:05.667 --> 00:28:09.534
in such a short period
is kind of intoxicating.

00:28:09.534 --> 00:28:13.100
It's just a lot more fun
than most of the things

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.467
that people--it's more fun
than, I don't know,

00:28:15.467 --> 00:28:16.801
whatever it is people
pay to have fun.

00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:19.734
Like, it's more fun
than most vacations.

00:28:19.734 --> 00:28:21.534
You know,
to actually build things

00:28:21.534 --> 00:28:24.901
and launch them, and,
you know, that's a big part.

00:28:24.901 --> 00:28:29.567
Obviously, there's the flipside
that then like at 4:00 AM,

00:28:29.567 --> 00:28:31.801
you get called, because
like a server is broken,

00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:33.334
and you've got to wake up
and fix up.

00:28:33.334 --> 00:28:36.467
I didn't really care
for that part so much.

00:28:36.467 --> 00:28:40.467
So, there's a balance.
But even in what I'm doing now,

00:28:40.467 --> 00:28:42.601
I get to be involved in
the creative side of things,

00:28:42.601 --> 00:28:44.300
because people come to me
with problems,

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.000
or we're looking at a product,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.968
and you can kind of
explore solutions.

00:28:47.968 --> 00:28:50.234
And then the next time I talk
to the people a week later,

00:28:50.234 --> 00:28:52.601
they've tried it out
and told me that it didn't work,

00:28:52.601 --> 00:28:54.267
or it did work,
or whatever,

00:28:54.267 --> 00:28:56.834
but it gets
that same creative cycle

00:28:56.834 --> 00:29:00.634
of exploring the world
and trying out new ideas.

00:29:00.634 --> 00:29:02.767
Priebatsch: So, I've got
a totally unconventional

00:29:02.767 --> 00:29:05.901
and probably not likely to be
popular response to this one,

00:29:05.901 --> 00:29:07.601
but, you know,
Scavenger is a company

00:29:07.601 --> 00:29:08.868
all about game mechanics,

00:29:08.868 --> 00:29:11.434
and we've still got
a lot of work to do,

00:29:11.434 --> 00:29:13.667
but we've certainly done well.
We're two years in,

00:29:13.667 --> 00:29:15.968
and we raised our last round
north of 100 million,

00:29:15.968 --> 00:29:18.067
so we're doing well.

00:29:18.067 --> 00:29:21.834
But we very, and I very,
explicitly try and manage

00:29:21.834 --> 00:29:23.968
my own motivation
using mechanics,

00:29:23.968 --> 00:29:28.200
and the way I do it is lack of
alternatives, realistically.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.968
You take out everything else
that could possibly

00:29:31.968 --> 00:29:34.501
make you excited
or successful or happy,

00:29:34.501 --> 00:29:37.501
and you replace that with what
you're doing at your company.

00:29:37.501 --> 00:29:39.000
And if you've got--
Kraus: I love you.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.367
[laughter]

00:29:40.367 --> 00:29:42.133
Priebatsch: No, no, you're not
going to like this one,

00:29:42.133 --> 00:29:44.234
and it's not popular, and
it's probably not recommended,

00:29:44.234 --> 00:29:46.767
if you want to be happy.
[laughter]

00:29:46.767 --> 00:29:50.367
But it's recommended if you
want to build your company

00:29:50.367 --> 00:29:54.400
to be as big as you can
possibly make it.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.167
I built my whole
incentive structure

00:29:58.167 --> 00:29:59.934
so that I don't
draw a salary.

00:29:59.934 --> 00:30:02.701
I don't have a super-active
social life.

00:30:02.701 --> 00:30:04.234
I left Princeton.

00:30:04.234 --> 00:30:07.200
I decided I was going to do
Scavenger, and that was it.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.734
And it's sort of the thing,

00:30:08.734 --> 00:30:10.367
if you really want
your troops to fight hard,

00:30:10.367 --> 00:30:12.234
you burn the ships,
and you've got nowhere to go.

00:30:12.234 --> 00:30:15.300
And if you build yourself
to have only that,

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.234
that that is the thing
you are doing,

00:30:17.234 --> 00:30:18.767
then you're absolutely
motivated to do it,

00:30:18.767 --> 00:30:20.167
because there's nothing else.

00:30:20.167 --> 00:30:21.834
And it sounds a little stark,
and it sounds sort of

00:30:21.834 --> 00:30:23.400
a little cruel
and almost masochistic,

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.701
but it's really not.

00:30:24.701 --> 00:30:26.968
It's a very almost
Zen-like state,

00:30:26.968 --> 00:30:28.634
where you wake up
in the morning, and you know

00:30:28.634 --> 00:30:30.968
that there's absolutely
nothing else in your life

00:30:30.968 --> 00:30:34.000
that you have to do
except build a company.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
And I'm in a weird state, right?
I sleep at the office.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.200
I don't have an apartment.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.501
I outsource laundry
to my parents.

00:30:38.501 --> 00:30:41.667
Like, it's a wonderful,
blessed, bizarre life.

00:30:41.667 --> 00:30:45.267
But if you can do that,
if you can convince the office

00:30:45.267 --> 00:30:46.767
to bring in breakfast,
and lunch, and dinner,

00:30:46.767 --> 00:30:48.133
so you don't have to worry
about making food,

00:30:48.133 --> 00:30:50.334
and you can remove
all alternatives

00:30:50.334 --> 00:30:52.267
and everything else
you have to focus on,

00:30:52.267 --> 00:30:53.734
then you will keep yourself
motivated

00:30:53.734 --> 00:30:55.167
on what you're building.

00:30:55.167 --> 00:30:58.234
It's not going to be
a super popular one.

00:30:58.234 --> 00:30:59.801
It's not going to get
in a book anywhere,

00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:02.801
but it definitely works.

00:31:02.801 --> 00:31:05.234
man: Great, thank you for
taking the time to talk with us.

00:31:05.234 --> 00:31:07.934
Dodge: Motivation
is incredibly important

00:31:07.934 --> 00:31:09.467
in starting a company.

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:12.167
It is everything:
motivation and competition.

00:31:12.167 --> 00:31:14.501
If you remember, you know,
when you were kids,

00:31:14.501 --> 00:31:18.234
and you played sports,
team sports,

00:31:18.234 --> 00:31:20.701
and the adrenaline rush
that you get

00:31:20.701 --> 00:31:23.400
from a band of brothers
out there

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:28.267
trying to defeat the enemy,
and just practicing so hard

00:31:28.267 --> 00:31:30.968
and getting so committed
to doing something,

00:31:30.968 --> 00:31:34.300
and then the thrill of victory
when you actually win.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.434
Well, when you're adults,

00:31:36.434 --> 00:31:38.100
you don't have an opportunity
to do that.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.601
The sports are gone.

00:31:39.601 --> 00:31:43.133
And, for me, startups
are like adult sports.

00:31:43.133 --> 00:31:46.434
You build a team.
You go against the competition.

00:31:46.434 --> 00:31:49.267
You wake up every morning,
and you can't wait to get there

00:31:49.267 --> 00:31:51.434
and to beat the competition,

00:31:51.434 --> 00:31:53.501
and there's nothing else
like it.

00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:57.734
Once it's in your blood,
you can't get away from it.

00:31:57.734 --> 00:31:59.701
Question over here.

00:31:59.701 --> 00:32:01.133
man:
When you find a company

00:32:01.133 --> 00:32:02.834
that you're
looking to invest in,

00:32:02.834 --> 00:32:04.400
how do you come up
with a number

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.167
of what you think
that company is worth?

00:32:06.167 --> 00:32:10.434
Do you listen to the seller,
or do you come in with a number?

00:32:10.434 --> 00:32:14.100
And is it ten times sales,
one time sales,

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.567
valued on EBITDA?

00:32:17.567 --> 00:32:20.434
Kraus: It's obviously
heavily dependent upon stage.

00:32:20.434 --> 00:32:22.501
So, again, if you're investing
in a late stage company

00:32:22.501 --> 00:32:24.334
with serious
public comparables,

00:32:24.334 --> 00:32:26.501
it's a much easier
valuation exercise.

00:32:26.501 --> 00:32:28.567
You might value it on a multiple
of free cash flow.

00:32:28.567 --> 00:32:30.801
You might value it on
a multiple of EBITDA.

00:32:30.801 --> 00:32:33.300
You would value it
relative to those things,

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.968
relative to its growth rate.

00:32:34.968 --> 00:32:38.801
But most investing by VCs
is not that style of investing.

00:32:38.801 --> 00:32:41.767
Most investment by VCs
is investing

00:32:41.767 --> 00:32:46.400
at a much earlier stage with
much less perfect information.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.200
Actually, I think the, um...

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.801
it is,
in my opinion, at least,

00:32:52.801 --> 00:32:56.100
more art than science,
the valuation game,

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.467
and it is subject hugely
to human dynamics.

00:32:59.467 --> 00:33:01.968
So, like,
I'm a big poker player.

00:33:01.968 --> 00:33:05.567
I love playing poker,
and it's clear that, obviously,

00:33:05.567 --> 00:33:08.133
competitive dynamics
increase your valuation

00:33:08.133 --> 00:33:11.434
pretty dramatically.

00:33:11.434 --> 00:33:14.601
Sadly, I think most
venture investors

00:33:14.601 --> 00:33:19.834
are subject to a huge set
of herd behavior,

00:33:19.834 --> 00:33:23.834
and what I would call FOMO,
fear of missing out.

00:33:23.834 --> 00:33:30.767
So, I think, if you want to play
the game against the investor,

00:33:30.767 --> 00:33:33.167
you've got to realize
that investors have a,

00:33:33.167 --> 00:33:34.601
for some reason,

00:33:34.601 --> 00:33:39.033
a much greater fear
of missing out on a great deal

00:33:39.033 --> 00:33:41.467
than a worry about
striking out on a deal

00:33:41.467 --> 00:33:42.868
that they see
in front of them.

00:33:42.868 --> 00:33:44.767
And that's very
anti Warren Buffet.

00:33:44.767 --> 00:33:47.267
Warren Buffet's view is there's
no called strikes in investing,

00:33:47.267 --> 00:33:50.400
only hit pitches that you think
you can knock out of the park.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.534
But it's very hard in that kind
of a competitive environment

00:33:53.534 --> 00:33:55.567
for most investors
to stay true to that.

00:33:55.567 --> 00:33:59.067
So, and then the last thing
I would say

00:33:59.067 --> 00:34:02.767
is that oftentimes investors,
through--

00:34:02.767 --> 00:34:04.534
I don't know who's read,
"Predictably Irrational,"

00:34:04.534 --> 00:34:07.634
but the notion of
an anchor price,

00:34:07.634 --> 00:34:10.367
oftentimes, oddly,
conversations around valuations

00:34:10.367 --> 00:34:12.234
revolve around
what the entrepreneur said

00:34:12.234 --> 00:34:14.167
that they wanted
instead of an independent like,

00:34:14.167 --> 00:34:15.567
"What do we think it's worth?"

00:34:15.567 --> 00:34:18.167
And it takes discipline
inside the investing rooms

00:34:18.167 --> 00:34:20.701
to actually create some--

00:34:20.701 --> 00:34:22.567
to create a valuation
from scratch,

00:34:22.567 --> 00:34:25.300
without being anchored
by what the entrepreneur said.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.834
So, kind of flip that around.

00:34:26.834 --> 00:34:30.934
I would, if I were you,
I'd mention a price. The--

00:34:30.934 --> 00:34:34.300
Priebatsch: Definitely.
[laughter]

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.834
Kraus: The second thing is
just recognize the psychology

00:34:36.834 --> 00:34:38.734
and how competition
plays into it.

00:34:38.734 --> 00:34:40.467
Now, you've got to be careful
on the game

00:34:40.467 --> 00:34:42.467
in a sense that what
you don't over-optimize.

00:34:42.467 --> 00:34:44.200
If you find somebody
you really want to work with,

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.033
then it's really
not worth jerking around,

00:34:47.033 --> 00:34:49.067
because a 10% premium
relative to the chance

00:34:49.067 --> 00:34:50.567
of losing the person
that you think

00:34:50.567 --> 00:34:51.868
can make the difference
isn't worth it

00:34:51.868 --> 00:34:53.567
to the long-run
of the business.

00:34:53.567 --> 00:34:58.901
So, hopefully,
some of that was helpful.

00:34:58.901 --> 00:35:01.400
man: So, my friend
always asks me to,

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.000
like, come up
with a business plan,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.534
and he'll give it to
some of his investor friends

00:35:05.534 --> 00:35:07.400
and see
if anything would happen.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.601
But say you don't know
how to make a business plan

00:35:09.601 --> 00:35:12.968
and also that your idea
is kind of out there,

00:35:12.968 --> 00:35:15.200
and you don't really--
there's no really statistics

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.434
or numbers
to back your idea up.

00:35:17.434 --> 00:35:19.801
How would you go about
getting your idea funded

00:35:19.801 --> 00:35:22.834
without a business plan,
if it's possible?

00:35:22.834 --> 00:35:27.534
Buchheit: So, no company
that YC funds

00:35:27.534 --> 00:35:29.868
ever has a business plan.

00:35:29.868 --> 00:35:32.934
We basically--again,
the team is a big part of it,

00:35:32.934 --> 00:35:35.968
and then, you know,
just look at the idea.

00:35:35.968 --> 00:35:40.434
And, specifically, does the team
understand the idea?

00:35:40.434 --> 00:35:43.834
But at an early stage
for kind of high-tech startups,

00:35:43.834 --> 00:35:46.267
there usually aren't really any
numbers that you can look at.

00:35:46.267 --> 00:35:49.367
You can't say this is going
to be our revenue in year five.

00:35:49.367 --> 00:35:51.300
When people do that,
it's all fiction.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.467
And some people do that

00:35:52.467 --> 00:35:54.300
because they think
it's an obligation,

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.634
but when you look at it,
there's--

00:35:56.634 --> 00:35:59.000
no one could've ever predicted
like what Google's revenue

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.434
was going to be at,
like, whatever year, right?

00:36:02.434 --> 00:36:05.334
So, that kind of--any time
spent on that sort of thing,

00:36:05.334 --> 00:36:07.300
you know, that makes sense
for a sandwich shop

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.534
or something like that,

00:36:08.534 --> 00:36:10.067
where the business
is kind of predictable.

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:12.634
If you're starting
some Facebook or something,

00:36:12.634 --> 00:36:15.100
you're not--there's no way
you can predict

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.534
any of those numbers.

00:36:16.534 --> 00:36:22.267
And so we ultimately just invest
in people at an early stage,

00:36:22.267 --> 00:36:23.968
which isn't to say
that the idea doesn't matter.

00:36:23.968 --> 00:36:25.133
Because if someone
comes to you

00:36:25.133 --> 00:36:27.100
with an idea that seems
really, really bad,

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.200
that kind of reflects
on the person.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.300
Or it might just be
a really brilliant idea,

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.267
which is always the intriguing
thing with bad ideas

00:36:35.267 --> 00:36:37.400
is that they're either bad
or brilliant,

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.267
and that's where you
want to talk to the team

00:36:39.267 --> 00:36:41.234
and find out
have they thought through

00:36:41.234 --> 00:36:42.501
any kind of the obvious flaws?

00:36:42.501 --> 00:36:44.100
If you ask them,
well, what about--

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.133
If your plan is to like
give away free gold bars,

00:36:46.133 --> 00:36:47.701
you say, like,
"Where do you get the money

00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:48.767
to get the free gold bars?"

00:36:48.767 --> 00:36:50.601
They think,
"Oh, I didn't get that."

00:36:50.601 --> 00:36:53.234
You know, that would be
a bad sign. [laughter]

00:36:53.234 --> 00:36:56.167
But, you know, maybe they have
a machine that makes gold.

00:36:56.167 --> 00:36:59.968
And you're like,
"Okay, this we can work with."

00:36:59.968 --> 00:37:01.968
So, it really,
at the early stage,

00:37:01.968 --> 00:37:04.901
you don't worry
about business plans.

00:37:04.901 --> 00:37:06.367
Just build a product.

00:37:06.367 --> 00:37:07.767
That's really
the most compelling thing

00:37:07.767 --> 00:37:09.300
is if you can
actually demonstrate

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.634
that you have something
that is useful

00:37:10.634 --> 00:37:11.934
and that people like.

00:37:11.934 --> 00:37:13.334
So, don't spend any time
on that.

00:37:13.334 --> 00:37:16.234
Just build something.
Get users.

00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:18.434
Get traction,
if that's possible,

00:37:18.434 --> 00:37:21.634
and that will make you
stand out.

00:37:21.634 --> 00:37:23.267
Priebatsch:
To jump in on that,

00:37:23.267 --> 00:37:26.501
we wrote a business plan for
the business plan competition

00:37:26.501 --> 00:37:28.868
and never used it again.

00:37:28.868 --> 00:37:30.234
Highland never asked for it.

00:37:30.234 --> 00:37:31.400
Google Ventures
never asked for it.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.667
Balderton
never asked for it.

00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:35.100
I still have it,
and it's really good-looking

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.634
and sounds super professional.
It's totally wrong. [laughter]

00:37:38.634 --> 00:37:40.801
But, you know, I would say
you should never write

00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:43.300
a business plan except for
a business plan competition,

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.501
because winning those
is useful,

00:37:45.501 --> 00:37:48.000
but they're the only ones
who really care.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.667
Dodge:
Good, over here.

00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:53.934
man: Hi, I'm interested in the
field of intellectual property.

00:37:53.934 --> 00:37:56.334
What's your view of funding?

00:37:56.334 --> 00:38:02.000
I mean, the part of intellectual
property patents,

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.300
trademarks,
all this stuff.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.834
Should I walk into it?

00:38:05.834 --> 00:38:13.934
Do you consider it as a plus,
considering funding?

00:38:13.934 --> 00:38:15.934
Kraus: You know, there's
differing views on this.

00:38:15.934 --> 00:38:19.467
My own personal view is no.
Here's why.

00:38:19.467 --> 00:38:22.234
I think that it's really
only valuable to any company

00:38:22.234 --> 00:38:25.133
that would acquire you,
because small companies

00:38:25.133 --> 00:38:27.267
have no ability
to prosecute their patents.

00:38:27.267 --> 00:38:31.400
Most of the time, you're walking
in with patent applications,

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.801
and you've got multi years
before it grants.

00:38:33.801 --> 00:38:35.400
You don't even know
if the company

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.367
is going to survive
to that stage.

00:38:37.367 --> 00:38:39.968
And then, lastly, most patents
aren't actually foundational

00:38:39.968 --> 00:38:42.400
or fundamental in some way.
They're incremental,

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.734
and so they're usually used
for defense more than offense.

00:38:44.734 --> 00:38:47.100
Somebody sues you.
You basically countersue.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.634
You've got kind of
competing claims.

00:38:48.634 --> 00:38:50.467
You do a free
cross license.

00:38:50.467 --> 00:38:54.801
They're rarely used
to effectively--

00:38:54.801 --> 00:38:57.467
they're rarely used to affect
the outcomes of competitors

00:38:57.467 --> 00:38:59.167
or other companies
as a startup.

00:38:59.167 --> 00:39:01.667
Now, Google, Facebook,
Microsoft,

00:39:01.667 --> 00:39:03.567
somebody big buys you,

00:39:03.567 --> 00:39:05.400
and you have something
foundational,

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.734
that will improve
your valuation,

00:39:07.734 --> 00:39:09.567
but I think the chances,
for the most part,

00:39:09.567 --> 00:39:11.200
are slim
relative to the ability

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.501
of actually making
a business of substance.

00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:17.534
So, it's not a high focus.

00:39:17.534 --> 00:39:20.234
There's certain areas
where it is more of a focus,

00:39:20.234 --> 00:39:21.901
but in kind of traditional,

00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:26.634
certainly in kind of consumer
internet businesses, no.

00:39:26.634 --> 00:39:27.934
Dodge:
Over here.

00:39:27.934 --> 00:39:29.534
man: My question is,
especially for Paul and Joe,

00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:32.000
I'm the founder of a small
enterprise software company.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.534
We have a lot of traction
in a small niche,

00:39:34.534 --> 00:39:36.067
and we are going after
a very large market

00:39:36.067 --> 00:39:37.601
that's growing really fast.

00:39:37.601 --> 00:39:39.100
When you look at a company
like that,

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.434
what are some things
that turn you on,

00:39:40.434 --> 00:39:46.067
and what are some things
that turn you off?

00:39:46.067 --> 00:39:48.267
Buchheit: Well, at the stage
that I invest

00:39:48.267 --> 00:39:51.467
is usually like
the very early stage,

00:39:51.467 --> 00:39:53.634
and so, again,
it comes down to the team.

00:39:53.634 --> 00:39:55.467
And if the team
believes in the idea

00:39:55.467 --> 00:39:58.267
and the team seems good,
we just go with it.

00:39:58.267 --> 00:40:00.667
Because the assumption is
you know better than we do.

00:40:00.667 --> 00:40:06.901
That said, enterprise sales
is notoriously difficult,

00:40:06.901 --> 00:40:09.234
but I think the question
you're asking

00:40:09.234 --> 00:40:12.167
might be a little later stage
and more to Joe's.

00:40:12.167 --> 00:40:16.434
Kraus: It's tough,
at that level of pitch,

00:40:16.434 --> 00:40:20.467
it's hard to give you
kind of specific advice,

00:40:20.467 --> 00:40:22.767
but my sense is where
I would quickly dive in,

00:40:22.767 --> 00:40:25.601
in that conversation, is just,
one, I'd want to understand

00:40:25.601 --> 00:40:27.934
the dynamics of the market
you're selling into today.

00:40:27.934 --> 00:40:29.167
How are you selling
into it?

00:40:29.167 --> 00:40:30.968
Is it direct sales?
Is it indirect?

00:40:30.968 --> 00:40:32.667
Is it over the phone?
Is it field sales?

00:40:32.667 --> 00:40:34.267
How do you compensate
those people?

00:40:34.267 --> 00:40:36.801
What's the title of the people
that you're selling to?

00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:37.834
And then I would want
to understand,

00:40:37.834 --> 00:40:39.734
is that pattern
relevant to the pattern

00:40:39.734 --> 00:40:43.167
into this larger market,
or is it a new pattern?

00:40:43.167 --> 00:40:45.234
And I would want to
also understand,

00:40:45.234 --> 00:40:46.734
is this going to require
a heavy lift

00:40:46.734 --> 00:40:48.434
with regard to
upgrading the team?

00:40:48.434 --> 00:40:50.167
So, suddenly, the people
that were really good

00:40:50.167 --> 00:40:52.400
at this niche market,
are they the right people,

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.000
or are we going to have to hire
a bunch of new people

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.534
to attack
this bigger market?

00:40:55.534 --> 00:40:56.968
So, that would be
the line of questioning

00:40:56.968 --> 00:40:58.267
that I would start
going down

00:40:58.267 --> 00:41:02.300
at the level of detail
that you've given me.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.968
man: Hi, I have
a two-part question.

00:41:04.968 --> 00:41:06.501
It seems like the team
is very important,

00:41:06.501 --> 00:41:08.634
and it also seems like a lot
of these cool app engine,

00:41:08.634 --> 00:41:10.434
where the hardware has become
less important,

00:41:10.434 --> 00:41:12.968
and it seems like startups
are actually getting cheaper

00:41:12.968 --> 00:41:15.868
to start, at this point,
easier to take a risk.

00:41:15.868 --> 00:41:19.000
So, I'd like your views
on outsourcing, basically,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.868
you know, now that we don't have
to pay the money on hardware,

00:41:20.868 --> 00:41:23.567
I'd rather invest
in local talent

00:41:23.567 --> 00:41:24.801
and keep the team together.

00:41:24.801 --> 00:41:26.467
And I'm just wondering
how you guys feel

00:41:26.467 --> 00:41:29.601
about the cost of startups
and how outsourcing affects that

00:41:29.601 --> 00:41:32.033
or shouldn't affect it.

00:41:32.033 --> 00:41:33.634
Buchheit:
Outsourcing of what?

00:41:33.634 --> 00:41:35.601
man: Coding,
in particular.

00:41:35.601 --> 00:41:37.601
Buchheit: Well, I mean,
if you're a technology company,

00:41:37.601 --> 00:41:40.601
you outsource the coding,
you're basically outsourcing

00:41:40.601 --> 00:41:43.501
the thing that you do
to a large extent.

00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:45.000
Kraus: Gold bar machine.
Buchheit: Yeah.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.200
man: But you see a lot where
the CTO will be someone local,

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.501
and then they'll outsource
their dirty work,

00:41:51.501 --> 00:41:54.501
and I don't agree with that.
I'm just wondering.

00:41:54.501 --> 00:41:57.300
Buchheit: No, I mean,
it's not like an ethical thing.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.667
It's just that
sometimes that works,

00:41:59.667 --> 00:42:03.033
but I haven't really seen
a lot of examples of that.

00:42:03.033 --> 00:42:05.901
I've seen a lot of people try,
and it can sometimes work

00:42:05.901 --> 00:42:09.267
if you're really on the ball,
but the fact is

00:42:09.267 --> 00:42:12.501
that it's very hard to get
really top quality developers,

00:42:12.501 --> 00:42:15.100
even when you're carefully
screening them.

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.901
You go through a long
interview process.

00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:19.801
You're managing them
locally.

00:42:19.801 --> 00:42:23.100
When you're just picking up
people off of a website,

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.167
I think the quality
that you're going to get

00:42:25.167 --> 00:42:26.868
just isn't as high.

00:42:26.868 --> 00:42:29.100
Now, if the actual technology
that you're building

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.334
is something very basic, and
that's not at all fundamental,

00:42:32.334 --> 00:42:34.901
you just need to customize
your WordPress template

00:42:34.901 --> 00:42:36.801
or something, yeah,
I think that can work fine.

00:42:36.801 --> 00:42:39.701
But if you're
building something

00:42:39.701 --> 00:42:41.467
where technology is
a core part of the business,

00:42:41.467 --> 00:42:43.734
I think that you're going
to run into a lot of trouble.

00:42:43.734 --> 00:42:45.033
Kraus:
As a general rule,

00:42:45.033 --> 00:42:48.234
I don't like it at all
at early stage.

00:42:48.234 --> 00:42:49.834
There are always
exceptions to the rule.

00:42:49.834 --> 00:42:51.834
In particular,
if this entrepreneur

00:42:51.834 --> 00:42:54.701
has a long-standing
previous working relationship

00:42:54.701 --> 00:42:56.534
with this group
that happens to be offshore

00:42:56.534 --> 00:42:58.501
and they've developed
multiple products together,

00:42:58.501 --> 00:43:00.767
really, the thing you're
dealing with in early stages

00:43:00.767 --> 00:43:03.067
is you want a mind meld
between the team,

00:43:03.067 --> 00:43:04.734
and you want
very high bandwidth,

00:43:04.734 --> 00:43:07.067
low latency communications
between the team.

00:43:07.067 --> 00:43:11.000
That is just hard to achieve
telephonically or over VC

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.334
or any of these things

00:43:12.334 --> 00:43:14.267
where you've just got
time and distance

00:43:14.267 --> 00:43:16.934
that no matter how good
the technology may be today,

00:43:16.934 --> 00:43:18.567
it is really, really hard

00:43:18.567 --> 00:43:21.601
to get that kind of
communication going.

00:43:21.601 --> 00:43:23.434
So, again, the only exception
I will see

00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:25.567
is somebody's worked
with this team for ten years

00:43:25.567 --> 00:43:27.267
and they've developed
multiple products together.

00:43:27.267 --> 00:43:29.501
Then I'd consider it;
otherwise, I'd just--

00:43:29.501 --> 00:43:31.667
I wouldn't do it at all.

00:43:31.667 --> 00:43:33.167
Buchheit: Yeah, to add
to that point, actually,

00:43:33.167 --> 00:43:34.434
of the team being together...
you know, at Google,

00:43:34.434 --> 00:43:37.234
if something
became really important,

00:43:37.234 --> 00:43:39.501
we would actually put
all the people in the same room,

00:43:39.501 --> 00:43:43.100
because actually having people
be in separate rooms,

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.667
it turned out to be a huge
disadvantage in communication,

00:43:45.667 --> 00:43:48.567
and that's because they're
like 20 feet apart.

00:43:48.567 --> 00:43:50.567
Right, if you put them on
the opposite side of the planet,

00:43:50.567 --> 00:43:51.968
it's a whole other game,
right?

00:43:51.968 --> 00:43:53.501
There's latency
with time zone.

00:43:53.501 --> 00:43:56.567
It just mucks up
the whole communication.

00:43:56.567 --> 00:43:58.567
man:
I agree. Thanks.

00:43:58.567 --> 00:44:00.701
man: This is a little
orthogonal perhaps,

00:44:00.701 --> 00:44:03.434
but I'd be very interested
to hear from each of you

00:44:03.434 --> 00:44:06.167
that aside from
your own companies,

00:44:06.167 --> 00:44:08.400
who do you think
are the really hot startups

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:14.434
to be working for today?

00:44:14.434 --> 00:44:16.000
[laughter]

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.968
Dodge: You're talking
to people who start companies.

00:44:17.968 --> 00:44:19.701
They don't work
for other people. [laughter]

00:44:19.701 --> 00:44:21.234
They aren't
going to do that.

00:44:21.234 --> 00:44:22.734
man: I guess I'm saying the ones
that look like they have,

00:44:22.734 --> 00:44:27.334
you know, big potential
or really solid or...

00:44:27.334 --> 00:44:29.300
lotta buzz.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.200
Priebatsch:
So, to throw in the plug,

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.434
if you weren't going to apply
to Scavenger,

00:44:33.434 --> 00:44:38.701
jobs at Scavenger.com,
then I think the companies

00:44:38.701 --> 00:44:40.234
that are real interesting
are probably the ones

00:44:40.234 --> 00:44:42.968
you hear about a lot,
but companies like Square

00:44:42.968 --> 00:44:45.367
that are doing things
in mobile payments.

00:44:45.367 --> 00:44:47.234
We're a location-based
company.

00:44:47.234 --> 00:44:49.133
I think that mobile payments
are going to be

00:44:49.133 --> 00:44:51.868
one of the things
that tie social

00:44:51.868 --> 00:44:54.701
to making it actually work
in offline commerce,

00:44:54.701 --> 00:44:57.501
and so any company
in that space--

00:44:57.501 --> 00:44:58.667
and Square is sort of
a leader there--

00:44:58.667 --> 00:45:00.267
I think would be fascinating.

00:45:00.267 --> 00:45:01.868
I don't know if you guys
have any others.

00:45:01.868 --> 00:45:03.567
Kraus: You know,
it's funny.

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.767
So, thank you, Seth,
for giving me

00:45:05.767 --> 00:45:09.033
like 30 seconds to think.
[laughter]

00:45:09.033 --> 00:45:10.167
Because, again, as a VC,

00:45:10.167 --> 00:45:12.067
you're spending
most of your time

00:45:12.067 --> 00:45:14.434
selecting what you hope
are the best companies

00:45:14.434 --> 00:45:16.834
and then trying to assist them
to make them successful.

00:45:16.834 --> 00:45:18.634
So, mentioning something
outside the portfolio

00:45:18.634 --> 00:45:22.100
actually takes a lot of
like synapses firing.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.234
But there's a company downstairs
that I admire from afar.

00:45:25.234 --> 00:45:29.634
They've raised their money.
It's a mobile gaming company.

00:45:29.634 --> 00:45:31.734
I do some gaming investing.
And it's called Pocket Gems,

00:45:31.734 --> 00:45:33.567
and I just think
they're on fire.

00:45:33.567 --> 00:45:37.601
I think they're great, and
that category monetizes well.

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:39.734
So, that's a company
that I happen to like.

00:45:39.734 --> 00:45:41.601
I don't know whether anybody
has ever heard of them,

00:45:41.601 --> 00:45:44.667
but they're
quite successful.

00:45:44.667 --> 00:45:47.534
Dodge: So, I think anything
to do with mobile,

00:45:47.534 --> 00:45:52.701
location, social, or games,
those four things--

00:45:52.701 --> 00:45:53.767
Kraus:
I get that pitch a lot.

00:45:53.767 --> 00:45:54.734
Dodge: If you can think
of something--

00:45:54.734 --> 00:45:55.734
Kraus:
That's the first slide:

00:45:55.734 --> 00:45:57.734
mobile, social,
gaming, location.

00:45:57.734 --> 00:45:59.200
Dodge: Yeah, so if you can
come up with an idea

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.400
that integrates mobile, social,
and games, go for it.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.467
Seth:
And colors.

00:46:03.467 --> 00:46:07.100
Dodge: Colors,
yeah, that, too.

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:09.434
Okay,
another question?

00:46:09.434 --> 00:46:11.868
man: Unless the last panelist
had any ideas.

00:46:11.868 --> 00:46:14.067
Buchheit: Yeah, I mean,
I could name off

00:46:14.067 --> 00:46:15.834
the obvious companies,
depending on what stage.

00:46:15.834 --> 00:46:18.601
You've got Facebook,
and Twitter, and Foursquare.

00:46:18.601 --> 00:46:22.801
All these are all obviously
hot companies.

00:46:22.801 --> 00:46:25.133
But if you want earlier
stage things, you know,

00:46:25.133 --> 00:46:26.868
I actually don't spend
that much time

00:46:26.868 --> 00:46:28.868
thinking about the early stage
companies that aren't YC.

00:46:28.868 --> 00:46:30.868
I mentioned Dropbox earlier.

00:46:30.868 --> 00:46:32.234
I think they're
going to be huge,

00:46:32.234 --> 00:46:35.067
as well as quite a few
of our other companies,

00:46:35.067 --> 00:46:36.968
but I don't have
any great examples

00:46:36.968 --> 00:46:40.434
that come to mind for you,
unfortunately.

00:46:40.434 --> 00:46:42.334
man: Okay, I have someone
who views himself

00:46:42.334 --> 00:46:43.567
as a young entrepreneur

00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:46.567
and has many, many ideas
every week at least.

00:46:46.567 --> 00:46:49.267
What are some tips
that you guys have for, like,

00:46:49.267 --> 00:46:54.067
self-regulating your ideas
and junking the ones that--

00:46:54.067 --> 00:46:56.701
because often
I'll be very idealistic

00:46:56.701 --> 00:46:58.434
and optimistic about things,

00:46:58.434 --> 00:47:00.701
just because I'm in the moment
of thinking about the idea.

00:47:00.701 --> 00:47:02.801
So, what are some tips
about weeding out

00:47:02.801 --> 00:47:05.701
just completely
obviously bad ones?

00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:08.300
Dodge: I can answer this one,
at least first,

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.934
because people come to me
all the time

00:47:09.934 --> 00:47:12.267
and ask me
exactly that question.

00:47:12.267 --> 00:47:15.868
And I tell them
it's sort of like

00:47:15.868 --> 00:47:18.067
if it's the only thing
you can think of,

00:47:18.067 --> 00:47:19.534
if you wake up
every morning,

00:47:19.534 --> 00:47:21.868
and that's all
you can think about,

00:47:21.868 --> 00:47:23.300
then that's the one
to go with.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.667
If you have ten ideas,

00:47:24.667 --> 00:47:28.100
and you think they're
all kind of pretty good,

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.801
but not sure,
or I'm not going to leave

00:47:30.801 --> 00:47:33.734
my existing job to go do this,
forget it.

00:47:33.734 --> 00:47:35.334
Don't do it.

00:47:35.334 --> 00:47:40.100
It's got to be an idea that you
just cannot stop thinking about,

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.968
and you have to do it.

00:47:41.968 --> 00:47:44.434
When you have that feeling,
that's the one.

00:47:44.434 --> 00:47:46.434
Kraus: I would actually
argue with this.

00:47:46.434 --> 00:47:48.167
I don't mean
to sound rude.

00:47:48.167 --> 00:47:50.400
The profile of the personality
you're talking about

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:57.334
that you have is not complete
as a successful entrepreneur.

00:47:57.334 --> 00:47:59.300
It's not the idea factory.

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:01.734
It's pairing yourself
with somebody

00:48:01.734 --> 00:48:04.033
that's really good at focusing,
and getting a cofounder

00:48:04.033 --> 00:48:08.934
is incredibly important
for your personality type.

00:48:08.934 --> 00:48:11.601
Most of the people that I know
that are idea factories

00:48:11.601 --> 00:48:13.300
are not the guys
that are great at starting

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.968
and executing on companies,

00:48:14.968 --> 00:48:18.767
because they can't stay focused
on making an idea happen.

00:48:18.767 --> 00:48:22.100
And, again, persistence
is one of those key things

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.467
that makes entrepreneurs
successful.

00:48:24.467 --> 00:48:27.200
Because, look, startups
go through deserts,

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.300
big deserts, where nothing feels
repeatable and easy,

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.734
and like maybe you're getting
a little bit of sales,

00:48:32.734 --> 00:48:35.701
but it doesn't feel like you've
figured out the real formula.

00:48:35.701 --> 00:48:37.567
Well, an idea person,
like yourself,

00:48:37.567 --> 00:48:40.234
immediately jumps to what
other ideas might we do?

00:48:40.234 --> 00:48:42.267
And sometimes that's good,
but most of the time,

00:48:42.267 --> 00:48:43.767
it's actually bad.

00:48:43.767 --> 00:48:46.667
Most of the time,
persistence does carry the day

00:48:46.667 --> 00:48:50.434
with a combination of exploring,
and it's that balance

00:48:50.434 --> 00:48:53.601
that is really important
and the art of it.

00:48:53.601 --> 00:48:56.300
And so, I would say to you
get a cofounder

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.767
that's different than you

00:48:57.767 --> 00:49:01.234
that can help kind of shape
and pare down those ideas

00:49:01.234 --> 00:49:03.767
and kind of camp down
the factory.

00:49:03.767 --> 00:49:05.200
man: Yeah, yeah,
thank you very much.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.334
That's excellent.

00:49:07.334 --> 00:49:10.734
man: Just wondering, how do
you guys see about health,

00:49:10.734 --> 00:49:14.033
just your own health
in terms of doing startups?

00:49:14.033 --> 00:49:16.601
Do you sacrifice
your health to like--

00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:18.467
Kraus: Yeah!
No, this is a huge deal.

00:49:18.467 --> 00:49:20.234
I mean, I don't mean to
jump into it already,

00:49:20.234 --> 00:49:21.734
but I'll tell
a personal story,

00:49:21.734 --> 00:49:26.033
and I tell this
only because it, um...

00:49:26.033 --> 00:49:30.100
I regret it.

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.701
I was a competitive skier
in college.

00:49:31.701 --> 00:49:34.434
I had a huge ski accident,
fell 300 feet down a chute

00:49:34.434 --> 00:49:36.167
through rocks
and was lucky to be alive.

00:49:36.167 --> 00:49:37.934
And I blew up my knee

00:49:37.934 --> 00:49:41.334
and I had reconstructive
knee surgery,

00:49:41.334 --> 00:49:44.434
and I had the surgery
a week before

00:49:44.434 --> 00:49:48.667
we started pitching JotSpot
on our VC roadshow.

00:49:48.667 --> 00:49:50.601
Essentially, we were
going to the roadshow.

00:49:50.601 --> 00:49:53.767
And instead of delaying it,
I did all the pitches,

00:49:53.767 --> 00:49:57.067
and we got the company going,
and we kind of went,

00:49:57.067 --> 00:50:00.067
and I put all of my health stuff
on hold.

00:50:00.067 --> 00:50:02.734
It took me seven years,
as a result,

00:50:02.734 --> 00:50:05.267
to recover from this fully.

00:50:05.267 --> 00:50:07.767
And so I've made a commitment,
like, never again

00:50:07.767 --> 00:50:09.501
am I doing that,
and it's really tough,

00:50:09.501 --> 00:50:16.133
because, for me, what motivates
me is my commitment to my team,

00:50:16.133 --> 00:50:17.801
when I'm doing these startups.

00:50:17.801 --> 00:50:20.667
And so I did the thing
I shouldn't have done.

00:50:20.667 --> 00:50:23.634
I kind of sacrificed
my own health

00:50:23.634 --> 00:50:26.567
in that particular case,
because I felt so obligated

00:50:26.567 --> 00:50:32.000
to show up for the team,
and that was just a bad choice.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.434
Buchheit:
Yeah, I agree.

00:50:33.434 --> 00:50:37.133
I think it's a very
short-term optimization

00:50:37.133 --> 00:50:39.901
to sacrifice your health,
because you have to recognize

00:50:39.901 --> 00:50:42.567
all of your abilities,
your mental capacity,

00:50:42.567 --> 00:50:45.534
your emotional capacity
to handle things

00:50:45.534 --> 00:50:47.200
is going to come
from your health.

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.501
So, if you're extremely
unhealthy,

00:50:49.501 --> 00:50:51.801
I don't think you're
going to be able to persevere,

00:50:51.801 --> 00:50:53.133
which as Joe pointed out,

00:50:53.133 --> 00:50:55.033
it's like kind of
the key thing you need to do.

00:50:55.033 --> 00:50:56.701
Are you going to be able to
make it through that desert,

00:50:56.701 --> 00:50:59.467
if you're half dead?

00:50:59.467 --> 00:51:01.501
And it's bad for the team too,
I think, because then

00:51:01.501 --> 00:51:03.234
you're setting a bad example
for everyone else,

00:51:03.234 --> 00:51:04.934
where you're kind of
implicitly telling them

00:51:04.934 --> 00:51:07.934
that they should be also
sacrificing their health, right?

00:51:07.934 --> 00:51:11.701
So, one of the few
pieces of advice

00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:13.934
we give the YC companies
for the summer is basically--

00:51:13.934 --> 00:51:15.334
not few pieces of advice--

00:51:15.334 --> 00:51:16.868
few activities
they're allowed to do.

00:51:16.868 --> 00:51:20.901
It's like you can spend
all your time working.

00:51:20.901 --> 00:51:22.367
I forget
what the other thing is.

00:51:22.367 --> 00:51:25.067
And then go outside,
get exercise, basically.

00:51:25.067 --> 00:51:27.200
It's crucial, I think.

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.868
If you're indoors
the whole time,

00:51:28.868 --> 00:51:32.167
you're just going to go insane
and feel terrible.

00:51:32.167 --> 00:51:33.434
Priebatsch:
Yeah, I buy into

00:51:33.434 --> 00:51:35.100
the physical activity thing
a ton.

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.300
I would recommend,
if you're doing a startup,

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.534
put yourself
on a running regimen,

00:51:38.534 --> 00:51:41.467
or swimming, or biking,
or whatever,

00:51:41.467 --> 00:51:43.000
partially to stay healthy,
but partially because

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.501
physical activity
is an awesome time

00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:47.133
to be thinking about things
or not thinking about anything

00:51:47.133 --> 00:51:48.667
and letting your mind reset,

00:51:48.667 --> 00:51:51.868
but also expanding
that to your team.

00:51:51.868 --> 00:51:54.467
At Scavenger,
we have team hikes.

00:51:54.467 --> 00:51:57.734
We're doing a 200-mile
running race next weekend

00:51:57.734 --> 00:51:59.801
with six of us, where we're all
hopping in a van,

00:51:59.801 --> 00:52:02.467
and you sort of relay
from a mountain to the beach,

00:52:02.467 --> 00:52:04.100
200 miles in 24 hours.

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.400
And if you can keep the entire
team active and healthy--

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.767
it's no surprise
there's a lot of data out there

00:52:09.767 --> 00:52:11.100
to show that people
who are active and healthy

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.067
are happier
and more productive.

00:52:13.067 --> 00:52:15.367
And you want people
to be healthy,

00:52:15.367 --> 00:52:17.167
you want them to be
focused and dedicated,

00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:19.467
but definitely healthy,
and physical activity

00:52:19.467 --> 00:52:26.133
is a great way
to help make that happen.

00:52:26.133 --> 00:52:28.667
man: Well, two good friends
of mine in college,

00:52:28.667 --> 00:52:33.100
we created a product line
for Next Gen Disc Golfing

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:36.234
accessories,
and we actually won first place

00:52:36.234 --> 00:52:37.901
in the business
concept contest.

00:52:37.901 --> 00:52:40.367
So, my question is
who should we talk to

00:52:40.367 --> 00:52:41.801
to get funding?

00:52:41.801 --> 00:52:46.000
Like, what are
good companies to--

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.200
[laughter]
Like you.

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.100
Like, who are good people
to talk to?

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:50.501
I mean, we're trying
to get funding

00:52:50.501 --> 00:52:52.234
to take it to the next step,
manufacturing,

00:52:52.234 --> 00:52:55.133
prototyping, shipping,
all that.

00:52:55.133 --> 00:52:56.767
Kraus: One of the things
you'll find,

00:52:56.767 --> 00:53:01.167
at least at the firm level,
is firms like to invest--

00:53:01.167 --> 00:53:03.734
it's the old adage, like,
invest in what you know.

00:53:03.734 --> 00:53:06.334
And so if you look through
all these funds,

00:53:06.334 --> 00:53:10.334
all the angels, most of them
have big portfolio pages.

00:53:10.334 --> 00:53:13.000
I would spend some time
looking through and seeing

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.400
if you see anything that at
least is approximately similar.

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.567
Like, for example,
Google Ventures has nothing

00:53:18.567 --> 00:53:21.567
in something that involves
retail sales

00:53:21.567 --> 00:53:25.033
or something that involves,
broadly speaking,

00:53:25.033 --> 00:53:26.767
something nontechnical.

00:53:26.767 --> 00:53:29.200
We're probably not a good fit
in that particular case,

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.467
because you're going to be
swimming heavily uphill,

00:53:31.467 --> 00:53:35.234
and VCs, like it or not,
are pattern matchers,

00:53:35.234 --> 00:53:37.300
based upon the limited
amount of time they have,

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.000
and, like, is this a pattern
that feels familiar

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.801
and where I can apply learnings
from one experience

00:53:41.801 --> 00:53:44.934
to another to help accelerate
the progress of the company?

00:53:44.934 --> 00:53:47.467
And so, for me, if I were you,
I would basically spend time

00:53:47.467 --> 00:53:49.000
looking through
the portfolio pages

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.601
of a lot of different funders,
and narrow it down

00:53:51.601 --> 00:53:53.701
to approaching those
that basically have something

00:53:53.701 --> 00:53:56.334
that's analogous
in some way.

00:53:56.334 --> 00:53:57.567
Buchheit: The other thing
you might try

00:53:57.567 --> 00:53:59.267
is just building the business
on your own.

00:53:59.267 --> 00:54:02.267
I mean, I don't know too much
about the disc golf space,

00:54:02.267 --> 00:54:04.934
but I can imagine it would be
a lot easier to raise funding,

00:54:04.934 --> 00:54:08.801
if you already had
an established online business

00:54:08.801 --> 00:54:11.200
where you've demonstrated
just running it

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:12.667
out of your apartment
or something,

00:54:12.667 --> 00:54:14.267
that you have a market.

00:54:14.267 --> 00:54:16.701
man: Yeah, we've made
a prototype of the backpack.

00:54:16.701 --> 00:54:18.234
We've taken that
to market and stuff,

00:54:18.234 --> 00:54:21.868
and we've estimated
about 50 grand to complete

00:54:21.868 --> 00:54:24.667
the first thousand backpacks
after shipment.

00:54:24.667 --> 00:54:27.133
I mean, we can't
really do that on our own.

00:54:27.133 --> 00:54:28.767
Kraus: This is actually,
this is--

00:54:28.767 --> 00:54:30.167
Buchheit: Well, 50 grand,
you might be able to do it

00:54:30.167 --> 00:54:32.000
with friends and whatnot,
right?

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.367
man: Ah, not in college.
[laughter]

00:54:33.367 --> 00:54:34.734
Kraus: Actually,
I would think

00:54:34.734 --> 00:54:36.968
there's a broader point in here,
which I feel like is--

00:54:36.968 --> 00:54:39.167
oftentimes, we get pitches
for businesses

00:54:39.167 --> 00:54:41.200
that are interesting
lifestyle businesses,

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.367
where I think it would make
a great lifestyle business

00:54:44.367 --> 00:54:46.634
but probably isn't
a venture-backed business,

00:54:46.634 --> 00:54:48.701
where a venture-backed business,
again,

00:54:48.701 --> 00:54:51.367
you're going to want to see
a return on your money

00:54:51.367 --> 00:54:54.200
and a high likelihood that
there's a multitude of buyers

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.968
in almost every stage
of the company.

00:54:55.968 --> 00:54:57.567
man:
We know there is.

00:54:57.567 --> 00:55:01.767
Kraus: But the thing is,
you know, the question is--

00:55:01.767 --> 00:55:03.501
you also always have to believe
that the business

00:55:03.501 --> 00:55:05.701
has a chance of being huge,
and so a lot of times,

00:55:05.701 --> 00:55:07.467
we run into companies
that would be--

00:55:07.467 --> 00:55:10.567
are great businesses
if the person's motivation

00:55:10.567 --> 00:55:13.934
wasn't getting on the front page
of "Tech Crunch,"

00:55:13.934 --> 00:55:15.200
and instead,
the motivation was

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.734
I want to draw as large
a salary as I possibly can

00:55:17.734 --> 00:55:20.734
and just have a business
that throws off a ton of cash,

00:55:20.734 --> 00:55:23.634
but I don't need to be
on the cover of "Tech Crunch."

00:55:23.634 --> 00:55:26.200
I just want to have
a great business.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:31.133
And so it's, oftentimes,
there's some counseling around.

00:55:31.133 --> 00:55:32.534
Like, look,
I like your business,

00:55:32.534 --> 00:55:34.033
just not the right one
to invest in,

00:55:34.033 --> 00:55:35.467
but make it a great
lifestyle business,

00:55:35.467 --> 00:55:37.601
and I think you'll be generating
a bunch of cash.

00:55:37.601 --> 00:55:39.434
Dodge: Okay, so we have
five minutes left.

00:55:39.434 --> 00:55:41.400
So, we're going into
lightning round now.

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:43.767
That means the questions
are like 15 seconds,

00:55:43.767 --> 00:55:45.300
and the answers
are like 45 seconds.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.968
Kraus: How about
only one person answers?

00:55:46.968 --> 00:55:49.033
Dodge: Yeah, only one person
answers 45 seconds.

00:55:49.033 --> 00:55:51.067
Go.
man: Okay, so, Seth,

00:55:51.067 --> 00:55:52.567
you took money
from Highland Ventures,

00:55:52.567 --> 00:55:54.200
and you kind of closed
with saying

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.267
if you can take money
from a big venture fund,

00:55:56.267 --> 00:55:57.968
a couple of billion dollar fund,

00:55:57.968 --> 00:56:01.400
you're taking 250 or 500K from
a couple of billion dollar fund,

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.701
that's a good way to go.

00:56:02.701 --> 00:56:04.000
But there's a whole
other side to this,

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.100
where if you're putting
yourself in a position

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:08.334
where if Highland
isn't interested

00:56:08.334 --> 00:56:10.200
or potentially
one partner at that firm

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.767
isn't interested
in doing a follow-on round,

00:56:11.767 --> 00:56:13.734
then it can kind of
kill your company.

00:56:13.734 --> 00:56:16.534
And so, like, Paul, you guys,
as I understand,

00:56:16.534 --> 00:56:19.968
have a policy where you don't
do follow-on rounds like that.

00:56:19.968 --> 00:56:21.501
If you guys don't mind
just talking about

00:56:21.501 --> 00:56:24.701
that other side
of that kind of investment.

00:56:24.701 --> 00:56:26.667
Buchheit: That's certainly
part of the reason we do that

00:56:26.667 --> 00:56:27.834
is because there is this issue,

00:56:27.834 --> 00:56:30.968
if you do get one round
from a VC

00:56:30.968 --> 00:56:32.501
and then they don't join
in the second round,

00:56:32.501 --> 00:56:35.300
that sends a pretty negative
signal to other VCs,

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.934
because, like, the people
who know you best

00:56:36.934 --> 00:56:38.534
don't want to invest.

00:56:38.534 --> 00:56:42.634
And so Y Combinator is we give
a small amount of money,

00:56:42.634 --> 00:56:46.200
but the real value
is actually the advice,

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.067
and connections, and network,
and everything else.

00:56:48.067 --> 00:56:49.634
And so, yeah,
as part of that,

00:56:49.634 --> 00:56:52.400
we don't have any
follow-on funding activity,

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.400
so that there is no
conflict of interest there.

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.567
There's no negative signal
that like,

00:56:56.567 --> 00:56:59.100
oh, we didn't choose
to join in on that round,

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:03.000
and we're able to help connect
people with the best VCs.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.434
Dodge:
Yeah, over here.

00:57:04.434 --> 00:57:06.133
man: This might help
the disc golf gentleman.

00:57:06.133 --> 00:57:09.100
But when do you know
to look for investors,

00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:11.167
and when do you know to throw
your idea on Kickstarter,

00:57:11.167 --> 00:57:17.300
and what are some pros
and cons of each?

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.968
Priebatsch: So, I'll jump in
on this one.

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:20.667
Start looking for an investor

00:57:20.667 --> 00:57:23.634
as soon as one of them
will give you money.

00:57:23.634 --> 00:57:25.801
That would be
my general advice.

00:57:25.801 --> 00:57:29.667
There's a continuing
trend to bootstrap

00:57:29.667 --> 00:57:30.968
and to try and not take money,

00:57:30.968 --> 00:57:32.734
and I'm totally
in the opposite camp.

00:57:32.734 --> 00:57:34.334
If you can get money
at good terms,

00:57:34.334 --> 00:57:35.834
it's going to make your life
easier.

00:57:35.834 --> 00:57:36.834
The help they're
going to give you

00:57:36.834 --> 00:57:37.834
is going to be great.

00:57:37.834 --> 00:57:39.100
The credibility
is awesome.

00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:41.734
And if you can bootstrap,
then take the money

00:57:41.734 --> 00:57:43.133
and just don't spend it
on the things

00:57:43.133 --> 00:57:44.367
you would've been
able to bootstrap.

00:57:44.367 --> 00:57:45.901
Spend it on
something else.

00:57:45.901 --> 00:57:50.100
So, as soon as humanly possible,
and start trying right away.

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:55.100
man: Hi, when you're working
nights and weekends,

00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:57.300
and you're putting
some more to work,

00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:59.934
at what point do you worry
about not infringing

00:57:59.934 --> 00:58:03.267
some obscure IP
and things like that?

00:58:03.267 --> 00:58:05.834
Buchheit: Never.
Don't waste your time.

00:58:05.834 --> 00:58:08.067
You are infringing on IP.
There's no question.

00:58:08.067 --> 00:58:13.367
[laughter]

00:58:13.367 --> 00:58:14.534
man:
So, let me reiterate,

00:58:14.534 --> 00:58:16.167
because the gentleman
in front of me

00:58:16.167 --> 00:58:17.767
asked the question
about bootstrapping,

00:58:17.767 --> 00:58:22.300
but that was my question,
so I'm going to ask it again.

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.467
Do we always
have to raise money?

00:58:24.467 --> 00:58:27.033
Because lately there is a trend
about bootstrapping.

00:58:27.033 --> 00:58:29.634
Is it for real,
or it was just a factor

00:58:29.634 --> 00:58:32.200
of the tough economic times?

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.400
Kraus: I think
bootstrapping is for real.

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.667
As an entrepreneur, look,

00:58:34.667 --> 00:58:38.567
I think that kind of
macro trend is out there.

00:58:38.567 --> 00:58:41.834
You have large cap tech
companies like Google,

00:58:41.834 --> 00:58:45.234
like Microsoft,
like Facebook, like Yahoo,

00:58:45.234 --> 00:58:47.968
who've accumulated a massive--
Apple--have accumulated

00:58:47.968 --> 00:58:49.934
a mass amount of cash
on their balance sheets.

00:58:49.934 --> 00:58:54.334
So, small acquisitions
are things which those companies

00:58:54.334 --> 00:58:58.567
are likely to continue doing
over the next two, three years.

00:58:58.567 --> 00:59:02.267
So, bootstrapping, really,
the benefit of bootstrapping

00:59:02.267 --> 00:59:04.801
is it allows for relatively
small acquisitions

00:59:04.801 --> 00:59:08.400
where you own the majority
of the company

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.968
to be really beneficial for you
and cheap for the company.

00:59:10.968 --> 00:59:15.067
So they preserve a wide range
of early exit options.

00:59:15.067 --> 00:59:18.267
Taking money definitely narrows
the range of exit options,

00:59:18.267 --> 00:59:19.400
just because there's
a higher hurdle now

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.567
that you have
to be bought at.

00:59:21.567 --> 00:59:23.801
So, I'm still a big fan
of bootstrapping,

00:59:23.801 --> 00:59:25.601
as an investor,
because it lowers the risk

00:59:25.601 --> 00:59:26.934
of the investor investing,

00:59:26.934 --> 00:59:29.400
because you usually have
more data to invest on.

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:31.067
Dodge: Okay,
last question over here.

00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:33.400
man: I'm currently looking
for one or more cofounders.

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.667
Right now,
it's just myself.

00:59:34.667 --> 00:59:37.200
And to be brutally honest
about my skills,

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:41.334
I think I excel most
at more of a product design,

00:59:41.334 --> 00:59:42.534
product manager type of role.

00:59:42.534 --> 00:59:43.934
I do have
a technical background,

00:59:43.934 --> 00:59:45.167
and I can do
the technical stuff,

00:59:45.167 --> 00:59:46.300
but I just feel
I excel more

00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:48.167
at designing the product
and the features.

00:59:48.167 --> 00:59:51.501
Do you recommend I look more
for a business background,

00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:53.133
a person with
a business background

00:59:53.133 --> 00:59:56.200
or a technical background?

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.734
Buchheit: I think--
I mean, it's tricky

00:59:57.734 --> 00:59:59.033
to find anyone, right?

00:59:59.033 --> 01:00:02.868
But I think improving
your own technical skills

01:00:02.868 --> 01:00:05.067
is the thing to do right away,
and then probably--

01:00:05.067 --> 01:00:07.067
I mean, it depends on what
you're building, obviously,

01:00:07.067 --> 01:00:08.167
like, it depends
on the market.

01:00:08.167 --> 01:00:09.601
It depends.
What are the needs

01:00:09.601 --> 01:00:11.400
that are going to make
your business successful, right?

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.300
But if there is a big
technology component,

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:14.534
I think it's pretty important

01:00:14.534 --> 01:00:16.000
that your cofounder
also be technical.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.100
man:
Thank you.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:19.400
Dodge: Okay,
we are out of time.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.334
Thank you so much
for staying with us

01:00:21.334 --> 01:00:26.234
and thank our panel.
