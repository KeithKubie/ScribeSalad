00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:07.546
(techno music)

00:00:11.097 --> 00:00:14.507
(kissing noises)

00:00:14.507 --> 00:00:15.417
- Yo, dude!

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:17.626
- Hey, what's up, Squat Sauce?

00:00:17.626 --> 00:00:20.566
- Hey, why don't you tell
me what's up, Street Meat?

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:24.282
- Oh, you know I'm just
sizzling on the street, dog.

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:25.736

00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:28.822

00:00:28.822 --> 00:00:29.655
- What?

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:30.488
- This was just what I...

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:32.791
I like this game because it
settles my brain down after

00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.407
a long day of getting
scalded by, fucking carnitas.

00:00:35.407 --> 00:00:37.507
- You got hot carnitas where you're at?

00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:38.800
- Yeah, dog.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.424
Yeah, I'm working at the Taco Bin.

00:00:40.424 --> 00:00:41.877
- Do you get any discount on your tacos?

00:00:41.877 --> 00:00:43.429
- Yeah, I get diarrhea for free, man.

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:46.560

one of these players

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.728
I want to play.

00:00:48.728 --> 00:00:51.106
- I'm going to do this lady, Kung Pao,

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:52.174
with sensitive skin.

00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:53.007
- Great.

00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:54.968
- I like to wear my hat
when I go in the garden,

00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:58.214
otherwise, my Melanoma
will really flare up.

00:00:58.214 --> 00:01:01.044
- [Video Game] Death from above!

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:02.627

- [Video Game] Round two.

00:01:10.317 --> 00:01:11.677

- That is some lightning kick, dude.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.311
Lightning's got some kick!

00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:16.836
- What is his diet that
fire comes out of his ass?

00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:18.611
- [Video Game] Round four.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.144
- I feel his kick would be much better at

00:01:20.144 --> 00:01:22.057
this if he took his hands
out of his fucking pockets.

00:01:22.057 --> 00:01:24.223
- Well, what's he going to do
with his hands in Divekick?

00:01:24.223 --> 00:01:25.380
- I don't know.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.382
- He's being responsible,
he don't wanna use it.

00:01:26.382 --> 00:01:27.656
- Maybe counter-balance, man.

00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:29.875

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:31.067
Divekick.

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:33.753
- Why is my head getting so big?

00:01:33.753 --> 00:01:35.224
- I hope your head explodes.

00:01:35.224 --> 00:01:38.724
- Your head is big but not as big as mine.

00:01:40.914 --> 00:01:43.970
- [Video Game] Jefailey, wins!

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:44.947

00:01:44.947 --> 00:01:46.945
- Dude, Santa Monica
City College is kicking

00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:48.586
my dick in right now.

00:01:48.586 --> 00:01:49.494
- Really?

00:01:49.494 --> 00:01:52.035
- Taking this Theater of
the West Indies Class--

00:01:52.035 --> 00:01:53.953
- So you're upset about
the class you're taking?

00:01:53.953 --> 00:01:55.299
- There's this girl.

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.255
- Talk it out, talk it out,
talk it out, what's her name?

00:01:58.255 --> 00:02:00.347
- Teacher just calls her Miss Rodriguez.

00:02:00.347 --> 00:02:01.570
She's, like, Puerto Rican or...

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.403
- Miss Rodriguez?

00:02:02.403 --> 00:02:03.236
Is she older?

00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:05.151
- The teacher is this old, fucking dude

00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:06.259
with a goatee.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.478
And he, like, refers to all of
us as Mr. and Mrs. Something,

00:02:09.478 --> 00:02:11.196
you know, like, I think I love her dude.

00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:12.029
- Whoa!

00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:15.769
- She's one of those, like,
some sort of ethnic girl

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.852
with really bright blue eyes.

00:02:17.852 --> 00:02:20.070
She's either Indian, or
Black, or Cuban, or--

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.201
- Either way, win-win.

00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:23.257
- Whatever it is, it's
my favorite country,

00:02:23.257 --> 00:02:26.701
because fuck dude, she's
just electric, you know.

00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:28.078
- Call her, ask her out.

00:02:28.078 --> 00:02:29.437
- Can't ask her out, dude.

00:02:29.437 --> 00:02:30.270
- What do you want?

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.247
You're an adult?

00:02:31.247 --> 00:02:32.080
- I gotta ease into it, dude.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.164
I think I'm gonna roll
a pencil down the stairs

00:02:34.164 --> 00:02:35.352
in the class, and then have to go--

00:02:35.352 --> 00:02:37.940
- Hi, is this Miss Rodriguez?

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.230
- Ha, ha, you're fucking hilarious.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.063
- Hello?

00:02:40.063 --> 00:02:41.049
I'm in your, um--

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:41.965

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:43.165
- Theater of the West Indies Class.

00:02:43.165 --> 00:02:44.031
You're not?

00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:45.189
Fuck you, I don't believe
you, dude, you're not...

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.261
- Yeah, at SMCC--

00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:47.298
- You're not fucking talking to her.

00:02:47.298 --> 00:02:48.131
- Yeah.

00:02:48.131 --> 00:02:48.964
- Are you talking to her?

00:02:48.964 --> 00:02:49.797
- I think you're great.

00:02:49.797 --> 00:02:50.707
- Fucking hang up.

00:02:50.707 --> 00:02:51.931
- And I would love to
take you out to dinner.

00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:52.897
- Please stop.

00:02:52.897 --> 00:02:54.090

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.823

00:02:56.741 --> 00:02:57.574
- Fuck you, dude.

00:02:57.574 --> 00:02:58.407
- All right, well I'll
see you Friday at eight.

00:02:58.407 --> 00:02:59.240
- No, fuck you dude.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.073
- All right.

00:03:00.073 --> 00:03:00.906
- Miss Rodriguez!

00:03:00.906 --> 00:03:01.915
- Well, I miss you already too.

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:02.748
- Hang up!

00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:03.581
- Okay, bye.

00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:04.900
- Miss Rodriguez, hang up.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.047
It's not me.

00:03:06.047 --> 00:03:07.236
- You hang up.

00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:08.102
This is nuts.

00:03:08.102 --> 00:03:10.323
You...I'm gonna hang up
'cause my battery's low.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:13.335
All right, I'll see you Friday.

00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:15.918
(reveal music)

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.485
- Oh, why the fuck would you do that?

00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:21.080
- I know we're supposed to game on Friday

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.132
night but I kinda had these plans come up

00:03:23.132 --> 00:03:24.278
out of nowhere.

00:03:24.278 --> 00:03:25.697
- Oh, fuck, my chest hurts.

00:03:25.697 --> 00:03:27.523
- That voice came through that phone and I

00:03:27.523 --> 00:03:28.356
was, like, Whooop!

00:03:28.356 --> 00:03:31.155
You're from someplace I don't know.

00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:33.034
- What the fuck is wrong with you, dude?

00:03:33.034 --> 00:03:34.566
- Nothing, I'm going on a
date with a beautiful woman.

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:37.953
- [Video Game] Stuck in controller line.

00:03:37.953 --> 00:03:39.419

00:03:49.144 --> 00:03:50.579
- Miss Rodriguez?

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.365
(foghorn sound)

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.831
Hi, I'm sorry, I was looking
for a Miss Rodriguez, you're?

00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:57.510
(tinkling music)

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.369
Eh, I've done worse.

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:01.751
