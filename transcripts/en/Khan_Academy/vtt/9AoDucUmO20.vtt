00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.400
Welcome back.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.330
Well, in the last video we
took the Maclaurin series for

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.650
cosine of x, the Maclaurin
series representation.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.660
So I guess we might as well
do the same for sine of x.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.270
And I'm sounding very
nonchalant, but I have a reason

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.520
behind why I'm doing this, and
you'll see in a few videos from

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.760
now, when we come up with
the grand conclusion.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.540
So anyway, let's
just set up f of x.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.660
And you might just want to do
this yourself instead of

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.100
watching me do it, because it
should be pretty

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.870
self-explanatory now that you
saw cosine of x.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.340
And then you could
check your work.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.290
You can pause right now, and
then you can check to see

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.260
that we got the same answer.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.670
You'll probably be right
and I probably made

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.980
a careless mistake.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.650
So f of x is equal
to sine of x.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.710
First of all, let's just
figure out all of the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.610
derivatives of sine of x.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.640
We can already guess that it
probably cycles similar to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.350
cosine of x, with
slight variation.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.340
So what's the derivative
of sine of x?

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.220
Well, that's just cosine of x.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.670
What's the second derivative?

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.160
I'm just going to stop
putting parentheses

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.778
around these numbers.

00:01:02.778 --> 00:01:05.490
The second derivative, well,
that's just derivative of that.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.770
It's minus sine of x.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.430
The third derivative of x.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.930
Well, I guess I'll put the
parentheses so you don't think

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.250
it's f to the third times x.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.090
The third derivative, well,
that's just going to be the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.620
minus cosine, rightu0008?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.570
Because the derivative of sine
is cosine, but then we have

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.700
that minus sine there.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.440
And the fourth derivative.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.640
The derivative of cosine is
minus sine, but we have a minus

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.620
there, so we get back to sine.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.670
And then the cycle continues.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.100
So the fifth derivative is just
going to be cosine of x, or

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.610
just the derivative
of the sine of x.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.120
And then the cycle
continues, right?

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.550
All right.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.740
So we know the derivatives,
and we can just keep going.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.700
So let's evaluate the
derivatives of our function

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.360
of sine of x at x equals 0.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.095
f of 0.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.790
Well, that's sine of zero.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.740
What's sine of 0?

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.630
Well, sine of 0 is 0.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.390
f prime of 0 is equal
to cosine of 0.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.150
That's equal to 1.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.380
The second derivative at 0,
that's minus sine of 0.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.440
Well, sine of 0 is still 0.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.230
So that's 0.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.505
You can see it's a very similar
pattern to what we saw in the

00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:23.390
Maclaurin series
for cosine of x.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.040
And then the third
derivative evaluated at 0.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.120
That's cosine of 0 is 1.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.410
But we have a minus sine,
so that's minus 1.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.210
This you already know.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.490
The fourth derivative is 0.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.660
Sine of 0 is 0.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.470
And then it starts
to cycle again.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.410
The fifth derivative,
0 equal to 1.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.540
So we start with 0, then
positive 1, then 0, then minus

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.800
1, then 0, then positive 1.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.980
Every other number is a 0.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.090
Every other, I guess you could
say, coefficient in the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.500
Maclaurin series is a 0.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.000
The coefficient when you don't
include the factorial term.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.660
And then the ones in between
oscillate between positive

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.790
1 and negative 1.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.990
So what would be the Maclaurin
series for sine of x?

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.900
The Maclaurin series
representation?

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.850
So we could say that sine of x
-- And remember, I haven't

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.170
proven to you that the
Maclaurin series representation

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.020
of sine of x or cosine of x or
e to the x really is equal to

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.270
those functions over
the entire domain.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.480
I might do that later.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.510
Frankly, I've been thinking
about the proof myself.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.580
It hasn't been completely
intuitive how to do that proof.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.680
Although if you test them
out, it does seem to

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.500
make a lot of sense.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.190
But you shouldn't just
take my word for it.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.870
I'm going to look up the
proof and I will prove

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.240
it to you, eventually.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.650
But for now, you just have to
take it as a bit of a leap of

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.410
faith that the Maclaurin series
representations just don't

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.840
approximate those functions
around 0, that when you take

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.770
the infinite series, it
actually equals the function.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.770
So sine of x.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.490
The Maclaurin series
representation is going to be

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:01.510
equal to -- well, f of 0,
that's 0 plus f of -- so the

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.340
first derivative, it's going to
be 1 times x to the 1 over 1

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.620
factorial, which is just 1.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.680
This is just 1.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.540
And then we have -- this is
just plus 0 -- and then we have

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.250
minus -- and now this is the
third derivative -- so, minus 1

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.530
times x to the third
over 3 factorial.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.150
And then you have a 0.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.440
Then we have a plus 1.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.640
And this is now the fifth
derivative, so x to the

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.430
fifth over five factorial.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.770
And we'll just keep going, but
I think you see the pattern

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.080
as we write and rewrite it.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.530
Sine of x is equal to 0, so we
get x to the first, so that's

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:57.850
just x minus x to the third
over 3 factorial plus x to

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.330
the fifth over 5 factorial.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.650
And then you can
imagine the pattern.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.320
We'd go minus -- we're just
taking the odd numbers -- x to

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.140
the seventh over 7 factorial
plus x to the ninth over 9

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.930
factorial minus x to the
eleventh over 11 factorial,

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.220
and we'll just keep going.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.500
And so we'll just keep
oscillating in sine -- that's

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.360
a bit of a pun -- and we use
all of the odd exponents.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.272
So if I were to write that in
sigma notation, and sigma

00:05:33.272 --> 00:05:36.080
notation often is
the hard part.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.360
Well once again, the first
term, when the term is 0 --

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.990
this is the first term, right
-- we get a positive sine.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.710
Because we're going to
oscillate in sine, we're

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.430
probably going to take
negative 1 to some power.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.180
It'll be negative 1
to the n plus 1.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.780
So let's see if that works.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.760
If this is the first term,
this will be a -- no,

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.670
no, no, that won't work.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.030
It'll be to the 2n plus 1.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.810
Actually, I think I should
have done that in the

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:10.980
previous video, too.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.190
I think it should have been
negative 1 to the 2n,

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.090
not negative 1 to the n.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.420
I'm sorry for that mistake.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:30.090
So it's negative 1 to the 2n
plus 1 times x to the 2n.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.010
Oh, no, no, sorry, I was
right in the previous video.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.000
See, I'm confusing
myself, because I don't

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.815
count the 0 terms.

00:06:37.815 --> 00:06:41.000
It would probably help me to
write the sigma down first.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.800
So this is equal to -- as you
can see I do all of this in

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.010
real time -- infinity
from n is equal to 0.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.490
And so, the first term is
positive, so it'll be

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.100
negative 1 to the n, right?

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.690
Because negative 1 to the
0 power is 1, right?

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.660
So that's positive and then the
second term is negative, then

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.080
positive, negative, right?

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:14.620
And so, the zeroth term is x,
so it has to be x to the --

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.480
let me see -- 2n plus 1.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.080
Does that work?

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.300
Right, because the first
term would then be 3.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:31.120
Right. x to the 2n plus 1
over 2n plus 1 factorial.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.050
It's almost easier when you
just write it out like that.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.205
Well, that's pretty
interesting.

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:37.180
But what's even more
interesting is if you see the

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.830
similarity between the
Maclaurin series representation

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.590
for sine of x, and then the
representation we figured

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.650
out for cosine of x in
the previous video.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:55.780
We figured out that cosine of x
is equal to 1 minus x squared

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:03.930
over 2 factorial plus x to the
fourth over 4 factorial minus x

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:12.310
to the sixth over six factorial
plus x to the eighth

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.790
over 8 factorial.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.030
So they're almost the
opposite, right?

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.430
They almost complement
each other.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.410
The cosine, these are all of
the even exponents, right?

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.870
And even factorials.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.590
And sine is all of the odd
exponents, because this

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.350
is x to the 0, right?

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.640
So that's why you get 1 here.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.540
And in sine, it's all of the
odd exponents and all of the

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.660
odd factorials in
the denominator.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.080
So that by itself, I
think, is pretty neat.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.240
What is especially neat, just
another fodder for thought, is

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.410
that we know from trigonometry
that sine is just a shifted

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.870
cosine function or that cosine
is just a shifted

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.040
sine function.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.310
But what's neat is by shifting
it by pi over 2 -- which is all

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.560
they are, right, if you were to
graph it, they're just shifted

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.980
90 degrees to the left or the
right of each other -- you can

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.490
actually represent them
differently by essentially

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:13.160
picking the odd or even terms
of this factorial polynomial

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.600
series, whatever you
want to call it.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.440
But anyway.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.900
Doesn't matter if you didn't
understand what I said at

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.600
the end, as long as you
appreciate how cool this is.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.030
I will see you in
the next video.
