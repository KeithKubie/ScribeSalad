00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959
if you fall into a black hole
 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.220
if you fall into a black hole
ready go you know black holes there this

you're asking about black holes as great

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
you're asking about black holes as great
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.470
you're asking about black holes as great
question the way I like to describe a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.100
black hole it's a star a black hole is a
star now when you and I think of stars

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110
star now when you and I think of stars
 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.229
star now when you and I think of stars
we think about the Sun which is giving

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239
we think about the Sun which is giving
 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.630
we think about the Sun which is giving
off all this light but the other thing

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640
off all this light but the other thing
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.970
off all this light but the other thing
about the Sun to keep in mind is it has

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
about the Sun to keep in mind is it has
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.020
about the Sun to keep in mind is it has
a lot of gravity as it's huge and

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030
a lot of gravity as it's huge and
 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.790
a lot of gravity as it's huge and
everything that has mass everything that

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800
everything that has mass everything that
 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.950
everything that has mass everything that
would weigh something here on earth has

fully understood though if you could
figure that out you know you might

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
figure that out you know you might
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.510
figure that out you know you might
change the world but with that said a

out in space and we have known

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
out in space and we have known
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.800
out in space and we have known
brightness and we see where we think

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810
brightness and we see where we think

they're going to be and then when they

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
they're going to be and then when they
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.069
they're going to be and then when they
really appear to be and then we infer or

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079
really appear to be and then we infer or
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.649

can escape from it now when you get

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670
can escape from it now when you get
 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.780
can escape from it now when you get
something that big

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790
something that big

the gravity as you get near it changes

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190
the gravity as you get near it changes
 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.890
the gravity as you get near it changes
and you know this like if you're real

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900
and you know this like if you're real
 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.190
and you know this like if you're real
far away from a light a light bulb it's

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200
far away from a light a light bulb it's
 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.410
far away from a light a light bulb it's
dim right when you walk up really close

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420
dim right when you walk up really close
 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.550
dim right when you walk up really close
to it gets brighter and brighter and

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560
to it gets brighter and brighter and
 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.619
to it gets brighter and brighter and
brighter well the same is true the

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629
brighter well the same is true the
 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.309
brighter well the same is true the
gravity that's that a star produces or

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319
gravity that's that a star produces or
 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.050
gravity that's that a star produces or
anything with mass produces the closer

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
anything with mass produces the closer
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.339
anything with mass produces the closer
you are to it the more gravity it has

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349
you are to it the more gravity it has
 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.130
you are to it the more gravity it has
satellites in space have less gravity to

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140
satellites in space have less gravity to
 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.839
satellites in space have less gravity to
fight than you and I do here on the

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849
fight than you and I do here on the
 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.820
fight than you and I do here on the
surface once they get out there in space

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830
surface once they get out there in space
 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.339
surface once they get out there in space
for example so when you fall into a

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349
for example so when you fall into a
 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.430
for example so when you fall into a
black hole bow first of all you don't

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440
black hole bow first of all you don't
 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.140
black hole bow first of all you don't
want to do that because the difference

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150
want to do that because the difference
 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.110
want to do that because the difference
in gravity between your feet and your

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120
in gravity between your feet and your
 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.979
in gravity between your feet and your
head just that far is so powerful it

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989
head just that far is so powerful it
 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.979
head just that far is so powerful it
would stretch you into really really

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989
would stretch you into really really
 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.869
would stretch you into really really
thin like a thin as a wire thin as a

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879
thin like a thin as a wire thin as a
 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.309
thin like a thin as a wire thin as a
piece of spaghetti as the saying goes

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319
piece of spaghetti as the saying goes
 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.770
piece of spaghetti as the saying goes
and bow I don't want to shock you that

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780
and bow I don't want to shock you that
 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.369
and bow I don't want to shock you that
that would that be really bad but in

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379
that would that be really bad but in
 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.670
that would that be really bad but in
science fiction we love that because

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680
science fiction we love that because
 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.220
science fiction we love that because
that's we can fly around in spaceships

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230
that's we can fly around in spaceships
 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.080
that's we can fly around in spaceships
and they have sort of science fiction

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090
and they have sort of science fiction
 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.140
and they have sort of science fiction
magic powers and they can we can survive

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150
magic powers and they can we can survive
 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.690
magic powers and they can we can survive
stuff like that in science stories

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700
stuff like that in science stories
 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.920
stuff like that in science stories
now you mentioned wormholes wormholes

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930
now you mentioned wormholes wormholes
 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.050
now you mentioned wormholes wormholes
are an idea that people think may exist

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060
are an idea that people think may exist
 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.210
are an idea that people think may exist
and the idea is that you would fall into

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220
and the idea is that you would fall into
 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.860
and the idea is that you would fall into
something with a lot of gravity like a

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870
something with a lot of gravity like a
 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.890
something with a lot of gravity like a
black hole and instead of just getting

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900
black hole and instead of just getting
 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.069
black hole and instead of just getting
crushed and killed you would end up in

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079
crushed and killed you would end up in
 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.080
crushed and killed you would end up in
another part of the universe at a

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090
another part of the universe at a
 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.979
another part of the universe at a
different time and this is something

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989
different time and this is something
 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.659
different time and this is something
that physicists say to each other at

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669
that physicists say to each other at
 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.849
that physicists say to each other at
physics meetings and they oh yeah oh

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859
physics meetings and they oh yeah oh
 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.289
physics meetings and they oh yeah oh
yeah you different party the University

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299
yeah you different party the University
 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.089
yeah you different party the University
of time yeah that's great yeah piece of

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099
of time yeah that's great yeah piece of
 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.550
of time yeah that's great yeah piece of
cake black hole wormhole sure that's

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560
cake black hole wormhole sure that's
 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.270
cake black hole wormhole sure that's
sure but understand though nobody's ever

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280
sure but understand though nobody's ever

done this these are theoretical things

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109
done this these are theoretical things
 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.720
done this these are theoretical things
they're important theoretical things

part of the bigger story that

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260
part of the bigger story that

astronomers and astrophysicists and just

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200
astronomers and astrophysicists and just
 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.199
astronomers and astrophysicists and just
scientists in general they're part of

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209
scientists in general they're part of
 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.449
scientists in general they're part of
the bigger story of the universe and

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459
the bigger story of the universe and

where you and I came from and what we're

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220
where you and I came from and what we're
 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.949
where you and I came from and what we're
all doing here and why the earth goes

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959
all doing here and why the earth goes
 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.080
all doing here and why the earth goes
around the Sun and why the other planets

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090
around the Sun and why the other planets
 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.430
around the Sun and why the other planets
go around the Sun and there

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440
go around the Sun and there
 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.260
go around the Sun and there
all in the same plane almost except

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270
all in the same plane almost except
 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.990
all in the same plane almost except
Pluto which is going on so it's all part

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000
Pluto which is going on so it's all part
 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.360
Pluto which is going on so it's all part
of this big story so these are great

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370
of this big story so these are great
 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.190
of this big story so these are great
questions Bo but they really don't have

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200
questions Bo but they really don't have
 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.650
questions Bo but they really don't have
clear succinct answers right now but

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660
clear succinct answers right now but
 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.920
clear succinct answers right now but
perhaps you will be the scientist the

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930
perhaps you will be the scientist the
 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.870
perhaps you will be the scientist the
astrophysicist who figures this out for

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880
astrophysicist who figures this out for
 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.470
astrophysicist who figures this out for
sure when you have these objects or

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480
sure when you have these objects or
 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.320
sure when you have these objects or
these theoretical places in space that

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330
these theoretical places in space that
 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.980
these theoretical places in space that
seemed to have so much energy you just

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990
seemed to have so much energy you just
 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.900
seemed to have so much energy you just
got to wonder if we could harness that

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910
got to wonder if we could harness that
 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.880
got to wonder if we could harness that
energy and do something fantastic with

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890
energy and do something fantastic with
 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.330

it keep asking questions Bo is great

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340
it keep asking questions Bo is great
 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.090
it keep asking questions Bo is great
carry on

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100
