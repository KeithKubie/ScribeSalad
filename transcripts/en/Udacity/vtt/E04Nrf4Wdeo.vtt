00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.650
One of the bigger problems the replication machinery has, is when it

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.620
reaches a repeat region in your genome, it has to copy it.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.490
&gt;&gt; Are you talking about when they reach a point

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.480
where there's like a bunch of thymines in a row?

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.900
&gt;&gt; Exactly. I want you to take a look at the sequence

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.230
you see here. Now, imagine that you're the replication machinery inside a cell

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.260
and you have to duplicate this DNA. To do that you have

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.250
to copy it letter for letter into the text box you see here.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.290
Remember, don't make a mistake.
