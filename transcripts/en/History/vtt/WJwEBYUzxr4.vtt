00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.170
NARRATOR: Novo Selo,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.040
a 12-year-old peasant
girl, Vangeliya,

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.710
is playing with her cousins
in a field when she gets

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.670
caught up in a freak storm.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.790
She was carried off
into the air by a tornado

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.000
and they found her
motionless body in the field.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.830
And strangely, her eyes
were completely caked

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.080
with sand and dust.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.210
And she said that
she couldn't open

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.080
them without excruciating pain.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.920
And what then began was a
decline in her ability to see.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.420
NARRATOR: After the
accident, Vangeliya

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.750
developed a striking ability
to predict the future

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.040
and began making
accurate revelations

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.380
for the local population.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.250
By the 1980s, Vangeliya, who
adopted the name Baba Vanga,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.080
had given thousands of
accurate predictions

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.920
and gained a reputation as the
Nostradamus of the Balkans.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.210
WILLIAM HENRY: Baba
Vanga said that she

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.120
could see in her mind's eye.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.460
And when she would
look at a person,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.920
she said that she could
see their whole life

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.290
in its totality, complete
from birth through their life

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.960
until death as if she
were watching a movie.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.250
JOHN HOGUE: She was a study
of many Bulgarian and Soviet

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.620
scientists, who
scientifically started

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.040
testing her and interviewing her
and the people that she read.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.290
And they have found that
it is an 80% accuracy.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.580
CAROLINE CORY: Her predictions
were actually very accurate,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.460
which tells us that the
ability to retrieve information

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.170
beyond this earth
plane has nothing

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.120
to do with our five senses.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.580
In fact, when she
became blind, it

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.670
is as if her other
senses developed

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.420
to receive messages and
information about the future.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.290
NARRATOR: Among her numerous
claims were predictions

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.330
relating to world events.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.080
Many of which would
later come true.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.080
New York City,
September 11, 2001--

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.500
BABA VANGA: American president
will fall after being

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.580
attacked by the steel birds.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.460
NARRATOR: Two planes hijacked
by members of a terrorist group

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.670
called al-Qaeda crash into
the World Trade Center

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:40.000
taking the lives of nearly
3,000 innocent civilians.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.120
Sumatra, Indonesia,
December 26, 2004--

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.830
BABA VANGA: A huge wave will
cover a big coast covered

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.670
with people and towns,
and everything will

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.000
disappear beneath the water.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.620
NARRATOR: A 9.1
magnitude earthquake

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.790
off the coast of the island
creates a devastating tsunami,

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.750
completely engulfing
over 3,000 miles of land

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.830
and claiming the lives
of over 230,000 people.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.170
Washington, DC,
January 20, 2009--

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.500
BABA VANGA: The 44th
president of the United States

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.080
will be an African-American man.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.920
Everyone will put
their hopes in him.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.420
I, Barack Hussein
Obama, do solemnly swear.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.500
NARRATOR: Barack Obama, an
African-American senator

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.500
from Illinois, is sworn into
office as the 44th president

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.750
of the United States.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.540
Congratulations,
Mr. President.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.960
JOHN HOGUE: We must remember
these amazing things are coming

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.460
from someone who was born
a peasant, who has not read

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.620
books, had a slight,
maybe functional literacy

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.540
with Braille, but
she has essentially

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.880
has no access to televisions,
no access to movies.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.040
This is coming out
of her interiority.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.710
NARRATOR: Baba Vanga proclaimed
her prophetic abilities not

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.880
only allowed her to tap into an
unknown realm of information,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.120
but it also put her in contact
with extraterrestrials.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.790
BABA VANGA: Baba
Vanga has talked

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.790
about these extraterrestrials
that are invisible or more

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.670
like they are presences like
clear reflections of water

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.670
shimmering.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.170
And they shared with
her many secrets

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.580
which she says are locked
inside the scriptures

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.580
of many religions.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.580
We have to wonder
with her where she

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.670
was getting this information.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.170
Is it possible she was
able to access some

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.500
kind of knowledge
that's out there that

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.330
normal people cannot access?
