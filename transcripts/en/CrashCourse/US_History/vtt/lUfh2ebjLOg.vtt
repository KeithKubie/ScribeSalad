00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.860
Hi, I’m John Green, this is CrashCourse
U.S. history and we’ve finally done it,

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.720
we’ve reached the end of history!

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.720
Ahh.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.700
Stan, says that history never ends but whatever
we’ve reached the part that Me From the

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.700
Present is in.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.860
So we aren’t going to cover the astonishing
results of the 2016 presidential election.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.830
What we are going to do is try to talk about
historical events that are also current events.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.859
Future John Green here to tell you that in
a stunning turn of events the 2020 presidential

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.640
election will be won by - Harry Styles.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.560
I know that he’s English and under 35 but
we’re going to change the constitution to

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.560
make it possible.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.790
Because… that’s how much we love Harry
Styles in 2020.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.809
Intro
So when we last left George W Bush, his approval

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.110
rating was dropping to the lowest number in
President of the United States approval rating

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.110
history.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.210
And the U.S. was facing what turned out to
be the 2nd worst economic crises in the past

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.210
150 years.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.530
A crisis that remains unnamed because we’re
kind of still in it.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.870
But I’d like to propose a couple names:
the Wall Street Wamboozle, the Financial Fartstorm.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.040
However, knowing historians they will inevitably
call it like The Major Recession of 2008 - 2012.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.040
Booooo!

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.270
So what caused the Financial Fartstorm that
began in late 2008?

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.150
Well, it was a mixture of public and private
activities that tilted towards short-term

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.729
economic thinking, speculation and irresponsible
spending.

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.079
First, there are the Federal Reserve’s policies
of keeping interest rates freakishly low in

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.520
response to the 2001-2002 recession.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.579
Now, this worked, but the recession ended
and interest rates stayed low.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.830
And this, combined with unscrupulous mortgage
lenders, encouraged people to buy houses that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.939
they could not afford.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.090
In the early 2000s, many millions of Americans,
including certain Crash Course US History

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.560
hosts, bought real estate assuming that its
value would increase rapidly and forever,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.110
so that when you were unable to make payments,
you’d just sell it, pay off the mortgage,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.110
and make a tidy profit.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.290
It turns out this was essentially a pyramid
scheme and, my friends, I was not at the top

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.290
of the pyramid.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.621
So back then you could buy a house with a
so-called NINJA loan which sadly this did

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:05.380
not involve mutant ninja turtles or pizza.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.140
Ninja stands for No Income, No Job, and No
Assets.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.830
Traditionally, people in this situation can’t
borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars, but

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.760
in the early 2000’s, these loans were giving
the benign sounding designation “subprime.”

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.140
So it’s important to understand that it
wasn’t just like big Wall Street banks financing

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.550
huge deals with debt, regular people were
doing it - like me.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.730
All this created a classic housing bubble,
which was doomed to burst.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.410
Also, with the interest on government Treasury
Bills effectively zero, investors had to look

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.520
elsewhere for better returns, which led to
the idea of issuing securities – these bond-like

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.110
instruments that were backed by mortgages.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.450
The thinking was that the interest people
paid on their mortgages would supply the underlying

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.340
value of the security, the way that like tax
revenues are the source of value of a government

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.340
bond.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.660
Now of course there’d be a minority of people
who’d fail to pay off their securitised

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.280
mortgages, but most people would pay because,
you know, they’d want to keep their houses.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.250
But it turns out that if you haven’t paid
any money to own your house, you don’t feel

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.560
all that invested in it.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.590
Now there are even more reasons why these
securities were terrible ideas, but the important

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.560
thing is that when the mortgages turned bad,
these securities became toxic assets.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.620
Basically, the people who held them suddenly
didn’t know what they were worth if anything

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.820
and banks overreacted to this uncertainty
as banks like to do by not lending out any

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.820
money.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.940
And that’s called a credit freeze, which
is very bad.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.770
So that’s how a housing bubble turned into
a full-fledged financial crisis.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.530
Alright Let’s go to the ThoughtBubble.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.600
When banks stop lending, business can’t
function.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.540
So the stock market collapsed, with the Dow
Jones Industrial Average dropping from above

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.930
14,000 to around 8,000 which wiped out about
$7trillion of shareholder wealth.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.740
And a majority of Americans had money invested
in the stock market, much of it in the form

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.740
of retirement funds.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.470
With it being harder to borrow money, Americans
finally cut back on their spending, which

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.220
resulted in many businesses failing and by
the end of 2008, 2.5 million jobs had been

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.790
lost, many of which were in manufacturing
and construction.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.790
And because those were both male-dominated
fields, it led to another change, by mid-2009

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.620
more women than men held paying jobs for the
first time in American history.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.030
In the last three months of 2008 and the first
three months of 2009 our GDP dropped 6%.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.630
And World Trade cratered and that led to unemployment
and misery worldwide.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.720
The event that triggered the chaos was the
failure of the investment bank Lehman Brothers

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.970
in September, just 2 months before the presidential
election.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.470
The Bush Administration tried to stop the
damage by getting Congress to pass the Troubled

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.470
Assets Relief Program, or TARP, which was
basically a $700 billion bailout for banks

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.870
like Citigroup and Bank of America, insurance
companies like AIG and mortgage insurers Fannie

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.390
Mae and Freddie Mac.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.550
Regular individuals also received tarps, but
they had to buy them and they weren’t as

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.550
cool.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.711
Anyway, these bailouts were probably necessary
to stop a complete failure of the financial

00:04:52.711 --> 00:04:55.590
system but they were very unpopular.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.130
Most of the banks that received a rescue from
the taxpayers didn’t help the homeowners

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.120
facing foreclosure, and despite receiving
millions of federal dollars, AIG continued

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.990
to pay huge bonuses to its top executives.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.990
Thanks, Thoughtbubble.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.280
So, the end of the Bush years looked a lot
like the end of the Hoover years.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.260
After a decade of Americans spending more
than they had, government taking a back seat

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.510
to business interests and deregulation of
industries going hand in hand with increasing

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.460
corruption, Barack Obama was faced with America’s
biggest economic challenge since the Great

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.460
Depression.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.300
Oh, by the way, we got a new president, Barack
Obama, who 50 years before his election couldn’t

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.670
have sat in the front of a bus in Alabama.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.760
So I know all the green parts of not-America
are mad at us for causing the great financial

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.760
meltdown and whatever, and fair enough, but
we do make some progress now and again

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.230
Barack Obama was young, he was relatively
new on the national scene, and represented

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.230
change.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.070
He appealed to young people and minorities,
and he harnessed the power of social media

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.170
to communicate with supporters, and get out
the vote, and also raise TONS of money.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.480
Also, he was on the cover of US Weekly.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.020
You didn’t see Martin Van Buren on the cover
of US Weekly.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.020
What’s that?

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.020
It didn’t exist?

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.020
Of course it existed!

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.970
In 2008 Obama’s election At the time Obama’s
election seemed a political watershed and

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.950
not just because he was the first African
American president.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.410
He appeared to break Republicans’ solid
hold on the south, he won Virginia, and North

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:20.730
Carolina and Florida, and his supporters represented
a coalition of African Americans, and Hispanics,

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.660
white liberals and, especially, young people.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.950
Oh, it’s time for the mystery document?

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.340
I hope it’s from that US Weekly profile.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.730
The rules here are simple - he said for the
final time.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.030
I’ll tell you one thing that’s going to
change here at Crash Course, no more shock

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.030
pens.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.600
I guess the author of the Mystery Document,
if I’m wrong I get shocked.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.230
Alright, let’s see what we got here today.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.030
“For everywhere we look, there is work to
be done.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.430
The state of our economy calls for action,
bold and swift.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.340
And we will act, not only to create new jobs,
but to lay a new foundation for growth.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.160
We will build the roads and bridges, the electric
grids and digital lines that feed our commerce

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.669
and bind us together.

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:02.870
We’ll restore science to its rightful place,
and wield technology’s wonders to raise

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.800
health care’s quality and lower its cost.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.230
We will harness the sun and the winds and
the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.001
And we will transform our schools and colleges
and universities to meet the demands of a

00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:17.001
new age.

00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:18.530
All this we can do.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.690
All this we will do.”

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.700
Speaking of things that we will do, I will
get this right it’s Barack Obama’s first

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.700
inaugural!

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.700
Ba-bam!

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.700
No more shocks.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.550
The getting shocked part of my life has come
to an end.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.140
Hopefully in Crash Course Literature when
I get things right I’ll get a puppy and

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.010
when I get things wrong I’ll get a rainbow!

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.120
Stan says that my only reward is not being
punished.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.490
So Obama promised to change the culture of
Washington.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.190
He would end partisan squabbling….

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.040
sorry I couldn’t even get through that sentence.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.530
To be fair, he did end the squabbling, it
became full blown yelling.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.210
He also wanted a foreign policy based on diplomacy,
he wanted to reduce inequality and increase

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.930
access to health care, he wanted to curb “greed
and irresponsibility” that had helped bring

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.960
on the economic crisis, and he wanted to end
the Bush tax cuts.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.881
He also wanted to end the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan and, as critics mocked, reverse

00:08:06.881 --> 00:08:07.881
global warming.

00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:10.390
That’s a tall order
So how has he done?

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.390
Not bad.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.590
Well, some would say not great either.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.060
For instance he launched diplomatic outreach
to the Muslim world, but a lot of this was

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.680
more rhetoric than action, as in his verbal
support for the revolution that overthrew

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.139
Hosni Mubarak in Egypt.

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:26.430
And he did keep some of his campaign promises,
for instance he signed into law the Lily Ledbetter

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:31.120
Fair Pay Act, which made it easier for women
to sue when they had been systemically underpaid

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.140
and he also reversed an earlier executive
order that limited women’s reproductive

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.140
rights.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.980
And speaking of women he appointed two of
them to the Supreme Court, Elena Kagan and

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.680
Sonia Sotomayor, the court’s first Hispanic
melmber.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.050
He also followed through on his promise to
end the war in Iraq, although to be fair the

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.940
Bush administration had really set him up
for success there.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.680
And he increased the number of U.S. troops
in Afghanistan as part of a longer term plan

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.890
to end the war there, which has sort of worked?

00:08:53.890 --> 00:09:00.050
He also authorized a successful military operation
that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:04.330
I was in Amsterdam at the time, and the Dutch
media came to my house to ask me how Americans

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.790
felt about this and I said, “Good!”

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:10.270
On the other hand Obama has been criticized
internationally for backing off his promise

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:15.010
to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp,
and he has largely followed the Bush administration's

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.730
policies with the war on terror.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.810
But the Obama administration has deployed
far more unmanned drones to kill suspected

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.200
militants around the world.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.060
Despite provoking outrage on the left and
the right, Americans generally appear to support

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.190
the use of drones and extra-legal assassination
of accused terrorists.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.990
Obama also kept in place Bush’s executive
power and in fact expanded it in some ways

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.200
with NSA’s PRISM program.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.150
What about that financial mess he inherited?

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.991
Well, Obama was fortunate to have a Democratic
Congress for his first term in office, so

00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:44.200
he could push through a lot of legislation.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.450
This included a sweeping stimulus package
with nearly $800 Billion in new spending,

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:55.380
most of it on infrastructure, that was signed
into law on February 17, 2009, just 28 days

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.510
into Obama’s presidency.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:01.640
In the end, the recovery act cost $787 billion
- more than the government had spent on a

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.970
package of programs ever.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.480
More than the Great Society.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.480
More than the New Deal.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.480
Did it work,?

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.140
Well it depends on who you ask.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:14.029
Among 9 large studies, 6 found that the stimulus
did have a positive effect on growth and employment,

00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:17.810
3 found that it had little or no effect, and
economists are equally divided.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.550
The stimulus is estimated to have saved about
3 million jobs, but it also increased the

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:22.610
deficit quite a bit.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:26.950
So Liberal economists see America’s current
7% unemployment rate as evidence that the

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:31.500
stimulus’ Keynesian policies should have
gone further, while conservatives say that

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.420
the stimulus exploded the federal deficit
and debt.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.310
Regardless, the recovery for the past few
years has been steady, but quite slow.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.680
Lastly, let’s turn to Obama’s signature
policy proposal the Affordable Care Act, better

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.170
known as Obamacare.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:48.210
The Affordable Care Act is arguably the most
significant piece of social legislation since

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.210
Medicare.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.970
And it seeks to move the United States into
the ranks of countries with universal health

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:53.970
care.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.080
A list that includes every industrialized
nation on Earth.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.440
We’re number one among countries that don’t
have universal health care.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.220
So Obamacare aims to reduce the number of
Americans without health insurance by making

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.940
it easier and less expensive for the uninsured
to buy it privately.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.970
It’s not a government insurance plan and
the government will subsidize those who can’t

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:11.970
afford insurance.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:16.570
That’s going to be expensive, but fortunately
our health care system is so astonishly inefficient

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:20.250
that there are lots of places to save money
and the Congressional Budget Office at least

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.060
thinks it’s going to be a wash.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.720
But controversially, the acts insurance mandate
means that if you don’t have insurance from

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.600
your employer you MUST buy it or else you
have to pay a penalty.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.570
In 2012 the core of the law was upheld by
the Supreme Court when they ruled that thiants

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.600
was a constitutional use of the government’s
taxing power.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.850
As for Obama’s success at ending partisan
politics, not one Congressional Republican

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:47.510
voted for Obamacare, and many used it to campaign
against Democrats in the 2010 mid-term elections.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.709
And while the success of the Affordable Care
Act won’t be able to be determined for many

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:56.760
years there was a huge backlash against both
Obama and his policies, on Facebook, and Twitter,

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.060
and also the mysterious world of non-the-Internet
One of these responses was The Tea Party,

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.430
a reference to the Boston Tea Party and an
acronym for Taxed Enough Already.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:09.770
For the record, I just want to say that the
vast majority of American’s taxes are lower

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.070
now than they have been at any point in the
last one hundred years.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.899
But the Tea Party is also very concerned that
deficits are out of control and that rising

00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:19.480
government spending is going to ruin America.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.070
Bolstered by 80 or so new Tea Party congresspeople,
the Republicans took control of the House

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.740
in 2010 and John, it’s pronounced, Boehner
became the Speaker of The House.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.860
All these Tea Party freshmen took their mandate
to cut taxes and reduce spending very seriously,

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.720
and that made it difficult for Boehner to
compromise with the Obama administration.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.120
Over in the Senate, Democrats held a slim
majority, but because of the filibuster needed

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.850
60 votes to do anything, which made them look
very dysfunctional

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.340
In fact, the 111th congress was one of the
least productive in American history.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.520
Obama was re-elected president in 2012, the
Republicans continued to control The House,

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.029
the Democrats continued to have slim majority
in the Senate, and now America is facing something

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:00.390
of a political crisis.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:05.279
Unwillingness to compromise precipitated a
series of mini-fiscal crises over things like

00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:07.660
the budget and raising the debt ceiling.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:12.020
Things that Congress used to be able to hash
out back when their business was governing

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.240
not ideological rigidity.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.360
Meanwhile, the economy has slowly added jobs
and looks halfway decent at the moment mostly

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.700
because Europe looks so bad.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.700
Yay?

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:27.690
That qualified questioning yay is about the
last word I have to say on American history.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:31.630
The particular brands of ideological certainty
that we see today may seem new but if you

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.589
look at American history you realize that
this has been going on for a long time.

00:13:35.589 --> 00:13:40.440
The Tea Party is right that the founding fathers
would be astonished by the extend of the American

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.600
government and the extent to which it’s
involved in the lives of Americans.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.670
And progressives are right that people around
the world have benefited from government investment

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.480
in healthcare and infrastructure and transportation.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.540
We have to ask ourselves again, “What does
freedom really mean?”

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.779
Can you be free when you live in poverty or
when you’re one injury away from bankruptcy?

00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:02.710
Can you be free when the government can go
to a secret court to read your text messages?

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.800
We know that you can’t be free if you’re
dead, so is the government’s job to protect

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.670
you not only by having a standing army but
also making you wear your seat belt?

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.720
Those are ultimately ideological questions,
but we have to grapple with them in a real

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.220
practical way.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.240
And the great story of American governance
is compromise.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.480
But that is also often been the tragedy of
American governance as when the Constitutional

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.540
Convention compromised over whether African
American people were people.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.550
So if you’ve learned anything this year,
I hope its been that the American story that

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.030
we find ourselves in now isn’t entirely
novel.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.880
And I think we have much to learn from those
who came before us, both from their successes

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.500
and their many, many failures.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.839
