Hi, I’m Hannah Dickinson,
and this is Cheers to You,

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.718
where I’m kicking off
my first round of the weekend

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:11.720
by cheers-ing
all the people and stories

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.263
that encourage me to drink.

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.015
Cheers to you, Titanic 2,

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:18.352
for your plans
to set sail in 2022,

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:21.438
promising an authentic
Titanic experience.

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:23.690
By that time,
all the icebergs will be melted,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.734
but people will be
fat enough to sink it.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.948
(clears throat)

00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:32.699
Cheers to you, David Schwimmer
look-alike,

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.618
for stealing beer
from a market.

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:38.872
The clerk didn’t notice
because HE WAS ON A BREAK!

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:40.540
Cheers to you,
Museum Of The Bible,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.794
for admitting five of your most
famed artifacts are fake.

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:48.090
One of the them being the Bible.
I am a Christian.

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:53.804
Cheers to you, Snapchat,

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:57.391
for help registering
400,000 voters in the midterms.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:00.060
I can’t wait for South Carolina
to elect Deez Nuts.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.400
Cheers to you, John Mayer,
for sleeping with 500 women.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.195
500 women
and zero allegations?!

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.281
That’s how you know
he made them cum.

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:16.535
Cheers to you, Sarah Silverman,

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:19.204
for letting Louis C.K.
masturbate in front of you.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:22.541
I cannot wait for that remake
of A Star is Born.

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:28.714
And cheers to you, Fendi,

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:31.341
for putting out a shawl
that looks like a vagina.

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.594
Mine looks more like a knock-off
in any back room in Chinatown.

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:36.930
(off-screen laughing)

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.182
Well done, Hannah. Well done.

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.893
Another great episode
of Cheers to You.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.603
And you can check out
our regular show

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.315
Every Damn Day on the Comedy
Central YouTube page,

00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:48.358
where this week,
we did episodes about the best

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:51.486
Jordan Peele character,
a round-up of Florida Man news,

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.363
and we even did,
for Halloween,

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:55.115
a ghost peppered
candy challenge.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.909
This is the reason
why this video gets dislikes -

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.163
is you walking on,
and making an ass of the show.

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:03.081
Cheers.
