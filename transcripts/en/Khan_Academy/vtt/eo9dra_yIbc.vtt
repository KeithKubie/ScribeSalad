00:00:00.028 --> 00:00:01.311
- [Teacher] We're given
an f of x and they say,

00:00:01.311 --> 00:00:02.787
what is the coefficient for the term

00:00:02.787 --> 00:00:07.286
containing x plus two to the fourth power

00:00:07.286 --> 00:00:10.105
in the Taylor polynomial,

00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:13.605
centered at x equals negative two of f?

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.315
So like always, see if you
can take a stab at this video

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:21.032
on your own before we
work through it together.

00:00:21.032 --> 00:00:22.665
Alright, now let's do this.

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:26.764
So in general, our Taylor
polynomial, p of x,

00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:28.317
it's going to have the form and remember,

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:30.894
we're centering at x equals negative two

00:00:30.894 --> 00:00:34.522
so this means we're going
to evaluate our function

00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:36.774
at where we're centering it.

00:00:36.774 --> 00:00:39.516
We are going to divide
it by zero factorial

00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:40.419
which is just one.

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:42.849
I'm just gonna write 'em all
out just so you see the pattern

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:45.261
and we could even say
that's gonna be times

00:00:45.261 --> 00:00:47.636
x minus where we're centering it

00:00:47.636 --> 00:00:48.942
but if we're subtracting a negative two,

00:00:48.942 --> 00:00:51.765
it's gonna be x plus two and I
could write to the zero power

00:00:51.765 --> 00:00:53.159
but once again, that's
just going to be one

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.462
so a lot of times, you won't
see someone write this and this

00:00:55.462 --> 00:00:56.625
but I'm writing it just to show

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:58.235
that there's a consistent pattern.

00:00:58.235 --> 00:01:01.226
So then you're gonna have
plus the first derivative

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:03.351
evaluated at negative two

00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:06.139
divided by one factorial
which is still just one

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:10.071
times x plus two to the first power

00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:14.649
plus the second derivative
evaluated at negative two

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.154
over two factorial times
x plus two squared.

00:01:19.154 --> 00:01:20.952
I think you see where this is going

00:01:20.952 --> 00:01:22.876
and really all we care about is the one

00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:24.431
that has a fourth degree term and,

00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:26.274
well, actually, let me just
write the third degree term too

00:01:26.274 --> 00:01:28.157
just so we get fluent doing this.

00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:32.539
So the third derivative
evaluated at negative two

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.706
over three factorial times x
plus two to the third power

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.993
and now, this is the part
that we really care about,

00:01:40.993 --> 00:01:43.896
plus the fourth derivative.

00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:45.247
I could have just written a four there

00:01:45.247 --> 00:01:47.692
but I think you get what I'm saying.

00:01:47.692 --> 00:01:50.690
And then evaluate at x equals negative two

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.909
divided by four factorial times x plus two

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.874
to the fourth power.

00:01:56.874 --> 00:01:58.594
So what's the coefficient here?

00:01:58.594 --> 00:02:01.788
Well, the coefficient is this business.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.423
So we'd have to take the fourth derivative

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:06.512
of our original function.

00:02:06.512 --> 00:02:07.738
We gotta take the fourth derivative

00:02:07.738 --> 00:02:09.784
of that original function,
evaluate at negative two

00:02:09.784 --> 00:02:12.677
and divide it by four
factorial so let's do that.

00:02:12.677 --> 00:02:14.824
So our function,

00:02:14.824 --> 00:02:18.422
so our first derivative, f
prime of x is just going to be,

00:02:18.422 --> 00:02:19.978
just gonna use the power rule a lot,

00:02:19.978 --> 00:02:23.895
six x to the fifth minus three x squared.

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:28.410
Second derivative is going to be equal to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.521
five times six is 30 x to the fourth.

00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:35.654
Two times three, minus
six x to the first power.

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:37.820
Third derivative.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.724
Third derivative of x
is going to be equal to

00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:44.391
four times 30 is 120 x to the third power

00:02:46.386 --> 00:02:50.339
minus six and then the fourth derivative

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.109
which is what we really care about

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.646
is going to be three times 120

00:02:54.646 --> 00:02:57.229
is 360 x to the second power

00:02:58.943 --> 00:03:01.116
and the derivative of a
constant is just zero.

00:03:01.116 --> 00:03:04.674
So if we were to evaluate
this at x equals negative two,

00:03:04.674 --> 00:03:07.007
so f, the fourth derivative,

00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:10.202
evaluated when x equals negative two

00:03:10.202 --> 00:03:14.334
is going to be 360 times
negative two squared is four.

00:03:14.334 --> 00:03:16.431
I'm just gonna keep
that as 360 times four.

00:03:16.431 --> 00:03:18.324
We can obviously evaluate that

00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:20.194
but we're gonna have to
divide it by four factorial

00:03:20.194 --> 00:03:24.085
so the whole coefficient is
going to be 360 times four

00:03:24.085 --> 00:03:25.297
which is the numerator here

00:03:25.297 --> 00:03:26.730
divided by four factorial,

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.290
divided by four times
three times two times one.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.725
Well, four divided by four,

00:03:31.725 --> 00:03:33.877
those are just gonna be one.

00:03:33.877 --> 00:03:37.859
360 divided by three, maybe
I'll think of it this way,

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.859
360 divided by six is going to be 60

00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:43.420
and so that's all we have.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.994
We have 60 and then in the
denominator we just have a one

00:03:45.994 --> 00:03:49.067
so this is going to simplify to 60.

00:03:49.067 --> 00:03:52.150
That's the coefficient for this term.
