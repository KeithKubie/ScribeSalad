00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.770
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.060
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Alexander
Brown: Hi everyone.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.280
My name is Nick Brown, I'm
a music specialist here

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.580
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.530
I work at the music division as
concert producer for our series

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.120
that takes place over
in Coolidge Auditorium.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.080 position:56%
Nice to see many friendly and
familiar faces, and also nice to see

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.630
so many new faces to our lecture
series here in the music division.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.120 position:56%
The talk today is going to be on boy
bands in the Library of Congress,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.850
which is a topic that probably
hasn't been covered so much

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.310
in public events here but I
think it should be covered more.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.610
The title is Hair Gel and
Groupies, which has nothing to do

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.420
with anything aside from
they're somewhat related topics

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.430
to boyband culture in terms of
there's a lot of hair gel going

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.510
on with musicians, as you'll
see in some of the photos.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.570
And young tween groupies were
also a thing and continue

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.360 position:56%
to be a thing with boy band culture.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.130
So just a bit about the format
of what we're going to do today.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.760
I'm going to kind of introduce a
thesis statement for you to ponder.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.490
And then my goal is to kind
of introduce you to some

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.560
of the different types of materials
we have relative to boybands,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.430
also introduce two different
kind of broad definitions

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.910
of what a boy band might be.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.100
And then, hopefully have some
fun, and there's going to be a lot

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.550 position:56%
of listening and viewing to be done.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.540
For those that are watching this
webcast at some date in the future,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.420
unfortunately the videos are
under copyright so I'm not going

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.380
to be able to include them in
the webcast version of this.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.680
However, everything is on YouTube,
which is where I pulled them from.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.450 position:56%
And actually most of them are up
there legally which is kind of cool.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.530
So if you can just go on YouTube
and search for the artist name

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.850
and the title and you'll
find the appropriate video.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.140
Okay. So there are two
directions we can go

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.200
in with definitions for boy bands.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.440
[Laughter] Oh, it gets better.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.820
Well, geeze sorry.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.390
Thank you James Wintle.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.670
Any who, so there are two avenues
in which we can define boy bands;

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.600
the first sort of more commonly
used is referring to pop group --

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.830
male pop groups from the 90s
and into the 21st century

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.150
that particularly appealed
to young teen women,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.660 position:56%
which is a market segment of course.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.000
And a broader definition of it.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.410
Actually we'll go back and
retroactively apply boy bands

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.390
as a term to things -- to
entities like the Beetles or a lot

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.060 position:56%
of the Motown bands are in groups
like The Temptations, the Four Tops.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.710 position:56%
And specifically with the 90s groups
we see a lineage that goes back

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.170
to the Jackson Five of course,

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.020
and some other folks
that we'll see in here.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.400
There is an official Library
of Congress subject heading

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.620
for boy bands, which
is really awesome,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.000
and there is also a Grove Music
Online article about boy bands,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.490
which means it's so conservative

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.050
in mainstream society
that it's in Grove.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.990
So also the Oxford Dictionaries
have it listed as quote,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.510
"a pop group composed of
attractive young men whose music

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.430
and image are designed
to appeal primarily

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.980
to a young teenage audience."

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.180
And there you can see the
record for the Library

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.070
of Congress subject
heading of "boy bands,"

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.870
and then this is the visualization
of the subject heading,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.920
so you can see a broader
scope would be vocal groups.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.030
I do want to mention that I'm
mainly a classical music guy,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.440
but I grew up listening to all
this 90s boy band pop stuff,

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.910
even though I was not a
teenage girl, so what that says

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.500
about the stereotype I don't know.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.650
Since the Library of Congress
started accepting copyrights

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.000
in the 19th Century --
well in the 19th Century --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.370
and we also had some going
back earlier than that,

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.900
the institution has been
a repository for American

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.930
and global cultural memory.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.610
And whether or not we like it boy
band culture is a part of history.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.410
And there [are] a lot of folks in
mainstream musicological circles

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.300
who think there is no merit in
studying popular music culture,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.370
and that is nonsense if you ask me,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.530
and they need to broaden
their horizons a little bit.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.880
It doesn't mean that they need to
study pop music but someone should,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.880
and therefore it is the Library
of Congress' duty to collect

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.350
and preserve items relevant to
important trends in history,

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.190
particularly American history.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.370
So there's a very important
dependence on places like Library

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.640
of Congress as a repository
institution,

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.160
and also comparable institutions
like the Grammy Museum,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.250
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, also
various centers for popular music

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.360
and popular culture studies that
exist at various universities.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.360
All of these folks are working to
make content available to those

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.250
that want to study
it, which is great.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.110
Here's that Oxford Music Online
article, it's under copyright

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.230 position:56%
so I just gave you a little snippet,
and is by a guy named Craig Jenix

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.880
who also wrote the entries
for most of the boy bands

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.050
who are actually listed in Oxford
Music Online, which is cool.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.630
And his article is
quite entertaining,

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.190 position:56%
I'll give you a little excerpt here.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.340 position:56%
There's several different key
ingredients to the boy band concept.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.790
Right? So there's some
kind of sex appeal

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.980 position:56%
for young women, and also young men.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:47.240
And there is a certain
kind of conflict

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.560
because these boy bands are
appealing to teenage girls

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.900
who are not 18, so there has to be
a very PG rated of appeal going on,

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.950
which is tricky and I'm
sure someone can study that.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.000
There's also certain involvement
with dance as you can see

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.010
with Backstreet Boys or Nsync.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.730 position:56%
Music videos and the dance that went
into productions has a huge role

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.520
and is probably more
impressive or more entertaining

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.120
than the music in many cases.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.190 position:56%
So going back to Craig Jenix's
description here, I'll share a quote

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.870
with you which is kind of funny.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.470
So "despite the frequent use

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.890
of subtle sexual euphemisms they
typically emphasize the emotional

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.340
connection over physical, making
the genre culturally appropriate

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.280
for adolescent participation.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.480
They presented their lyrics
through uncomplicated harmonies,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.100
which is probably the most positive
way that's ever been described,

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.760
and accessible song structures."

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.750
So he kind of puts forth
this structure and this model

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.210
for boy bands which I think we
can go back and apply to any

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.870
of the bands we're going
to talk about today,

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.860
in that the boy bands
were representative

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.820
of the different archetypes in sort
of young man, young male culture.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.300
So there's the jock.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.030
He also uses clown, the
rebel, the heartthrob,

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.470
and the hot mess pretty
much -- I added that one in.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.250
You can see in, I think
it's Backstreet Boys,

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.550
the guy with dreads.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.750
That's not a good thing.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.070
So why do we collect and
preserve these materials?

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.510
I gave a bit of an intro,
but for anyone who likes

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.650
to criticize my interest in
this I point you to the mission

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.120
of the Library of Congress,
which says,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.360
"The library's essential
mission is to provide Congress

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.040
and then the federal government and
the American people with a rich,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.230
diverse, and enduring
source of knowledge.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.920
That can be relied upon to
inform, inspire, and engage them,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.350
and support their intellectual
and creative endeavors."

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.180
And this is the cover of
the new strategic plan

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.260
for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.620
There's some other bits within
the strategic plan that kind

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.090
of give us the justification
for doing this work,

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.150
including "The Library of Congress
is a chief steward of America's

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.690
and the world's record of
knowledge and is a springboard

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.150 position:56%
to the future while providing
indispensable services to Congress."

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.760
Now, Congress probably isn't going

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.710 position:56%
to come borrowing a One Direction
book but some of you staffers might,

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.260
and there is certainly a
need to have an understanding

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.870
of performing arts copyright
-- things like recordings,

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.700 position:56%
and sheet music, and such, and these
materials can serve as a resource

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.010
for that, especially in terms
of figuring out who owns what.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.370
And there are some
lawsuits going on,

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.890
which we'll talk about
in a little while.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.790
There are some values that are
pointed out in the strategic plan

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.600
that I'd also like to mention.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.600
Excerpts from the values are "...to
leverage the strength of diversity

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.270
in the library staff,
collections, and constituents."

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.800
Certainly there is diversity
if we bring in pop culture

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.040
with highbrow intellectual
culture such as art music.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.900
And also, in the core functions of
the Library of Congress, "Acquire,

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.040
describe, make accessible, secure
and preserve a universal collection

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.600
of knowledge in physical
and electronic formats.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.650
And obtain electronic
access for its own users

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.050
to digital materials
held by other entities."

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.840
And then, a second core function:
"Demonstrate the scope and value

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.660 position:56%
of library collection, staff
expertise, and resulting scholarship

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.570
through a variety of public
programs, such as this one,

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.490
publications and online
presentations."

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.100
So there is a -- an important
figure who I'd like to mention

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.620 position:56%
and this is probably the first time
he's being mentioned in relationship

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.560
to 90s pop bands, Oscar
Sonneck, who as the second chief

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.840
of the music division
really instilled this vision

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.140
of the Music Division collections
being the national performing arts

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:35.200
and music resource for study,
so a shout out to Oscar Sonneck.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.650
And one thing that was
part of his vision was

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.720
to "Create a musical
collection worthy

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.200
of America's national library,"
and also, "The development

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.200
of a collection reflecting
musical culture."

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:53.860
There is no value judgement placed
in that statement, so ponder that.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:58.330
There's some other reasons why
I think boybands are worthy

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.640
of our attention somewhat.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.180
They give a lot of context to
major issues happening in history.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.310
And as you'll see in some of
the materials that we'll look

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:12.660
at you can see fashion as it was
evolving from the 80s into 90s,

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.030
which some people argue is in
response to economic conditions

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.330
in the US and globally, post
Reagan, during Reagan, et cetera,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:26.160
and conflict with the Gulf War for
example if anyone saw the movie

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.120
"In the Army Now," which is also
probably the first time it's ever

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.890
been mentioned at the
Library of Congress.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.490 position:56%
A lot of the fashion statements made
in a film like that are reflected

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:40.010
in the images that you'll see
related to the pop bands here.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.980
Also if we look back
at larger scale topics

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.210
like the Civil Rights Movement,
there's major roles for music

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.200
and pop music in those topics.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.130
And the boy bands, whether we like
it or not, are part of the culture.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.900
So let's keep looking at it.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.740
So getting a little further into
this, there are three main areas

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.300
where we get our boy band
materials from, and this applies

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.310
to pretty much any
other kind of material.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.780
So copyright deposits,
which we mentioned earlier,

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.110
there are also the
donations of materials,

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.540
and then acquisitions
of special collections.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.510
We'll see in the images today,
and also the show and tell

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.860
that you can see in the
end that there are --

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.360 position:56%
most of the things you're going to
see are copyright deposit materials.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.170
But there [are] also situations
of boy bands being incorporated

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.640
into things like public
broadcasting news coverage,

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.160
in which case you can go into the
new archive of public broadcasting

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.580
to get more information and see
how the media is covering that.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.880
So hey, look at that --

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.650
it's reception history of boy
bands in public news making.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.920 position:56%
So some of the types of materials
we'll address are non-fiction books,

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.450
sheet music, memorabilia,
periodicals and newspapers,

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.700
also I'll add serials to
that list, audio recordings,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.710
and film and TV materials.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:07.350
So I'll kind of explain some

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.140
of the different materials
as we go through here.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.990 position:56%
This is a shelf in the music 420s --

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.460
ML 420s, where there [are] a
whole ton of Beatles books,

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.590
which I just discovered
for the first time

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.850
because I generally
don't go to that section.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.020
But I went there now
and it was great.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.100
There's a lot more about
the Beatles than a lot

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.400
of other really important
classical composers

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.140
who we pay much more attention to.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.830
So that is certainly a reflection

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:37.070
of popular culture creating
content related to popular music

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.100
that then [inaudible] -- so
there's more attention paid

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.170
by popular culture than
academia is my point there;

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.240
and you can see the result of this.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.760
And a lot of these
books are -- there's --

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:52.770
it's kind of biographical
sketches of them.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:57.950
There's also some strange
memorabilia books, like The Beatles

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.290
Down Under, which is a
title here you can see

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:01.750
in the orange on the left.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.640 position:56%
And then, there's also scholarly
publications related to the Beatles.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.540
There's the complete
Idiot's Guide to The Beatles,

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.940
The Cambridge Companion
to the Beatles (which

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.280
if anyone's a classical music
scholar, the Cambridge companions

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.550
to composers are really great),
The Beatle's Encyclopedia,

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:26.360 position:56%
The Beatles 365 Days -- this is like
a good coffee table book of photos,

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.160
and then we'll get into
the Jackson Five here.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.320
So we all know the Jackson Five?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.650
Does anyone not know who
the Jackson Five are?

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.240
Okay. Cool.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.260
So just for the inter-webs
world this was

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.760 position:56%
where Michael Jackson got his start,
it was a boy band formed in 1969

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.990
under the auspices
of Motown Records,

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.080
and they were modeled
after the Temptations.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.160
This is an example of an
item in the collections.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.540
This is a video recording that
came through copyright deposit

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:11.650
of a Soul Train episode that
featured the Jackson Five,

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.590
and we will get to watch it.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.860
Okay. So that's an example of
something that's a video format.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.060
Right? If we're going to keep
in mind the topic of fashion,

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.820
notice what they were wearing;
bell bottoms, really tight,

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.000
the hairdos were important.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.670
There's also certain dance
style reflected in the music,

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.640
and also note how they're very --

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.910
at least in that little
clip that we saw, --

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.590
focused behind the microphones.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.470
They're not running all around
as might have been the case

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.750
in other videos.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.470
This is an item that
you can see over here,

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:49.490
which is in that M421
world -- ML421, sorry.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.570
And it is a Michael
Jackson scrapbook,

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.590
so it is specifically
looking at his development

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.680
in the early years
of the Jackson Five.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.980
Some cool photos.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.670
And just for you, over 100
never before seen photos

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.380
of Michael and his family.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:07.120
Does anyone know what this is?

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.190
Okay. Well yeah.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.490
It's sheet music.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.690
So we have a lot of marching
band scores, totally random

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.860
but we're the repository for
copyright, so we're the place

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.160
that would have them aside

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.760
from performing arts
library that does band music.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:26.040
What's interesting is if you look

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:32.130
at the marching band music there's
a certain level of repertoire

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.840
that gets into that world.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:39.280
So you'll see here two of
the Jackson Five songs.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.630
I'm sure these things exist
but the Backstreet Boy

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:48.140 position:56%
and Nsync marching band arrangements
have yet to be found by me

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.220
in our collections, and
that might be a result

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.820
of the arrangers just
not submitting them.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.030
But I can say somehow
there's a greater value

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.070
to the Jackson Five
artistically than Backstreet Boys,

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.020
which I don't know that
anyone would disagree with.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.950
And just to give you another
taste of Jackson Five.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:12.100
Cool. So we're seeing changes in
costuming, even from 1970 to 1971.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.230
This is of course not a
large enough sample size

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.450
to determine something definitive,

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.810
but you can see there's a lot
more dancing going on at least

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.500
with Michael Jackson in this case.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.430
And the white pants with
the Christmas tree is --

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.730
are interesting.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.540
Okay. So going to shift over
to the Latin American world now

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.930
with a pop boy band called Menudo.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:58.050
Woo. [Laughter] I don't
think I was born

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:02.250
yet when they were
a thing, I'm sorry.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.180
[Laughter] It's okay.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:10.860 position:56%
So Menudo originally formed in 1977,
they were based out of Puerto Rico.

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.420
And one funny fact about their
band was that the singers used

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:20.500
to originally get kicked out when
they turned 16, because I guess

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.720
that was the barrier in
terms of the PG-ness.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.350
There's a funny term used by
the writer in Grove Music Online

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:32.720
about them called Menudo-Mania
in terms of the hype around them,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.670
they became more popular in
the United State in the 80s.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:40.510
And over time there were 30
plus singers on their stage,

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.610
not at the same time, but they
kind of rotated in and out

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:44.340
because of that age limit.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.370 position:56%
So here you see a kind of, you know,

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:51.880
juvenile memorabilia book
from 1984 about them.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.390
One thing that I do have to say
about the library's collections

00:17:55.390 --> 00:18:05.310
with regard to boy bands is that
non-US based boy bands are not

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.560
as represented in our
collections, for various reasons,

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.180
just like all kinds
of other topics--

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.760
in terms of if you go in
and look at Menudo compared

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.200
to Backstreet Boys there's
like 2000 times more content

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.500
for Backstreet Boys.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.590 position:56%
And the place where there is more of
the Latin American boy band music is

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.030
in the copyright deposits
of sound recordings.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:29.240
And I think that there's a lot
work that we can do in terms of,

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.780
you know, if we find people
who have private collections

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.840
of Menudo memorabilia for
example and there's a division

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.980
in the library that is
interested in growing that area

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.830
of collections then it, you
know, maybe that's a good thing

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.990
to look into, but I'm not a manager

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:48.420
so I don't have any
say, that's okay.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.640
Here you can see one of
those musical recordings.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.720
Interesting thing about RCA
Victor, does anyone know the story

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.460
about Carl Engel and bringing

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:02.070
in Victor Talking recordings
back in the 20s?

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.310 position:56%
Does anyone know who Carl Engel was?

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.640 position:56%
No music division people can answer?

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.280
So Carl Engel was the third
chief of the music division.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:15.180
He came into office in
1922 and lasted until 1934,

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.680 position:56%
in which case he got a more powerful
job outside, I guess he saw it

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.090
that way; he went to become
president of G. Schirmer.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.010
And when he came into the
music division he was all

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.350
about growing the collections
and fulfilling the mission

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.850
that Sonic had put in
place previous to him.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:36.300 position:56%
Engel developed a relationship with
the Victor Talking Record company --

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.090
Victor Talking Machine company.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:42.360
And he kind of haggled them
for two years to get them

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:46.150 position:56%
to donate recordings of commercial
releases and other unpublished stuff

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.320
to the library to develop
a sound collection.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.250
And there was some wax cylinder
that existed somewhere before,

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:55.580
but in the literature that I've
found it said that Engel's project

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.270
with the Victor Company was really
the beginning of our sound archive

00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.720
in the sense that we know today.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.760
So over the course of
Engel's tenure they brought

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.060
in a few thousand recordings.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.590
Some of those were selected
by Engel and his staff

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.490
from the Victor catalogues.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:13.000
And later on, as the relationship
kind of weakened a bit,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.670
the Victor Company
was just sending stuff

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.530
that they thought would
be worthwhile

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.910
for the music division
sound collections.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.160
And nowadays there's a whole
recorded sound section as we know

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.620
and they have over 3.5
million recordings.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.890 position:56%
So it's kind of cool that the former
chief of the music division had

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.560
such an impact over time
starting from a little idea

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.660
and pestering of a
commercial entity.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:38.360
Here you can see a little picture
of Menudo from a record cover

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.530
in 1982, note the attire.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:47.840
And if we go back, note the
attire here, note the haircuts.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.240
The mullet was in fashion, right?

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.360
I don't get the see through quality

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.060
of this though, that's
kind of weird.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:02.400
This is a picture of
Menudo in New York City.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.490
And I thank Kareliz Rodriguez
for sending it me today,

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.800
and it is from the Puerto
Rican digital library.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.910
And this was taken in 1984
at Radio City Music Hall.

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:21.180
That's kind of cool,
they look happy.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.200
Then here's another picture
from about 1977 or 1978,

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.140
there are all original Menudo
members in this picture,

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.970
and this is also from the
Puerto Rican Digital Library.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:41.120
So now we've arrived at 1990.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.640
Menudo, oh my gosh.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:49.990
So the title of the album in the
song is No Me Corten El Pelo,

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.760
which means Don't Cut My Hair.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.780
[Laughter] For anyone that
survived this era I think was --

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.210
you know, there was a
lot of long hair going

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:02.460 position:56%
on with teenage rebellion with boys.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.010
And -- yes.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.860
And boys wearing headbands
and that kind of stuff.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.650 position:56%
So you can see that all, and there's
even the depiction of the scissors

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.800
with a do not cut symbol there.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:21.630
And the record from the
collection here is of a VHS tape

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.990
of a performance of this album.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.720
Cool. So you can keep watching
that on YouTube if you'd like.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.950
It is not up there legally, so
we are adopting fair use for the

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.840
in person portion of this lecture,
and then [please] go Google it

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.180
if you want to watch it at home.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.380
There are kind of weird
musical strands happening,

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:45.200
you could hear some throwbacks to,
like, 50s, early Elvis rock style.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.430
And then, we get into much more
Latin beat dance feel going

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:55.410
on at this point, which one could
say speaks to the complicated

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.540
and close relationship
between Puerto Rican culture

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.180
and American culture,
or the differences

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.470
between those two cultures.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:07.920
And just as a reminder,
that's what they used

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.220
to look like, quite a shock.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:17.270
I think there's even eyeliner
on the guy in the bottom left.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.570
Anyways, great.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.010
So the next group I'd like to
talk about is called New Edition.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.270
Does anyone remember them?

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:27.220
Yay. So funnily enough
they were also from Boston,

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.320
which is another group --
another group we're going to talk

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.790
about that's from Boston as well.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:36.170
They were established in 1978
and the song we're going to check

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.790
out is called Candy Girl, which
was one of their top hits.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:42.090
It's also the name this album here,
which was their main debut album.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.910
They were big in the 80s and
some of the other big songs were

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:50.190
"Can You Stand in the Rain" and
"Cool It Now," and "Candy Girl" was

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.070
by a gentleman named Maurice
Star who also has a role in some

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.640
of the later bands
that we'll discuss.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.950
And "Candy Girl" came in 1983.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.460
Cool. So as you can see, they
filmed on location in Boston;

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:08.060
the Hatch Shell was there and
then, then the John Handcock tower.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:12.590
And there were no windowpanes
falling down, oh well.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.760
Cool. So the next group
that we're going to talk

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.030
about is the one you've
probably all been waiting for.

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:28.580
There they are New
Kids on the Block --

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:34.660
later NKOTB, later KNOTB BSB with
Backstreet Boys -- very strange.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.810
I learned a lot, I'm telling you.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:43.670
So they were formed in
1985 by Maurice Star,

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:48.650
who was the guy behind New Edition,
and there's Boston ties there.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:54.090 position:56%
The original band had Joey McIntyre,
Jorden Knight, Jonathan Knight,

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.770
Danny Wood, Donnie Walberg,
who some of you might know

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.690
from Blue Bloods, which
is on TV now.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:05.140
It kind of went defunct in
1994, but they came back in 2011

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.290
for that CD recording
and also the tour

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.900
with the Backstreet Boys,
which is interesting.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.960
And here you see just kind of
one of these memorabilia books.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.320
This is called the "Only
Official Auto Biography

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.170
of America's Hottest Group, the
Inside Story Told in Their Words,"

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.110
and you can see it
over here for free.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:30.690
So I have a kind of
interesting connection to them.

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:32.890
It's not anything substantive,

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:36.220
but this is a house
where the Knights lived.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.950
Right. On Melville Ave.
in Boston is the just --

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:45.190
the street that runs down the side
of the Dorchester district court

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:49.220
and I lived there -- not in a house
but down the street for, like,

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.630
two years when I was
a kid growing up.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.850
It just - [was] actually at
the time when they sold it.

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.290
And their mom sold it to
the Salvation Army in 1996,

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:02.240
and now it is a sort of a
multi-purpose community outreach

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.220
and residential facility.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:09.320 position:56%
And apparently there are people
that do New Kids on the Block, like,

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.960
fan tours in Boston and there
are five sites that they, like,

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.770
go around, take pictures at.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:21.400
And they're all middle aged women
who do it, that's kind of funny.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.830
Anyways, so this is a kind
of interesting New Kids

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.420
on the Block related item.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.300
It is a book as you can see, and
the title is New Kids on the Block;

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.050
Oral Histories of Immigrant Teens.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.690
And it was published by
Scholastic I believe,

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:36.990
and you can see it over here.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:45.150
And it's the idea to kind of
portray their immigrant roots

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:50.930
in a positive happy
manner to youth and such.

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:53.700
Teenage immigrants from various
countries recount the emotional

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.890
experience of fleeing their
homelands and adjusting

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:57.600
to a new life in the United States.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:03.190
This is the photo you probably
saw in the event flyer.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:07.190
This is a juvenile
book about New Kids

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.620
on the Block, it came out in 1991.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:14.600
This resides in the ML3930
world where you can see stuff

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:19.320
from juvenile books about Leonard
Bernstein to One Direction,

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.510
which you'll see over there, and
New Kids on the Block and the like.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:27.530
The Menudo book is
also from this section.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.350 position:56%
Step By Step, one of their big hits.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:35.220
This a recording of that
by CBS Records in 1990,

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.580
you can still see Maurice
Star was producing.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:43.240
And now you'll get to hear it.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.350
Okay. Luckily these songs are
so repetitive you don't need

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.440
to listen to more than a minute.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:56.610
[Laughter]

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.140
Okay. So to get into
periodical and newspaper realm,

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.400
did you know there are
comic books about boy bands?

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.700
I didn't know that.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.000
I thought it was totally wild.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.870 position:56%
I used to read Calvin and Hobbes and
Spiderman, but apparently New Kids

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.170
on the Block was a thing to read.

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:14.800
And here you can see several comic
book records related to New Kids

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:20.590
on the Block in the newspaper and
current periodical reading room.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:26.300 position:56%
The titles are, Hanging Tough, Comic
Tour, Chillin', Backstage Pass,

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.550
and just New Kids on the Block.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:34.650
And here you can see Chillin'.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:39.450
Another way of describing these
comic books apparently is calling

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:43.750
them a digest magazine, because
they were clearly propaganda items

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:49.430
for the band and not about
making a big creative statement

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:50.840
for the comic book industry.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:56.150
This is another example, going
back to the film video collections,

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.210
an episode of "VH1 Behind The
Music," which I'm sure some

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:02.640
of you used to watch or still watch
if it exists still, I don't know.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.950
I was more of an MTV guy, sorry.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:08.060
And this was actually from when --

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.920
from 2008, it was kind
of a reunion attempt.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.940 position:56%
There was a Richie Rich New Kids on
the Block comic book, and we have it

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.240
because no one else does.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:35.520
And because the boy bands are
commercial successes generally,

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.990
if you make it to these
groups' level,

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:42.510
once they break apart there's
always avenues for reuniting,

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:44.780
which happened when
New Kids on the Block

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.430
and Backstreet Boys
did their tour in 2011.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:50.710
And then, also some of the folks
go off in their own directions,

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:54.020
like Jorden Knight, who did a
whole remix album of New Kids

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:59.970
on the Block songs, which we have
because no one else bought it.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:01.270
[Laughter]

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.110
And this is a picture from
him performing in that tour

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:06.030
with the Back Street Boys.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:13.830
And there is the official
publicity for NKOTBSB.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.280
And we have that recording.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.470 position:56%
Kind of seems like an attempt to get
people who grew up during New Kids

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:29.390
on the Block era and their children
who grew up in Backstreet Boys era

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.440
to listen to the same thing.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.380
This is an example of sort of
a pop culture book that we have

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.560 position:56%
in the music division's collections,
it's called, Boyz and the Bandz,

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.310
the hottest men in music from Elvis

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:45.740
to Nsync universe,
and Donald F Rider.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:49.180
I guess was the author.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.920
[Inaudible] [Laughter]
In the bottom left.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.200
So this is an example of a kind
of literature, even if it's kind

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:01.180 position:56%
of memorabilia fan books existing to
kind of bring this topic together,

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:04.010
even though this is a little
broader, but it kind of refers

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.660
to that sex appeal topic.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:10.800 position:56%
Boyz II Men, another great boy band.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:16.480
They are probably one of the more
functional reunion type groups.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.590
They're still touring and as we
all know hopefully, they performed

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:27.270
in the Gershwin Prize
in 2014 with Billy Joel.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:31.370
This is again from that juvenile
section 3930, and the book is

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:32.670
over here for you to see.

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.010
Note their fashion
choices down there, 1997.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:38.870
Less overalls, shorter
hair, more buttoned up.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:40.470
It looks like they're at
an awards show though,

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:42.770
so that might explain it.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.240
Cool. And just a funny story, he
forgot his cufflinks that night

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.970
and he borrowed mine, just
kind of [a] good story.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.720
This is an example of a choral
octavo score of an arrangement

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.240
of pop music: a Boyz II
Men song, "Water Runs Dry,"

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.940
written by Babyface -- and it's
also available in TTBB and SAB

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:13.740
if anyone's interested
in purchasing them.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.680
This is probably one
of the better avenues

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.220 position:56%
for sheet music revenue I would say.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.430
Since, you know, high school choirs
all over the country might want

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.010
to perform current pop songs.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:29.530
And there's a market, so of course
we would hope these would exist

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:33.760
with copyright permission from
the original copyright holder.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.230
All right.

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.360
Switching to another
Latin group, Chamos,

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.960
which was a Venezuelan group.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.470
And here is a record for one of
their reunion recordings from 2008.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:50.420
This is a group that probably
didn't want to reunite,

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.210
and you'll see why in a moment.

00:32:52.210 --> 00:33:00.620
It's kind of funny, but let's see.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.540
This group was much less
influential than Menudo

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:08.480
and they didn't last quite as
long, but it gives you a sense of,

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.490
you know, things that were
trendy in other parts of the US

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.610
and Latin America trickling
down to South America as well.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:16.910
That's about all I
can handle, sorry.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:21.880
It's fun, I was having a ball
in the office this morning.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.610
So this is a song called
"Siempre te amaré,"

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.970
which is "I'll Always Love You."

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:29.010
Now for the reunion video.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:35.150
It's an example of pop stars aging.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:40.980 position:56%
So anyways I think that was pulled
from like a daytime talk show thing,

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:44.060
which has a certain
audience and demographic.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.270
Did in anyone in here
buy that reunion CD?

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:54.420
No? Okay. Okay.

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:58.890
So a little known secret
to all of the 90s

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:03.820
and early-21st century boy band
and sort of mainstream pop music is

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:07.230
that most of it was
written by one guy.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:13.100
And this is him, his name is
Max Martin, he was born in 1971.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:17.990 position:56%
So he wrote hits for folks like
Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys,

00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:23.830
Nsync, Kelly Clarkson, Pink, Katy
Perry, Glee, T-Swift, AKA Tay,

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:28.310
AKA Taylor Swift -- who we
like because she gives money

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:33.430
to classical music organizations
[like the] Seattle Symphony

00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:36.210
and then the Nashville
Symphony in particular.

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:43.200
So some of the specific songs with
him include, "I Want It That Way,"

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.050
"Oops I Did It Again,"
"You Drive Me Crazy,"

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:50.740
"You Hit Me Baby One More
Time," [and] "California Girls."

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:55.450
He has had I believe it was
over 21 number one hits,

00:34:55.450 --> 00:35:01.680
which has only been topped by Paul
McCartney and one other person.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.430
And all told he has about
58 plus songs that made it

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:08.400
to the top ten charts
of the Billboard charts.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.890 position:56%
So I think he's making lot more
money than all of these other people

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:14.190
if he held onto his copyright.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.750
So segue to the Backstreet Boys.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:23.690
Yay! This was my favorite boy
band when I was growing up.

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:27.830
They were established in 1993,
originally in Orlando Florida.

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:31.470
The first -- the original
members were Nick Carter, Howie --

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:33.560
I don't know how to
pronounce that, sorry.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.710
Brian Latrell, A.J. McLean,
and Kevin Richardson.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:40.740
They've now sold over
130 million records,

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.780
and some folks call them
the most successful boy band

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.660
of all time as a result of that.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.710
They have some legal troubles
going on with their management,

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.310
and it's been a problem
I guess for several years

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:55.150 position:56%
where management wasn't giving them
what they thought they were entitled

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:59.220
to in terms of performance fees
and royalties and kind of business.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.360
Sadly, not uncommon.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.200
So this is an example of, you know,

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.570
not the most valuable
intellectual book.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:14.010
It is a Backstreet Boys quiz
book, which you can glance

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.480
at over there if you would like.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:22.400
This is an official Backstreet
Boys book from the 421 world.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:30.720
You can see, well, Nick
Carter's hair didn't change much.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:34.790
I was hoping it had.

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:37.980
And this is a MARC record
of "I Want It That Way."

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.140
Who knew? So you can see
here that we got this --

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:44.250
I think this was a music video.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:50.670
Yes. And it came in
through copyright,

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:56.380
you can see there the copyright
classification number and such.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.680
And here's the video.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.890
So my funny story with the
Backstreet Boys and that song is

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:08.500
in sixth grade we had to do a
project where we took a pop song

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.400
and talked about ancient China
history and re-did the lyrics.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.840
So my song was called
the China Stomp

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.750
and it was set to I
Want It That Way.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.220
That's kind of funny.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.740
But anyway, so this is kind of one

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.670
of the quirkier little
memorabilia books

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.780
that we have, it's about yea big.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.730
And if you look at the table
it's actually standing up,

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:29.610
it's the only item standing up.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:35.110 position:56%
Back in the day when we had Borders
and actual plentiful huge bookstores

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:39.330
around there were often those
little tiny kitschy books

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:42.690
at the checkout counter, so
that's that kind of concept.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:45.050
We also had the one
for Nsync, don't worry.

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:49.040
It's kind of like the
Schoenberg, Stravinsky things,

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.270
Nsync or Backstreet Boys, sorry.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.570
Pick sides.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:38:01.900
So -- and believe it or not
we also have karaoke CDs.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:09.200
Yay! So this is the karaoke CD from
1999 that included Backstreet Boys'

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:17.040
"I'll Never Break Your
Heart," and sorts of things

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.730
that are beyond what
you would expect.

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:23.230
We have things like episodes of
Larry King Live in the collections,

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.750
and the Backstreet Boys
appeared on Larry King Live.

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:32.810
So someone could come up
with a paper on that somehow.

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:37.630 position:56%
What's interesting though is it's a
reunion kind of performance in 2001,

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.390
so that comes with
interesting things.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:43.530
Also does anyone remember
Now That's What I call Music?

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:45.240
Apparently they're
up to, like, 40 plus

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.130
or 50 plus now, which is insane.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:51.100
But Now That's What I Call
Music 2 came out in 1999

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:55.800 position:56%
and it included Backstreet Boys, and
you can see some of the other groups

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.010
on here, Brittany Spears,
Sheryl Crow,

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:01.050
Fat Boy slim, JayZ, U2, et cetera.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:05.310 position:56%
And for those that don't know these,
they are kind of compilation CDs

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:10.610
of the top hits every so often,
and there were many ads for these

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:15.330
on MTV and VH1 back in the day.

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.660
So Nsync, many of us know them.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:22.660
Here's another quiz
book, very exciting.

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:27.570
So this is my favorite
item that I've found --

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:33.360
there's a CD-Rom software slash
game called the Nsync Hotline

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:38.000
and we have it, and this is
a little screenshot from it.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.240
And what was interesting
about this game is

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.770 position:56%
that there was a fantasy phone and
game controller which you would plug

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.890
into your computer so
that you could then speak

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:47.880
to the members of the band.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.980
And the software had
little responses programmed

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.270
in so you could interact with them.

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:59.040
Yeah, and it's under
juvenile software.

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:10.340
There are fantastic fold
out photos in this book.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:15.770
Oh, and there are the dreads on
the second guy from the left.

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:19.740 position:56%
Cool. This is just kind of an iconic
photo that describes I think a lot

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:24.760 position:56%
of people's childhood in the 90s --
if you were coming of age when Nsync

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.940
and Backstreet Boys were big.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:32.050
And this is of course "No Strings
Attached," you get the joke.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.120
Oh, this was also gym pants time.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.670
I don't know if these are leather
or not, but gym pants were a thing

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.930
and people wore them all
time, pre-yoga pants.

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:43.860
And the little -- if you
see the guy on the left --

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.900
the zipper on the bottom so
that you could open up the legs.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:53.280
And just for kicks, "Bye Bye Bye."

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.570
Cool. We're nearing
the end, don't worry.

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:59.970
Okay. Here's an example of
piano vocal guitar sheet music

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:02.540
for "Tearin' Up My Heart,"
one of Nsync's hits that's

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.790
in our collections, M1630.2.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:14.160
This is the One Direction section
of a shelf in the 3930s I think.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.940
There's a lot more One Direction
than most other boy bands

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.600
and I don't know why that is,

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:23.640
maybe they just have a
good marketing person.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.290
This is the very One
Direction [item]

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:28.130
that sparked my whole
interest in this topic,

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:31.760
because I thought it was cool
and very out of place in the rows

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:35.810 position:56%
and rows of classical music shelves.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:39.380
We'll give you a little
taste of One Direction.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:44.060
You get it.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.190
So interesting things
about One Direction.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:49.810
They were originally
solo auditionees

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:51.670
on the X-Factor UK the TV show.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:53.190
And then Simon Cowell
kind of decided

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:55.760
that they would make some money
if they were singing together.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:01.070
So they reentered the X-Factor as
an ensemble and placed third place.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.730
And after that point it was
about 2012 when they exploded

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:06.810
in the international
scene, and since then one

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:10.850
of the guys has departed and
there's drama and apparently he --

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:15.290
I think today his new
solo thing charted ahead

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.730
of the One Direction stuff.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:26.460
Anyways so -- that just
appeared in my Facebook feed,

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:30.370
I didn't go seeking
it out, I promise.

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:34.270
So this is some more of the One
Direction goodies that we have.

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:37.810
Some more of the -- fan book.

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:43.440
You can see again hairstyles
have changed since the 'fro era.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.600
We're going to skip that one.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.890 position:56%
Cool. So we have arrived at the end.

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:51.860
I want to just kind of remind
you of some resources if you'd

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:55.790
like to get further into
pop music studies here

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:58.430
at the library or boy band studies.

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.130
Catalog.loc.gov -- our
online catalogue --

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:03.180
is a great place to start.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.100
If you have trouble there
ask a reference specialist

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.670
in the music division or
recorded sound section,

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:12.120
et cetera; they are your friends.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:16.890
For example, I learned from one
colleague that we don't have much

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:21.340
of the pop music copyright deposits
because there was a certain point

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.740 position:56%
when the legislation changed and
recordings were able to be submitted

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.920
to cover all of the copyright.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:32.130
So for example, with Mr. Martin,
who composed all of those songs

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:34.680
for Backstreet Boys, Nsync, et
cetera, we only have a handful

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:39.130
of his songs of all of those
20 something number ones

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:43.510
and 50 something top ten in
terms of sheet music form.

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:46.800
But we do have all the
recordings for sure.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:50.030
There is a popular music
encyclopedia that we have available

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.630
in the music division's
performing art's reading room,

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:56.840
and that is a reference item
that you can use in there.

00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:02.650
This is the entry for New Kids on
the Block in that encyclopedia.

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:07.970
We also have various pop
music serials and journals

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:11.710
that address these topics
in a scholarly level --

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.770
or in a scholarly manner.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:17.490
This is another journal here
called "Popular Music and Society."

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:21.730
We have Billboard magazines,
so if you want to see

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.180
from the horse's mouth who did
what at what point in terms

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:29.860
of charting you can check that out.

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.930
Seventeen magazine -- we
have that in our collections.

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:36.410
I didn't know that
until I looked this up.

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:39.450
But if we're thinking about the
way that boy bands are marketed

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:45.370
to teenage women and
young women an item

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:47.920
like Seventeen magazine is a
source of seeing, you know,

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.220
what was being done in marketing.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.040
So if you're a marketer
for, you know,

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:57.100
the music business there's some
value in that kind of a material.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.450
These are commemorative
covers, so you can collect all

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:01.180
of the One Direction members.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:08.560
And for the academics who like
to hate, The Learned Society

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.290
for Musicology has a popular
music study group, and the purpose

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:17.340
of that study group is to advocate
for popular music resources

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.060
and scholarship, and also to
raise awareness about the fact

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.610
that this is a legitimate
scholarly pursuit.

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:28.440
And I think in certainly musicology
worlds there are more jobs perhaps

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.790
coming open for people who are
doing things like ethnomusicology

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:34.310
and pop music studies than
another Bach specialist,

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:36.750
because a lot of those Bach
specialists exist and hold

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:40.190
onto those jobs until they
don't want them anymore.

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:41.660
So a bunch of thank you's.

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.410 position:56%
Thanks to the music division for
allowing me to do this curator talk,

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:48.100 position:56%
I really enjoyed putting it together
and sharing some kind of quirky bits

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.600
from our collections with you.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:54.210
Thanks to Sue Vita and Jan
Lauridsen for allowing us to these.

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:58.410
Also Hispanic Cultural Society and
LC-Globe for supporting my work

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:00.670
and also helping getting the
word out about this event

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.280
and all of our curator talks.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.380
Also Carl Engel for kind of
changing the culture and bringing

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.240
in recordings in the 1920s.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:12.320
That's a huge deal and our
collections are so rich

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.600
because of the recordings
that we have.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.600
And also, Backstreet Boys just
for being fun and entertaining.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.510
And that's it, thank you.

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:24.390
