talk a little bit about the awoken and
also some problems we can face that

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329
also some problems we can face that
 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.319

the future API or something it's mean is
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.649
the future API or something it's mean is
not perfect yet maybe so because a

you can see that market and the business

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259
you can see that market and the business
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.830
you can see that market and the business
is merging between a pc and mobile more

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
is merging between a pc and mobile more
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.130
is merging between a pc and mobile more
and more like new genre in mobile

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140
and more like new genre in mobile
 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.570
and more like new genre in mobile
and PvP games the what we've seen

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580
and PvP games the what we've seen
 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.300
and PvP games the what we've seen
similar with the MMORPG in APEC so that

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310
similar with the MMORPG in APEC so that
 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.420
similar with the MMORPG in APEC so that
the expectation from the users a little

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430
the expectation from the users a little
 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.880
the expectation from the users a little
bit different from because there are

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890
bit different from because there are
 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.760
bit different from because there are
different area or different a platform

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770
different area or different a platform
 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.150
different area or different a platform
like because these users coming from PC

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160
like because these users coming from PC
 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.380
like because these users coming from PC
and console they really care about that

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390
and console they really care about that
 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.890
and console they really care about that
fidelity of the game but in Android the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900
fidelity of the game but in Android the
 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.530
fidelity of the game but in Android the
mobile devices is still in some

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540
mobile devices is still in some
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.720
mobile devices is still in some
limitation because in the battery

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730
limitation because in the battery
 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.190
limitation because in the battery
technology is not enhanced a lot so it's

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200
technology is not enhanced a lot so it's
 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.390
technology is not enhanced a lot so it's
stuck on somewhere during recent over

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400
stuck on somewhere during recent over
 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.210
stuck on somewhere during recent over
ten years so there's still many Huddle's

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220
ten years so there's still many Huddle's
 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.240
ten years so there's still many Huddle's
to limited budget of the power and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250
to limited budget of the power and
 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.960
to limited budget of the power and
performance so the new technology really

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970
performance so the new technology really
 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.180
performance so the new technology really
really required to overcome that so the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190
really required to overcome that so the
 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.729
really required to overcome that so the
optimization itself is really important

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739
optimization itself is really important
 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.449
optimization itself is really important
than ever but you can imagine easily

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459
than ever but you can imagine easily
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.310
than ever but you can imagine easily
about the traditional optimization is

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320
about the traditional optimization is
 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.320
about the traditional optimization is
just trade-off between the quality and

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330
just trade-off between the quality and
 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.949
just trade-off between the quality and
also performance if you want to

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959
also performance if you want to
 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.400
also performance if you want to
increasing more FPS then you just

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410
increasing more FPS then you just
 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.570
increasing more FPS then you just
dropping down your fatality of the game

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580
dropping down your fatality of the game
 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.210
dropping down your fatality of the game
but that that new users the expectation

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220
but that that new users the expectation
 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.699
but that that new users the expectation
is something like that even just five

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709
is something like that even just five
 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.690
is something like that even just five
inches obscures your mobile phone and

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700
inches obscures your mobile phone and
 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.930
inches obscures your mobile phone and
how we can overcome this what is the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940
how we can overcome this what is the
 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.509
how we can overcome this what is the
advanced optimization what is the

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519
advanced optimization what is the
 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.539
advanced optimization what is the
fundamental solution for that you will

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549
fundamental solution for that you will
 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.699
fundamental solution for that you will
be the better quality but there's better

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709
be the better quality but there's better
 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.289
be the better quality but there's better
performance we think the balkan is one

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299
performance we think the balkan is one
 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:09.190
performance we think the balkan is one
of the answer am i right I'm not sure

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200
of the answer am i right I'm not sure
 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.220
of the answer am i right I'm not sure
but I am sure several things even Balkan

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230
but I am sure several things even Balkan
 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.009
but I am sure several things even Balkan
is not so perfect but still work and

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019
is not so perfect but still work and
 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.140
is not so perfect but still work and
because many people already knew about

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150
because many people already knew about
 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.170
because many people already knew about
the what pokken is so I just run through

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180
the what pokken is so I just run through
 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.620
the what pokken is so I just run through
this really quickly

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630

you can add more tacos than GL yes it's

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310
you can add more tacos than GL yes it's
 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.960
you can add more tacos than GL yes it's
not means you can cover 3000 roll call

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970
not means you can cover 3000 roll call
 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.590
not means you can cover 3000 roll call
for your game but it's maybe a three or

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600
for your game but it's maybe a three or
 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.420
for your game but it's maybe a three or
four times more drakul you can cover

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430
four times more drakul you can cover
 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.170
four times more drakul you can cover
with a book and than GL es so I heard

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180

mean that you can resolving any issues
 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.550
mean that you can resolving any issues
with that but you have the more margin

it's not just they command buffer

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650
it's not just they command buffer
 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.060
it's not just they command buffer
command before submission but also the

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070
command before submission but also the
 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.970

other things too like ground allocation

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980
other things too like ground allocation
 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.820

and also the merging the render passes

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370
and also the merging the render passes
 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.990
and also the merging the render passes
and making surpasses is grouping that

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000
and making surpasses is grouping that
 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.340
and making surpasses is grouping that
passes into the one or split the timings

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350

so on and the other various of way of

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470
so on and the other various of way of
 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.210
so on and the other various of way of
optimization you can help you can make

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220
optimization you can help you can make
 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.520
optimization you can help you can make
more better management of the resources

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530
more better management of the resources
 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.719
more better management of the resources
and can have more way of reusing your

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729
and can have more way of reusing your
 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:38.130
and can have more way of reusing your
resources you've used before then that

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140
resources you've used before then that
 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.210
resources you've used before then that
means there's

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220
means there's
 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.320
means there's
more possibilities you can optimize or

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330
more possibilities you can optimize or
 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.510
more possibilities you can optimize or
improve things better than GL yes

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520
improve things better than GL yes
 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.390
improve things better than GL yes
because GL yes there's not many things

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400
because GL yes there's not many things
 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.810
because GL yes there's not many things
you can do also you can have a

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820
you can do also you can have a
 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.850
you can do also you can have a
implementation the bulk and you can see

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860
implementation the bulk and you can see
 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.490
implementation the bulk and you can see
many ways even that is not giving you

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500
many ways even that is not giving you
 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.320
many ways even that is not giving you
that twice or a third time better

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330
that twice or a third time better
 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.640
that twice or a third time better
performance but you can find that a

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650
performance but you can find that a
 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.230
performance but you can find that a
small amount of the improvement that

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240
small amount of the improvement that
 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.110
small amount of the improvement that
also can give you more capability to the

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120
also can give you more capability to the
 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.150
also can give you more capability to the
things more you can show to people make

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160
things more you can show to people make
 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:21.120
things more you can show to people make
differences so yes we can see that twice

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.130
differences so yes we can see that twice
 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.970
differences so yes we can see that twice
or a third time better performance FPS

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:23.980
or a third time better performance FPS
 

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.230
or a third time better performance FPS

experiences yes the Balkan has have has

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:57.470
experiences yes the Balkan has have has
 

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.150
experiences yes the Balkan has have has
some advantages but it's not so simple

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:01.160
some advantages but it's not so simple
 

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.240
some advantages but it's not so simple
and is not so all solution for all cases

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:06.250
and is not so all solution for all cases
 

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:10.390
and is not so all solution for all cases
if you do the just pouring API from GL

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:10.400
if you do the just pouring API from GL
 

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.210
if you do the just pouring API from GL
yes to Balkan and that implementation is

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:13.220
yes to Balkan and that implementation is
 

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.020
yes to Balkan and that implementation is
proper and you can have a quite big

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:17.030
proper and you can have a quite big
 

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:21.760
proper and you can have a quite big
improvement in CPU that is true but it's

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:21.770
improvement in CPU that is true but it's
 

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.640
improvement in CPU that is true but it's
not giving you sometimes it's better

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:24.650
not giving you sometimes it's better
 

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.080
not giving you sometimes it's better
performance because it sometimes is

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.090
performance because it sometimes is
 

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.710
performance because it sometimes is
bounded by GPU fully or your

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720
bounded by GPU fully or your
 

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.720
bounded by GPU fully or your
implementation is not wrong but it's not

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:34.730
implementation is not wrong but it's not
 

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.450
implementation is not wrong but it's not
well fitted into a certain game as

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:37.460
well fitted into a certain game as
 

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:43.150
well fitted into a certain game as
certain GPU architecture so the GPU is

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160
certain GPU architecture so the GPU is
 

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.470
certain GPU architecture so the GPU is
the real problem yes partly there's some

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.480
the real problem yes partly there's some
 

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.050
the real problem yes partly there's some
part of that that GPU driver is the

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:50.060
part of that that GPU driver is the
 

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.920
part of that that GPU driver is the
issues because the quality is not enough

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:52.930
issues because the quality is not enough
 

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.990
issues because the quality is not enough
sometimes the game develop from the

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000
sometimes the game develop from the
 

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.130
sometimes the game develop from the
console and PC they complain about that

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:00.140
console and PC they complain about that
 

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.870
console and PC they complain about that
the mobile GPU is not enough performance

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:03.880
the mobile GPU is not enough performance
 

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:09.550
the mobile GPU is not enough performance
yes because that mobile GPU is running

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:09.560
yes because that mobile GPU is running
 

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.920
yes because that mobile GPU is running
on just less than 10 watt power but your

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:14.930
on just less than 10 watt power but your
 

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:20.560
on just less than 10 watt power but your
G pores is running with over a 100 watt

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:20.570
G pores is running with over a 100 watt
 

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.010
G pores is running with over a 100 watt
or something is the 10 times bigger

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:23.020
or something is the 10 times bigger
 

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.470
or something is the 10 times bigger
power budget they can use so the mobile

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480
power budget they can use so the mobile
 

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.110
power budget they can use so the mobile
GPU is is you can you have to bury only

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120
GPU is is you can you have to bury only
 

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.820
GPU is is you can you have to bury only
those two quality and performance issues

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:33.830
those two quality and performance issues
 

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.450
those two quality and performance issues
is just fundamental thing about that

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:37.460
is just fundamental thing about that
 

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.450
is just fundamental thing about that
quality we are now try to improve more

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:40.460
quality we are now try to improve more
 

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.680
quality we are now try to improve more
than that with the Google and also the

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:44.690
than that with the Google and also the
 

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.980
than that with the Google and also the
other GPU vendors but still there's

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:47.990
other GPU vendors but still there's
 

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.880
other GPU vendors but still there's
something remained so the GPU is not the

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:51.890
something remained so the GPU is not the
 

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.780
something remained so the GPU is not the
real problems partly because you are

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:55.790
real problems partly because you are
 

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.230
real problems partly because you are
wrong targeting the power budget and

00:10:59.230 --> 00:10:59.240
wrong targeting the power budget and
 

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.170
wrong targeting the power budget and
performance target

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.180
 

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:09.050
so is bounded by fully GPU because you

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060
so is bounded by fully GPU because you
 

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.500
so is bounded by fully GPU because you
overloaded fidelity of the graphics to

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:12.510
overloaded fidelity of the graphics to
 

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.470
overloaded fidelity of the graphics to
overwork your GPU a lot then that will

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480
overwork your GPU a lot then that will
 

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.670
overwork your GPU a lot then that will
not give you any benefit and also your

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:20.680
not give you any benefit and also your
 

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.420
not give you any benefit and also your
implementation is not well fitted with

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:23.430
implementation is not well fitted with
 

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.639
implementation is not well fitted with
certain GPU architect that is also one

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:26.649
certain GPU architect that is also one
 

00:11:26.649 --> 00:11:29.790
certain GPU architect that is also one
of the problem so you have to figure out

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800
of the problem so you have to figure out
 

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.600
of the problem so you have to figure out
with some optimization or better policy

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:33.610
with some optimization or better policy
 

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.259
with some optimization or better policy
to target the power budget and

00:11:36.259 --> 00:11:36.269
to target the power budget and
 

00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:42.480
to target the power budget and
performance target so for chasing that

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:42.490
performance target so for chasing that
 

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.870
performance target so for chasing that
topic the developers really need to have

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:45.880
topic the developers really need to have
 

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.980
topic the developers really need to have
some way of optimizing and analysis or

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:49.990
some way of optimizing and analysis or
 

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.150
some way of optimizing and analysis or
something so the simplest way is just

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160
something so the simplest way is just
 

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.460
something so the simplest way is just
delivering better game engine including

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:56.470
delivering better game engine including
 

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.550
delivering better game engine including
all the solution but as you know the

00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.560
all the solution but as you know the
 

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.949
all the solution but as you know the
unity and ue4 is not that level yet I'm

00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959
unity and ue4 is not that level yet I'm
 

00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:08.699
unity and ue4 is not that level yet I'm
sorry and also we have to bring more

00:12:08.699 --> 00:12:08.709
sorry and also we have to bring more
 

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:13.259
sorry and also we have to bring more
better tooling to understand more to

00:12:13.259 --> 00:12:13.269
better tooling to understand more to
 

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:16.740
better tooling to understand more to
deliver way of the way that deliver the

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:16.750
deliver way of the way that deliver the
 

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.850
deliver way of the way that deliver the
game developers to understand more about

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:19.860
game developers to understand more about
 

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:24.199
game developers to understand more about
their games running on a device inside

00:12:24.199 --> 00:12:24.209
their games running on a device inside
 

00:12:24.209 --> 00:12:28.949
their games running on a device inside
and also do they bring more a better way

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959
and also do they bring more a better way
 

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:32.879
and also do they bring more a better way
of interacting the OEM and GPU bandit to

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:32.889
of interacting the OEM and GPU bandit to
 

00:12:32.889 --> 00:12:36.360
of interacting the OEM and GPU bandit to
share your feedback is you can you can

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:36.370
share your feedback is you can you can
 

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.110
share your feedback is you can you can
you can share about similar things what

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:40.120
you can share about similar things what

you can share about similar things what
I'm now talking about and that morning

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360
I'm now talking about and that morning
 

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.990
I'm now talking about and that morning
times former session also Google guys

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000
times former session also Google guys
 

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.449
times former session also Google guys
know talking about

00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:47.459
know talking about
 

00:12:47.459 --> 00:12:51.000
know talking about
so the pended channel is there and also

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.010
so the pended channel is there and also
 

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.939
so the pended channel is there and also
you have a google channel but the

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:53.949
you have a google channel but the
 

00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:57.689
you have a google channel but the
problem is when you found that a GPU

00:12:57.689 --> 00:12:57.699
problem is when you found that a GPU
 

00:12:57.699 --> 00:13:01.230
problem is when you found that a GPU
driver box then whatever you connect

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240
driver box then whatever you connect
 

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.889
driver box then whatever you connect
contact with dependent work or a cool

00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:03.899
contact with dependent work or a cool
 

00:13:03.899 --> 00:13:06.930
contact with dependent work or a cool
but it not give you fix your problem

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:06.940
but it not give you fix your problem
 

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.900
but it not give you fix your problem
because the driver fixes should be

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:09.910
because the driver fixes should be
 

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.110
because the driver fixes should be
shipping into the real product into the

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120
shipping into the real product into the
 

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.300
shipping into the real product into the
market so we we have to

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:16.310
market so we we have to
 

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.989
market so we we have to
about that kind of thing but it's

00:13:18.989 --> 00:13:18.999
about that kind of thing but it's
 

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:22.420
about that kind of thing but it's
usually the game debug doesn't have any

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:22.430
usually the game debug doesn't have any
 

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.230
usually the game debug doesn't have any
channel to contacting where the OEM that

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240
channel to contacting where the OEM that
 

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.050
channel to contacting where the OEM that
is really hurt the situation in around

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:29.060
is really hurt the situation in around
 

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:32.460
is really hurt the situation in around
or they ecosystem so we are now

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:32.470
or they ecosystem so we are now
 

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:35.530
or they ecosystem so we are now
announcing the game doubt and you can

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:35.540
announcing the game doubt and you can
 

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.900
announcing the game doubt and you can
contact with the game depth as something

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:37.910
contact with the game depth as something
 

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:42.009
contact with the game depth as something
that come anytime you want and the last

00:13:42.009 --> 00:13:42.019
that come anytime you want and the last

one is the better guidance about power

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:45.290
one is the better guidance about power
 

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.210
one is the better guidance about power
budget and performance type I want to

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:48.220
budget and performance type I want to
 

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:53.439
budget and performance type I want to
leave it talk more about this power

00:13:53.439 --> 00:13:53.449
leave it talk more about this power
 

00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:57.160
leave it talk more about this power
budget so my personal opinion you have

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:57.170
budget so my personal opinion you have
 

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:01.329
budget so my personal opinion you have
to avoid the GPU bounding situation at

00:14:01.329 --> 00:14:01.339
to avoid the GPU bounding situation at
 

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:05.100
to avoid the GPU bounding situation at
all with your content

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:05.110
 

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.869
so there's the three bounding types

00:14:07.869 --> 00:14:07.879
so there's the three bounding types
 

00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:12.429
so there's the three bounding types
this one is CPU bounding and second is

00:14:12.429 --> 00:14:12.439
this one is CPU bounding and second is
 

00:14:12.439 --> 00:14:16.329
this one is CPU bounding and second is
this GPU bounding and the best case is a

00:14:16.329 --> 00:14:16.339
this GPU bounding and the best case is a
 

00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:23.049
this GPU bounding and the best case is a
non-bonding situation so if you have a

00:14:23.049 --> 00:14:23.059
non-bonding situation so if you have a
 

00:14:23.059 --> 00:14:27.040
non-bonding situation so if you have a
three different type of situation with

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:27.050
three different type of situation with
 

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.850
three different type of situation with
your GL es pill and after bulk and port

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:30.860
your GL es pill and after bulk and port
 

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.809
your GL es pill and after bulk and port
you can have some benefit with the

00:14:34.809 --> 00:14:34.819
you can have some benefit with the
 

00:14:34.819 --> 00:14:37.660
you can have some benefit with the
balkan with the CPU bonding and normal

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:37.670
balkan with the CPU bonding and normal
 

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:41.470
balkan with the CPU bonding and normal
situation but you cannot see any benefit

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480
situation but you cannot see any benefit
 

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.759
situation but you cannot see any benefit
with bulk and port which is GPU bounding

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:44.769
with bulk and port which is GPU bounding
 

00:14:44.769 --> 00:14:48.569
with bulk and port which is GPU bounding
you can easily see after bulk and port

00:14:48.569 --> 00:14:48.579
you can easily see after bulk and port
 

00:14:48.579 --> 00:14:53.439
you can easily see after bulk and port
the CPU broad is decreased and then GPU

00:14:53.439 --> 00:14:53.449
the CPU broad is decreased and then GPU
 

00:14:53.449 --> 00:14:55.869
the CPU broad is decreased and then GPU
rode it increased because of a PS

00:14:55.869 --> 00:14:55.879
rode it increased because of a PS
 

00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:59.079
rode it increased because of a PS
increasing but with the GPU bounding

00:14:59.079 --> 00:14:59.089
increasing but with the GPU bounding
 

00:14:59.089 --> 00:15:01.990
increasing but with the GPU bounding
situation just a CPU drop but because

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000
situation just a CPU drop but because
 

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.730
situation just a CPU drop but because
GPU is are already in the 100% busy so

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:06.740
GPU is are already in the 100% busy so
 

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:11.340
GPU is are already in the 100% busy so
there is no way of increasing more FPS

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:11.350
there is no way of increasing more FPS
 

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:18.160
there is no way of increasing more FPS
so the good design policy about the

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:18.170
so the good design policy about the
 

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:22.360
so the good design policy about the
power budget is so making a left french

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:22.370
power budget is so making a left french
 

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:27.240
power budget is so making a left french
road with your former device target and

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:27.250
 

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.310
adjusting that road with

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320
adjusting that road with
 

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.920
adjusting that road with
the other quality leveling and also to

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:32.930
the other quality leveling and also to
 

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.780
the other quality leveling and also to
perform a different performance target

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:34.790
perform a different performance target
 

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.740
perform a different performance target
adjustment for the lower load for the

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:38.750
adjustment for the lower load for the
 

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.490
adjustment for the lower load for the
old devices set and the high load for

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:42.500
old devices set and the high load for
 

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:47.170
old devices set and the high load for
the latest device set and also you can

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:47.180
the latest device set and also you can
 

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:51.100
the latest device set and also you can
consider carefully this budget is also

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:51.110
consider carefully this budget is also
 

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.720
consider carefully this budget is also
you have to consider a throttling

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:52.730
you have to consider a throttling
 

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:58.870
you have to consider a throttling
situation and about performance target

00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880
situation and about performance target
 

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.550
situation and about performance target
you sometimes have to design your

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560
you sometimes have to design your
 

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.860
you sometimes have to design your
performance target with resolution and

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:02.870
performance target with resolution and
 

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.300
performance target with resolution and
fps so HD 30 frames per second is there

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:07.310
fps so HD 30 frames per second is there
 

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.530
fps so HD 30 frames per second is there
then you can easily imagine that

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:10.540
then you can easily imagine that
 

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.730
then you can easily imagine that
increasing your resolution to the full

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:12.740
increasing your resolution to the full
 

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.870
increasing your resolution to the full
HD will go up the GPU a lot but with

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880
HD will go up the GPU a lot but with
 

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.130
HD will go up the GPU a lot but with
post fps and resolution double then you

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:21.140
post fps and resolution double then you
 

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.980
post fps and resolution double then you
can expect easily to imagine that the

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:23.990
can expect easily to imagine that the
 

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:27.400
can expect easily to imagine that the
right side of the picture the GPU will

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:27.410
right side of the picture the GPU will
 

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.640
right side of the picture the GPU will
be the quadruple and CPU will be double

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:30.650
be the quadruple and CPU will be double
 

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:35.020
be the quadruple and CPU will be double
is a quiet higher increasing road for

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:35.030
is a quiet higher increasing road for
 

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:39.340
is a quiet higher increasing road for
your post GPU and CPU and quality the

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:39.350
your post GPU and CPU and quality the
 

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.690
your post GPU and CPU and quality the
leveling is a little bit more

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:40.700
leveling is a little bit more
 

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.450
leveling is a little bit more
complicated you can you can tune your

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:45.460
complicated you can you can tune your
 

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.170
complicated you can you can tune your
quality level for the effect or that

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:49.180
quality level for the effect or that
 

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.620
quality level for the effect or that
geometry and characters details and also

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:53.630
geometry and characters details and also
 

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.790
geometry and characters details and also
resolution of texture but it also can

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800
resolution of texture but it also can
 

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.100
resolution of texture but it also can
make a side effect to give a heard that

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:03.110
make a side effect to give a heard that
 

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.400
make a side effect to give a heard that
memory bandwidth and so on so you have

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:06.410
memory bandwidth and so on so you have
 

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.100
memory bandwidth and so on so you have
to really carefully design that and need

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:09.110
to really carefully design that and need
 

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:11.740
to really carefully design that and need
more better understanding about the GPU
