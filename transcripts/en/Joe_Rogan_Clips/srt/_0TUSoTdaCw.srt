1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,050
The Joe Rogan experience. That's
good stuff. That's what I mean.

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:08,760
I feel like that is the pinnacle of
where this medium can take us. Watching.

3
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:11,340
Like can say he was in an extreme state.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,880
What about when you could go
by be comfortable, capable.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,940
You become comfortable and creases
are listened to that podcast.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,090
Like I go on runs, I'd listen to
this and I thought fucking hell man.

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,210
Where else are you going to get this
content? Whereas that got you into this.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,730
There's no one would ever
agree to it anywhere else.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,450
That's the thing that you'd never get a
group of people whose jobs depended upon

10
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:36,720
keeping the show on the air,
whether they're producers or executives.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,250
They would never agree to that.
They'd be like,

12
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:39,600
you can't have that crazy fucker on,

13
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:42,270
you can't have this on can of
Eddie Bravo on all the time.

14
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:43,770
He thinks dump world is flat.

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,880
Stop this cause you traveling
between such a loaded,

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,510
diverse and unusual ideas and,

17
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:53,960
and sort of the theme of Alex Jones
is as well is that he's lucky.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,830
He demonstrates to a point that there's
voracity in what he's saying some things.

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,200
Yeah, he's right about a
lot of things. You know,

20
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:03,090
we were just talking about animals,
human hybrids.

21
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:06,690
We started pulling up these studies where
they actually have done studies where

22
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:11,280
they've tried to create animal human
hybrids, non-viable, an animal,

23
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:16,080
human embryos to trying to grow
human organs in different animals.

24
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:19,230
And there's all sorts of weird
scientific shit that we're doing.

25
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,260
Imagine what they're doing in
China behind walls. Look at this.

26
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,460
China's latest cloned monkey
experiment is an ethical mets.

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,910
They used CRISPR to add human genes
into monkey genes and there's like five

28
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:32,240
monkeys. This happened back
in January and I don't do,

29
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,370
this is a fucking horror movie.
This is a hard,

30
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:38,360
but this is how the horror movie begins.
Why did you think that one,

31
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,080
if that's what's being revealed.
The truth is Darker Das for sure,

32
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,360
for sure.
They're trying to create super soldiers.

33
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,280
Someone is trying to create some
super soldier, some half champ,

34
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:53,010
half human super intelligent,

35
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:57,840
murderous thing that's powered by remote
control passing and all could objective.

36
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,670
No, I don't see a good outcome for the
superintelligent murderous remote control

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,020
[inaudible] being what?

38
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:08,880
If you could send those superintelligent
murders chimps to go kill Isis now.

39
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,930
Now we've got a reason to get them
out there. Now we need, and we look,

40
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:17,931
we've got a nice contract with the defense
contractor and they're gonna tell us

41
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:22,200
how we lubricate the passage to
the murderous monkeys is isis.

42
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:27,201
That's the function of Isis in the
cultural conversation is to justify it.

43
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:28,650
The monkey sell watches.
