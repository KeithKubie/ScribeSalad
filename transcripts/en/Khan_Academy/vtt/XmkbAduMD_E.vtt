00:00:00.163 --> 00:00:09.599
Before jumping into the details of the Bay of Pigs invasion I want to make sure we understand the environment in Cuba and the United States leading up to the invasion.

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.737
So, going into the late 1950's Cuba was controlled by this guy right over here: Batista

00:00:16.737 --> 00:00:20.497
and he was a dictator that was supported by the United States.

00:00:20.517 --> 00:00:26.023
Just to give a sense of what he was like. Here's a quote from John F. Kennedy in 1963.

00:00:26.023 --> 00:00:32.179
So this is after he's already had, you know, the Bay of Pigs has happened, the Cuban Missle Crisis has happened.

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:37.617
He is not a big fan of Fidel Castro. But with that said, in hindsight, JFK did say this.

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:43.370
This is pretty objective assessment of what Batista was like as the dictator of Cuba.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.413
This is John F. Kennedy saying this:

00:00:45.423 --> 00:00:47.615
"I believe there is no country in the world

00:00:47.635 --> 00:00:56.133
including any and all the countries under colonial domination, where economic colonization, humiliation and exploitation

00:00:56.133 --> 00:01:03.755
were worse than in Cuba, in part owing to my country's policies during the Batista regime.

00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:11.800
To some extent it is as though Batista was the incarnation of a number of sins on the part of the United States.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.586
Now we shall have to pay for those sins." So even JFK in hindsight is saying that Batista

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:25.468
was really not the best person and it really was not a good idea for the United States to support such a

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:30.244
corrupt dictator for so long in Cuba. This is Batista

00:01:30.244 --> 00:01:35.837
right over here, riding with some U.S. generals in a parade when he visited DC. So you can imagine

00:01:35.837 --> 00:01:43.633
he was not a popular person in control of Cuba and in 1959 you have a successful revolution against him.

00:01:43.643 --> 00:01:53.215
In 1959 there is a revolution and the revolution is led by this character, Fidel Castro, and

00:01:53.215 --> 00:02:03.373
his kind of two right hand men are Raul Castro and Che Guevara right over here

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:09.610
and they take control of Cuba. They're part of this nationalist, revolutionary movement. Now the one thing

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.465
they do do, and they are left-leaning from the beginning, people assume that they are maybe communists or

00:02:16.465 --> 00:02:24.382
quasi-communists. But even from the get-go as soon as they take power, they start taking over lands that were owned by,

00:02:24.382 --> 00:02:30.882
well, one that was private Cuban property, some of it that was United States property. Their arguement would

00:02:30.882 --> 00:02:40.772
have probably been that this was wealth, private property that was ill gotten, that was gotten in the time of Batista,

00:02:40.772 --> 00:02:48.122
but they did in a broad sweep , so they took over a lot of private land, a lot of private property, which also led to people thinking

00:02:48.122 --> 00:02:53.994
hey, this is not just a nationalist revolution, this is also a communist revolution but you could also imagine

00:02:53.994 --> 00:03:03.442
that once they take over there this huge migration of Cubans to the United States and there, it's

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:10.089
primarily middle class, upper middle class Cubans, educated Cubans, who were really afraid of what Fidel Castro

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:17.195
is doing in terms of taking over of private land, taking people's property. So you start having this

00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:24.260
Cuban exile community really focused around Florida and mainly Miami and they're still there.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:34.935
And they're very unhappy with this Fidel Castro character right over here. So when we fast forward into 1961 John F. Kennedy becomes president,

00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:45.236
He gets elected in 1960, becomes president in early 1961. We're now fast forwarding to April, 1961 so JFK has only been president for a few months.

00:03:45.236 --> 00:03:50.400
But you can imagine a lot of levels you have all of these Cuban exiles, upper middled class, educated, middle

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.733
class, Cuban exiles who hate Fidel Castro. He's taking over their land he's turning it into what looks like a leftist state.

00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:04.573
This is all happening within the context of the cold war, the US is afraid of

00:04:04.573 --> 00:04:11.517
countries falling to communism. It looks like Fidel Castro is a communist, so the US decides the fact

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:16.072
that you have all of the exisles who wanna oust him to the US porbably wants to oust him just because

00:04:16.072 --> 00:04:23.271
he's a communist and they're afraid that he's going to align himself with the Soviet Union. So in conjunction

00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:29.514
with the Cuban exiles and the CIA, and this right here is the director of the Central Intelligence

00:04:29.514 --> 00:04:35.925
during the Kennedy administration or at least the beginning part of the Kennedy administration, this is Allen

00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:44.649
Dulles, his brother is John Foster Dulles, where Dulles Airport is named after and he was a US Secretary of State.

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:51.814
They decide that they want to oust Fidel Castro, but they want to do it in a way that the US does

00:04:51.814 --> 00:04:57.386
not look like it's the one doing the invasion, so what they do is they plan an invasion where they

00:04:57.386 --> 00:05:14.468
take Cuban exiles and they get 1400 men to sign up to be kind of part of this CIA backed , US backed force

00:05:14.468 --> 00:05:21.000
to invade Cuba and overthrow Fidel Castro. And a lot of this was based on the premise, and you can imagine

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.113
this even happened in the iraq war, where the CIA, the American President, they kind of surround themselves with people who tell

00:05:29.113 --> 00:05:36.063
them, who one give them a very optimistic, hopeful scenario telling them "Look. We represent what the rest

00:05:36.063 --> 00:05:42.081
of the Cuban people want," They'll say, "Look if we just start a revolution Fidel Castro will be overthrown."

00:05:42.081 --> 00:05:47.547
The reality that came out, at least at that point in time, in early 1960's, Fidel Castro was actually

00:05:47.557 --> 00:05:51.983
pretty popular with the Cuban people and you can imagine he was at that time popular with the poor

00:05:51.983 --> 00:06:00.213
people who did not have land and now all of the sudden you have this leader for the people, I don't know

00:06:00.213 --> 00:06:05.550
about his popularity now but at that point he was probably a lot more popular than the exiles and the

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.277
CIA would have had Kennedy believe. So they plan this attack

00:06:09.277 --> 00:06:15.800
Kennedy says oh, if we can get rid of Fidel Castro then that derisks the possibility of having this

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.841
communist nation right off of the Florida coast. So they plan this invasion and you know it's shady to

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:27.109
begin with because they didn't want to make it look like an official U.S. invasion. They wanted to

00:06:27.109 --> 00:06:34.040
make it look like a pure Cuban counter-revolution and to some degree that really mixed up everything and

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:41.218
made it look, and well it really was suspect because they really were doing something that was not what it really

00:06:41.218 --> 00:06:48.434
was. But the invasion the way it all worked out is that by April 15th, and this is just going into the

00:06:48.434 --> 00:06:49.578
details of the invasion,

00:06:49.578 --> 00:06:51.109
So they had the fourteen hundred exiles

00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:56.313
They had some ships, some planes they marked them

00:06:56.313 --> 00:06:59.224
They either removed the markings so that it didn't look like they were American

00:06:59.224 --> 00:07:00.295
ships or planes

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:05.382
Or they put false markings of the Cuban military

00:07:05.382 --> 00:07:08.622
So that it would cause some confusion or whatever

00:07:08.622 --> 00:07:10.617
So on April 15, 1961,

00:07:10.617 --> 00:07:14.795
Remember this is only a few months into Kennedy's administration,

00:07:14.795 --> 00:07:16.434
they start air attacks

00:07:16.434 --> 00:07:22.544
and these air attacks launch from Nicaragua and they go to Cuba.

00:07:22.544 --> 00:07:27.325
And the whole point of these air attacks was to kind of soften the Cuban Air Force

00:07:27.325 --> 00:07:31.476
for an eventual invasion by the 1400 exiles.

00:07:31.476 --> 00:07:37.151
And so they have eight aircraft, eight bombers

00:07:37.151 --> 00:07:43.229
leaving Nicaragua. They bomb Cuba at a base outside of Havana

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:49.115
and a base near the south, actually not too far from the current Guantanamo Bay.

00:07:49.115 --> 00:07:52.826
And the point or their goal was to destroy the Cuban Air Force

00:07:52.826 --> 00:07:54.208
It turns out they didn't do it.

00:07:54.208 --> 00:08:03.853
And once again, to kind of cause confusion, they did it not under the U.S. markings, but they put Cuban Air Force markings on the planes.

00:08:03.853 --> 00:08:07.685
You had eight planes going and doing the bombing

00:08:07.685 --> 00:08:09.941
One of them gets shot down

00:08:09.941 --> 00:08:15.713
and a ninth plane actually leaves from Nicaragua and they falsely put bullet holes

00:08:15.713 --> 00:08:19.471
in it to look like it was hit with anti-aircraft guns

00:08:19.471 --> 00:08:22.497
and had it defect to Florida.

00:08:22.497 --> 00:08:27.070
So I guess the idea behind this was to make it look like there is a Cuban

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.957
pilot who takes off from Cuba or somehow gets out of Cuba

00:08:30.957 --> 00:08:38.412
with a Cuban plane (that's why they put the markings there) and then tries to destroy a bunch of Cuban aircraft

00:08:38.412 --> 00:08:40.207
and then defects to the United States.

00:08:40.207 --> 00:08:42.227
That's the impression that they wanted to convey.

00:08:42.227 --> 00:08:45.206
It's not so clear that the Cubans actually fell for it.

00:08:45.206 --> 00:08:52.231
And so that happened in 1961. Most everyone kind of saw this as a U.S. attack, or at least said they viewed it as a U.S. attack.

00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:58.885
Then you fast forward to the night of April 16th

00:08:58.885 --> 00:09:02.095
and this whole time everyone was expecting a US attack

00:09:02.095 --> 00:09:11.070
This all leads to the fact that this was not a well orchestrated series of events

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:16.243
It's pretty well established that some of these exiles were just not as tightlipped as they should have

00:09:16.243 --> 00:09:23.957
been about the invasion. It got out to Soviet intelligence. The Cubans knew that an invasion was imminent.

00:09:23.957 --> 00:09:29.340
So on April 16th you have kind of a false attack - a decoy attack -

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:34.569
at Bahia Honda right over here, with a bunch of decoy boats with loudspeakers on them

00:09:34.569 --> 00:09:37.261
that made it sound like they were firing to cause confusion

00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:41.475
and it did temporarily cause Castro to look in that direction

00:09:41.475 --> 00:09:46.203
because they were on hair trigger notice expecting an imminent invasion

00:09:46.203 --> 00:09:49.320
that was not the real one. This was on the evening of April 16th

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:55.023
When you go to the early morning of April 17th you have the real invasion

00:09:55.023 --> 00:10:04.387
where you have the 1400 Cuban exiles with CIA and US military support (but all of that was hidden )

00:10:04.387 --> 00:10:09.974
to actually invade at the Bay of Pigs.

00:10:09.974 --> 00:10:15.234
And to make a long story short it was kind of a invasion that did not go well.

00:10:15.234 --> 00:10:22.396
It has been blamed on bad planning, on incompetance at some parts of the invasion.

00:10:22.396 --> 00:10:26.487
The invasion lasted from April 17th which was the first day of the invasion.

00:10:26.487 --> 00:10:33.886
By April 19th the invading force, or counter-revolutionary force, the 1400 cuban exiles,

00:10:33.886 --> 00:10:36.040
had been pushed back to the beaches.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.993
And for the most part a little over 100 of them were killed

00:10:40.993 --> 00:10:51.993
and most of them, over 1000 of them, were captured. And then later on in the year Fidel Castro,

00:10:51.993 --> 00:10:58.983
- and some were executed after after being captured - but later on in the year Fidel Castro makes a deal with the United States

00:10:58.983 --> 00:11:03.970
where he hands over the captured exiles to the United States in exchange for

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.485
$58 million in aid and supplies and all the rest.

00:11:07.485 --> 00:11:15.720
So this, at least from a military point of view, was a complete debacle from the United States point of view.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.770
You can imagine after this happened people in the United States started

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:20.787
pointing fingers

00:11:20.787 --> 00:11:26.447
You have the CIA (and this is Allen Dulles right here) and the exiles blaming the Kennedy administration

00:11:26.447 --> 00:11:30.976
saying that look he wasn't willing to do what it takes to actually do a proper invasion.

00:11:30.976 --> 00:11:36.954
He wasn't willing to supply the proper air support once the invasion started happening.

00:11:36.954 --> 00:11:42.542
He was not willing to commit more U.S. troops once the invasion started looking like it was not going in

00:11:42.542 --> 00:11:44.176
the direction of the exiles.

00:11:44.176 --> 00:11:47.503
Kennedy on the other hand blames the CIA.

00:11:47.503 --> 00:11:52.123
He says look this was just done and planned incompetently

00:11:52.123 --> 00:11:56.735
He also says that "You gave me all sorts of misinformation. You told me that once the invasion

00:11:56.735 --> 00:12:01.797
started there was all sorts of resentment against Fidel Castro and it would cause this broader

00:12:01.797 --> 00:12:04.216
uprising, which never ever happened."

00:12:04.216 --> 00:12:10.102
This is actually a quote from John F Kennedy that he said after the Bay of Pigs invasion:

00:12:10.102 --> 00:12:12.929
"The first advice I am going to give to my successor is to watch

00:12:12.929 --> 00:12:17.726
the generals and to avoid the feeling that because they were military men their opinions on military matters

00:12:17.726 --> 00:12:18.908
were worth a damn."

00:12:18.908 --> 00:12:22.376
This is John F. Kennedy saying this after the Bay of Pigs invasion.

00:12:22.376 --> 00:12:26.659
You can dig deeper and figure out who probably was in the right here,

00:12:26.659 --> 00:12:35.352
but the bottom line here is that it lead to all-round negative consequences for the United States.

00:12:35.352 --> 00:12:40.283
After this kind of strengthened Fidel Castro's hold on Cuba.

00:12:40.283 --> 00:12:43.043
He was like, "Hey that was the United States' best shot."

00:12:43.043 --> 00:12:47.023
Huge embarrassment for them. It allowed his to concentrate his control.

00:12:47.023 --> 00:12:51.177
It also caused him to now become very openly communist

00:12:51.177 --> 00:12:57.337
Before the Bay of pigs invasion he was kind of trying to get the U.S. to somewhat like him.

00:12:57.337 --> 00:13:03.213
Although they wouldn't like him because he was taking over private property and he was clearly left-leaning.

00:13:03.213 --> 00:13:10.703
But after the Bay of Pigs invasion he definitely aligned himself closely with the Soviet Union.

00:13:10.703 --> 00:13:15.492
He became much more open about being a Marxist, Leninist, communist state

00:13:15.492 --> 00:13:22.941
and because he as afraid of future US invasions he was open to what eventually leads

00:13:22.941 --> 00:13:31.164
to the Cuban Missile Crisis which is the Soviet Union actually placing ballistic missiles with nuclear

00:13:31.164 --> 00:13:35.709
warheads in Cuba at short range to the United States. It set up this whole

00:13:35.709 --> 00:13:40.429
series of events that really didn't work in the U.S.'s favor.
