00:00:05.584 --> 00:00:08.834
(contemplative music)

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.105
- Welcome to A Conversation with History.

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:34.739
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.409
of International Studies.

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:38.699
Our guest today is George Packer who is

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.967
a staff writer for The New
Yorker, the author of many books,

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:46.187
most recently The Unwinding which won

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:50.130
the National Book Award for nonfiction.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.297
He is on the Berkeley campus
as the 2017 Jefferson lecturer.

00:00:57.104 --> 00:00:59.129
George welcome back to our program.

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.520
- Good to be with you again Harry.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.172
- Last time you were here we
talked about The Unwinding

00:01:04.172 --> 00:01:07.255
and when I asked you what you learned

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:12.021
from doing that research and writing

00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:15.589
that book about where America was.

00:01:15.589 --> 00:01:19.672
- That book has been cited
as a primer on Trump's

00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:26.947
America, Trump's victory.

00:01:26.947 --> 00:01:29.209
I think I have to reject that a little.

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:32.792
I didn't imagine Donald
Trump's presidency.

00:01:34.347 --> 00:01:36.547
I believed the polls last year.

00:01:36.547 --> 00:01:38.498
I thought he would win because the poll,

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:39.774
I mean I thought Hillary would win

00:01:39.774 --> 00:01:41.711
because the polls said she would.

00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:44.628
But the book did survey a landscape

00:01:46.814 --> 00:01:49.246
that was preparing the way for Trump.

00:01:49.246 --> 00:01:52.086
So Trumpism, the feelings the impulses

00:01:52.086 --> 00:01:54.253
that we call populism that

00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:59.510
fueled the support that drove him

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.457
to victory in the Republican Primary,

00:02:01.457 --> 00:02:03.450
the victory in the General Election

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.283
was all there in the
places I was reporting on

00:02:08.197 --> 00:02:10.266
five, six, seven years earlier.

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:14.301
So I wasn't, I was I guess
shocked but not surprised

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:17.243
by his victory because
that work had prepared me

00:02:17.243 --> 00:02:19.297
for something like that
I just didn't think

00:02:19.297 --> 00:02:20.953
we were quite that far gone.

00:02:20.953 --> 00:02:23.576
- And what were the some of
the things that you found?

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:27.409
I mean you were going to
different parts of the country

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.255
talking to different people
of different social class

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:35.173
and there were some common themes.

00:02:35.173 --> 00:02:38.923
I mean as people responded
to the 2008 crash.

00:02:40.206 --> 00:02:43.423
Yeah that was the context
for my reporting was

00:02:43.423 --> 00:02:46.265
the financial crisis
and the Great Recession.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:47.908
The early Obama years.

00:02:47.908 --> 00:02:50.220
I was in western North Carolina,

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.224
rural tobacco and textile area.

00:02:52.224 --> 00:02:55.325
I was in exurban Tampa Bay where

00:02:55.325 --> 00:02:57.890
the housing bust was most dramatic

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.859
and there were all these new subdivisions

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.646
that were practically deserted.

00:03:02.646 --> 00:03:07.071
I was in Youngstown, Ohio
which is classic Rust Belt City

00:03:07.071 --> 00:03:10.434
and it it kind of didn't matter whether

00:03:10.434 --> 00:03:14.385
I was talking to a
Democrat or a Republican,

00:03:14.385 --> 00:03:18.061
to someone in a city or a small town,

00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:20.161
to someone who was black or white.

00:03:20.161 --> 00:03:24.328
There was a common sense
of the game that they play

00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:32.898
being rigged in favor of
people who had the connections,

00:03:32.898 --> 00:03:36.583
who were in the right networks,
who had power and money

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:39.980
of the middle class disappearing,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.035
of their children's chances being poor.

00:03:44.035 --> 00:03:48.611
And of this globalization
kind of sweeping away

00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:51.368
the life that they knew
whether it was the factory

00:03:51.368 --> 00:03:55.359
or the shops in this small
town Main Street or what.

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.526
So there was just a general
feeling of anxiety and

00:04:03.547 --> 00:04:06.549
suspicion, suspicion of each other too.

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.691
I kept running into people
who thought something,

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:12.226
someone was scamming them
or something was a scam.

00:04:12.226 --> 00:04:16.375
And also the the way they got information

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:20.053
was no longer through one of three or four

00:04:20.053 --> 00:04:22.739
respected establishment news sources.

00:04:22.739 --> 00:04:24.822
It was their own tailored

00:04:27.377 --> 00:04:30.335
information world that they could choose.

00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:34.502
So it was either Fox, or MSNBC,
or their favorite websites.

00:04:36.413 --> 00:04:39.351
Twitter had not yet become quite

00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:42.684
the deafening echo chamber it is now but

00:04:44.263 --> 00:04:48.430
Facebook was beginning to
become a major source of news so

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.527
I would say if you want to
look at three factors in

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.990
the rise of Trump they were all there.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.157
One was economic stagnation
and a sense of falling behind

00:05:04.563 --> 00:05:09.103
and growing inequality
that's been true for decades.

00:05:09.103 --> 00:05:12.270
The change in the color and culture of

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.774
towns that had not had immigration before

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.903
that were beginning to feel the effects

00:05:17.903 --> 00:05:21.953
of several decades of
open immigration policies.

00:05:21.953 --> 00:05:25.201
And three social media and new media that

00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:28.618
made it possible for people to get around

00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:34.334
the established voices and instead

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:37.517
to hear more radical voices and to

00:05:37.517 --> 00:05:38.988
choose whether or not to believe them.

00:05:38.988 --> 00:05:40.592
And often they did
because the radical voices

00:05:40.592 --> 00:05:42.962
spoke more directly to them.

00:05:42.962 --> 00:05:46.571
- And there was a sense in
your book of kind of the

00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:50.738
general collapse of institutions
that might support people.

00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:53.720
And when you're talking
about the democratic

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.959
institutions a real lack of trust.

00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:01.126
- Yes, certainly the Federal
Government felt like a

00:06:02.744 --> 00:06:06.494
dysfunctional and
parasitic and far off thing

00:06:08.755 --> 00:06:10.267
that had nothing to do with them

00:06:10.267 --> 00:06:12.767
in any sort of supportive way.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.367
And even to some extent State Government.

00:06:17.367 --> 00:06:19.279
But also think about churches.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:23.360
Even though I was in very
religious parts of the country

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.122
the church didn't play
the kind of cohesive role

00:06:26.122 --> 00:06:28.526
in the lives of people I was with.

00:06:28.526 --> 00:06:32.375
And these are very anecdotal
and idiosyncratic stories.

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:36.690
I wasn't looking for
statistical representation.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.484
There were really no unions to speak of.

00:06:40.484 --> 00:06:43.077
The woman I wrote about in
Youngstown had been in a union

00:06:43.077 --> 00:06:44.529
when she worked on an assembly line

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.064
but her job had gone off to Mexico.

00:06:46.064 --> 00:06:49.320
And the union had had dissolved

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.550
with the end of that factory.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.883
And civic groups were not in their lives

00:06:56.435 --> 00:06:58.602
and corporations were just

00:07:00.932 --> 00:07:05.099
giant bodies that use their
labor when they needed it

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:09.522
and offered them no security in return.

00:07:09.522 --> 00:07:12.432
And there was a family in
Tampa whose husband was

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.613
always working odd hours at the Target,

00:07:14.613 --> 00:07:17.766
the local Target stockroom
but they would call him

00:07:17.766 --> 00:07:20.535
when they needed him and
sometimes he had too few hours

00:07:20.535 --> 00:07:23.115
in a week to support his family.

00:07:23.115 --> 00:07:27.607
So seemed to all be at the
convenience of the corporation.

00:07:27.607 --> 00:07:30.190
These are the institutions that

00:07:31.324 --> 00:07:34.564
in this the great post war boom

00:07:34.564 --> 00:07:37.179
were the heart of the of the middle class.

00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:39.719
The institutions that
were like the foundation

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:42.487
on which a middle class
life could be built.

00:07:42.487 --> 00:07:45.403
They weren't there and then the media

00:07:45.403 --> 00:07:49.262
the last one had become kind of a weapon

00:07:49.262 --> 00:07:51.921
more than a source of stability.

00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:53.631
A weapon in the political wars that

00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:56.381
Americans are now all engaged in.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.118
- Your intellectual
odyssey is one coming from

00:08:00.118 --> 00:08:02.285
a very liberal background,

00:08:05.078 --> 00:08:07.732
maybe at times a radical background

00:08:07.732 --> 00:08:10.899
in terms of your own experiences were.

00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:15.376
Were the people you talking
to did they have a sense

00:08:15.376 --> 00:08:18.848
of the class that they belonged to,

00:08:18.848 --> 00:08:22.609
the traditional importance of unions,

00:08:22.609 --> 00:08:26.126
what had been the bread
and butter of liberal

00:08:26.126 --> 00:08:29.421
radical constituencies in the past?

00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:32.921
- For the woman in Youngstown Tammy Thomas

00:08:34.416 --> 00:08:38.096
the union was a fact of life and it was

00:08:38.096 --> 00:08:41.224
like the local school, it was just part of

00:08:41.224 --> 00:08:45.214
the fabric of her life but
it wasn't in her corner.

00:08:45.214 --> 00:08:48.085
It didn't fight for
her in her in her view.

00:08:48.085 --> 00:08:50.342
And when the job started to go,

00:08:50.342 --> 00:08:52.447
and then when the buyouts
started to happen.

00:08:52.447 --> 00:08:54.477
When the factory closed
the union was helpless

00:08:54.477 --> 00:08:58.712
and it didn't put up
much of a fight at all.

00:08:58.712 --> 00:09:00.838
This family in Tampa it was interesting.

00:09:00.838 --> 00:09:04.392
One night we were talking
and the husband said

00:09:04.392 --> 00:09:06.744
he had just seen a documentary
on the History Channel

00:09:06.744 --> 00:09:09.482
about a strike in West
Virginia in the 20's,

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:12.399
a famous violent coal miners strike

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.803
at a place that's famous but I can't

00:09:16.803 --> 00:09:19.735
remember the name unfortunately.

00:09:19.735 --> 00:09:21.593
And he was telling me that
at Target they showed them

00:09:21.593 --> 00:09:25.224
the employees videos, propaganda videos

00:09:25.224 --> 00:09:28.224
about why unions were bad for them.

00:09:28.224 --> 00:09:30.730
And why if there was
ever a vote for a union

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.376
they should vote against it.

00:09:32.376 --> 00:09:34.194
And it wasn't as though he felt

00:09:34.194 --> 00:09:37.504
how dare the company
try to cheat me out of

00:09:37.504 --> 00:09:40.337
my right to have, to be organized.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.842
What he said was I
watched that documentary

00:09:45.842 --> 00:09:47.952
I couldn't figure out what
was so bad about them.

00:09:47.952 --> 00:09:49.793
It's like it was some
distant thing that he

00:09:49.793 --> 00:09:53.104
knew existed once in the past decades ago

00:09:53.104 --> 00:09:56.346
and had stopped existing and was now

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:58.276
part of the History Channel.

00:09:58.276 --> 00:10:00.233
But it seemed like not such a bad thing

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:02.624
so why was Target telling
him it was such a bad thing.

00:10:02.624 --> 00:10:07.604
So that made me sad because
it showed how far away

00:10:07.604 --> 00:10:09.873
that tradition had gotten from a true

00:10:09.873 --> 00:10:12.540
working class American in Tampa.

00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:17.429
Which was a union town by the way.

00:10:17.429 --> 00:10:21.596
- The transition from the
time of your research, writing

00:10:23.795 --> 00:10:27.614
to the emergence of the era of Trump

00:10:27.614 --> 00:10:30.925
has been one in which,
and you point this out

00:10:30.925 --> 00:10:34.758
in your October 2016
article in The New Yorker

00:10:36.653 --> 00:10:41.511
on the campaign, one in which
identity politics emerged.

00:10:41.511 --> 00:10:44.326
I guess the question I
had was that apparent

00:10:44.326 --> 00:10:46.826
at the time of your writing or

00:10:49.878 --> 00:10:53.628
when does this transition
become so powerful?

00:10:56.584 --> 00:10:58.612
It's really an important
feature of the campaign.

00:10:58.612 --> 00:11:03.116
- I think identity
politics is always with us

00:11:03.116 --> 00:11:06.884
and a self conscious
white identity politics,

00:11:06.884 --> 00:11:11.051
not just white domination
but white identity politics

00:11:12.194 --> 00:11:16.673
to me first emerged in the
candidacy of Sarah Palin

00:11:16.673 --> 00:11:20.840
when she flaunted kind of
small town white culture,

00:11:22.395 --> 00:11:26.426
white boots, white
music, redneck woman was

00:11:26.426 --> 00:11:28.748
the theme song of her campaign.

00:11:28.748 --> 00:11:31.796
It was in your face identity politics

00:11:31.796 --> 00:11:36.652
and her crowds were entirely
white which isn't always true

00:11:36.652 --> 00:11:40.105
even at a Republican political event.

00:11:40.105 --> 00:11:44.400
And that was when I
first noticed this thing

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.535
that had emerged which seemed
offensive and resentful

00:11:47.535 --> 00:11:51.702
and like about kind of demanding
our rights which is not,

00:11:55.164 --> 00:11:58.572
in general white politics is
simply the dominant politics.

00:11:58.572 --> 00:12:00.332
It's not self conscious in that way

00:12:00.332 --> 00:12:03.066
but it seemed to be taking
on some of the forms of

00:12:03.066 --> 00:12:07.676
non white identity politics
when she came along.

00:12:07.676 --> 00:12:11.152
But then it got submerged for a while.

00:12:11.152 --> 00:12:13.492
Good old fashioned racism was there

00:12:13.492 --> 00:12:15.368
in many places I was writing about

00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:17.855
especially in North Carolina where Obama

00:12:17.855 --> 00:12:20.639
was deeply unpopular with most people,

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:23.709
although not with the the
guy I was writing about,

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:28.560
Dean Price who sort of revered
and was obsessed with Obama.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.340
So it was clear that Obama
as the first black president

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.130
was an affront to a lot of people I met

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.741
in the small towns of
Western North Carolina,

00:12:37.741 --> 00:12:41.320
Southern Virginia, Martinsville area.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.131
I remember in the
midterm elections of 2010

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:48.755
being at a polling place
in Martinsville and

00:12:48.755 --> 00:12:52.922
an older white woman whose
husband had just recently died

00:12:54.219 --> 00:12:56.886
just spitting angry at Obama for

00:12:58.132 --> 00:12:59.948
being in the Oval Office and for somehow

00:12:59.948 --> 00:13:02.915
running down the presidency
and not speaking right,

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:04.410
not dressing right, and all these things

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.564
I found just mind boggling.

00:13:06.564 --> 00:13:08.222
What are you talking about?

00:13:08.222 --> 00:13:12.389
She thought this man is somehow
desecrating the presidency.

00:13:16.567 --> 00:13:18.143
I mean wonder how she feels about

00:13:18.143 --> 00:13:20.526
the guy who's desecrating
the presidency right now.

00:13:20.526 --> 00:13:24.693
That was there but the
reaction to Obama on the left

00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:30.544
and among minorities
took a few more years and

00:13:32.341 --> 00:13:34.481
that came after my book was published.

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:37.444
The following year, 2014 with Ferguson

00:13:37.444 --> 00:13:40.485
and Black Lives Matter,
and the other incidents

00:13:40.485 --> 00:13:43.838
of police brutality and it changed

00:13:43.838 --> 00:13:45.390
the atmosphere dramatically.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:49.557
The last two years of Obama's
presidency were characterized,

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.086
the dominant political
event in the country was

00:13:55.086 --> 00:13:59.108
the return of identity
politics on the left.

00:13:59.108 --> 00:14:01.088
And that's still with us today.

00:14:01.088 --> 00:14:05.159
And it's now I think at
even more intense level

00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:08.032
because Trump is producing a reaction.

00:14:08.032 --> 00:14:10.383
- Before we talk about identity politics

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:14.383
I do want to have you
repeat the phrase you have

00:14:15.226 --> 00:14:18.393
about Sarah Palin's relation to Trump.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.766
You recall a beautiful phrase.

00:14:21.766 --> 00:14:23.381
You call her the...

00:14:23.381 --> 00:14:24.633
- John the Baptist--

00:14:24.633 --> 00:14:25.655
- For Trump.

00:14:25.655 --> 00:14:28.445
- She was the the one who went before

00:14:28.445 --> 00:14:31.417
and was a harbinger of what was to come.

00:14:31.417 --> 00:14:33.022
And she was one of his first supporters.

00:14:33.022 --> 00:14:35.439
She was poor and he was rich.

00:14:37.606 --> 00:14:41.523
But they were breathing
the same noxious air of

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.497
celebrity worship and kind
of lowering of standards,

00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.457
celebrating the lowering of standards.

00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:54.736
I was sitting in a diner in a little town

00:14:54.736 --> 00:14:58.153
in Southeastern Ohio in the fall of 2008.

00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:01.850
She had just been nominated Vice President

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.450
and these women were
saying to me we love her.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.764
I said why and they said
she would fit right in here.

00:15:08.764 --> 00:15:10.802
She's just like us.

00:15:10.802 --> 00:15:13.356
And that too was kind
of a epiphany for me.

00:15:13.356 --> 00:15:17.834
You mean what you want is
you in the highest office,

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:21.417
not someone with
qualifications, experience

00:15:22.726 --> 00:15:25.639
who speaks in a slightly different way

00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:28.826
and who knows their way around
foreign capitals, et cetera.

00:15:28.826 --> 00:15:30.147
You want you.

00:15:30.147 --> 00:15:32.147
That was a sign of utter

00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:37.989
cynicism toward the political class,

00:15:37.989 --> 00:15:41.072
contempt for expertise, and populism.

00:15:43.277 --> 00:15:44.811
That's what populism sounded like.

00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:47.207
And that was when I
really began to hear it

00:15:47.207 --> 00:15:49.472
with Sarah, with John
the Baptist Sarah Palin.

00:15:49.472 --> 00:15:53.493
- One of the themes in
earlier works is this

00:15:53.493 --> 00:15:57.433
coming to terms with
your observations that

00:15:57.433 --> 00:16:00.780
reason was being displaced basically

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.630
as part of the discourse basically.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.713
And we're moving not your,
this is an observation

00:16:08.648 --> 00:16:12.415
on your point that that
rational discussion

00:16:12.415 --> 00:16:15.082
was leaving the public space and

00:16:17.136 --> 00:16:20.306
what you just described is a sense of

00:16:20.306 --> 00:16:22.970
there's an emotional reaction to her.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.541
It's not thought out.

00:16:25.541 --> 00:16:29.013
It's not the result of the policies

00:16:29.013 --> 00:16:31.513
that Sarah Palin is proposing.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.523
- You know I think we
have to be careful not to

00:16:35.523 --> 00:16:38.867
imagine a past that
was better than it was.

00:16:38.867 --> 00:16:41.617
I think politics is almost always

00:16:42.732 --> 00:16:45.438
dominated by people's emotions.

00:16:45.438 --> 00:16:48.284
Choices of leader are
dominated by how you feel

00:16:48.284 --> 00:16:52.451
about someone which might be
even pre-verbal or nonverbal.

00:16:54.748 --> 00:16:58.915
But in the debates that I
grew up watching for president

00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:04.558
the policies were the kind of the heart

00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:07.123
of what they were arguing about?

00:17:07.123 --> 00:17:09.280
What you might remember
is there you go again

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.863
or where's the beef
but that had to do with

00:17:15.333 --> 00:17:18.048
what you're gonna do to
Medicare or Social Security.

00:17:18.048 --> 00:17:19.522
- You're talking about an earlier period.

00:17:19.522 --> 00:17:20.860
Not in in the recent period.

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.741
- I'm talking about like the 70's, 80's.

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:24.347
- Yeah yeah yeah.

00:17:24.347 --> 00:17:25.180
- Now

00:17:27.398 --> 00:17:29.985
do candidates even
approach a debate thinking

00:17:29.985 --> 00:17:32.471
I've got to win the policy debate?

00:17:32.471 --> 00:17:37.043
Or do they think I've
got to appear to be like

00:17:37.043 --> 00:17:39.969
this kind of person in order to connect

00:17:39.969 --> 00:17:41.838
with a segment of the population

00:17:41.838 --> 00:17:44.181
that wants that kind of person?

00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:48.181
I think Trump's campaign
although he had slogans

00:17:50.243 --> 00:17:53.317
and even kind of half baked policy ideas

00:17:53.317 --> 00:17:56.067
that appeal to people what really

00:17:56.975 --> 00:18:00.058
provided the energy was the character

00:18:02.015 --> 00:18:04.085
and the kind of language he used.

00:18:04.085 --> 00:18:05.669
This is not new.

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:08.135
I don't want to say that in the past

00:18:08.135 --> 00:18:10.692
we've all been Oxford
Debate Union citizens

00:18:10.692 --> 00:18:13.938
who just decided you scored
more points than you.

00:18:13.938 --> 00:18:14.977
Of course not.

00:18:14.977 --> 00:18:17.107
But it feels like this
is now displaced any

00:18:17.107 --> 00:18:21.417
almost anything else this is
where politics has gotten.

00:18:21.417 --> 00:18:24.066
And that's also populism because

00:18:24.066 --> 00:18:26.944
it means establishing a direct connection

00:18:26.944 --> 00:18:29.564
between the leader and the people

00:18:29.564 --> 00:18:31.698
which Trump consciously did.

00:18:31.698 --> 00:18:32.957
I am your voice.

00:18:32.957 --> 00:18:34.160
I alone can fix it.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.327
That was his way of saying
I'm channeling my followers.

00:18:40.436 --> 00:18:43.706
And so they identify with him personally.

00:18:43.706 --> 00:18:46.980
And they were the same hat and

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.052
that makes it very difficult
to persuade people of things

00:18:51.052 --> 00:18:55.846
because it's a tribalism,
it's a tribal identity.

00:18:55.846 --> 00:18:59.763
- An important piece of
your Unwinding book was

00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:05.596
a whole section on the celebrity culture.

00:19:06.447 --> 00:19:09.874
And although Trump isn't one
of the figures you identified--

00:19:09.874 --> 00:19:11.957
- He almost was, damn it.

00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:15.278
I thought about, I
thought he's too obvious.

00:19:15.278 --> 00:19:17.522
If I put him in people will just say

00:19:17.522 --> 00:19:19.650
oh I think of course Trump is in there.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.004
- That that was because
you lived in New York

00:19:22.004 --> 00:19:24.369
and we're so used to him basically.

00:19:24.369 --> 00:19:26.840
But it in other words

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.830
when you think about that
section of your book you

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.912
and then you look at Trump
oh yeah this is I mean

00:19:34.912 --> 00:19:37.495
so there is this element of him

00:19:38.543 --> 00:19:41.134
that you capture in the profiles where you

00:19:41.134 --> 00:19:45.301
seem to be saying that
leaders are people we admire

00:19:46.743 --> 00:19:49.295
because the great life they live.

00:19:49.295 --> 00:19:51.813
- They live it in in our stead.

00:19:51.813 --> 00:19:54.701
We don't aspire to being where they are.

00:19:54.701 --> 00:19:57.784
That's for an age of upward mobility.

00:19:58.978 --> 00:20:01.858
They represent us, they speak for us.

00:20:01.858 --> 00:20:03.275
And I saw that in

00:20:06.204 --> 00:20:08.994
sort of in Sam Walton's
story which is the story

00:20:08.994 --> 00:20:11.744
of a small town guy from Missouri

00:20:13.453 --> 00:20:16.453
who becomes the world's richest man.

00:20:18.478 --> 00:20:23.435
And in some ways they don't
have to be because he's

00:20:23.435 --> 00:20:27.602
like them he's a figure
that they can identify with.

00:20:29.271 --> 00:20:33.184
Jay-Z, I had all these
celebrity profiles so

00:20:33.184 --> 00:20:36.526
from different sectors of our society.

00:20:36.526 --> 00:20:39.253
From politics, from entertainment,

00:20:39.253 --> 00:20:41.526
from business, finance, government.

00:20:41.526 --> 00:20:44.886
Jay-Z at a concert that I went to

00:20:44.886 --> 00:20:49.053
so that I had some feel for
him was saying to his fans

00:20:52.444 --> 00:20:55.600
I am the new Jackie Robinson.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.059
I'm breaking all the barriers.

00:20:57.059 --> 00:20:59.258
I'm a part owner of the Brooklyn Nets.

00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:02.505
We're in the Barclays Arena
which I'm a part owner of.

00:21:02.505 --> 00:21:06.611
I am you in this place,
I'm at the table for you.

00:21:06.611 --> 00:21:10.630
And the fans would
flash his corporate logo

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:15.573
back at him to say yes we
follow you, we have your symbol.

00:21:15.573 --> 00:21:20.107
And that seemed like a new
way to relate to celebrities.

00:21:20.107 --> 00:21:24.664
When I was growing up
celebrities were sports heroes

00:21:24.664 --> 00:21:27.022
could draw a great deal of admiration

00:21:27.022 --> 00:21:30.583
but they were kind of like a diversion.

00:21:30.583 --> 00:21:35.145
Liz Taylor and Richard
Burton are at it again.

00:21:35.145 --> 00:21:39.797
But now they're like a brand
that you associate with

00:21:39.797 --> 00:21:44.514
and it's a way of feeling
as if you have a place

00:21:44.514 --> 00:21:46.778
in the sun when you know you won't

00:21:46.778 --> 00:21:50.914
because the doors don't
open for you anymore.

00:21:50.914 --> 00:21:53.997
And I think of it as a kind of malign

00:21:54.875 --> 00:21:57.676
symptom of loss of
faith in our own ability

00:21:57.676 --> 00:22:01.843
to govern ourselves instead
we hand it off to these god's.

00:22:04.411 --> 00:22:08.145
- In The New Yorker article you make

00:22:08.145 --> 00:22:12.834
an important distinction
going back to this problem

00:22:12.834 --> 00:22:16.021
of identity and the working class

00:22:16.021 --> 00:22:19.638
in which what emerged for the first time

00:22:19.638 --> 00:22:21.985
either during the campaign or before it

00:22:21.985 --> 00:22:26.082
was the notion of a white working class.

00:22:26.082 --> 00:22:30.249
So identity politics was
combined with traditional notions

00:22:35.806 --> 00:22:39.921
of thinking about society
in terms of class.

00:22:39.921 --> 00:22:40.794
Talk about that.

00:22:40.794 --> 00:22:44.070
- There's always been a
very clearly identified

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.607
white working class and
it's had different names.

00:22:45.607 --> 00:22:49.107
Blue collar was its name 50, 70 years ago.

00:22:51.902 --> 00:22:55.569
Tradesmen, working man,
in the 19th century.

00:22:57.726 --> 00:23:02.024
It's now a kind of
political science category

00:23:02.024 --> 00:23:06.191
because it behaves in a
particular way that is distinct

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.224
from other groups of whites.

00:23:13.224 --> 00:23:15.084
It gave Donald Trump his victory.

00:23:15.084 --> 00:23:17.800
I mean it was overwhelmingly the force

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.477
that brought him to office.

00:23:19.477 --> 00:23:20.806
- [Harry] He won every category.

00:23:20.806 --> 00:23:23.182
- He won every category
of white but his vote

00:23:23.182 --> 00:23:26.126
among working class whites which

00:23:26.126 --> 00:23:28.141
I think the political scientists define

00:23:28.141 --> 00:23:31.391
as non-college degree was overwhelming.

00:23:32.872 --> 00:23:36.205
In some areas it was like 75% which

00:23:37.476 --> 00:23:40.476
was not true for Mitt Romney in fact

00:23:42.095 --> 00:23:45.968
Obama won some of those
votes in 2008 and 2012.

00:23:45.968 --> 00:23:50.670
So something shifted and I
think it's this identification

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.666
with Trump as their
voice as their tribune.

00:23:53.666 --> 00:23:57.333
Not his policies but
his character his ethos

00:23:58.297 --> 00:24:02.464
and it's a, I think a probably
inevitable response to

00:24:05.156 --> 00:24:08.176
two terms of a black president which

00:24:08.176 --> 00:24:12.343
for some white Americans was a
shock and an unwelcome shock,

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:17.353
and becoming another
minority group among several

00:24:19.922 --> 00:24:22.305
rather than the dominant majority.

00:24:22.305 --> 00:24:25.984
As we become a more ethnically
heterogeneous society

00:24:25.984 --> 00:24:29.651
with immigration and
with demographic trends

00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:34.974
whites who feel like the deck is stacked

00:24:34.974 --> 00:24:36.470
increasingly stacked against them

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:41.187
are going to see themselves
as a group with a grievance.

00:24:41.187 --> 00:24:43.854
And that became Trump's group so

00:24:44.734 --> 00:24:47.178
the white working class
which has always been

00:24:47.178 --> 00:24:51.345
a big category for political
scientists now is the

00:24:53.371 --> 00:24:56.422
sort of the great mystery
people are trying to solve.

00:24:56.422 --> 00:24:58.371
It's been moving in the
Republican direction

00:24:58.371 --> 00:25:02.828
for three decades, you can
just see it at each point.

00:25:02.828 --> 00:25:05.560
Bill Clinton reversed it a
bit, Obama reversed it a bit

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.705
but it's really been headed that way.

00:25:08.705 --> 00:25:10.398
Probably and certainly in the South

00:25:10.398 --> 00:25:12.944
since the Civil Rights Act and

00:25:12.944 --> 00:25:16.063
in the rest of the country
since the Reagan era.

00:25:16.063 --> 00:25:19.934
Reagan Democrats, those
were working class whites.

00:25:19.934 --> 00:25:21.767
It's a huge part of the electorate.

00:25:21.767 --> 00:25:23.770
I think some progressives
think it's kind of

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.380
gonna disappear, they're gonna die off

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.213
by suicide or opioid
overdose or just old age.

00:25:32.115 --> 00:25:36.282
They're 40% of the electorate
from what I understand so

00:25:37.545 --> 00:25:38.876
it's kind of like staring you in the face.

00:25:38.876 --> 00:25:42.387
It's something even if you don't like

00:25:42.387 --> 00:25:46.691
its political behavior
you can't wish it away.

00:25:46.691 --> 00:25:50.858
- Your analysis and description,
your descriptive analysis

00:25:53.024 --> 00:25:57.107
looks at many factors in
explaining where we are.

00:25:58.485 --> 00:26:01.277
But you've come under criticism from

00:26:01.277 --> 00:26:04.863
your friend Ta-Nehisi Coates in a piece in

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:07.724
The Atlantic and I guess in his new book

00:26:07.724 --> 00:26:11.724
as both ignoring race and
then on the other hand

00:26:13.118 --> 00:26:17.963
not seeing race as really
the cause of everything

00:26:17.963 --> 00:26:21.219
that has come to pass with Trump.

00:26:21.219 --> 00:26:24.894
So that Trump, he calls him the first

00:26:24.894 --> 00:26:28.174
white president and
that Obama's presidency

00:26:28.174 --> 00:26:30.584
made Trump inevitable I think he said.

00:26:30.584 --> 00:26:34.594
- Yeah and I think the first
white president is a brilliant

00:26:34.594 --> 00:26:37.242
insight and I think it I agree with that.

00:26:37.242 --> 00:26:40.723
Yeah I don't want to
put words in his mouth

00:26:40.723 --> 00:26:44.155
but he criticized that
piece that you mentioned,

00:26:44.155 --> 00:26:46.988
my piece pre-election for focusing

00:26:50.024 --> 00:26:53.435
so much attention on the
white working class and

00:26:53.435 --> 00:26:55.375
why it had left the Democratic Party

00:26:55.375 --> 00:26:57.546
and gone to the Republicans
and why it seemed to

00:26:57.546 --> 00:27:01.692
have been captured by
Trump and Coates thought

00:27:01.692 --> 00:27:06.271
you're just trying to in
some way separate yourself

00:27:06.271 --> 00:27:09.759
and all whites from
this class when in fact

00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:13.278
Trump got the support,
the majority of votes

00:27:13.278 --> 00:27:17.880
from every category of whites
including educated whites.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.199
And so he really is the white president

00:27:21.199 --> 00:27:23.616
who represents the return of,

00:27:25.056 --> 00:27:28.534
after eight years of Obama
kind of a vengeful return

00:27:28.534 --> 00:27:32.284
of white supremacy to
our to our politics and

00:27:34.361 --> 00:27:36.758
he thought I was evading that and maybe

00:27:36.758 --> 00:27:40.072
evading my own complicity in that.

00:27:40.072 --> 00:27:43.493
And you know it's hard
to answer a charge of

00:27:43.493 --> 00:27:47.741
you're just avoiding
the truth about yourself

00:27:47.741 --> 00:27:50.574
when that truth is a truth that I,

00:27:51.844 --> 00:27:54.901
it's sort of I was born with that truth.

00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:59.448
My answer is no one should
ever underestimate race

00:27:59.448 --> 00:28:01.556
in America and certainly Trump brought it

00:28:01.556 --> 00:28:05.723
to a new level of explicit
and broadly accepted vitriol.

00:28:09.843 --> 00:28:12.760
Although he was much more concerned

00:28:14.373 --> 00:28:17.761
with immigrants and Muslims
during his campaign rallies

00:28:17.761 --> 00:28:19.928
than he was with black Americans.

00:28:19.928 --> 00:28:21.926
The focus was more on
those other groups so

00:28:21.926 --> 00:28:26.812
to put it in black and white
terms I think is a bit of

00:28:26.812 --> 00:28:30.979
a misread of where Trump, what
particular kinds of hostility

00:28:31.865 --> 00:28:34.230
and bigotry he was stirring up.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.766
But certainly it also had to do with

00:28:36.766 --> 00:28:40.766
our ancient racial burden
and yet then you start

00:28:43.175 --> 00:28:45.719
thinking about the other things
that got Trump where he was.

00:28:45.719 --> 00:28:49.249
How can we ignore the
fact that Hillary Clinton

00:28:49.249 --> 00:28:52.122
was the first woman to come
that close to the presidency

00:28:52.122 --> 00:28:55.514
and that the hatred for her was so intense

00:28:55.514 --> 00:28:58.633
that it could not be explained
by her Email server alone?

00:28:58.633 --> 00:29:01.604
It had to be on a more
primal level and I think

00:29:01.604 --> 00:29:04.645
it had a lot to do with
her being a powerful woman.

00:29:04.645 --> 00:29:08.396
So I think misogyny was
right there in the mix.

00:29:08.396 --> 00:29:12.396
How can you ignore the
fact that the areas where

00:29:13.597 --> 00:29:17.526
cultural resentment, racial
resentment was strongest

00:29:17.526 --> 00:29:21.055
by polling numbers are
the same areas where

00:29:21.055 --> 00:29:25.864
the sense of being under siege
by forces of globalization

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:30.394
and having the sort of the
underpinnings of your community

00:29:30.394 --> 00:29:34.043
disappearing under your
feet and your children

00:29:34.043 --> 00:29:37.510
struggling and your neighbors turning to

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:41.827
either drugs or crime or
government benefits or all of them,

00:29:41.827 --> 00:29:43.460
how can you ignore that connection?

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.910
They are obviously related.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.778
I don't want to have to
sort it all out and say

00:29:46.778 --> 00:29:51.626
well it was 27% economics
and 43% race and 30%,

00:29:51.626 --> 00:29:55.793
to me they reinforce each
other and I don't think of

00:29:57.858 --> 00:30:01.858
race in our politics as
a fixed immutable force.

00:30:02.797 --> 00:30:06.964
It can change depending on the
circumstances and context and

00:30:09.627 --> 00:30:13.544
depending on the the
verbal atmosphere were in.

00:30:15.903 --> 00:30:20.070
Trump unleashed things that
were obviously there but that

00:30:22.794 --> 00:30:26.627
in other context would
keep themselves in check.

00:30:26.627 --> 00:30:30.394
And he exacerbated them and amplified them

00:30:30.394 --> 00:30:33.975
in ways that I don't
think any other politician

00:30:33.975 --> 00:30:38.015
except maybe George Wallace
has done so explicitly

00:30:38.015 --> 00:30:40.549
at that level, national level.

00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:43.869
So I don't know it's a long way of saying

00:30:43.869 --> 00:30:46.577
I think it's too complicated for one cause

00:30:46.577 --> 00:30:48.843
to explain everything about Trump.

00:30:48.843 --> 00:30:53.010
- One of the interesting parts
of your New Yorker article

00:30:55.866 --> 00:30:58.949
was the evolution of the Democratic Party

00:30:58.949 --> 00:31:02.699
because you're saying
that part of this story

00:31:04.228 --> 00:31:08.649
and a very important part
is the Democratic Party's

00:31:08.649 --> 00:31:11.867
changing of its primary constituency

00:31:11.867 --> 00:31:15.367
from the working class to the meritocracy.

00:31:16.772 --> 00:31:20.079
Talk a little about that
because that's critical here

00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:22.920
because there there's so
many pieces to this puzzle.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.593
And this is a truly important one.

00:31:24.593 --> 00:31:28.475
- I tried to tell a
very simplified version

00:31:28.475 --> 00:31:30.708
of the story of how beginning in

00:31:30.708 --> 00:31:32.762
the late 60's really you can pinpoint it.

00:31:32.762 --> 00:31:36.933
The '68 Democratic
convention which was a riot

00:31:36.933 --> 00:31:41.100
forced changes in the party
that diminished the power

00:31:42.379 --> 00:31:46.302
of the old brokers who
were the big city mayors,

00:31:46.302 --> 00:31:49.759
the union leaders, kind of the New Deal

00:31:49.759 --> 00:31:53.926
Democratic coalition and
forced the party to democratize

00:31:55.762 --> 00:31:58.705
its selection process for president

00:31:58.705 --> 00:32:02.622
and its selection process
for delegates so that

00:32:04.652 --> 00:32:07.827
minority groups struggling
for equal rights,

00:32:07.827 --> 00:32:10.994
single cause activists who were either

00:32:12.855 --> 00:32:15.938
anti-war, pro-environment, et cetera,

00:32:17.518 --> 00:32:20.113
what became known as the new politics,

00:32:20.113 --> 00:32:23.855
younger, better educated, not attached

00:32:23.855 --> 00:32:27.022
to these old institutions like unions.

00:32:28.423 --> 00:32:31.410
That first emerged as a force in '72.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.820
It helped get George McGovern nominated.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:37.403
Bill Clinton was a
McGovern worker in Texas

00:32:39.694 --> 00:32:43.792
with his girlfriend from
Yale Law School Hillary and

00:32:43.792 --> 00:32:47.459
they were classic cases
of young boomers who

00:32:50.258 --> 00:32:52.219
came out of, especially Bill Clinton,

00:32:52.219 --> 00:32:53.983
out of an atmosphere that was more like

00:32:53.983 --> 00:32:56.310
the New Deal Coalition but were headed

00:32:56.310 --> 00:33:01.119
in a different direction
which was the direction of

00:33:01.119 --> 00:33:03.863
it's sort of politics tinged with idealism

00:33:03.863 --> 00:33:08.030
but also without much feel
for the issue of class and of

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.907
economic injustice and of kind
of the haves and have nots.

00:33:12.907 --> 00:33:17.500
That's not the way Bill
Clinton I think saw politics.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:22.273
And Gary Hart was a campaign
manager for George McGovern.

00:33:22.273 --> 00:33:23.821
And Hart was the first one to really

00:33:23.821 --> 00:33:28.204
take this new politics to the
presidential level in '84.

00:33:28.204 --> 00:33:31.429
Bill Clinton was the first
to become president with it.

00:33:31.429 --> 00:33:33.886
By the 90's the Democrats although they

00:33:33.886 --> 00:33:37.053
still talked the talk of unions and of

00:33:39.655 --> 00:33:42.360
economic justice we're really the party

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.277
of the educated, and of minorities.

00:33:47.615 --> 00:33:50.357
Bill Clinton embrace
globalization with both arms.

00:33:50.357 --> 00:33:52.255
He saw it as the answer.

00:33:52.255 --> 00:33:54.739
He gave a speech at a White House

00:33:54.739 --> 00:33:56.374
conference on the new economy.

00:33:56.374 --> 00:33:57.707
Remember the new economy?

00:33:57.707 --> 00:33:59.875
Everything was gonna be solved by,

00:33:59.875 --> 00:34:01.798
we've repealed the business cycle.

00:34:01.798 --> 00:34:04.736
It's just growth growth growth
because we have deregulation

00:34:04.736 --> 00:34:07.445
plus technology, plus education,

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:10.441
plus breaking down
barriers between countries.

00:34:10.441 --> 00:34:13.027
It is gonna be nonstop growth.

00:34:13.027 --> 00:34:14.635
And he said that the internet would be

00:34:14.635 --> 00:34:16.945
the greatest engine for reducing poverty

00:34:16.945 --> 00:34:20.862
the world had ever seen,
which today looks mad.

00:34:22.122 --> 00:34:24.615
That was the atmosphere around so that

00:34:24.615 --> 00:34:29.387
style of Democrat took
over the party in the 90's

00:34:29.387 --> 00:34:33.554
and Barack Obama I would
say is a creature of that

00:34:35.576 --> 00:34:39.225
who came out of the same meritocratic

00:34:39.225 --> 00:34:43.308
race that Bill Clinton
did so what that meant was

00:34:46.023 --> 00:34:49.822
the connection to working class Americans

00:34:49.822 --> 00:34:53.989
who were no longer organized
in unions so much and who were

00:34:56.182 --> 00:34:59.839
turning to a more resentful
politics because of

00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:02.071
a sense that they were being left behind.

00:35:02.071 --> 00:35:04.007
Democrats really no longer
had that connection.

00:35:04.007 --> 00:35:06.126
They talked it but they didn't have it.

00:35:06.126 --> 00:35:08.959
But we didn't quite see it starkly

00:35:10.171 --> 00:35:13.916
until 2016 when it decided the election.

00:35:13.916 --> 00:35:17.166
- And what this transcension, sorry sir

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.887
transition leads to is
a lack of realization

00:35:25.221 --> 00:35:27.613
when we come to Hillary's campaign

00:35:27.613 --> 00:35:30.861
that you could have many policies,

00:35:30.861 --> 00:35:32.804
proposed many policies that address

00:35:32.804 --> 00:35:36.432
the problems we're
confronting but in a way

00:35:36.432 --> 00:35:39.142
people weren't listening,
weren't interested

00:35:39.142 --> 00:35:42.412
even when a policy was
passed they didn't realize

00:35:42.412 --> 00:35:43.814
that they were benefiting from it.

00:35:43.814 --> 00:35:46.981
And what replaced policy was identity.

00:35:48.955 --> 00:35:50.389
- I got to interview her

00:35:50.389 --> 00:35:52.392
a month before the election last year.

00:35:52.392 --> 00:35:57.036
At that moment it seemed like
she was headed for victory.

00:35:57.036 --> 00:35:59.515
I was asking her a bunch of questions

00:35:59.515 --> 00:36:02.826
that were all around the
the fundamental question

00:36:02.826 --> 00:36:06.221
how did the Democrats lose these voters?

00:36:06.221 --> 00:36:07.842
Why are they all for your opponent,

00:36:07.842 --> 00:36:11.420
and how can you get them back,
and how can you help them?

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.456
And she had a lot of answers.

00:36:14.456 --> 00:36:17.153
She talked about corporate
responsibility and

00:36:17.153 --> 00:36:21.078
profit sharing and getting
corporate corporations

00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:23.274
to think more in the long
term and more about jobs

00:36:23.274 --> 00:36:26.696
and less about the quarterly earnings.

00:36:26.696 --> 00:36:28.462
She talked about breaking up monopolies.

00:36:28.462 --> 00:36:31.853
She talked about getting
back to manufacturing

00:36:31.853 --> 00:36:33.808
in parts of the country
where it had disappeared

00:36:33.808 --> 00:36:34.916
and how you could do that.

00:36:34.916 --> 00:36:39.653
She talked about, she used the
phrase educational elitism.

00:36:39.653 --> 00:36:42.022
She was almost criticizing I think her own

00:36:42.022 --> 00:36:44.725
husband and herself for having

00:36:44.725 --> 00:36:48.041
moved the Democratic Party
or being part of a move

00:36:48.041 --> 00:36:52.208
that really saw education
as the answer to everything.

00:36:53.156 --> 00:36:56.286
She understood that that
left out a lot of people

00:36:56.286 --> 00:36:59.026
who were never going to
get a graduate degree

00:36:59.026 --> 00:37:03.193
and never going to be symbolic
analysts in the new economy.

00:37:06.006 --> 00:37:08.087
She was thinking about that but there were

00:37:08.087 --> 00:37:10.811
all these small bore policy ideas.

00:37:10.811 --> 00:37:13.125
And I thought while I was listening to her

00:37:13.125 --> 00:37:15.388
these all sound good.

00:37:15.388 --> 00:37:18.012
I really have barely heard
any of this on the campaign.

00:37:18.012 --> 00:37:19.828
I'm sure you've said it but it just didn't

00:37:19.828 --> 00:37:23.017
get through 'cause the noise is too loud.

00:37:23.017 --> 00:37:25.451
And it's not gonna help
you on election day.

00:37:25.451 --> 00:37:28.534
It's not gonna get the voters who are

00:37:30.436 --> 00:37:34.208
the objects of these ideas to vote for you

00:37:34.208 --> 00:37:37.684
because that's not why they
are voting the way they vote.

00:37:37.684 --> 00:37:41.721
- And interestingly as you look at this

00:37:41.721 --> 00:37:45.230
embrace of globalization, the abandonment

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:49.147
of the working class,
the emphasis on diversity

00:37:50.999 --> 00:37:54.440
and responding to
individual constituencies

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.857
and their right to realize their identity

00:37:59.054 --> 00:38:03.221
that on the one hand Trump
then becomes a response

00:38:05.521 --> 00:38:09.354
in a weird kind of way
to what the forces that

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.820
the Democratic Party was
unintentionally setting in place.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.987
So as you focus on discreet identities

00:38:22.939 --> 00:38:25.689
it opens up the identification of

00:38:28.234 --> 00:38:31.026
the working class with
the white working class.

00:38:31.026 --> 00:38:33.609
- Yeah exactly because although

00:38:35.101 --> 00:38:38.504
my conversation with
Hillary Clinton was about

00:38:38.504 --> 00:38:41.257
the working class and jobs and policies

00:38:41.257 --> 00:38:43.999
her campaign was an
identity politics campaign

00:38:43.999 --> 00:38:45.568
in the sense that she was really speaking

00:38:45.568 --> 00:38:49.522
to a lot of different
identity groups and saying

00:38:49.522 --> 00:38:52.927
I've got your back I've got
your back and hoping that

00:38:52.927 --> 00:38:55.975
the some of them all including

00:38:55.975 --> 00:38:59.087
her own identity group
educated professionals,

00:38:59.087 --> 00:39:01.928
would be enough to get her over the top.

00:39:01.928 --> 00:39:06.095
Rather than a truly compelling
vision that rose above them.

00:39:08.155 --> 00:39:10.148
I mean she said stronger
together that was her slogan

00:39:10.148 --> 00:39:13.228
but it felt like an empty slogan.

00:39:13.228 --> 00:39:17.773
What Republicans used to do
in response to that is to say

00:39:17.773 --> 00:39:21.940
we Republicans stand for a
transcendent American vision.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.047
We're not gonna divide
you up into these groups

00:39:27.047 --> 00:39:30.697
which of course they were doing because

00:39:30.697 --> 00:39:35.115
they were locking out groups
from their share of the pie.

00:39:35.115 --> 00:39:39.282
But they were speaking to a
kind of universal identity.

00:39:40.142 --> 00:39:41.740
That's not what Trump did.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:45.907
Trump didn't talk the Reagan
talk of the city on the hill.

00:39:47.153 --> 00:39:51.168
Trump made it clear that
he was there for you,

00:39:51.168 --> 00:39:54.168
white, Christian, largely small town

00:39:55.721 --> 00:39:57.888
rural Heartland Americans.

00:40:00.258 --> 00:40:04.074
They became a big identity
group among others

00:40:04.074 --> 00:40:05.992
and they became the focus of Trump.

00:40:05.992 --> 00:40:08.600
Remember I love the poorly educated.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.119
That's 'cause they were
his biggest supporters and

00:40:12.119 --> 00:40:14.039
he didn't say the white poorly educated

00:40:14.039 --> 00:40:16.282
but everyone understood
what he was saying.

00:40:16.282 --> 00:40:20.449
Trump beat Hillary by creating
a bigger identity group

00:40:22.684 --> 00:40:24.970
than the ones that supported Hillary.

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:29.557
- The election, and now
if you watch the news you,

00:40:29.557 --> 00:40:33.464
and I should say again
that in a way your book

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:36.131
helped us understand the context

00:40:37.219 --> 00:40:40.607
that was pushing all of this along.

00:40:40.607 --> 00:40:44.631
But what has a sense that
the country is breaking apart

00:40:44.631 --> 00:40:48.464
basically or at a minimum
there are two worlds

00:40:49.861 --> 00:40:53.035
that don't talk to each other
and have their own media.

00:40:53.035 --> 00:40:57.143
Yesterday in your lecture you identified

00:40:57.143 --> 00:41:00.726
four different narratives
of the way people

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:06.257
are telling their story
and trying to retell

00:41:07.266 --> 00:41:11.172
the story of America and point
to the future for America.

00:41:11.172 --> 00:41:15.339
Briefly recount the four
groups narratives that you see.

00:41:17.229 --> 00:41:20.603
- And you could easily
come up with others.

00:41:20.603 --> 00:41:24.284
These are the four that I
think are the strongest.

00:41:24.284 --> 00:41:26.117
And they're sort of...

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.293
Something I saw in my reporting
for the unwinding was that

00:41:30.293 --> 00:41:34.026
although the left right
division is very real and deep,

00:41:34.026 --> 00:41:38.700
it's a giant Marianas Trench
across which no one can travel.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.482
And the two sides are in these mutually

00:41:41.482 --> 00:41:44.759
incomprehensible hostile
camps, that is all true.

00:41:44.759 --> 00:41:46.860
If you watch Fox News all day
long you will be saturated

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:50.527
with a worldview that
is impenetrable to me.

00:41:51.706 --> 00:41:54.484
And you will not have,
be able to listen to me

00:41:54.484 --> 00:41:56.374
and I won't be able to listen
to you and that's where we are

00:41:56.374 --> 00:41:58.654
and social media, Twitter and Facebook,

00:41:58.654 --> 00:42:01.970
have utterly intensified that and made it

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:03.557
sort of tailored to the person.

00:42:03.557 --> 00:42:07.724
But in addition to left right,
red blue we have up and down.

00:42:09.569 --> 00:42:12.087
So if there are these the
four narratives that I

00:42:12.087 --> 00:42:15.837
talked about they are
up and down narratives.

00:42:17.319 --> 00:42:20.735
The up narrative on the
right is libertarian America

00:42:20.735 --> 00:42:24.036
which is the Koch brothers narrative.

00:42:24.036 --> 00:42:28.422
The up narrative on the left
is cosmopolitan America.

00:42:28.422 --> 00:42:32.128
It's the narrative of globalization and

00:42:32.128 --> 00:42:36.269
tolerance and openness and
the flow of people and goods

00:42:36.269 --> 00:42:40.102
and information which
is the Clintons America.

00:42:41.788 --> 00:42:46.232
The down narrative on the right
is America first, its Trump.

00:42:46.232 --> 00:42:49.028
And the down narrative on
the left is diverse America.

00:42:49.028 --> 00:42:50.561
It's groups that have been
historically oppressed

00:42:50.561 --> 00:42:54.144
that are now saying we
demand our share and

00:42:55.013 --> 00:42:58.596
in the lecture I
discussed how I think that

00:42:59.466 --> 00:43:03.633
just a necessary goal, can
easily become an end in it.

00:43:04.767 --> 00:43:08.934
That the identity as a category
for getting equal rights

00:43:09.872 --> 00:43:11.781
becomes an end in itself
and almost becomes

00:43:11.781 --> 00:43:15.502
a form of separatism which
is where diverse America

00:43:15.502 --> 00:43:17.674
our identity politics is going,

00:43:17.674 --> 00:43:21.104
especially in cultural
institutions like universities

00:43:21.104 --> 00:43:25.271
and like media, foundations,
even elementary schools.

00:43:28.168 --> 00:43:31.251
I see it in my own kids education so.

00:43:32.253 --> 00:43:36.336
None of those groups speaks
to the whole country,

00:43:37.865 --> 00:43:42.419
all of them have winners
and losers in their story.

00:43:42.419 --> 00:43:45.919
And they are all entrenched in a sort of a

00:43:50.046 --> 00:43:54.129
zero sum battle for power
that may be inevitable.

00:43:56.565 --> 00:43:59.565
Politics is a struggle for power but

00:44:00.414 --> 00:44:02.913
they don't speak to us as citizens.

00:44:02.913 --> 00:44:07.080
And they don't find a way
of being truly inclusive

00:44:09.854 --> 00:44:13.446
So I think that's, it's
just a way of looking

00:44:13.446 --> 00:44:17.667
at how truly tribal our
politics have become.

00:44:17.667 --> 00:44:19.995
Where we cannot understand each other,

00:44:19.995 --> 00:44:23.833
we see each other as
illegitimate in some ways.

00:44:23.833 --> 00:44:26.105
To even speak to someone
from a different tribe

00:44:26.105 --> 00:44:29.691
is to give them a legitimacy
they don't deserve.

00:44:29.691 --> 00:44:31.326
And each tribe hopes and thinks

00:44:31.326 --> 00:44:33.378
the other will somehow disappear

00:44:33.378 --> 00:44:35.587
either by being beaten in the polls

00:44:35.587 --> 00:44:38.670
or by dying off, by being walled off.

00:44:42.358 --> 00:44:44.791
It's as if they can't acknowledge that

00:44:44.791 --> 00:44:48.958
the country is made up of
more than their own tribe.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.460
- What sort of leadership,
what sort of ideas

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:58.627
should we be looking for
to take us over these humps

00:44:59.461 --> 00:45:03.294
because really your
description is so powerful

00:45:04.671 --> 00:45:08.838
of what's going on that it
almost seems impossible to

00:45:10.973 --> 00:45:13.269
bring us together again to use

00:45:13.269 --> 00:45:16.019
a hackneyed phrase from the past.

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:26.247
Is it this idea that you
talked about yesterday

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.160
of citizenship, and civic education,

00:45:31.504 --> 00:45:36.078
and maybe at the local level
and not in national leadership?

00:45:36.078 --> 00:45:40.245
- I think local politics is
much more hopeful because

00:45:42.295 --> 00:45:45.431
it's just not as poisoned
as national politics.

00:45:45.431 --> 00:45:49.598
It's not as paralyzed and
dysfunctional as Congress.

00:45:52.385 --> 00:45:54.758
People have to look at each
other and deal with each other.

00:45:54.758 --> 00:45:56.566
They're talking about
issues that they have

00:45:56.566 --> 00:45:59.264
in common like the air they breathe.

00:45:59.264 --> 00:46:00.595
It's kind of hard to...

00:46:00.595 --> 00:46:04.424
Yes we can politicize
the air we breathe but

00:46:04.424 --> 00:46:07.504
in the end you better have a solution

00:46:07.504 --> 00:46:10.500
or you're not gonna get reelected.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:14.053
You know citizenship is both to me

00:46:14.053 --> 00:46:18.139
the most inclusive category
and also a kind of empty

00:46:18.139 --> 00:46:21.629
category in that it doesn't
have a political content.

00:46:21.629 --> 00:46:22.950
It doesn't have ideas.

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:26.056
It's more of a kind of an activity.

00:46:26.056 --> 00:46:28.567
But it's an activity that we've lost.

00:46:28.567 --> 00:46:30.396
It may be coming back
I mean there's a lot of

00:46:30.396 --> 00:46:34.563
stirrings of civic activism
both on the right and the left.

00:46:37.407 --> 00:46:39.208
The Tea Party was a big one on the right.

00:46:39.208 --> 00:46:42.347
It was kind of nihilistic
and it burned itself out.

00:46:42.347 --> 00:46:46.520
The reaction to Trump is
now showing lots of life

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:50.191
and showing you know a
citizenry that actually

00:46:50.191 --> 00:46:54.105
is quite alert and awake and wants to

00:46:54.105 --> 00:46:55.705
get involved in public life.

00:46:55.705 --> 00:46:58.291
There's a lot of
candidates for local office

00:46:58.291 --> 00:47:00.922
on the Democratic side that
would not have shown up

00:47:00.922 --> 00:47:02.097
two years ago or four years ago.

00:47:02.097 --> 00:47:05.129
But meanwhile the Democratic
Party lost 1000 offices

00:47:05.129 --> 00:47:09.212
during the Obama years and
became a hollow structure

00:47:09.212 --> 00:47:11.354
without any real organic connection

00:47:11.354 --> 00:47:14.771
to their own base and their own voters so

00:47:16.143 --> 00:47:18.933
that's part of this institutional collapse

00:47:18.933 --> 00:47:22.579
that I was talking about in my book.

00:47:22.579 --> 00:47:24.500
I don't think a single
leader's gonna do it.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:28.667
These are deep fundamental
disagreements of value.

00:47:29.593 --> 00:47:34.582
There's no real papering them
over with inspiring rhetoric.

00:47:34.582 --> 00:47:37.082
I do think Barack Obama tried.

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:42.603
This was what his presidency was about.

00:47:42.603 --> 00:47:44.124
It was about uniting us.

00:47:44.124 --> 00:47:46.351
And in the last year of his presidency

00:47:46.351 --> 00:47:49.137
he gave a series of speeches
that never got much attention

00:47:49.137 --> 00:47:53.045
'cause the campaign was
so loud but that were

00:47:53.045 --> 00:47:57.212
like a last farewell testament
of what democracy is about.

00:47:59.016 --> 00:48:00.328
So it's worth looking at those speeches

00:48:00.328 --> 00:48:03.144
'cause he talks about empathy,
about listening to people

00:48:03.144 --> 00:48:05.026
who are not like you
who you disagree with.

00:48:05.026 --> 00:48:06.305
You may not ever agree with them

00:48:06.305 --> 00:48:08.373
but you have to listen to them.

00:48:08.373 --> 00:48:11.790
He talks about reason and about facts and

00:48:13.501 --> 00:48:17.010
about the long term and things
not happening overnight.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:20.865
Lots of to me you know
kind of the garden variety

00:48:20.865 --> 00:48:25.327
democratic values and he
was trying to reaffirm

00:48:25.327 --> 00:48:29.494
them when he had a chance
before he had to say goodbye and

00:48:30.396 --> 00:48:34.944
right now it looks, yeah
those things seem weak

00:48:34.944 --> 00:48:37.413
and almost namby-pamby compared to

00:48:37.413 --> 00:48:41.786
what we're up against with
the current president but

00:48:41.786 --> 00:48:44.174
we shouldn't lose sight of
them 'cause without them

00:48:44.174 --> 00:48:47.030
and especially that ability to actually...

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:48.700
It's a very painful thing
to get outside yourself

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.276
and listen to someone who you deeply

00:48:51.276 --> 00:48:54.005
disagree with and maybe deeply dislike.

00:48:54.005 --> 00:48:57.163
But right now it's almost considered

00:48:57.163 --> 00:49:00.996
immoral to do that on
both sides on all sides.

00:49:02.455 --> 00:49:05.120
Evangelical Christians
may think it's immoral

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.346
to even listen to
someone who's pro choice.

00:49:08.346 --> 00:49:12.918
But it's a perilous thing
to stop that because

00:49:12.918 --> 00:49:16.376
a democracy needs citizens above all.

00:49:16.376 --> 00:49:20.543
- Obama was articulating in a
way a philosophical statement.

00:49:25.644 --> 00:49:28.042
There is the problem
which you've identified

00:49:28.042 --> 00:49:31.582
and others have identified
that when you do something

00:49:31.582 --> 00:49:33.565
good for people, good in the sense

00:49:33.565 --> 00:49:37.861
of addressing their problems
they don't realize it.

00:49:37.861 --> 00:49:42.036
It doesn't enter their
consciousness in terms of

00:49:42.036 --> 00:49:46.727
changing their identity and
partly this is the result

00:49:46.727 --> 00:49:48.856
of a lack of political education.

00:49:48.856 --> 00:49:53.327
It's also of what technology
has done to the media

00:49:53.327 --> 00:49:56.069
and to the way things are reported.

00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:58.555
And you've written a lot on on the sort of

00:49:58.555 --> 00:50:01.138
negative impacts of technology.

00:50:02.244 --> 00:50:04.809
- Yeah I mean I'm a bit of
a technophobe I suppose.

00:50:04.809 --> 00:50:07.729
I had a visceral feeling that when I first

00:50:07.729 --> 00:50:10.906
got to know Twitter that
this was not going to

00:50:10.906 --> 00:50:14.108
empower all of us to be
more active citizens.

00:50:14.108 --> 00:50:17.858
It was gonna become an
addiction and probably

00:50:20.814 --> 00:50:23.266
eventually a fairly destructive addiction.

00:50:23.266 --> 00:50:25.039
And right now Twitter seems to me like

00:50:25.039 --> 00:50:29.278
a pretty negative force in
our politics and Facebook too.

00:50:29.278 --> 00:50:32.695
I didn't see the ways in which ideologues

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:38.486
and Russians were going
to use them to try to

00:50:38.486 --> 00:50:40.631
create divisions or exacerbate divisions.

00:50:40.631 --> 00:50:45.001
But that's a an incredible
new thing in our politics

00:50:45.001 --> 00:50:47.724
that the Russians understood first.

00:50:47.724 --> 00:50:50.118
They were already there
and they looked at us

00:50:50.118 --> 00:50:54.285
and at Poland and Hungary and
France and Catalonia and said

00:50:56.497 --> 00:51:00.577
we know how to to really
turn you against each other

00:51:00.577 --> 00:51:04.494
to make the very idea
that there might be truth

00:51:05.367 --> 00:51:08.751
kind of in doubt, just
destabilize everything.

00:51:08.751 --> 00:51:10.139
It's not gonna build anything new.

00:51:10.139 --> 00:51:13.140
It's just totally destructive
but we know how to do it.

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:16.343
And Facebook and Twitter
turned out to be ideal

00:51:16.343 --> 00:51:20.260
platforms for that kind
of nihilistic activity.

00:51:21.919 --> 00:51:26.086
And we Americans turned out
to be perfect marks for it.

00:51:27.364 --> 00:51:31.707
And man those those fake
news stories were genius.

00:51:31.707 --> 00:51:35.955
They were targeted at
particular communities.

00:51:35.955 --> 00:51:37.866
They were sort of in this devilish way

00:51:37.866 --> 00:51:41.304
of how could I really freak
out some white Christians

00:51:41.304 --> 00:51:44.251
in small towns outside Detroit?

00:51:44.251 --> 00:51:46.954
Well maybe if I create a fake group

00:51:46.954 --> 00:51:50.775
that is militantly anti-Islamophobia

00:51:50.775 --> 00:51:55.671
they might think they're
coming, they're taking over.

00:51:55.671 --> 00:51:57.047
It worked.

00:51:57.047 --> 00:51:59.788
It wouldn't have worked if our democracy

00:51:59.788 --> 00:52:02.418
had not been so fragile but
we had reached the point

00:52:02.418 --> 00:52:05.585
where we were kind of prey to this and

00:52:06.848 --> 00:52:09.102
I don't know how you undo that.

00:52:09.102 --> 00:52:11.703
- It's interesting that
the intelligence services

00:52:11.703 --> 00:52:15.375
didn't identify this problem
until it was too late

00:52:15.375 --> 00:52:17.998
in the game as far as the
election was concerned.

00:52:17.998 --> 00:52:21.383
- And unfortunately the
Obama administration

00:52:21.383 --> 00:52:25.060
did identify it and didn't
do anything about it

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.850
until it was too late because in his

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:30.891
fair minded and above it all way he didn't

00:52:30.891 --> 00:52:33.558
want to seem to be taking sides.

00:52:34.656 --> 00:52:37.730
Of course he endorsed
a campaign for Hillary

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:40.487
but he didn't want to
be using intelligence

00:52:40.487 --> 00:52:44.070
and the National Security
Council to indict

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:49.487
her opponent Donald Trump
for colluding with Russians.

00:52:50.629 --> 00:52:53.988
And yet they knew he
was so hat's on Obama.

00:52:53.988 --> 00:52:56.009
I bet Hillary will never
forgive him for that.

00:52:56.009 --> 00:52:57.759
- One final question.

00:52:59.533 --> 00:53:03.700
Your descriptive analysis in,
because of its objectivity,

00:53:06.278 --> 00:53:09.778
and because of your perceptive eye and ear

00:53:12.261 --> 00:53:14.511
for hearing what's going on

00:53:15.638 --> 00:53:19.138
doesn't have a lot of hope for the reader.

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.620
It may appear to be more
pessimistic than you are.

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:29.028
What are the threads of hope that you see?

00:53:29.028 --> 00:53:32.464
- I mean they're very
hard to find right now.

00:53:32.464 --> 00:53:36.297
When I look at the
humiliation of America as a

00:53:39.296 --> 00:53:40.921
force for good in the world,

00:53:40.921 --> 00:53:44.088
as a leader in the eyes of our allies.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.898
When I look at the disgraceful behavior

00:53:47.898 --> 00:53:50.059
at the highest levels in our government.

00:53:50.059 --> 00:53:52.892
When I look at corruption becoming

00:53:53.893 --> 00:53:56.167
I mean it's like people
don't even have the bandwidth

00:53:56.167 --> 00:53:59.869
to think about how much
corruption is happening

00:53:59.869 --> 00:54:02.926
in a daily way between
the Trump organization

00:54:02.926 --> 00:54:07.093
and the Trump administration
or the Kushner organization.

00:54:08.481 --> 00:54:12.148
It's pretty hard to say
yeah well if only we

00:54:13.189 --> 00:54:16.859
got rid of this guy because
I think it's much bigger

00:54:16.859 --> 00:54:18.613
and deeper and more
long lasting than Trump.

00:54:18.613 --> 00:54:22.780
It's about a weakening of
our faith in democracy and

00:54:24.515 --> 00:54:27.363
Trump has exploited
that pretty brilliantly.

00:54:27.363 --> 00:54:31.196
I think the only answer
is to try to combat it

00:54:33.257 --> 00:54:36.674
in one's own life and in one's activities

00:54:37.724 --> 00:54:40.040
and in what you do and support.

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.790
It's not gonna succeed overnight.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:47.575
The Democrats may not take
back Congress next year.

00:54:47.575 --> 00:54:48.702
They probably won't.

00:54:48.702 --> 00:54:51.289
They can't lose heart because of that

00:54:51.289 --> 00:54:53.535
because this is a long struggle.

00:54:53.535 --> 00:54:56.146
And it's not just about
Democrats retaking Congress.

00:54:56.146 --> 00:55:00.298
It's about solving
problems that will win back

00:55:00.298 --> 00:55:04.048
the trust of voters
whose trust they've lost.

00:55:05.431 --> 00:55:08.594
It's very hard to sustain
very much optimism.

00:55:08.594 --> 00:55:10.934
I don't have a choice I have children.

00:55:10.934 --> 00:55:13.641
I mean this is the country
that they're growing up in.

00:55:13.641 --> 00:55:16.558
And I can't let them give up on it.

00:55:18.579 --> 00:55:21.170
- Well on that note
George I want to thank you

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:22.770
for coming back on our program

00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:25.603
and keep the books and articles coming.

00:55:25.603 --> 00:55:26.476
- Thanks for having me.

00:55:26.476 --> 00:55:27.838
- 'Cause that's a step toward our

00:55:27.838 --> 00:55:30.002
understanding what's going on.

00:55:30.002 --> 00:55:31.552
- That's my small contribution.

00:55:31.552 --> 00:55:32.610
- Thank you very much.

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:35.358
And thank you very much for joining us

00:55:35.358 --> 00:55:38.097
for this conversation with history.

00:55:38.097 --> 00:55:41.347
(contemplative music)
