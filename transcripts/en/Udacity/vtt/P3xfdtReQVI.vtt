00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.448
Here's our last practice problem for the lesson. What do you think would be the

00:00:03.448 --> 00:00:07.946
solution for this radical equation? Write your answer as a set, or if there's

00:00:07.946 --> 00:00:12.360
no solution, type NS as usual. And, just like our last problem, we have a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.283
number in front of our radical. So be sure you square this number when you

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:17.130
solve.
