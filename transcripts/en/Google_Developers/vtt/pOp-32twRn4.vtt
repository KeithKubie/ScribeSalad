MELINDA EPLER:
I'm Melinda Epler.

00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:12.036
WAYNE SUTTON: I'm Wayne Sutton.

00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:13.760
We're the founders
of Change Catalyst.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.309
We empower inclusive and
sustainable innovation

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:16.910
globally.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.200
MELINDA EPLER: Welcome
to this series sponsored

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.240
by Women Techmakers,
Google's initiative that

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.640
provides visibility,
community, and resources

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.380
for women in technology.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.050
Together we're helping tech
hubs to develop more inclusive

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.420
cultures, programs, and spaces.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.370
WAYNE SUTTON: To create
an inclusive tech hub,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.940
the first step is to establish
a baseline so you can understand

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.220
the current state of
diversity and inclusion

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.470
of your group or organization.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.470
This requires creating a
method for data collection,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.379
deploying it, and
analyzing the results.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.670
MELINDA EPLER: It's important
to measure both diversity

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.000
and inclusion.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.770
Data around diversity includes
race, gender, ability,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.640
veteran status, sexual
preference, and age.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.740
Data around inclusion includes
retention, turnover, safety,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.430
comfort, belonging,
support, and access.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.310
WAYNE SUTTON: Once
you have this data,

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.160
you can begin to establish
some goals for creating change.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.250
Continuously measuring the
changes in this data over time

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.460
allows you to know whether or
not your inclusion efforts are

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.290
working or not working.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.500
From the top down to the bottom
up, everyone in your community

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.325
must play an active role and be
held accountable for inclusion.

00:01:21.325 --> 00:01:22.700
MELINDA EPLER:
Make sure you have

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.570
a code of conduct or harassment
policy clearly stated

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.150
and easy to find.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.540
You also need to make sure
you enforce this policy, which

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.190
will make people feel safe.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.560
WAYNE SUTTON: Develop an
annual strategic inclusion plan

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.690
across the entire organization.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.405
Set goals and outcomes
you hope to achieve.

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:40.646
And develop processes
together to achieve them.

00:01:40.646 --> 00:01:42.520
MELINDA EPLER: Each team
and individual needs

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.799
to establish their own stretch
goals around inclusion.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.090
WAYNE SUTTON: Consider tying
these goals to performance

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.429
reviews to hold each
person accountable.

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.470
MELINDA EPLER: Create an
inclusive advisory group

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.290
to continuously measure,
advocate for, and maintain

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.192
culture change around inclusion.

00:01:56.192 --> 00:01:57.650
This is a good way
to enroll people

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.890
in your group or organization
that care about this work.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.770
As a tech hub, measure
and publish your goals,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.440
being transparent about what
is working and not working.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.444
And tell your ongoing
story of change.

00:02:08.444 --> 00:02:09.860
WAYNE SUTTON:
Measure what matters

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.990
so you can change what matters.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.720
Join us as we go deeper
into leadership, culture,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.420
external programs, and
physical spaces of tech

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.420
hubs in the next videos.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.878
