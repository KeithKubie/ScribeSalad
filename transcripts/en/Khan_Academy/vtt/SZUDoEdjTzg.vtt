00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.150
SAL: So where we left
off in the last video,

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.160
Vi and myself had
posed a mystery to you.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.920
We had talked about
Benford's law.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.855
VI: And we asked, what
is up with Benford's law?

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:13.549
SAL: This idea that, if you
took just random countries

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.090
and took their population and
took the most significant digit

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.022
in their population and plotted
the numbers of countries

00:00:20.022 --> 00:00:22.230
that their most significant
digit is a 1, versus a 2,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.864
versus a 3, you just
had it was much more

00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:26.030
likely that it would be a 1.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.130
Or that, if you took physical
constants of the universe,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.280
that they're most
likely to have 1

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.690
as their most significant digit.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.251
VI: I wish we had more graphs,
because graphs are fun.

00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:38.750
SAL: Yes.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.180
VI: But if you
look at information

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.540
from the stock market
or anything, what's up?

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.217
SAL: Yes.

00:00:43.217 --> 00:00:44.800
And it seems to all
follow this curve.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.617
And what was
extremely mysterious--

00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:48.700
and this is where we
finished off the last video--

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.230
was if you look at
pure, I would say,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.620
compounding phenomenon, like
for example, the Fibonacci

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.850
sequence, or powers of 2,
that exactly fits the Benford

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.460
distribution.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.790
It exactly fits this.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.440
If you take all the
powers of 2, a little bit

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.410
over 30% of those powers of
2, all of the powers of 2

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.709
have 1 as their most
significant digit.

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:14.250
What is this?

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.880
17?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.030
Roughly 17% of
all of them have 2

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.490
as their most significant digit.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.960
VI: Yeah.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.001
Although in this case,
there's an infinite number

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:21.980
in every set, so
it's harder to graph.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.050
SAL: But if you
wanted to try it out,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.082
you could take the first
million powers of 2

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:27.290
and then find the percentage.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.020
And that will probably give
you a pretty good approximation

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.385
of things.

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:29.970
VI: Yeah.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.300
So to me, that's
like less mysterious.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.010
On the one hand, wow, this
fits exactly with mathematics.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.030
But that also gives you
a really good handle,

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.870
because you realize, alright,
there's something here

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.010
I can actually take a look at.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.160
SAL: You could take
a look at it and it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.530
starts to become something
you can dig deeper in.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.946
And we said, in
the last video, we

00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:48.740
wanted you to pause it and think
about why this is happening

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.860
because, frankly, we had
to do the same thing.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.400
And a big clue
for us was when we

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.030
looked at a logarithmic scale.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.830
And we're looking at
one right over here.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.371
And just to be clear,
what's going on

00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:02.740
in this logarithmic scale is you
see equal spaces on this scale

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.250
are powers of 10.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.270
So on a linear scale,
this would be a 1.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.884
And maybe this would
be a 2 and then a 3.

00:02:08.884 --> 00:02:10.550
Or if we wanted to
say that this is a 2,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.920
you would say this is a 1, this
is a 10, this would be a 20,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.580
then would be a 30,
so on and so forth.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.540
But in a logarithmic
scale, equal distances

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.060
are times 10 or, in this case,
if we're taking powers of 10.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.620
So this is 1:10, then
10:100, then 100:1,000.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.000
And you see how the numbers
in between fall out,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.200
that the space between
1 and 2 is pretty big.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.860
And then 2 and 3 is still pretty
big, but a little bit smaller.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.360
And then 3 and 4 gets smaller
and smaller and smaller,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.260
until you get to 10.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.660
And that's a pretty
big clue about what's

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.460
going on with Benford's law.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.360
VI: Yeah.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.152
It seems to match up somehow.

00:02:42.152 --> 00:02:43.360
So there's a connection here.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.360
SAL: And it actually turns out--
and this actually a very big

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.860
clue-- that this, if
you take this area right

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.260
here as a percentage
of this entire area,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.660
it's exactly this percentage.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.060
It's exactly that
percentage there.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.110
And if you take this area as a
percentage of that entire area,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.227
it's exactly this
percentage, that roughly 17%,

00:03:08.227 --> 00:03:10.060
or whatever that number
is right over there.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.260
So that's a huge clue.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.560
VI: Yeah, or at
least for powers of 2

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.977
or a Fibonacci sequence
thing-- for powers,

00:03:17.977 --> 00:03:19.060
it definitely makes sense.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.860
SAL: Yes, for any powers.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.860
And so the logic
is-- and this is now

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.260
our biggest clue-- is to
actually plot the powers of 2

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.635
on a logarithmic
scale like this.

00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:29.343
VI: All right, let's
see where they fall.

00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:30.760
SAL: All right,
let's try it out.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.460
So 2 to the zeroth power is 1.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.560
2 to the first power is 2.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.060
Then you get to 4.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.460
Then you get to 8.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.410
Then you get to
16, which is going

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.660
to be someplace around here.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.460
Then you want to
go to 32, which is

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.260
going to be someplace
around there.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.460
That's 30, so this is 32.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.960
Then you want to go to 64.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.960
And so this is 40, 50, 60.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.560
64 is going to be
right over there.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.960
And so what you see is, when
you plot the powers of 2

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.660
on this logarithmic scale,
they're equal distance apart.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.277
So you keep stepping along.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:05.860
If you were to plot
on a linear scale,

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.060
they'd get farther
and farther apart.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.586
VI: Yeah.

00:04:07.586 --> 00:04:09.460
SAL: Actually, twice as
far apart every time.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.660
But on this scale right over
here they are equally spaced.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.594
So what's happening
is you have something

00:04:15.594 --> 00:04:17.260
that's just equally
stepping along here.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.360
You can imagine even just
like walking along this.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.860
And if your sidewalk is shaped
like this logarithmic scale,

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.260
the probability on
any given step, as you

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.660
do many, many steps, or as
you count all the steps,

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.618
you're going to have
many, many more steps that

00:04:30.618 --> 00:04:32.560
fall into the block
that's between 1 and 2,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.360
or between 10 and
20, than you will,

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.318
for example, the block
that's between 9 and 10.

00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:39.760
VI: Yeah, if you just take
a random point along here,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.060
you're more likely to fall
in a area starting with 1.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.160
SAL: Right, one of these areas.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
Exactly, starting with 1, so
between 1 and 2, or 10 and 20,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.960
or 100 and-- and
that's exactly--

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.660
VI: So taking equal steps
is going to give you

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.719
that distribution, unless
your steps happen to--

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:56.260
because there's
special cases, right?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.860
So if you're getting--

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.360
SAL: Or people walk
logarithmically.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.560
[LAUGHS]

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.060
VI: Yeah, if you walk from 1 to
10, if your steps are 10 long--

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.810
SAL: Yeah.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.860
In special cases, yes.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.760
VI: So that's what
happens there.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.960
SAL: If your steps are 10 long--

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.160
VI: You happen to
exactly on [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.686
SAL: Right.

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:11.560
But if you're anything--
any slight variation

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.935
away from that exact
thing, and then you

00:05:12.935 --> 00:05:13.060
will get the distribution.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.285
VI: Yeah.

00:05:13.285 --> 00:05:14.860
You're going to end up
stepping all over the place.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.193
SAL: The Benford's distribution.

00:05:16.193 --> 00:05:18.760
VI: Benford's distribution.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.802
SAL: Even though I think
we now understand why,

00:05:20.802 --> 00:05:21.760
it's still fascinating.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.360
VI: Yeah.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.660
Well, this explains it
for these number series.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.894
SAL: Yes.

00:05:26.894 --> 00:05:28.560
VI: So now we have
to somehow figure out

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.260
how to connect that to the
real world information.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
SAL: The general idea,
well, so for populations.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.634
And we read up a
little about it.

00:05:35.634 --> 00:05:37.360
And Benford's
distribution tends to work

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.860
for things that
grow exponentially.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.460
VI: Yes.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.060
SAL: Like powers of 2.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.935
VI: Like powers of 2.

00:05:40.935 --> 00:05:41.860
SAL: Like powers of 2.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.318
And populations
grow exponentially.

00:05:43.318 --> 00:05:43.960
VI: Yeah.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.960
And in finance, a lot of
things also grow exponentially.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.860
SAL: Yes.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.060
Or decline exponentially.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.660
Either way.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.051
SAL: But it tends to
operate exponentially.

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:53.560
You keep growing
by 10% every year.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.752
That's an exponential path.

00:05:55.752 --> 00:05:57.460
What's fascinating is
physical constants.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.860
And we actually aren't 100%
sure why this is happening.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.460
VI: No.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.260
This is still crazy to me.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.060
SAL: We only have theories here.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.019
And the general idea--
because, you know,

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:08.185
physical constants is sort
of dependent on the units

00:06:08.185 --> 00:06:09.160
you're dealing with.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.260
They're depending on a
whole bunch of things.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.860
Actually, I have a few
very loose theories.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.160
But I'll let you all
think about that more.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.760
VI: OK.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.560
SAL: All right?

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.433
And so, hopefully,
you all enjoyed this.
