00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Okay--I'd like to add a new element.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So instead of requiring users to put text in the box and hit enter,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we'd like to give them a button to click on to submit our form.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're still going to use the input element,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but it's going to have a new attribute--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and it'll look something like this.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So--we're still using the input element.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This time we have an attribute called type, which equals submit,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and this instead of drawing the text box that accepts input from users.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We'll draw a little button that should allow us to submit the form.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Okay--I'm going to add this in our HTML now,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and then we'll load it in our browser to see how it looks.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Okay--so we're adding a second input element,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and this one is type equals submit.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
There we go. We'll save this file.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We'll go to our browser, we will reload the page,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and there we have it--we have a new little submit button.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, I'm going to enter some text into here, and click submit.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Okay--so--before I click submit, I'd like you to click submit,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and tell me--is clicking submit any different than pressing enter in the form?
