00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.380
You probably know some of the signs of industrialization
in the nineteenth century:

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.880
Trains connected cities, symbolizing progress.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.290
But they also brought about the destruction
of rural lands, divisions between social classes,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.460
and rapid urbanization.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.300
Clocks, meanwhile, became technologies of
standardization: They created a universal

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.090
time, as opposed to a local “sun time.”

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.320
But clocks were also technologies of control,
ushering in new relationships between owners

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.880
and workers, and governors and the governed.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.200
Not that life was great before clocks... feudalism was also really unpleasant.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.931
And factories appeared, creating new goods,
new classes of owners and laborers, and new

00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:45.540
environmental problems.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.770
And communications technologies, starting
with the telegraph, made the world smaller.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.520
Like the Scientific Revolution, the Industrial
Revolution is a trope—one about changes

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.800
to technical systems that began in England
in the late 1700s.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.890
Some historians call this the First Industrial
Revolution, and the changes that happened

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.390
in the United States a century later, the
Second Industrial Revolution.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.299
No matter what you call it, a revolution started
with coal, iron, and textiles in the 1700s.

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.600
By 1800, industrialization was still pretty
limited, even in England.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.860
But by 1900, industrialization had transformed
the world.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:29.600
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.120
So, what allowed the Industrial Revolution

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.700
to take off in England?

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.460
One reason was social stability.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.180
A period of peace followed the unification
of England and Scotland.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.759
And both enjoyed a strong rule of law and
a free market.

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.590
Another reason was a population boom.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.929
Industrialization required a large pool of
labor to staff the new factories.

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.139
The population grew thanks in part to what
some historians call the British Agricultural

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:59.049
Revolution or the Second Agricultural Revolution—the
first being the invention of farming itself.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:05.069
From the mid-1700s to the mid-1800s, farms
changed rapidly, growing larger as common

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.720
land became enclosed.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.170
And farmers started using an improved crop
rotation plan to get more of out of their

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.510
land—big ups to my dudes, turnips and clover!

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.270
Yields went up, resulting in fewer farmers
being needed—and, eventually, more people

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.950
looking for work in towns.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.950
But technologically speaking, the Industrial
Revolution happened thanks to coal.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.810
Burning coal produced the high temperature
necessary to smelt iron.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.420
Coal burned more efficiently than charcoal.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.379
And unlike charcoal, the coal supply wasn’t
limited by the size of a region’s forests.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.200
So coal became the source of heat for the
steam engine.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.150
The steam engine is a reminder that a revolutionary
technology often isn’t one new invention,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.569
but a process of improving existing ones.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.860
Two earlier scientists came up with ideas
for steam engines powered by … gunpowder.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.870
One was Dutch natural philosopher Christiaan
Huygens, who’s

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.750
famous for many things, including the pendulum
clock.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.319
The other was Dutch–Swiss mathematician
Daniel Bernoulli, famous

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.860
for his work in fluid dynamics.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.220
But neither of these gunpowder engines really
took off.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.540
Though they may have *explosion sound* in that way.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.730
ThoughtBubble, show us how the steam engine
became a reality:

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.060
In 1698, English engineer Thomas Savery
patented the first workable steam pump,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.799
which he called the “Miner’s Friend, or
an Engine th Raise Water by Fire.”

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.750
It was made to pull water up out of coal mines,
so you can see that industrialization was

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.890
linked to the quest for fossil fuels from
the very beginning.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.230
This “miner’s friend” worked by boiling
steam and then cooling it to create a partial

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.950
vacuum, which then drew the water out of the
mine.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.799
It had no moving parts, but it also broke
down a lot and was super dangerous.

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.930
So historians usually give the props for the
first steam engine to English preacher and

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.409
engineer Thomas Newcomen, whose “atmospheric
engine” was economically practical.

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.249
Note, this was in 1712, well before the Industrial
Revolution!

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:05.680
Newcomen’s engine was not very efficient—but
it didn’t have to be.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.069
It ran on coal, but it was used at coal mines,
so they had plenty of coal.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.030
His engine worked by using a boiler to heat
the air inside a cylinder.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.329
A valve then sprayed cold water into the cylinder,
creating steam and a partial vacuum, which

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.070
pulled a piston down through the cylinder.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.660
Then the process repeated,  heat the cylinder, condense steam,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.560
this moved the piston up and down, which
also moved an attached beam, which pumped

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.220
water up from the mine.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.860
Savery’s engines didn’t go away when Newcomen’s
design hit the market, by the way, because

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.550
Newcomen’s engines had to be pretty big.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.560
Smaller operations were happy with Savery’s
version.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.740
This overlap of older, less efficient and
newer, more efficient models would continue…

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.260
and still does today.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.569
But in 1781, Scottish chemist and engineer
James Watt improved the work of Newcomen.

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.639
Watt added a new chamber called a separate
condenser where the steam could be collected

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.750
without affecting the heat of the cylinder.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.620
This made Newcomen’s design more cost-effective
and doubled its efficiency by reducing wasted

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.620
energy.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.030
Later, Watt tweaked his design again so that
it could generate rotary motion, which made

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.639
it way more useful than a mere water pump.

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.500
Watt then teamed up with a Birmingham manufacturer,
Matthew Boulton, to produce his engine on

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.539
a large scale.

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.581
Thanks ThoughtBubble.
The steam engine became the workhorse of the

00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:27.581
Industrial Revolution.

00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:33.600
In a matter of decades, steam-powered machines
such as trains reshaped much of England.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.970
But steam wasn’t the only new technē around.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.949
If the seventeenth century was the century
of science, and the eighteenth was the century

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.340
of philosophy, then the nineteenth century
was the century of engineering.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.790
One critical development in engineering was
precision manufacturing.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:54.130
For the first time, tool systems like lathes
and milling machines worked with high precision.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.780
Precision manufacturing enabled the production
of interchangeable parts at scale.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.379
The concept of interchangeable parts actually
originated in the United States, and was called

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:05.620
the American system of manufacturing.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.110
We did something
This system arose shortly after Watt’s engine,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.520
at sites such as the Springfield Armory in
Massachusetts, because the US government wanted

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.030
to be able to quickly repair muskets on the
field during war.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:23.009
Eventually, the American system allowed unskilled
workers to make large quantities of guns quickly.

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:28.509
Together, precision manufacturing and interchangeable
parts allowed for people to replace only part

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.020
of a machine, not make a whole new one.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.199
This lead to a machine revolution that changed
every stage of manufacturing in the textile,

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.610
iron, printing, papermaking, and other industries.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.360
So the combination of all of these developments—bigger
farms, plentiful coal, miners to dig it up,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.060
steam engines, trains to move materials, and
precision machines—led to many new technologies.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.020
For example, the first iron-hulled gunboat,
the Nemesis, was built in 1839 for the British

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.240
East India Company.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.840
Some iron warships called “dreadnoughts,”
and paddle-powered “steamers” were built

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.300
in the mid-1800s.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.020
But steamships didn’t become common until
the 1870s.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.460
Communication was also transformed for many
people by the development of telegraphy, or

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.449
sending messages over long distances using
electrical signals.

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:14.830
Synthetic chemicals also appeared in the mid-1800s.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:20.419
William Henry Perkin developed the first synthetic
dye, a shade of purple known as mauveine,

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.820
in 1856.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.949
And the mid-1800s also saw the rise of machines
in agriculture, both for plowing fields and

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:28.139
harvesting crops.

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:34.069
Then, of course, in the 1880s, inventors introduced
electrical light to a murky, gas-lighted world—but

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:36.110
we’ll have a separate episode on all that.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:41.830
Cool new gizmos aside, the enormous wealth
concentrated in cities, and their dense populations,

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.979
led to a whole new scale of construction of
old technologies, like bridges.

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:50.699
Around 1800, the Port of London decided it
needed another bridge across the River Thames.

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:55.199
Lots of folks submitted proposals, including
the famous engineer Thomas Telford, who designed

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:59.639
a single cast-iron arch with a span of six
hundred feet.v

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:05.030
Cast-iron bridges were a brand new thing, so there
were no technē, or experience-based standards

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.930
for determining if any given design would
actually work.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:13.110
Likewise, there was no epistēmē, or theoretical
science, relevant to this scale.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.289
Universities didn’t even have engineering
professors yet!

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:21.879
So Parliament created two committees to solve
the bridge problem, one consisting of mathematicians

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:25.490
and natural scientists, and the other of practicing
builders.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:30.240
The upshot: neither group could figure out
how to scientifically determine if a given

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.000
bridge design would work, just by looking
at the plan!

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.690
Instead, some really good silliness ensued.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:40.810
The Astronomer Royal suggested that the bridge
be needed to be painted white, so its strength wouldn’t

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:42.050
be affected by the sun.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:46.610
Meanwhile, the Pavilion Professor of Geometry
was able to calculate the length of the proposed

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:53.270
bridge down to one ten-millionth of an inch,
and its weight to one thousandth of an ounce.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.510
But he couldn’t determine if it would actually
be stable.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:01.080
So what I’m getting at is, the Industrial
Revolution was sometimes not very revolutionary-looking.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.160
Now, what were the social effects of the Industrial
Revolution?

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:09.540
Before the early nineteenth century, most
finished goods were made in small batches

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.340
in the so-called cottage system, where craftspeople,
including women, worked at home.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.920
But, by 1800, the capital generated by cottage industries became the foundation for factories.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.100
And factories offered lots of advantages
over a rural cottage—namely, production

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.730
could be mechanized and centralized, to make
things more quickly for less money.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.290
And the introduction of interchangeable parts
meant that, instead of one skilled craftsman

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.780
making one musket, several people could work
on different parts of it.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.200
So, crafts went from being unique to being
mass-produced.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.390
And if production changed, you know that labor
was bound to change, too.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.880
As industrialization took off, labor went
from being seasonally based to being based

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.560
on clock time.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.180
Factory work started early in the morning
and stopped late at night.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.680
Laborers worked in shifts and were fined if
they didn’t keep pace.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:04.240
And as a result of all these changes in the
labor force, the whole idea of class also changed.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.120
Before the Industrial Revolution, your lot
in life was determined by birth.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:13.060
But industrialization led to a new view of
society where classes were tied not to nobility

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.320
but to money.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.950
Which raised the possibility of class mobility.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.940
In fact, the Industrial Revolution produced a whole new middle class of non-noble property owners.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.560
The middle class became both the chief producer
and consumer of factory products.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.380
And most of the early factory owners were
middle-class entrepreneurs.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.860
The working classes on the other hand often worked in crowded, unsanitary facilities.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.010
Poor draining of sewage gave rise to a host
of new hygienic problems, especially outbreaks

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.800
of typhus and cholera.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.320
In the 1800s, epidemics of cholera killed
at least 140,000 people in Britain, mostly the poor.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.900
And the urban poor weren’t the only people
affected by the industrial revolution.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:56.160
The burning of so much coal, so quickly left
behind a literal mark in the earth’s geohistory.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:00.720
Today, many earth scientists agree that we
are actually living in a new geological epoch

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.019
due to human alterations of the earth.

00:11:03.019 --> 00:11:07.200
Earth scientists have proposed a name for
the new epoch—the Anthropocene,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.840
the “age of man.”

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.110
We’ll come back to this, too.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:15.360
So the Industrial Revolution is indeed a trope—a
useful, if reductive, shorthand for this period

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.360
in history.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.290
But it’s hard to argue with the fact that,
in many ways, for at least some people, it

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.160
was truly revolutionary.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.399
Industrialization increased the standard of
living for many and led to sustained economic

00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:26.399
growth.

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:31.060
But it also led to environmental degradation,
harsh working conditions, and the Anthropocene

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.060
itself.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.420
But before we move on from the early 1800s,
there’s one more scientific revolution we’ll

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.420
want to to explore.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:42.339
Next time—we’ll travel around the world
twice with the first modern biologists: Chuck

00:11:42.339 --> 00:11:44.790
Darwin and Al Wallace.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.480
Only the fittest will survive!

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.279
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:53.980
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.980
Thought Cafe.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.600
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.860
