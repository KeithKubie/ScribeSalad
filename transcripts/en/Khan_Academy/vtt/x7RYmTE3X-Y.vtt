00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.600
Welcome back.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.550
Now let me apologize.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.170
That last problem, I think I
rushed it a little bit because

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.760
I have to get under this
10-minute YouTube limit.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.360
But let me know.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.590
Send me a message on that last
video if you don't think the

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.920
explanation was as satisfying as
you would like it to be or

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.920
if you're still confused.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.400
With that said, let
me move on.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.390
Problem number 9 on page 461.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:45.210
The decimal number above, and
they wrote 5.101001000100001,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.820
and it keeps going.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.780
The decimal number above
consists of only 1's and 0's

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.520
to the right of the
decimal point.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.720
The first 1 is followed
by one 0.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.650
The second 1 is followed
by two 0's.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.120
Right?

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.005
The second 1 is followed by
two 0's, the third 1 is

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:00.960
followed by three 0's,
and so forth.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:12.500
What is the total number of 0's
between the 98th and 101st

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.830
1 in this decimal number?

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.250
Well, the first 1 is followed
by one 0, the second 1 is

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.650
followed by two 0's.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.700
The third 1 is followed
by three 0's.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.030
Right?

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.540
So the 50th 1 is going to
be followed by 50 0's.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.380
Right?

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.750
The nth 1 is followed
by n 0's.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.020
So the 98th is going to
be followed by 98 0's.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.725
Right?

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:43.440
So you're going to have a 1,
then you're going to have 98

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.050
0's, then you're going
to have the 99th 1.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.170
That's going to be followed
by 99 0's.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.690
That's just the pattern
that they set up.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.300
Then you're going to
have the 100th 1.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300
That's going to be followed
by 100 0's.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.930
Then you're going to have
the 101st 1, right?

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.850
And we don't care about the 0's
that are after the 101st

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.250
1, because they said how many
0's are between the 98th 1 and

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.290
the 101st 1.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.260
So I mean, another way to draw
it, as you know, we had a

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.540
bunch of 0's on this, and
then this is the 98th 1.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.080
Then we're going to have
a bunch of 0's.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.880
We're going to have
98 0's here.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.280
Then you're going to have a 1.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.570
Then you're going to have
a bunch of 0's.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.630
This time you're going
to have 99 0's.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.590
This is going to
be the 99th 1.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.890
Then you have the 100th 1, which
is followed by 100 0's.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.030
Then you have the 101st 1.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.820
And we don't care about
this 0's after it.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.720
So this is how many 0's
are in between.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.420
We just have to add up this.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.340
See, 8 plus 9 is 17.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.650
So it's 98 plus 99 is 207.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.190
So it's 307 0's.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.930
Is that one of the choices?

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.255
Sorry.

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.810
I'm doing my math wrong.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.350
See, this is how I know it's
late at night and I

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.400
should be in bed.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:23.320
But 98 plus 99 is 197
plus 100 is 297.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.660
So that's how many 0's are
between the 98th and 101st 1

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.240
in this decimal number.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.900
Problem 10.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.150
Let me switch colors.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.695
This color is making
me sleepy.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:53.290
f of x is equal to 3 minus
2x squared over x for all

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.760
non-zero x, then f of 2.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.970
Well, we just take a 2.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.810
f or 2, we're just taking a
2 and sticking it here.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.840
So everywhere we see an x,
we replace it with a 2.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.590
So it becomes 3 minus 2-- we
put a 2 in there, let me

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:21.899
switch colors for emphasis-- 2
squared over-- that's not the

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:23.980
same purple-- over 2.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.730
Just so you know where
that 2 came from,

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.950
that's f of 2, right?

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.190
Everywhere where there
was an x, I just

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.280
replaced it with a 2.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.890
Now I just evaluate this.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.330
So 3 minus 2 times 2
squared-- so that 2

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.790
squared is 4-- over 2.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:53.220
So 3 minus 8 over 2 equals--
well 3 minus 8 is minus 5-- so

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.660
it's minus 5 over 2.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.315
That is choice d.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.560
OK, it looks like we
have a geometry

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:13.370
problem for number 11.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.620
Let me draw this.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.800
There's two lines like
this and like this.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:39.510
These lines are perpendicular,
x degrees, y degrees.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.470
This line is l.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.040
This line m.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.310
In the figure above, l is
perpendicular to n.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.590
Right? l is perpendicular to n,
this is a 90 degree angle,

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.770
and x is greater than
90 degrees.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.830
So this angle is larger
than 90 degrees.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.670
So they didn't draw
it that way.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.420
So this is actually probably
angling down a bit.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.100
Which of the following
must be true?

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.100
y is less than 90 degrees?

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.740
So let's see.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.080
So, it's interesting, because
who cares what's happening up

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.150
here, right?

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.500
If you have a line-- let me
just draw it like this.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.605
Let me draw it with the
lines actually.

00:06:16.605 --> 00:06:19.460
Let me draw it like if you have
one line like this, and

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.580
then this line like this.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.450
If this right here is x,
x is greater than 90

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.960
degrees, and this is y.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.820
We know that these two angles
are going to be supplementary

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.970
to each other, that they
add up to 180, right?

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.480
X plus y is equal
to 180 degrees.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:49.760
So if x is greater than 90, then
we know that y has to be

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.150
less than 90, right?

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.550
So that's what we
know is true.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.850
We could look at the
other choices.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.030
y is definitely not going
to be greater than 90.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.920
y is definitely not going
to be equal to 90.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.210
If y is equal to 90 and x is
greater than 90, then these

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.210
two angles are going to be
greater than 180 degrees,

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.740
which we know it can't be.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.780
n is perpendicular to m.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.540
We know that's not true because
if this is 90 degrees,

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.670
then this is also 90 degrees.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.720
But this angle is a
corresponding angle, but it's

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.530
not the same.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.700
So they're not parallel lines.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.310
This line is actually, I should
drawn it like this.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.200
Actually I drew a straight line
when I didn't want to.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.525
It's going to be skewed
down like this, right?

00:07:29.525 --> 00:07:32.820
Because x degrees
is more than 90.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.480
Then l is parallel to m, and
we also know that's not the

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.320
case for the same reason.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.280
So it's choice a.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.300
All right.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.860
Let's see if I can fit in this
last problem within the

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.100
10-minute window.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.970
Problem number 12.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:56.670
In the the xy plane, the line
with the equation y is equal

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:04.680
to 5x minus 10 crosses the
x-axis at the point with the

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.610
coordinates a, b.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.110
So this is where it crosses
the x-axis.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.820
So that's where it crosses
the x-axis.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.500
What is the value of a?

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.330
OK, so when something crosses
the x-axis, what's

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.340
the value of b?

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.630
What's the y-value?

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:30.470
Well, the y-value, we know,
is going to be 0, right?

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.100
I mean, I could draw that.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:38.400
If I draw coordinates, and
if this is a line,

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.049
let me draw the line.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:42.880
We'll say the line looks
something like this.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.330
Where something crosses the
x-axis, that's going to be

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.910
right here, when y equals 0.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.600
So all we have to do is
say that y equals 0

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.830
and solve for x.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.600
So y equals 0 is equal
to 5x minus 10.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.750
5x is equal to 10,
x is equal to 2.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.210
So this is the point
right here.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.290
This is the point 2 comma 0.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:15.190
So a is going to be equal to
choice d, which is 2, which is

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.610
the answer.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.910
I think that's all the time
I have for in this video,

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:19.930
because the next one
looks like I'll

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.200
have to draw a table.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.510
So I will see you soon.
