That's the thing that gets me
with this Flint crisis,

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:06.472
is why does it take so long
for people to act on this?

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:07.940
I just don't get it, you guys.

00:00:07.973 --> 00:00:10.943
Story's not sexy enough, Larry!

00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:13.746
Oh, w... Hey!
Grace Parra, everyone!

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.283
-(cheering and applause)
-Hello, hello. Hi. -All right.

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:22.121
Okay, what do you mean the story
is not sexy enough, Grace?

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:23.790
Well, you're talking
about lead pipes,

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.192
infrastructure funding,
civil engineering.

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.127
If you want people
to take action

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.129
in these United States
of America,

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:33.599
you got to sex your story up.

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:35.568
Okay, but...

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:39.605
I mean, Grace,
how-how do you sex up

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:41.874
something like
the Flint water crisis?

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:44.677
-Oh, I don't know.
Well, actually, I do know. -Oh.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.180
Here's a little public service
announcement I put together

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.482
with my friends.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.989
(sultrily): What's happening
in Flint is just foreplay.

00:00:57.022 --> 00:01:00.660
If we're not careful,
it's gonna get real, real bad.

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:01.994
(echoing):
<i> Real bad.</i>

00:01:02.027 --> 00:01:04.464
Across the country,
from Washington D.C.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:07.533
to Sebring, Ohio, up to
10 million homes and businesses

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.136
are taking it from lead pipe.

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:12.672
So if there's one thing
we've learned from Flint,

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.674
-it's that...
-We've got to take

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:17.210
Michigan Governor Rick Snyder
down!

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:20.413
-Take him down!
-Whoa, whoa, Holly.

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:24.750
I mean... it's that someone's
got to lay a ton of new pipe.

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:27.620
But we need somebody man enough
to do it.

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:32.225
We need someone to unscrew
the old and screw in the new.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.759
(echoing):
<i> Screw.</i>

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:35.628
All night long.

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:39.899
'Cause right now,
that Flint water is oh so dirty.

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:42.301
-Too dirty.
-(echoing):<i> Too dirty.</i>

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:44.804
Don't you want
to help us get wet?

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.339
Don't you? Don't you,

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.875
you cost-cutting,
poor-hating bastards?!

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:51.177
-Grace!
-I'm sorry.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.013
(echoing):
<i> Get wet.</i>

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:56.749
THEDE:<i> But water utility budgets
 across the country</i>

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:59.018
<i> have been tied up or cut down,</i>

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:00.753
leaving us helpless.

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:03.623
And, fellas,
I'm just not into that.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.291
(chuckles)

00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:08.828
Listen, this needs to be
a national conversation.

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:11.097
We all need to come together

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.767
at the exact same time.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.370
(echoing):
<i> City water.</i>

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.372
Please don't make us wait.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.307
Because people
could (bleep) die!

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.578
-(indistinct arguing) -No, no!
They won't listen to anger!

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:27.647
-(sighing)
-Okay.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.184
Please, gentlemen, legislate,

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:34.253
regulate,
and fund water infrastructure.

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:35.588
Trust us.

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:38.524
ALL:
You won't regret it.

00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:41.727
The women of<i> The Nightly Show,</i>
 everyone!

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.529
We haven't forgotten you, Flint!

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:46.362
We have not forgotten!
We'll be right back!
