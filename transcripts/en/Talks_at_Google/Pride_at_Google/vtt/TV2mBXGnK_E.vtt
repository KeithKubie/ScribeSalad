00:00:05.831 --> 00:00:08.330
SPEAKER 1: I'd like to introduce
our first speaker, Reverend

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.550
Floyd Thompkins, who is
the Director of the Center

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.490
for Innovation in the Ministry
of San Francisco's Theological

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.660
Seminary.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.680
Floyd has also served
as a dean and chaplain

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.970
at two world-class institutions,
Stanford and Princeton.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.010
He developed unique,
highly-effective programs

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.740
to empower underserved
teenage youth and young adults

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.860
in urban and rural areas, in
East Palo Alto and rural south

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.090
Georgia.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.415
He led Antioch Baptist
Church, the oldest African

00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:34.250
American church in San
Jose, and was the education

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.440
and administration pastor
of Covenant Christian

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.230
Church in Douglas, Georgia.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.620
And then to his
right, your left,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.610
Reverend Annanda Barclay is a
former theological education

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.400
ministry fellow at Austin
Theological Seminary,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.860
where she received her
Master of Divinity degree.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.990
After graduating seminary,
Annanda spent a year

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.270
as a student chaplain at
the University of Illinois

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.330
at Chicago's Medical Center.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.200
Her services to the
church and denomination

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.050
include being co-moderator of
the National Board of Directors

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.980
for More Light Presbyterians,
and an occasional blogger

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.830
for "Believe Out Loud."

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.770
She has since moved
here to the Bay Area

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.634
to serve on staff with
First Presbyterian.

00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:14.300
In addition to her
work with the church,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.160
she serves and works
with various groups

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.090
to strategically advocate the
intersectional justice, love,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.290
and kindness.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.810
Annanda has a deep reverence
for God's grace made manifest

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.060
in her, and how
we love each other

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.180
and honor ourselves
in God's creations.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.660
And then lastly, Dr.
Reverend Janie Spahr.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.990
She is a lesbian, feminist,
Presbyterian minister

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.170
committed to justice issues
for the lesbian, gay, bisexual,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.410
transgender community, pursuing
connections for wholeness

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.540
with each other in these
oppressed communities

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.490
claiming their freedom.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.940
Janie began her
out liberation work

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.510
with her lesbian, gay,
bisexual, and transgender people

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.900
back in the 1980s,
when she was a minister

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.429
of pastoral care in the Castro
area here in San Francisco.

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.720
Since then, Janie has become
one of the most recognized

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.047
scholars in this field.

00:02:07.047 --> 00:02:08.630
And she is now serving
as the Director

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.450
for San Francisco's Theological
School's Reconciliation

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.410
Project.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.540
Without further ado, I
will hand the mic over

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.340
and let you all get started.

00:02:19.882 --> 00:02:21.090
FLOYD THOMPKINS: Hi everyone.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.464
Thank you for
letting me be here.

00:02:22.464 --> 00:02:25.190
And it is refreshing that Google
thinks there are questions that

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.410
it cannot answer.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.075
That is-- that humility
will go a long way.

00:02:32.075 --> 00:02:35.210
I'm Director of the Center
for Innovation and Ministry,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.310
and just want to introduce
one other person,

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.720
just in the audience, that
you can talk to afterwards.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.980
And that is Bear Ride, who
is the sister of Sally Ride,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.490
and also is the person
who is the convener

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.350
of the Reconciliation Project.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.890
And to her right, is
her partner Susan Craig,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.240
which is one of the--

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.870
wonderful person, we go
back 20 years at Princeton.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.210
And she is one of my favorite
people on the planet.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.430
So we're grateful
for them to be here.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.340
I just wanted to
say, I am a person

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.780
who is a person of faith, an
ordained Baptist minister,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.930
so I am not Presbyterian.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.340
And also, come from an
evangelical tradition.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.640
I continue to preach
revivals and call people

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.210
to the stage for salvation,
and call people to the stage

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.720
for having religious
experiences.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.330
And I am also very much
aware and affirming

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.695
of the LGBTQ community.

00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:34.070
And the question
is, how does one

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.590
do it when you take
scripture, as I

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.210
do, very, very, very seriously?

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.500
Well, first thing is,
to remind ourselves

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.110
that it is the word of
God, not the scriptures.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.920
In fact, in the
30,000 scriptures

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.360
that are in the
bible, it does not

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.680
claim itself to be inerrant.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.080
It claims itself to
be always good for--

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.830
profitable for reproof,
profitable for instruction,

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.000
profitable for changing.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.730
It's important, but
it also understands

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.060
that the spirit of the living
God and the experience of Jesus

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.780
is what, in fact, is the
important part of scripture,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.640
and important part
of interpretation.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.220
Because remember,
unless someone was there

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.100
when scripture was written,
all of it is interpretation.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.769
So when someone says
to me, well, this

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.279
is what the bible says, and
I know it, and this is it,

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.670
then there's one or two options.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.190
They're either
actually just unaware

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.972
of their own social
location, or it could be

00:04:27.972 --> 00:04:29.180
that they're manipulating me.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.810
Or it could be, literally,
that somehow they

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.260
want to take their stance
and their understanding

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.330
of the bible, their
understanding of faith,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.860
and lay it on me.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.760
Because I'm an
evangelical, I can say,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.210
you know what, you have
your relationship with God.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.960
And I respect that, and
let us reason together.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.470
But at the same time, let us
also come together, and look

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.810
and see what the scriptures
say in the context

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.000
of the witness of
Christ, and the context

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.470
of the witness of God.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.860
Because one always has
to ask, what is going on,

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.630
and how is it a religiously
OK thing to exclude someone?

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.790
I also come from the--

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.350
Steven Biko of South Africa says
that diversity is not something

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.880
that is accidental to God.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.760
It is the intentionality
of God to make it diverse,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.670
so that in the diversity
we may discover,

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.090
not just our own path,
but the path of God.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.040
So in other words,
if God is not simply

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.030
trying to affirm ourselves,
but God is actually

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.040
trying to expand ourselves.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.890
And finally, I wanted to
say one of the things I say

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.790
around an altar all the time.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.900
It is not interesting that
people believe in God.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.290
Because look, if
the sunrise doesn't

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.000
make you believe in God,
then I don't know what will.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.770
What is interesting
is, Jesus comes to say,

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.130
no, it is not that
I am so great.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.520
But I am come to tell you
that I believe in you--

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.420
that there is in your humanity
something so powerful,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.540
so amazing, that I have
created an image of God.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.700
That when you
accept that and live

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.710
that in a collaborative
experience,

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.860
you come to know me
in a different way.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.960
Because that is the incarnation.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.410
Other than that, all we have is
another religious expression.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.070
The incarnation, which is Jesus,
makes it mean that the human

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.560
experience-- the
diversity itself--

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.810
has to be something
that is not accidental,

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.870
or something that is
managed, or that is something

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.340
that we have to live through--

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.220
but actually is the gift of
God to the people of God.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.110
And it is in that gift
that we celebrate today,

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.610
and we hear these stories.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.150
It's in that gift that
we allow ourselves

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.670
to have all kinds of diversity.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.180
And the same time to say,
truth is in that diversity.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.320
And finally, that truth is
not relative, it is eternal.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.290
But what is relative, is our
understanding, and our growing

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.479
to what God is saying.

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:57.020
For instance, in
the Catholic Church,

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.930
that's what Vatican
II was all about.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.750
And as we move in prayer--
because other than it,

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.610
why pray?

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.330
If the only thing you
want to do is say--

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.730
if prayer is only the
recitation of saying,

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.960
God give me stuff,
then that's not

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.970
what I experience as prayer.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.280
Prayer is also,
God show me stuff,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.310
and God, show me how to expand.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.670
When we say in the psalms,
God, enlarge yourself,

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.530
God can't get any bigger.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.300
So it's not about God being--

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.910
it is meaning a
large vision of God.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.420
And enlarging our vision of
God is how God becomes larger.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.990
So today, I know there are
folks who have differences.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.040
But we come in this place to
say, Lord, enlarge yourself,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.530
which is to enlarge
our vision, so that we

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.650
may see you as you
want us to see you,

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.730
not as is comfortable to see.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.260
With that, I'm through.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.009
Go ahead.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.750
ANNANDA BARCLAY: So when
it comes to scripture,

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.720
I go from the two greatest--
the two commandments Christ

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.710
taught us, to love God
with all your heart, soul,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:12.242
and mind, body, and also to
love your neighbor as yourself.

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:13.950
Those are the two
fundamental scriptures.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:19.710
So when we're talking about
loving somebody and Christ,

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.010
who we all understand to be
fully human and fully divine,

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.370
and yet you are made
in the image of God,

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.490
then if Christ is the Son of
God and you are children of God,

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:34.380
does that not make us all
fully human and fully divine?

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.740
And if we're to go there
and talk about our faith,

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.840
and how we enact
our faith, how we're

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.159
disciples within our faith--

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.020
what do we mean
when we say faith?

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.600
And what do we mean when
we're talking about loving

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.370
our neighbor as ourselves?

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.760
So if we look at
faith, in many ways

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.030
faith is not just
faith in God out there,

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.410
this God that's in the
heavens and the universes

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.150
upon universes.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.970
Faith is also in
the divinity that

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.650
is in each and every one of us.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:13.200
Faith is in the living God that
exists within your neighbor

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.850
and yourself.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.600
And so when we talk
about specific subject

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.860
of LGBTQ inclusion in the
church, what we're talking

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.780
about is, are you
willing to acknowledge

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.130
the divinity, the image
of God in your neighbor?

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.987
And if you take
away that divinity--

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.070
you're not taking it away.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.778
You don't have the
power to take it away.

00:09:33.778 --> 00:09:37.110
But if you try to
mute it, or deny it,

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.140
are you not also denying
the divinity in yourself?

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.850
You are funneling, excluding
God, instead of expanding.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.350
Another theological
approach to that

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.695
would be Octavia
Butler, a famous African

00:09:49.695 --> 00:09:51.120
American female--

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.240
I believe she was queer--

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.050
sci-fi novelist.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.900
And her theology
is, God is change,

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.190
because change is inevitable.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:03.350
That is one thing I would
assume Google knows very well.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.580
AI is a big deal.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.000
Change constantly, there is no
sameness-- so in the same way,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.350
our expansion and understanding
of God must change as we grow

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.030
and spiritually mature.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:20.430
A sign of spiritual stagnancy
is sticking our heels in.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.510
And if we look at Christ's
ministry in all four gospels,

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:29.340
Christ is constantly being
changed by those he encounters.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.920
He does not stay the
same in his ministry.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.130
His divinity is the
same, so is yours.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.250
His humanity is the
same, so is yours.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.830
But he's willing to be
changed and transformed,

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.200
and in turn his ministry grows.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.700
And we know him
2000-years-plus, to this day.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.300
So that's more of
the approach that I

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.270
take with this as an
overall expansion,

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.630
and we'll funnel it
down with questions.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:02.460
But I would encourage you all
to look at your own divinity,

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.810
and to see the divinity of
others, because it's important.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.790
And if you miss it, you miss God
in the everyday interactions.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.830
And it becomes easy
to other somebody.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.840
It becomes easy to
discard somebody.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.746
It becomes easy to deny
another their humanity, which

00:11:19.746 --> 00:11:22.245
is their inherent right for the
simple fact that they exist.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.290
JANE SPAHR: Whoa.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:28.790
Hi.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.920
I want to look at this
from another angle

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.920
too, from personal angle.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.650
Because I'm 75 years
old, I'd live a long time

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.730
to also see tremendous change.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.960
And with that, the change of
course happened inside of me

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.970
also.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:58.630
In which, learning
that I was lesbian,

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.500
I always said that the
reason why I am lesbian

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.020
is because of God.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.210
And people don't
understand that many times.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.580
And this is what I went from.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.660
I went from, oh, my god,
because I was culturated,

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.990
I was in a church.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.830
I was told all these
horrible things

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.740
about what people
call gay people.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.900
And so that's inside of me--

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.010
that was inside of me.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:29.560
So I went from oh, my
god, to thank you, God.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.000
And I did that because
of some amazing people,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.710
like my former
husband Jimmy, who

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.550
loved me into loving myself.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.690
It was two wonderful
children who

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:45.370
are now 50 and 48, who
loved their mother and said,

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.560
Mommy, don't worry
that you are lesbian,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.530
it's God made you that way.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.790
This is who you are.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.600
So I've had tremendous
support in learning

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.000
what it is to be in love
with what God made me.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.040
For instance, when I realize
and my deepest feelings were

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.175
for my friends and yet we had--

00:13:09.175 --> 00:13:11.440
I have a twin sister, so
we had lots of boyfriends,

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.970
we had lots of people
around us and so on.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.330
But the most
important thing was I

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.410
knew, even in
marrying Jimmy Spahr,

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:24.490
that the deepest place
inside of me was not met.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.750
And I call it that
God place deep inside.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.020
And then when I realized--
when I went from oh, my god,

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.350
to thank you, God, it was
like, wow, this is fabulous.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:37.490
I can be myself.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.340
I can really be who I am.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.030
And with that then, these are
the other questions that came.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:47.260
Well, if people
are off about this,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.850
and they only see us as
mythology or stereotypes,

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.570
then who else is
being stereotyped?

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.430
Who else is being told--

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:01.360
you know, how am I being duped?

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.720
Or how am I complicit
with a culture that

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.720
stereotypes and
labels and says, this

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.000
is what it is to
be this or that?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.230
And with that, not only
did God expand within me,

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.790
but I expanded.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.880
And it was this
tremendous meeting

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.310
of who God is within us, and
around us, and beside us.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.360
So then when I
came out, thinking

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.360
the church would surely
love us, because then we

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.470
can be who we are,
the church says, no.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.060
I'm like, what?

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.520
We're finally who we
are, we can finally--

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.530
we can give our gifts fully,
we don't have to be afraid.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.230
We don't have to hide.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.060
This is an amazing
thing that happens,

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.570
and then they don't want us.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.970
So I think the church
had to learn from us,

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.190
it's to meet us--

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.100
it's to meet who we are
as LGBTQ Christians.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.620
It's to see who we are.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.120
It's to hear our life,
it's to hear our faith.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.650
This is how we change.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.177
I mean, I've been
in so many debates

00:15:01.177 --> 00:15:02.760
around scripture,
and so on like that.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.140
But when you meet
us, and you see us,

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:09.370
and you meet someone like
Annanda, you feel this--

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.550
you begin to hear that we
too are people of faith.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.850
We too are people that have
the same struggles, that

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.750
have the same things that we're
looking for, the same dreams.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:25.840
So it's in that way I find
that scriptural debate has

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.810
been something that
I find is heady,

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:34.420
and it moves away from the
personhood of who Christ

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.830
is within us.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.910
And with that, that then breaks
us away from one another.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.970
So throughout the
country as I traveled,

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.070
it was things like this
that people would say.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.690
They would say, well, God,
you really can preach,

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.980
as though we wouldn't
preach from the text.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.450
And meeting people
for the first time--

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.780
people hearing gay
is good, and you

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.000
are who you are because of God.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.020
Can you imagine?

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.510
We went into one
church in Alabama.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.110
And you knew every LGBTQ
person in the place,

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.360
because they laid their
heads down and wept,

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.480
because no one had
ever said to them,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.010
this is such a good thing,
this is such a God thing,

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.460
of who you are.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.420
It is in that kind of
travel as we moved around,

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.610
as we moved in churches
where people were

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.060
afraid to say who they were.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.990
And so they'd say
things like this--

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:30.970
well, thanks, Janie,
for coming, but there's

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.650
no other gay people here.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:37.390
And there was always someone who
stood in the church and said,

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.840
but I'm here, I'm here.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.950
And they go, Sally?

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:46.050
Our Sally, our one who's our
deacon, our most faithful

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:46.950
person?

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:51.300
It happened in every faith
community that we went to.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.690
It happened in Iowa
with grandmothers

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.300
who said, we've been
waiting for you to come,

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.180
because I have a wonderful
lesbian granddaughter,

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.290
and I've wanted to say it
out loud to my whole church.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.500
It's meeting people, it's
hearing their stories,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.280
it's feeling who they are.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.060
It isn't-- I would say, who
do people think Jesus was?

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.160
He was a radical.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.819
He was a radical rebel.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.470
He took on people who said
that women were not equal.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.270
He changed the theme of that.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.960
He talked about Samaritans
that are different.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.520
And he said, there they
are in the realm of God.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.510
They're part of God.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.810
Everything that he did
challenged the status quo

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.340
of the time.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.510
That's what he did.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.720
He was a radical rabbi.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.930
And so I always thought,
well, isn't that

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.850
what we're supposed to be doing?

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.250
Aren't we supposed
to be challenging

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:52.530
these systems of oppression
that keep us from one another?

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.440
So that's, I think, our job--

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.930
is to live into
that, and challenge

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.383
everything in which they say,
these people are that way--

00:18:01.383 --> 00:18:02.210
no.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.834
And I'll tell you
one more story.

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:06.750
A person called me on
the phone and they said,

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.650
are you Janie Spahr?

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:08.316
And I said, yes.

00:18:08.316 --> 00:18:11.400
He said, do you know that
there is a complaint being made

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.740
against you in Philadelphia?

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.812
I said no, no I didn't.

00:18:14.812 --> 00:18:17.020
He said, you mean nobody
called you to tell you this?

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.420
I said no, nobody called me.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:24.010
He said, well, then, I
want to know who you are.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.810
I want to hear your faith.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.650
I want to hear how you
love, who you love.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.680
I want to know who you are.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.440
And we had this
amazing conversation.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.150
And he went back to that
governing body and he said,

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.180
how many of you
know Janie Spahr?

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.880
How many of you called her
and asked her about her faith?

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.960
How many of you know who she is?

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.810
Well, I do.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:49.080
I called her, and I know
her, and I talked to her.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.070
And I'm voting for her, and
god, I'd wish you'd do the same.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.390
It's that kind of change
that has to happen.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:01.140
And then when you watch people
that are so hurt by the church,

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.440
or by community--

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.100
the church has been the greatest
perpetrator of injustice

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.680
against LGBTQ people.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.580
So those of us that are
still in the church, you see,

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.960
are trying to spread this good
news of God's love for all.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.560
This is what we're trying to
do, because the church has been

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.190
so unjust in labeling
and framing us

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.680
as less than, as second class.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.970
So we're here.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.150
We're here, we're queer, and we
love that God made us this way.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:36.550
And this is why we've
come here, to say, yay.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.940
You know, this is
the realm of God

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.250
that is so diverse
and so wonderful,

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:46.950
so let's not bring it back
into this tight script.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:52.420
God is so magnificent,
and that's why we're here.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.872
Thanks for having us.

00:19:53.872 --> 00:19:55.830
FLOYD THOMPKINS: Wanted
to own one other thing,

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.650
because as we're
sitting here, also,

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:02.320
the other thing that happens
in scripture, I think--

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.480
you know, there's also a
social location, right?

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.235
I'm a black male and
you're like, well,

00:20:06.235 --> 00:20:08.610
you're black, [INAUDIBLE]
straight, why is this an issue?

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.100
Because remember,
African Americans,

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.340
when you say, we're scripture
and everything else,

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.250
there's that scripture called
slaves, obey your master.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:20.350
Um, which kind of is
the deal for us, right?

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.460
[LAUGHS] if everything
in this bible is true,

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:28.530
and that scripture is
true, then not only

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.970
is it a text of
terror, but the church

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.640
becomes a terroristic
organization to us, right?

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.640
And that's not who we've
experienced it, though.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.660
Because actually, the church
became the place of liberation

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.600
in slavery.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.330
Because it begins-- it's a
place of affirming humanity.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:47.150
And so then, by definition,
we have to work in scripture.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.900
Then, you look at the Greek,
then you look at the Hebrew.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.290
Then, you look and say,
what is the heart of God?

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.060
So I just wanted
to say that this

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.160
is-- because one of
the pre-questions

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.800
is like, well, you're changing
because times are changing.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.314
No, we're changing-- at
least I'm not, quite frankly.

00:21:02.314 --> 00:21:04.230
By being a person that
believe in Jesus Christ

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.180
and open the bible and
seeing that scripture,

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.710
I obviously--
that's the beginning

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:08.668
of the point of change.

00:21:08.668 --> 00:21:11.280
Because that scripture
calls me in to look to say,

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.000
is that true, and is that
representative of God?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.290
And if that's what God
is saying about us, then

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.670
therefore this can't be true.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.090
But then, you look at the
context of that scripture.

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:22.860
You look at the words
of that scripture,

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.526
and then you see
something new, and then

00:21:24.526 --> 00:21:26.320
you start seeing
scripture that way.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.340
So I just wanted to
also own that there

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:32.160
is some connectedness also to
the understanding of scripture,

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.160
and I think sometimes that's
what social location is.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.600
I think women have to do
it very naturally also,

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.620
if, in point of fact, you accept
some of the scriptures that

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:44.430
says, only men can do this and
that must be what it means.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.500
Then, I think as
a woman Christian,

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.300
there's going to be
some issues, saying,

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.980
was this the God
I need to serve?

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.360
That's not the Jesus
I fell in love with.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:57.600
So there is a different stake
that I come to scripture with.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.620
Because to love Jesus
and to be a black man,

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.740
I am interacting with scripture
from that social location.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.150
So that may be a different
location from a white man.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.990
That may be a different
location from a person of color.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.050
But that location is
what I want to call into.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.510
And also, that blindness--

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.062
there is a blindness to say,
I don't see why you just

00:22:18.062 --> 00:22:19.020
don't see it like that.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:23.121
Well, of course you won't,
because it works for you.

00:22:23.121 --> 00:22:24.370
But it doesn't work for Jesus.

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:25.900
It didn't work for the--

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.375
you know, that's
why people were--

00:22:27.375 --> 00:22:28.500
I got to watch my language.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.560
That's why people were
not happy with Jesus.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.900
Because let's face it,
he looked and said,

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.620
yo, I hear what you're
saying, it's just not--

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.810
and I got you, Paul.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.990
At least, I got you, Saul, but
you've got to become a Paul.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:47.220
And that means you're actually
going to have to evolve.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.520
Saul to Paul is about evolving.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:56.040
And so that's the Jesus
that calls us into this.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:01.770
It's not easy, it's not
necessarily comfortable,

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.350
but it is absolutely faithful.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.940
It is what scripture does.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.897
And then to ask me
not to do it, is

00:23:07.897 --> 00:23:10.230
to then tell me that I'm not
your brother, your sister--

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.470
I should be a slave
obeying my master.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.630
And that is something--

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.530
you all, I don't know you, but
I ain't going to do that, OK?

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:22.850
And also, I think that's what
gay and lesbian people are

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:23.350
like.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.130
OK, you know what,
that's really nice,

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.660
and I hear what you're saying,
but no, because I will not

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.830
be destroyed in that way.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.830
So anyway, I just
wanted to throw

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.150
that in about interconnectivity
and where we come from.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.630
It's not just the
political times,

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.820
it is the fundamental
understanding.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.440
And like I said
to Nick, we're not

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.930
interested in having a
political conversation--

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:44.907
absolutely boring.

00:23:44.907 --> 00:23:47.490
But we're interested in having
a spiritual conversation, where

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:49.300
we all are.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.420
And therefore, there's
grounds for disagreement.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.130
But yet, brotherhood
and sisterhood,

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.364
that then brings us together
as we're moving forward.

00:23:57.364 --> 00:23:58.780
ANNANDA BARCLAY:
Siblinghood, too.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:23:59.555
FLOYD THOMPKINS: Siblinghood?

00:23:59.555 --> 00:23:59.880
ANNANDA BARCLAY: Siblinghood.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.546
JANE SPAHR: Yes.

00:24:00.546 --> 00:24:01.412
Evolving.

00:24:01.412 --> 00:24:02.290
FLOYD THOMPKINS:
Evolving siblinghood.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:03.706
JANE SPAHR: And
we've all evolved.

00:24:03.706 --> 00:24:08.120
I mean, we have evolved to come
to acceptance of ourselves,

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.400
and to who we are.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.280
Because so much around us
said, no, you can't be.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.090
And we said, yes, we can.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.880
Yes we can, because of God.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:25.850
That makes people cranky, you
know, but it's true, it's true.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:26.560
Isn't it?

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.790
ANNANDA BARCLAY: It is.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:31.552
So I think we take questions
now, or where are we at?

00:24:31.552 --> 00:24:33.010
SPEAKER 1: It seems
like the debate

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.810
in church about
homosexuality comes

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:36.382
down to how I read the bible.

00:24:36.382 --> 00:24:37.840
In your experience,
have Christians

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.560
changed how they read scripture
specifically in response

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.970
to this issue of what you
just-- you mentioned that psalm,

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.330
but I don't know if
anybody wants to elaborate.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.570
JANE SPAHR: Well,
again, I think so much--

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.000
again, we've done so much
on this and the bible.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.600
And when you do this, you
think surely people see this,

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.770
and hear this, it's very clear.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:00.730
It's not.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:04.900
And so what we have found in
traveling the country and so

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:05.720
on--

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.790
what I've found, it's when they
meet us and hear our faith,

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.380
and see who we are.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.490
And to see that we
too are like you.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:18.100
And it's so wonderful
to see people open,

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.530
because otherwise
people are very closed,

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:22.420
although they have
this stereotype of who

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.770
they think we are.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.440
And then to see us, and that
we too are people of faith,

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.028
and we too love God and so.

00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:34.190
That's where I've seen
most change happen,

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:38.140
is finally to meet
us face to face.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:42.830
Sometimes scripturally, but it
usually doesn't work that way.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.370
I haven't seen it.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:45.220
FLOYD THOMPKINS: And
I think you're talking

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.511
with the notion of hermeneutic.

00:25:46.511 --> 00:25:49.210
Which is, again, starting
off saying we all start

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.010
from an interpretive reality.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:54.670
We have a relationship at the
center with the King Papers

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.160
Project at Stanford.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.010
And so you know, every
word King's ever written

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:00.910
is down there.

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:03.100
And what is interesting,
there's a reoccurring theme

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.474
that he has, which
is-- you know,

00:26:04.474 --> 00:26:07.870
this guy went on and got a
PhD at Boston University,

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.160
higher criticism,
all of those things.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.030
Although he didn't-- anyway--

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.850
but he would say, I
learned everything I

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.640
need to learn in Sunday school.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.820
He keeps saying that
over and over again.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.000
Not that all of the other
criticism didn't help him.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.820
But ultimately, it was
the experience with God,

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:32.800
interaction with those
simple stories of who Jesus

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:38.170
was presented to me, that
became the framework of all

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:39.970
of the social justice
and understanding

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:44.110
in the framework of my
theology and academic work.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:45.670
Because what brought
him to Boston

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:49.090
was Boston personalism,
which is the idea

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:53.380
that you move out of a
personal experience with God.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.330
And that always become
the hermeneutics

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:59.830
of that, which allows you to
take the tools that you have,

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:03.430
and it will always be
an expression of that.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:06.610
And then sometimes those
tools will make that change,

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:10.276
but it's that interaction
that he talks about.

00:27:10.276 --> 00:27:13.270
And there's a very
famous thing in some

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:15.940
of the things that was written,
when everyone was talking

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.040
about his speech on war.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.990
And all of his
advisers were looking

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.690
at every political possibility,
and why he shouldn't

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.602
stand up and whatever.

00:27:24.602 --> 00:27:26.310
They looked at him
and he said, oh, yeah,

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.030
I'm going to do the speech.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:27.655
It's like, why?

00:27:27.655 --> 00:27:33.740
Because it's wrong-- Vietnam War
is wrong, and I believe that.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.550
And you can give
me all the reasons,

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.510
but I know it's wrong from what
I knew from what they taught me

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.660
in Sunday school.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:46.330
And so at some point, yeah,
biblical interpretation changes

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.570
as you get more tools.

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:51.880
But it's also got to
be allowed to change.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:58.630
So it's funny that higher
criticism has not hurt faith.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:00.730
It only expands it, in that way.

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:05.539
So yeah, that's some
changes that have happened.

00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:07.330
ANNANDA BARCLAY: I
think scripturally, too,

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:12.730
if we're wanting to look
at the biblical text,

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:16.870
both in the Hebrew
bible and the Greek.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:20.890
We look at Christ's
teachings, he in turn

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:23.480
tells-- first off, we never
see Christ in a synagogue.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.230
We have in one or
two gospels, we

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:31.690
hear Christ as a child talking
to folks within the temple.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.000
And outside he turns
the tables over,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.720
but in general, Christ
is rarely actually

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.820
in designated religious spaces.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.260
So I think as Christians we
create this myth that Christ

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:49.390
was already in the "church" as a
Jewish rabbi, which isn't true.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:53.470
And then we also create
this myth that Christ

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.630
was strict to scripture,
which is actually

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.960
what got him in trouble, was his
reinterpretation of the law--

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.200
which is a radical
diversion from how

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.670
it was previously interpreted.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:10.240
And so the third
approach I'd take to that

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.850
is, when we're talking
about evolving,

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:15.370
because that's been a
theme for our panel,

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:18.580
would not we as Christians
2,000 years later

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:22.360
also evolve in our understanding
and depth of the interpretation

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.980
of scripture?

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.390
And is that not also, not
just mimicking, but learning

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.390
from Christ's own life,
and Christ's own witness

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.100
to ministry?

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:37.540
And I think to not do
that is a spiritual crime.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.700
I think that that
actually is what

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:44.170
robs ourselves of being able to
live a deeper and fuller life.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.380
Similar to Janie, once
I came out for myself--

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.260
it was the first
semester of grad school,

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.740
and I finally saw
other LGBTQ Christians

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:58.450
who didn't have as much
fear, who didn't necessarily

00:29:58.450 --> 00:29:59.540
hate themselves.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.390
And it was a loving
church environment.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:06.189
Because I could not reconcile
to be Christian and to be LGBTQ.

00:30:06.189 --> 00:30:07.480
I didn't think it was possible.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.460
And what I realized was, similar
to Stokely Carmichael's speech

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:17.860
"Black Power," that
the church's rules--

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.940
both the laws written and
culturally, sociologically

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.680
embodied--

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.860
were not for gay people.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.510
They weren't for LGBT people.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:32.150
It was to protect those
who feared LGBTQ people,

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:33.370
for whatever reason.

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.300
Similarly, for the
laws of segregation--

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.550
those aren't for black people.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.930
Black people know
we're fully human,

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:44.370
counted in the Constitution
despite the Three-Fifths rule.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.110
So that wasn't for
black people, that

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:50.760
was for white supremacists,
to put something

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.560
on the books as
a discrimination.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.440
And so when we talk about
discriminating against people

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.350
within the name of
God, we are falsely

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:03.030
claiming the audacity, truly,
to falsely speak for God.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.940
And then to make an
exclusion that dehumanizes

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.822
another person, is a problem.

00:31:08.822 --> 00:31:10.280
And it's one that
should be tackled

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:14.100
with love to a certain degree,
but when you have folks who--

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.290
many of us know folks who
have killed themselves,

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.000
who have hurt themselves,
who have been beat up,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.460
who have been put out on the
street, who cannot get a job,

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.440
who cannot find a
roof over their head.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.760
That's a problem.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.920
That's a human problem,
and that is one directly

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.870
caused by the church in
the false name of Christ.

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.630
And so when we take
a look at scripture,

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.840
again, are you loving
your neighbor as yourself?

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.080
And do you love yourself enough
to have the courage to love

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.714
somebody who is different?

00:31:40.977 --> 00:31:42.810
FLOYD THOMPKINS: That's
a preacher, you all.

00:31:52.425 --> 00:31:54.325
SPEAKER 1: How would
you advise Christians

00:31:54.325 --> 00:31:58.338
to accept the LGBTQ community
that finds themselves violating

00:31:58.338 --> 00:32:01.361
principles of exegesis
while trying to frame

00:32:01.361 --> 00:32:02.744
a justification of that?

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:07.360
JANE SPAHR: I think
you just answered it.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:07.950
ANNANDA BARCLAY: Yeah.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:08.350
Yeah.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.391
FLOYD THOMPKINS: Well,
it's a false premise, that

00:32:10.391 --> 00:32:11.720
somehow that if I exegesis--

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.444
I mean, it's the same thing
that the Southerners said,

00:32:15.444 --> 00:32:16.860
look, that's what
the scripture do

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.330
say, slaves, obey your master.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:20.540
Now, I don't know how I can--

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:24.170
I like you all and
everything, but quite frankly,

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:26.900
if the scripture says that
you just have to be slaves,

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:27.470
I'm sorry.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:29.690
Because that's what
scripture says, right

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:32.482
And that's exactly what
you're saying, the exegesis.

00:32:32.482 --> 00:32:34.940
I mean, and that's probably
offensive to someone that says,

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.840
I'm not like that, but that's
exactly what you're saying.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.420
You're saying you
cannot read the bible.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.940
You're telling someone, I
cannot read the bible and love

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.494
somebody.

00:32:45.494 --> 00:32:47.660
Because I read the bible,
I have to exclude you, not

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.060
accept you, not believe you.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.360
I can read the
bible and say, look,

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.200
I want a set of
humility that says,

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.880
I read the bible this way.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.100
This is what I believe.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.440
But I'm willing to
dialogue with you,

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.730
and come to that point of seeing
how we can love each other.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:07.130
And because I know the
Jesus of the bible,

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.530
I know some way I'm
supposed to love you.

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:13.994
Now, I might be stuck in my
exegetical world like this.

00:33:13.994 --> 00:33:15.410
And I may have to
keep doing that.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:19.680
But I'm not going to say by
being stuck in that, it's over.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.310
One of the more important
thing is, it's not over.

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:26.000
This is what causes a
stuck, angry Christian.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.550
Because what happens is you go--

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.435
because your soul
is being violated.

00:33:30.435 --> 00:33:32.060
There's something
within you that says,

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.070
I know there must
be something more,

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:37.760
but instead I'm afraid
to even look at it.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.870
Look at it.

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:42.320
It doesn't mean that I even
understand it totally right

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.830
now, but I understand that
the Jesus that I know,

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:48.440
and the witness of
this gospel somehow

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.790
doesn't fit what's going on.

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:50.780
Let me keep going on.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:55.150
And by the way, I think if
you do really good exegesis--

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:59.530
you're Google, so you guys
you can Google this stuff--

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.400
you know it's out there.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.790
But keep doing it.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:08.130
Now, at the same time
if you say, look,

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.010
I don't want to do
it, well, that's fine.

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:12.380
But then realize
you're going to see

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.020
my image in your
head going, exactly,

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.139
that slavery analogy,
which is fine.

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:18.880
I mean, we have a lot of--

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.469
I know some folks who basically
say, I can't love you,

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:23.449
because the bible
tells me I can't.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:25.826
That's fine, if that's
what you want to be.

00:34:25.826 --> 00:34:27.409
But if that's not
what you want to be,

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:31.730
keep looking, and find a way
to say, what does God say?

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:34.610
And I don't know how you come
to your own path of doing that,

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:37.822
but that's the problem with--

00:34:37.822 --> 00:34:39.530
not the problem with
the question, that's

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.821
the challenge of that question.

00:34:40.821 --> 00:34:44.420
It's stuck in the fact that
you can't have real exegesis

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.569
and then believe this,
and that's just not true.

00:34:46.569 --> 00:34:48.110
JANE SPAHR: I think
everything you're

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.389
saying here, and justice--

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:53.090
it isn't just what's
going on there,

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.580
when you can only
look at it that way.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:58.610
It isn't just, and Jesus
was all about justice,

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:00.380
and turning things over.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.900
And I want to give
a thing too, where

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:07.730
I have, again, this changing
people's minds and hearts.

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:10.460
When I went to
Oklahoma, I had heard

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.890
that there was a
couple that absolutely

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:16.580
believed that LGBTQ
people were going to hell

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:20.101
and had a strict thing of how
they looked at scripture and so

00:35:20.101 --> 00:35:20.600
on.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.632
So the person raised his
hand, and I was ready--

00:35:24.632 --> 00:35:26.840
because you're ready, you're
talking about your life.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.530
And I said, yes?

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:34.610
And he said, well, you know
how I feel about homosexuality

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:35.550
and so on like that.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.010
And I said, yes.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:40.700
And he said, well, let me
tell you what happened to me.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:46.894
He said, our son came home from
Oberlin College two weeks ago,

00:35:46.894 --> 00:35:48.560
and said, Mom and
Dad, there's something

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:53.300
I want you to know about me,
and that is that I'm a gay man.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.280
I'm a gay, Christian man.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.570
So he said, so what do you
think we did, Janie Spahr?

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:01.670
And I said, what
did you do, Gary?

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:07.850
And he said, we love our son.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:10.730
We love our son,
and God would never

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:15.860
ask us to choose to
go against our son.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.830
So this was the
turnaround there.

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:22.010
And then, he said this.

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:23.742
So what you're doing
around the country--

00:36:23.742 --> 00:36:25.200
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.350
He said, I'm going
to give you $5,000

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:29.780
every year until you
can find the church

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.800
that you want to find.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.590
And that's when they got upset.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:38.490
They saw the turn, but
then it's about economics,

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.500
and that's a whole other thing--

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.660
about, oh my god, not
only that, but he's

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.480
going to give money
toward this thing.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:50.610
And that's another thing, but
that's about justice, you see?

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:54.330
And he learned it
about his own kid.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:57.030
And my friend Sandy said
the same thing-- don't ever

00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:00.900
ask me to choose between
the bible and my child,

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:04.140
because I will always
choose for my child.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.930
Because this is God
of love and justice

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:11.430
would never ask me
not to love my child.

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:12.990
And yet we've seen it.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:16.770
Only what happens to many of
those children that are not

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:19.640
accepted by their family
and so on, many of them,

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.620
as you have said, we have
buried, we have been with,

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:27.340
and we have tried to love
them into loving themselves.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.310
But when you have
buried young people

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.017
because they have
killed themselves,

00:37:31.017 --> 00:37:32.850
when you have [? been ?]
them in such a way,

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:34.500
this is what we say--

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:38.420
it is not enough
that you love me.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.160
It is not enough
that you love me.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.530
Then you must vote for me.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.690
Then you must vote
for my rights.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.970
Then I know you love me.

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:49.565
It's not a love, because
love without justice

00:37:49.565 --> 00:37:51.360
is no love at all.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.280
And this is what we're
talking about here.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.360
We're talking about when
people are seen as less

00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:01.970
than, from a God who loves
and accepts us for who we are.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:07.070
And then, to treat people as
though they are nothing, as

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.840
though they are second class.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.240
I have done this for
50 years, and watched

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.720
this and it's no more--

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.470
no more.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:16.850
We can't keep doing it.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.050
Love and justice--

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:19.660
Jesus talked about
love and justice,

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.350
said they have to be together.

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:23.270
That's what we're
talking about here,

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.460
and how we read the bible,
and how we look at it.

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:27.530
And those of us here--

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:29.900
a wild feminist, she's got
it right here on the thing.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.530
Feminist, you know what it is
to try and read the scriptures

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:38.210
through the context of feminist
women, as women of color,

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:40.730
as reading through
the context and stuff.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:43.510
And there it all comes,
and you don't think.

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:45.289
Then I look at some
of these scriptures,

00:38:45.289 --> 00:38:47.330
and you don't think that
in the boat when they're

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:49.340
talking about 12 boys
being in the boat,

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.800
you don't think that there
are children in that boat,

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.930
and women in that boat--

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:55.410
and they're all people of color.

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.630
All people of color,
that's who they are.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.240
That's what we
have to talk about.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.370
We have to talk about
these Scriptures.

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:02.210
Where were they?

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:04.790
What was the context,
and what is it now?

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:05.660
What is it now?

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:09.980
And how can we read into
that where we are now?

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.560
And what does that say, in
how we live and how we behave?

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.330
All around the country,
everywhere I went,

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:17.500
they always wanted to
know how I was a lesbian.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.730
I never asked, how are
you a heterosexual?

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:21.036
I would never ask that.

00:39:21.036 --> 00:39:22.160
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.220
But not one person
asked me, how do

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.710
you spend your money,
what's your economics,

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:28.980
how do you feel about war?

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.440
How's Christ in your life?

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.710
Not ever once--
it was always, how

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:35.770
does it feel to be a lesbian?

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:38.220
Well, it's all of it together.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.740
I'm a whole person.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.170
It's one of the many,
many parts of me.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:43.560
And I'm a Christian.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.770
And I follow the
one who challenged

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:52.010
every system that says no,
that says no to the truth.

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:55.550
That's what I've
seen, and that's

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:59.960
why I still do this, because
I don't want to bury one more

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:05.540
child because somebody says
they were bad boys or bad girls.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.060
I will not do it.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:12.360
So that's why I'm
still doing this work.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.624
So didn't mean to--

00:40:14.624 --> 00:40:16.790
SPEAKER 1: It actually leads
into the next question.

00:40:18.979 --> 00:40:20.520
You answered some
of this, but if you

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.015
want to elaborate on it more.

00:40:22.015 --> 00:40:23.390
Someone asked,
how would you like

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:25.580
to see other Christians
respond to and support

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:29.120
LGBTQ Christians, including
LGBTQ Christians coming

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.860
from a variety of
theological perspectives?

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.320
FLOYD THOMPKINS:
I want to say one

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.900
thing about the exegetical
thing as I answer that.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:43.640
It is commendable that if
you're stuck there about LGBTQ,

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.680
you also end up getting
stuck about women.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:51.560
Because I am a son of a
woman minister, who battled

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.110
hard to accept her call.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:56.990
And the same people who didn't--

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:59.730
because they was stuck
exegetically in the same way.

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:03.050
So you understand, if
you're stuck there,

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:05.660
I just ask you to
continue to fight.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.800
To say, is this God?

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.830
And if there is something
in your soul that's saying,

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:12.540
you know, I'm excluding
50% of humanity,

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:13.610
then I'm excluding this.

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.920
I'm only left with
only one people, which

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:21.830
is men are the only people that
God works with and speaks to.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.620
And if that's the case, I don't
know anybody in this room--

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.320
and I don't know you-- who
probably would say, that's OK.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.530
So that's the exegetical
trap you're in.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.690
I just wanted to follow
that out, and say--

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:36.260
and by the way, there are
whole church denominations

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.510
that are fighting
that trap right now,

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:41.450
because they realize that's
what you do when you go there.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.460
In terms of the ally--

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.560
I'll talk about being allies.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:50.030
Part of the ally, is actually to
be the person who speaks truth

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:51.170
honestly.

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:56.610
Who says, honestly,
you know what?

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:57.590
People have to evolve.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:59.374
I use the word evolve.

00:41:59.374 --> 00:42:01.790
Fortunately, I was the first
person to talk, so now we got

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:04.910
evolve in this
thing, or expand God.

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:08.330
But the notion is, is
that it is an evolution,

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:09.290
and that people can.

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:13.790
So first thing I say to allies
is that, OK, it will be OK,

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:15.830
you can grow.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.050
And by growth,
means we don't know

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:20.120
where we're going to end
then, but we can grow.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:25.010
The second thing is always
to stand with and for those

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.510
who are like Jesus--

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:29.330
those who are the most
vulnerable and the most hurt.

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:32.210
Because quite frankly,
that's the gospel.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:36.830
And so the notion of
not being intimidated

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:44.740
by a very sometimes
mean-spirited and small mindset

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:48.940
that says to you in general if
you believe that, a, you either

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:52.420
must be one of them or you're
not really a Christian.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:56.140
The way to answer that is
to laugh and keep moving.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:59.260
And why I say laugh is because
when people feel like that,

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:00.700
you know what?

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.700
Let God handle them.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.480
What you need to keep
handling is what you handle,

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.640
which is keep loving.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.091
You know what I'm saying?

00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:08.590
Absolutely.

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:09.785
Can I take a question?

00:43:15.969 --> 00:43:16.510
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:22.050
So I'm still sort of formulating
my question, so forgive me.

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:25.360
I don't know, it's
not clear or anything.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.920
But thank you for coming here.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.830
And I know it's such
a controversial topic,

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:31.580
and I know that--

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:34.360
sorry, I don't know your name,
you're sitting in the middle.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.820
Actually, all of you were
talking a lot about, like,

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.030
loving our neighbor,
loving everyone else.

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.130
And I totally, like--

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:45.910
this is what we're called
to do as Christians.

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:48.640
But I also believe that
there's a difference

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:52.960
between loving the image
of God and loving sin.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.970
And of course, I'm saying
that because I believe

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:57.130
that homosexuality is a sin.

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:01.990
And I still haven't
found anywhere

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:05.794
in Scripture that
says otherwise.

00:44:05.794 --> 00:44:06.460
So I don't know.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.420
And while I was praying
about this too last week

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.939
Revelation 2 came to mind
about the compromising church

00:44:13.939 --> 00:44:14.980
and you're not just all--

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:19.060
I have so very messy
thoughts so I don't know.

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:25.576
So like, if you have any
comments or thoughts about that

00:44:25.576 --> 00:44:28.300
I would like to hear.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.540
ANNANDA BARCLAY: So the
Christian Orthodox definition

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:34.960
of sin is that
which separates us

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.440
from our truest
self, our humanity.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.350
I cannot help that I was
born queer any more than

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:44.190
the mahogany of my skin.

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:52.360
And so when we talk about sin,
sin is a behavior, not a being.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:56.790
It is a choice that one makes
to depart from your true self.

00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:58.780
And because you are made
in the image of God--

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.010
because we all are.

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:03.820
Because we all have a divinity
within us-- that turning away

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.890
from our true self
is turning away

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:10.150
from our divinity,
our divineness.

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:13.030
And so if we are to limit--

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:14.860
I'll go with your logic.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:21.330
If we are to limit
the sexuality of God

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:26.580
to heterosexual, although
you have two clearly

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:31.840
queer, non-heterosexual
people in front of you,

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.820
then we are still narrowing God.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:36.294
And neither of us can
be anything but queer,

00:45:36.294 --> 00:45:37.960
because that is our
truest human nature.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.990
And it's different from
yours, as it's diverse.

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:45.460
But-- not but.

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:51.630
And, sexuality is not simply
a behavior, which I think

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:53.190
is part of what people think.

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:56.250
Because people sometimes
think, oh, you're LGBT--

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:58.130
oh-- I shouldn't say
T, because T is gender,

00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:59.020
it's not sexuality.

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:04.440
So LGBQ-- and say, well, it's
OK if you don't act on it.

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:09.450
As if my sexuality is
only watered down to sex--

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:12.630
the act of sex, in particular.

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:16.830
Whereas folks who are straight
are never necessarily told,

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:19.140
well, your straightness
is OK, and we don't even--

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.300
it's not even a question
if you act or not act

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.900
on your straightness, because--

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:25.995
do you behave straight?

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:32.530
AUDIENCE: I mean, we all
sin in different ways.

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:37.330
Straight people, if
they commit adultery.

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:40.070
ANNANDA BARCLAY: So I
want to keep you on track.

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:42.000
I'm not talking about adultery.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.077
Is straight a behavior?

00:46:44.077 --> 00:46:44.910
AUDIENCE: It is not.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:47.718
It is an identity, and
so is homosexuality.

00:46:47.718 --> 00:46:50.939
But the practice of
homosexuality is a sin.

00:46:50.939 --> 00:46:52.980
ANNANDA BARCLAY: So the
practice of homosexuality

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:57.420
is a sin more so than the
practice of heterosexuality,

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.469
even though the actions
might be the same?

00:46:59.469 --> 00:47:01.510
Although, the parts might
be a little different--

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:02.777
the connecting parts.

00:47:02.777 --> 00:47:03.360
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.360
ANNANDA BARCLAY: Pardon?

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.270
AUDIENCE: The practice
of heterosexual really

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:10.030
before marriage according
to the bible is a sin.

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:11.712
And so they are equally sin.

00:47:11.712 --> 00:47:13.170
ANNANDA BARCLAY:
All right, so I'll

00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:14.220
go down this rabbit
hole with you,

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:15.520
and then I'll shut it down.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:16.977
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:16.977 --> 00:47:17.810
ANNANDA BARCLAY: OK.

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:19.980
So I'll go down the
rabbit hole of marriage.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:23.490
Biblical marriage
was never necessarily

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:26.400
between one man and one woman.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.640
If we look at David,
he had a whole harem.

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:36.590
Abraham, he had Hagar and Sarah.

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:39.500
And so if we look at
marriage biblically,

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:43.100
and in particular the act
of sex within marriages,

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:47.210
it is not biblically just
between one man and one woman.

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:48.770
Historically
throughout the bible,

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:52.130
that comes far later, if
it comes really at all.

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:53.110
It's always ambiguous.

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:58.570
So when we talk about biblical
interpretation of families,

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:06.630
that interpretation
is super new,

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:11.330
because biblical families
are all kinds of complex.

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:14.850
And so when we say that
scripture's inerrant,

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.670
it goes back to what
Floyd was saying.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:22.790
If you are going to
lay that lens on it,

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:26.907
then Floyd and I should
still be in shackles.

00:48:26.907 --> 00:48:28.490
If we're going to
lay that lens on it,

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:30.560
Janie and I should
not be ordained.

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.540
If we're going to lay that lens
on it, all of us women in here

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:38.050
should have our heads covered
in scarves at all times.

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:43.500
And so when we pick
specific scriptures

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:47.352
because we believe that
they are inherently sinful,

00:48:47.352 --> 00:48:48.810
well, let's talk
about what is sin.

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:51.480
Some of us should not be eating
shellfish, if that's the case.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:59.050
And so when we look at the
law and how we interpret it,

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:01.030
I want us to be
mindful of, again,

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:02.950
those first two commandments
that Christ said

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:04.420
are the most important.

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:07.510
Love God with all your heart,
soul, your mind, your body.

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:10.300
And love your
neighbor as yourself.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:16.210
And so I ask of you to struggle
with seeing somebody who is not

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:22.110
straight just as divine just
as worthy and just as sinless

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:23.010
as you.

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:24.930
AUDIENCE: I am not sinless.

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:27.513
ANNANDA BARCLAY: But that's what
I'm saying, just as sinless--

00:49:27.513 --> 00:49:29.161
so no more, no less.

00:49:29.161 --> 00:49:30.660
JANE SPAHR: Can I
also say too about

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.850
marriage-- because just
exactly what you're saying,

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:35.760
the dynamics of family
and so on in the bible,

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:36.780
they're very different.

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.280
It doesn't give us a thing.

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:44.865
Let me just say those of us who
are honored to do marriages--

00:49:44.865 --> 00:49:45.990
I do marriages.

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:47.800
I meet with people for a year.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.130
This is what I say.

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:55.380
I want you to have a healthy,
loving mutual relationship.

00:49:55.380 --> 00:50:00.430
That is not in the
bible as far as--

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:04.680
it's usually in the bible,
is that women were property.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.950
And we were seen as less
than, and we were only defined

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:10.380
by the men that we loved.

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:12.540
Honest, that's what it is--

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:17.190
talk about sin, talk about
power over relationships.

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:20.460
We're talking about
today of having marriages

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:24.150
that are mutually
loving together,

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:26.610
that honor, that are just.

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:28.080
And this is what I do.

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.640
I don't care if you're gay,
straight, whatever you are.

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:35.730
For a year we meet,
and we do all that work

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:39.450
about what it means
to be in love.

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:43.230
And who supports you, and
what community is around you,

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:45.300
so that you're not in isolation.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:48.570
Is there a faith community
that honors who you are?

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:50.460
So for those of us--

00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:56.230
my being lesbian, I
believe, is not a sin.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:59.060
I believe it's a gift.

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:03.810
And it's all about identity,
it's not about behavior.

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:09.350
Now, how I behave, is am
I loving to my partner, is

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:11.960
it mutual, is it just?

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:16.830
I would ask that of any of
us who dare to be married.

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:20.300
So this sin-- where we get
caught is this behavior.

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.570
And as you're saying,
it's all about sex.

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:26.690
And we're saying, we don't
want you to just look at us.

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:30.500
Like, we want you to look
at us as whole people.

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:34.700
But what happens is, gay
people are seen as behavior.

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:39.590
We are not seen as whole
people who were made also

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:41.240
in the image of God.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:47.330
And so that's where it gets hard
for us to hear that who we are

00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:48.710
is sinful.

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:52.970
Because if we act in
ways that are unjust,

00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:55.340
if we act in ways
that are not mutual,

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:59.120
if we act in ways that we
treat people as less than,

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.517
yes, I'm right with you.

00:52:01.517 --> 00:52:03.350
But that's the behavior
we're talking about.

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:06.460
We're not talking
about our very being--

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.360
our very being.

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:11.480
AUDIENCE: I struggle a lot
with something you said.

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.700
I think you repeated
it a couple times.

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:19.490
When somebody doesn't
tolerate LGBTQ people,

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:23.030
they say, because of God,
or because of bible--

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:26.690
I struggle with that part
of what you said, to say,

00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:28.190
that's fine.

00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:30.770
FLOYD THOMPKINS: I
didn't say that's fine.

00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:32.470
AUDIENCE: Sorry,
let me rephrase it.

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:37.790
So when people
don't tolerate, they

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:40.250
behave in a way
that's discriminatory

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:44.290
and they justify that, I have
a hard time not acting on it

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:47.440
with, even if it
doesn't belong to me.

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.030
And I struggle
sometimes with, like,

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:53.930
letting them be, and realize let
God take care of it, versus me

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:54.890
just yelling at them.

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:59.395
I don't really know
what's the line there.

00:52:59.395 --> 00:53:01.770
FLOYD THOMPKINS: If you got
that impression, I apologize.

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:04.320
But if they act--

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:07.340
kind of what Janie--
if they act unjustly,

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:12.230
if they use their power to hurt
people because they're LGBTQ,

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.450
then you stand up for anybody.

00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:17.030
That's what I say
about being there.

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:24.650
However, to argue with
someone about their beliefs ad

00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:32.120
infinitum is just not
worth the time, one.

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.720
And two, because I actually
believe in a real God.

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.887
And every conservative in
this room will understand.

00:53:37.887 --> 00:53:39.803
And I actually believe
in the power of prayer.

00:53:39.803 --> 00:53:41.510
It doesn't mean I'm
going to let you be.

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:45.230
It just means whatever
you need, I don't have.

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:46.940
So I'm going to pray
for two things--

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:50.180
either someone that
has it, you meet,

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.280
or either God gives
you experiences

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.110
that you will open up.

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:56.630
I'm old enough that a
lot of people in my life

00:53:56.630 --> 00:54:00.650
have come back in
my life who thought

00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:03.000
I was a heretic and
blah, blah, blah,

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.500
who now 15 years later
come back to apologize.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:09.782
And a reason they can apologize
is I stayed in relationship,

00:54:09.782 --> 00:54:11.240
and looked at it
and went, you know

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:12.560
what, I'm going to tell
you what I believe.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.480
You got what you
believe, you're not

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:20.194
hurting anybody in my presence,
and I'm going to pray for you.

00:54:20.194 --> 00:54:21.110
And that's what it is.

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:22.820
Because the yelling
at them is kind

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:27.930
of almost a self-affirming
thing, which is really nice,

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:30.440
but it actually is not moving
the ball down the road,

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.690
and it may be destroying
the relationship.

00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:35.704
Because you actually
might have what people--

00:54:35.704 --> 00:54:37.620
everybody in this room
understands psychology.

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.957
So a lot of times when
people hear stuff,

00:54:39.957 --> 00:54:41.540
they're angry with
you the first time,

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:44.180
just because of where
they are developmentally.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:46.580
But you stay in
relationship with them.

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:49.700
One of the things that
I love about Janie Spahr

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:53.420
is she's going to stay
in relationship with you.

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:56.420
And because she's in
relationship with you,

00:54:56.420 --> 00:55:00.610
you know that you can come
back and ask questions and say

00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:03.560
like the person in the back
row who asked that question.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.810
I appreciate that she stood
up and asked the question.

00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:07.520
She said, it's
formulating in my mind.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.500
And I hear what you're saying.

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.270
I totally disagree with you.

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:12.230
You disagree with me.

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:14.810
But I believe that
the God who is moving

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:17.480
is a God that is going to
move us to the right place.

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.420
So that's what I meant.

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.821
But no, clearly if somebody
is being discriminated

00:55:21.821 --> 00:55:24.070
against somebody being yelled
at, somebody being hurt,

00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:26.020
clearly you stand up.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:27.824
It's kind of what I do.

00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:29.240
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]
was asking,

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.190
how should we act to
the Nashville Statement,

00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:33.230
both within and
out of the church?

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:36.470
So I don't know if someone
can summarize what that is,

00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:37.090
just briefly?

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:43.580
FLOYD THOMPKINS: Can
you put up the Center

00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:44.780
for Innovation and Ministry?

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:47.600
The Spark Committee
just yesterday

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.730
actually put together
a statement in reaction

00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:51.270
to that statement.

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:53.360
And as you put it up,
I'm going to throw it

00:55:53.360 --> 00:56:01.320
to Annanda and Janie to
talk about that clearly.

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.029
SPEAKER 1: Would you
like to read it out?

00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:03.861
FLOYD THOMPKINS: OK.

00:56:03.861 --> 00:56:05.340
Yeah, I can read it out.

00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:15.240
"Jane Adams Spahr
Reconciliation Project

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.690
affirms the beautiful,
sacred diversity

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:20.870
of all God's creation,
proclaiming and celebrating

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:23.810
that we are all children of
God, holy loved and cherished

00:56:23.810 --> 00:56:25.160
by our Creator.

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:28.910
As a council spiritual
leaders, we whose stated goal

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:31.910
is the creation of healthy,
thriving, authentic communities

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:34.400
of faith, we reject
the Nashville Statement

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:37.910
issued by the Council of
Biblical Manhood and Womanhood

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:40.640
on August 30, 2017.

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:44.360
Further, we reject any other
statements or manifestos

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.490
that teach anything other
than the full welcoming

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:48.590
and inclusion of
our queer family

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:52.010
and all our faith communities
and societies, both locally

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:53.290
and internationally.

00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:57.770
The Jane Adams Spahr
Reconciliation Project

00:56:57.770 --> 00:57:00.590
continues its work in
opening the hearts and minds

00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:04.310
of faith communities
towards LGBTQ community,

00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:08.300
welcoming fully those who
have been silenced or excluded

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:09.840
as members and leaders.

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:13.610
We are steadfast in this
ministry and outreach.

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:16.370
We stand without
compromise or apology.

00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:19.880
We do not cower before
erroneous and hurtful statements

00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:24.950
or practices to marginalize
our God-given human family."

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:28.730
And that is our statement
that came from the committee.

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:32.810
And I'm going to let these
two wonderful people continue

00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:33.710
on there.

00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:35.630
Also, check our Facebook page.

00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:38.900
Innovation and Ministry has
a couple other reactions,

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:42.010
and you can react to them also.

00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:43.910
Go ahead.

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:46.550
ANNANDA BARCLAY: I like to say,
contrary to popular belief,

00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:48.680
sense is not common.

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:51.930
Because if sense was common, we
wouldn't need this statement.

00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:55.130
If sense is common,
black people wouldn't

00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:57.860
be on pavements bleeding.

00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:02.270
If sense was common, Janie
would not have to continue this

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:04.580
ministry-- this particular
part of this ministry,

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:06.230
50 years going--

00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:08.080
for LGBTQ inclusion
in the church.

00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:12.530
If sense was common, we
would be able to look

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:18.230
at the differences within each
other and accept them as gifts.

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:21.200
Because the truth
of the matter is,

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:25.100
we are all here for a
reason, and we're not

00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:28.430
coming back in this form,
in the same way again.

00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:32.000
There will never be another
person before you or after you

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.200
the way you are--

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.480
the gifts that you have,
and the experiences

00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:37.910
that you can bring to the
world, and the communities

00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:39.190
that you can build.

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:41.240
But in order to
do that, you have

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.790
to live fully into
yourself, and you

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:47.330
have to accept and acknowledge
the full humanity of those

00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:48.740
around you, in order to build.

00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:51.320
It's easy to destroy.

00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.970
Honestly, it's very easy--

00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:55.070
it's easy to break
something apart.

00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:58.370
It is hard to work with
somebody and accept who they

00:58:58.370 --> 00:59:00.920
are, and build something up.

00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:02.840
It is incredibly hard
for humanity to do.

00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:08.210
I mean, Nashville,
that's a bunch of mess.

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:09.080
We all know this.

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:11.720
And I'll be honest, part of
my frustration in my voice,

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:13.970
is after a while you get tired.

00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:17.420
When people cry out and say
that you are discriminating

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:21.590
against me, after a while
you get tired of crying out.

00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:23.830
How many generations of
queer people have to do this?

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:32.850
And so at some point for those
who do not identify or embody

00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:38.700
LGBTQ, at some point you
have to ask yourself,

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:41.820
how long can you continue to
discriminate against somebody?

00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:44.937
And how long can you be
complacent with that?

00:59:44.937 --> 00:59:46.770
And would you not rather
build something up?

00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:50.370
I'm not saying you have
to like all LGBTQ people,

00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:53.220
but you do have to respect
them beyond tolerance.

00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:55.410
I don't want to be tolerated.

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:57.210
I want to be respected.

00:59:57.210 --> 00:59:59.910
And I want you to be just as
respected, no more no less

00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:04.080
than I. And so for me
with statements like that,

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.430
I mean they're so blatant.

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:09.100
Why are we having a discussion?

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.280
The discussion isn't for me.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.960
As a queer person, the
answer is quite clear.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.350
The discussion is for
folks who are struggling.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:17.180
And I say, wrestle
with your struggle.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.910
But at the same time, I choose
to live and be acknowledged

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:21.560
in my full humanity,
and nobody's

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.640
going to take that away.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.820
I will fight for it--

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:29.070
claw-- try me.

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:31.970
That's all I have to say.

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:34.920
JANE SPAHR: So we
say, God is that which

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.740
happens between you and me.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.020
And so we're
grateful that Google

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:44.320
would have us here, and let
us happen with you together.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.820
And so we brought you a gift.

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:52.470
We brought you a rainbow
flag, and it's a large flag.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.070
It's really around, how do we
break systems of oppression

01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:04.120
that keep people from seeing
one another for who we are?

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:08.130
So we come with all that
the rainbow flag may be,

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:10.920
thanking you so much
for the opportunity

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.530
for Google to have us here.

01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:14.440
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:17.890
And I hope that everyone
would join me in applause.

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:22.440
[APPLAUSE]
