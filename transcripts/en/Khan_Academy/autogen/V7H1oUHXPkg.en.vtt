00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.530
 We have seen the last video system equations. 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.970
 In this video I will show you one of the methods of constraint 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.390
 Where you do not need 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.630
 For a graph of the two lines 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.560
 To see where they intersect. 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.610
 This will give you an exact rhetorical answer. 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.290
 In the next videos you will see 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.290
 More ways to do so. 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.760
 Now look at these equations. 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.910
 The first x plus 2y equals 9, 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.140
 The 3x plus 5y equals 20. 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.810
 If you have the same process as in the previous video, you can 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.350
 Draw each of the two lines a diagram, 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.010
 These are the two lines. 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.630
 They can be drawn either in the form of an oblique cross 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.560
 Or the shape of a gradient point. 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.290
 They are in typical form now. 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.530
 You can draw both lines and find out 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.040
 Where they will meet and this could be the solution. 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.710
 But it's hard to get by just looking 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.280
 To see exactly where they meet. 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.890
 So find a way to do it. 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.150
 The way I will follow is the method of substitution. 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.400
 I will use one of the equations to arrive 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.440
 For one of the variables then make the substitution here 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.880
 So here again. 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.570
 And Awni explained to you what I mean. 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.500
 Let me get to x using the first equation. 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.440
 The first equation says x plus 2y equals 9. 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.410
 I want to get x value 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.520
 Of the equation. 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.500
 My x remains equal to 9 minus 2y 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.780
 This is the first equation. 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.960
 It has somehow been arranged. 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.710
 As the equation shows, 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.350
 So to achieve the equations, x must 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.880
 Check the constraint here. 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.080
 So I can put these here instead of x&gt; 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.430
 You have concluded in the first equation that x 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.320
 Equal to this. 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.690
 Well, if x should equal those 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.820
 Let me put those instead of x 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.990
 So the second equation will become 3 x 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.300
 From x, you write: 9 minus 2y. 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:15.090
 3 hit 9 minus 2y plus 5y equals 20 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.540
 This is called the substitution method. 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.250
 I have been replaced for x only. 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.730
 The benefit is that I have one equation 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.830
 I am anonymous and defy and can now create the value of y. 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.060
 Do it 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.810
 3 hit 9 equals 27. 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.150
 3 hit negative 2y equals negative 6y plus 5y equals 20. 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.180
 Add negative 6y to 5y 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.750
 Equation 27 minus y equals 20 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.870
 Defeating 27 of the parties 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.260
 You have to let me write that of us. 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.110
 Let us discount 27 parties. 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.250
 On the left, 27 and 27 cancel each other 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.420
 And you have a negative y equals 20 minus 27 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.770
 Equals a negative 7. 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.170
 Then you can hit either side 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.450
 In negative 1 you get y equals 7 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:20.320
 Here we found the y value of the intersection point 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.320
 The two lines. y equals 7. 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.550
 Write it here 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.660
 y equals 7 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.290
 Now that you know the value of y, you can find the value x. 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.780
 x equals 9 minus 2y 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.120
 Do not do that. 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.010
 x equals 9 minus 2 multiply y = 2 multiply 7 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:49.210
 Or x equals 9 niggs 14, or x is equal to stby 5 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.640
 If using the replacement method you can 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.600
 Access the x and y points 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.020
 Which achieve the equations 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.990
 The point x is equal to 5, y is equal to 7. 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.520
 They achieve equations. 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.830
 You can check it out. 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.270
 Equation 1: Passive 5 plus 2 hit 7 equals negative 5 plus 14 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.990
 Already equal to 9. 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.910
 Equation 2: 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.170
 3 hit negative 5 equals negative 15, plus 5 hit y: 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.670
 Plus 5 hit 7 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.310
 If a negative 15 plus 35 is already equal to 20. 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.350
 If this achieves the two equations. 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.640
 If you want a graph of the equations 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.090
 They will intersect a negative point 5 comma 7 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.000
 Now use your skills 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.830
 To solve the following word problem. 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.530
 Give you that total 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:55.130
 Two numbers equals 70 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.710
 And the difference between them 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.820
 Equals 11 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.070
 What are the two numbers? 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.980
 Let us resolve this rhetorical question 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.460
 If you know some of the variables. 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:29.210
 Let us assume that X is the largest and that y is 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.420
 Is the smallest number. 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.180
 This is just an arbitrary assumption, 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.640
 One is bigger than the other 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.940
 The difference between them 11 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.020
 Now the first assumption is that the two numbers are equal to 70 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:51.340
 Means that x plus y must equal 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.350
 The second assumption is that the difference between them is 11 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.450
 I mean the larger the minus the smaller 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.290
 Must be 11 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.320
 This means that x minus y must equal 11. 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.960
 That's all you've assumed. 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.510
 You have two equations and are unknown. 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.530
 You have a system of two equations 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.040
 You can solve it using the replacement method. 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.190
 Let us reach x in this equation. 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.160
 When you add y 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.610
 For both ends of the equation, what will be the result? 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.700
 At the left end, x is left alone 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.890
 Because these two will negate each other. 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.000
 In the right hand side you will get an x ​​equal to 11 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.630
 Plus y or y plus 11. 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.240
 If x equals 11 plus y 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.830
 Using the second equation. 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.070
 You can replace x in the first equation. 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.770
 Instead of writing x plus y equals 70, you can 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.850
 Replace x with this 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.210
 Which we found in the first equation in purple 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.360
 Now we adhere to it as a constriction of x in the OT equation 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.600
 So if you put this alternative you get y redundant 11_ 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.990
 In place x _ 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.700
 Plus y equals 70 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.710
 This is x. 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.870
 This limitation is taken from this second equation 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.650
 Or from the second assumption. 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.020
 I put y plus 11 instead of x 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.480
 Because this was the limitation 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.420
 The second equation gave me that. 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.280
 If you get the value of y. 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.230
 You got y plus 11, plus y equals 70. 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.470
 It is the same as 2y plus 11 equals 70. 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:45.430
 Then if you put 11 of the parties you get 2y 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.570
 What will you equal? 

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.220
 59. 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.160
 Then subtract 10 from 70, get 60 

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.530
 Is 59. 

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:56.120
 If 2y equals 59 

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.240
 Which can be written: 59 on 2 

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:10.110
 Equals 29.5 

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:15.380
 y equals 29.5 

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.650
 Now what is the value of x? 

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.090
 Well, you've come to that x equals y plus 11. 

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:26.120
 If x is equal to 29.5 _ this is the value of y that we have just recommended _ 

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.835
 Plus 11. 

00:08:30.835 --> 00:08:32.549
 Add 10 to get 39.5. 

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.809
 Then add 1 you get 40.5. 

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:37.990
 Now you have concluded. 

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.690
 If you want to find the intersection of these two lines 

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:48.140
 Will intersect at the points 40.5 comma 29.5. 

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.435
 You can use this equation to get to x 

00:08:51.435 --> 00:08:52.200
 Then you put this as a substitute. 

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.756

00:08:53.756 --> 00:08:55.250
 Duplicate ????????????????????? 

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.245

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.760
 ???? 

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.770
 The important thing is to use the restrictions 

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.850
 Now verify the credibility of what you have reached, 

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.330
 What is the sum of these two numbers? 

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.600
 40.5 plus 29.5 equals 70 already. 

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.250
 The difference between them is 11 

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.550
 Their charges are kept away from B-11 

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.320
 I hope you have benefited from this lesson.
