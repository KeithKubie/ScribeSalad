interface of the the OS itself awesome

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
interface of the the OS itself awesome
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.340
interface of the the OS itself awesome
and your do you focus primarily on

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350
and your do you focus primarily on
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.900
and your do you focus primarily on
interaction design visual design or

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910
interaction design visual design or
 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.490
interaction design visual design or
would you say you have a specialty in

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500
would you say you have a specialty in
 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.660
would you say you have a specialty in
any of those um the primarily

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670
any of those um the primarily
 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.060
any of those um the primarily
interaction it's some visual direction

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
interaction it's some visual direction
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.679
interaction it's some visual direction
but yeah mostly interactive designer

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
but yeah mostly interactive designer

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979
be sure to check out advanced design for
 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.810
be sure to check out advanced design for
engineering from i/o 2012 yeah okay so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
engineering from i/o 2012 yeah okay so
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.910
engineering from i/o 2012 yeah okay so
with that should we jump into the the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920
with that should we jump into the the
 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.679
with that should we jump into the the
slides about notifications and yeah

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689
slides about notifications and yeah
 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.800
slides about notifications and yeah
definitely so notifications and you dive

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
definitely so notifications and you dive
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.910
definitely so notifications and you dive
into this the first thing I wanna talk

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
into this the first thing I wanna talk
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.319
into this the first thing I wanna talk
about is the psychology concept of flow

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329
about is the psychology concept of flow
 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.389
about is the psychology concept of flow
flows basically it's it's kind of hard

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
flows basically it's it's kind of hard
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.469
flows basically it's it's kind of hard
to describe and you can read the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
to describe and you can read the
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.389
to describe and you can read the
Wikipedia article about it if that helps

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
Wikipedia article about it if that helps
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.429
Wikipedia article about it if that helps
but it's best to just sort of think

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
but it's best to just sort of think
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.850
but it's best to just sort of think
about times you've experienced it so

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860
about times you've experienced it so
 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.499
about times you've experienced it so
it's when sort of everything fades away

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
it's when sort of everything fades away
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.330
it's when sort of everything fades away
and you're just really focused intently

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
and you're just really focused intently
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.090
and you're just really focused intently
on something you're creating so like if

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
on something you're creating so like if
 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.410
on something you're creating so like if
you're a musician you're not thinking

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420
you're a musician you're not thinking
 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.969
you're a musician you're not thinking
about the musical instrument that you're

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979
about the musical instrument that you're
 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.309
about the musical instrument that you're
playing or you know even playing video

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319
playing or you know even playing video
 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.300
playing or you know even playing video
games

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310
games
 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.130
games
yeah you don't think about the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140
yeah you don't think about the
 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.600
yeah you don't think about the
controller that you're holding the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610
controller that you're holding the
 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.940
controller that you're holding the
controller just sort of fades away and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
controller just sort of fades away and
 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.020
controller just sort of fades away and
you also get into the state with

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030
you also get into the state with
 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.270
you also get into the state with
computing a lot where you're I'm sort of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280
computing a lot where you're I'm sort of
 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.470
computing a lot where you're I'm sort of
engaged in what you're doing

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480
engaged in what you're doing
 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.089
engaged in what you're doing
we're with the mobile device you're out

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099
we're with the mobile device you're out
 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.059
we're with the mobile device you're out
in the world engaged and what can

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069
in the world engaged and what can
 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.280
in the world engaged and what can
destroy flow is interruptions and

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290
destroy flow is interruptions and
 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.110
destroy flow is interruptions and
notifications are kind of fundamentally

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
notifications are kind of fundamentally
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.440
notifications are kind of fundamentally
interruptive so flows a really good

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450
interruptive so flows a really good
 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.110
interruptive so flows a really good
state for people to be in and it's a

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120
state for people to be in and it's a
 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.089
state for people to be in and it's a
little bit dangerous to be sort of

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099
little bit dangerous to be sort of
 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.830
little bit dangerous to be sort of
constantly pulling them out of that the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840
constantly pulling them out of that the
 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.599
constantly pulling them out of that the
main problem there is they're just not

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609
main problem there is they're just not
 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.490
main problem there is they're just not
going to be as effective

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500
going to be as effective
 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.949
going to be as effective
so if flow is proposed by psychologists

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959
so if flow is proposed by psychologists
 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.470
so if flow is proposed by psychologists
Chiklis Mejia and it's you know

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480
Chiklis Mejia and it's you know
 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.940
Chiklis Mejia and it's you know
characterized by this sort of complete

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950
characterized by this sort of complete
 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.979
characterized by this sort of complete
and absorption of what you're doing this

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989
and absorption of what you're doing this
 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.140
and absorption of what you're doing this
is kind of like a feeling of I'm in the

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150
is kind of like a feeling of I'm in the
 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.960
is kind of like a feeling of I'm in the
zone like kind of like yeah it's like

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
zone like kind of like yeah it's like
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.379
zone like kind of like yeah it's like
exactly what it is okay so I think

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389
exactly what it is okay so I think
 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:07.879
exactly what it is okay so I think
what's what's important to think about

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889
what's what's important to think about
 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.729
what's what's important to think about
is sort of the users attention stream is

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739
is sort of the users attention stream is
 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.920
is sort of the users attention stream is
this sort of precious resource that

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930
this sort of precious resource that
 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.280
this sort of precious resource that
needs to be protected mhm and yeah

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290
needs to be protected mhm and yeah
 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.569
needs to be protected mhm and yeah
especially like on tablets is sort of

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579
especially like on tablets is sort of
 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.520
especially like on tablets is sort of
larger format devices they're possibly

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530
larger format devices they're possibly
 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.069
larger format devices they're possibly
reading a book you know although

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079
reading a book you know although
 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.259
reading a book you know although
effectively a lot of full screen apps

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269
effectively a lot of full screen apps
 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.159
effectively a lot of full screen apps
are now going sort of you know

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169
are now going sort of you know
 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.240
are now going sort of you know
lights-out mode where people aren't

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250
lights-out mode where people aren't
 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.860
lights-out mode where people aren't
going to be as which later often but

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870
going to be as which later often but
 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.629
going to be as which later often but
something of immersiveness right like

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639
something of immersiveness right like
 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.309
something of immersiveness right like
you're immersed in the content and what

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319
you're immersed in the content and what
 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.860
you're immersed in the content and what
you're doing yeah so I think it's really

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870
you're doing yeah so I think it's really
 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.199
you're doing yeah so I think it's really
important to think about you know

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209
important to think about you know
 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.420
important to think about you know
assuming the user is immersed is it

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430
assuming the user is immersed is it
 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.159
assuming the user is immersed is it
worthwhile to interrupt them with the

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169
worthwhile to interrupt them with the
 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.420
worthwhile to interrupt them with the
notification that your applications

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430
notification that your applications
 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.039
notification that your applications
about to generate sometimes it is so if

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049
about to generate sometimes it is so if
 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.930
about to generate sometimes it is so if
it's use as a sort of you know developer

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940
it's use as a sort of you know developer
 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.069
it's use as a sort of you know developer
analogy basically what you're doing is

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079
analogy basically what you're doing is
 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.589
analogy basically what you're doing is
you're kind of blocking the user thread

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599
you're kind of blocking the user thread
 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.599
you're kind of blocking the user thread
like literally the users brand like you

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609
like literally the users brand like you
 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.159
like literally the users brand like you
are blocking that they're sort of

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169
are blocking that they're sort of
 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.140
are blocking that they're sort of
cognitive flow momentarily to deliver

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150
cognitive flow momentarily to deliver
 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.640
cognitive flow momentarily to deliver
your notifications so do you want to

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650
your notifications so do you want to
 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.819
your notifications so do you want to
block that thread so three rules for

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829
block that thread so three rules for
 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.970
block that thread so three rules for
creating notifications the first one is

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980
creating notifications the first one is
 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.680
creating notifications the first one is
doesn't involve another person I'm so

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690
doesn't involve another person I'm so
 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.149
doesn't involve another person I'm so
like a real-time chat yeah is there

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159
like a real-time chat yeah is there
 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.619
like a real-time chat yeah is there
someone or a hangout or something is

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629
someone or a hangout or something is
 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.390
someone or a hangout or something is
there someone sitting there waiting for

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400
there someone sitting there waiting for
 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.460
there someone sitting there waiting for
you so you need to get the person's

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470
you so you need to get the person's
 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.839
you so you need to get the person's
attention because yeah this other person

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849
attention because yeah this other person
 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.250
attention because yeah this other person
is actually waiting on them it's kind of

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260
is actually waiting on them it's kind of
 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.990
is actually waiting on them it's kind of
like is another thread waiting on you

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000
like is another thread waiting on you
 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.300
like is another thread waiting on you
exactly right another very important

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310
exactly right another very important
 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.940
exactly right another very important
human thread

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950
human thread
 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.940
human thread
it's like waiting for you so that's the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950
it's like waiting for you so that's the
 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.110
it's like waiting for you so that's the
first one is the time-sensitive you know

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120
first one is the time-sensitive you know
 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.220
first one is the time-sensitive you know
block something out of your calendar

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230
block something out of your calendar
 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.960
block something out of your calendar
that events gonna end you need to get to

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970
that events gonna end you need to get to
 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.170
that events gonna end you need to get to
it yeah and that's you know sort of one

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180
it yeah and that's you know sort of one
 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.340
it yeah and that's you know sort of one
of the reasons why you'd want to deliver

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350
of the reasons why you'd want to deliver
 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.920
of the reasons why you'd want to deliver
a notification and then finally is it

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930
a notification and then finally is it
 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.000
a notification and then finally is it
you know something that the user is

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010
you know something that the user is
 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.290
you know something that the user is
specifically requested it's like an

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300
specifically requested it's like an
 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.810
specifically requested it's like an
alarm doesn't involve another person it

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820
alarm doesn't involve another person it
 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.430
alarm doesn't involve another person it
is time-sensitive and it's something the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440
is time-sensitive and it's something the
 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.220
is time-sensitive and it's something the
user said so is this something with user

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230
user said so is this something with user
 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.900
user said so is this something with user
said you know please remind me at this

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910
said you know please remind me at this
 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.780
said you know please remind me at this
moment or if this happens then of course

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790
moment or if this happens then of course
 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.260
moment or if this happens then of course
that's totally okay to barge in a lot of

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270
that's totally okay to barge in a lot of
 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.660
that's totally okay to barge in a lot of
notifications on Android don't follow

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670
notifications on Android don't follow
 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.860
notifications on Android don't follow
these three rules and that's not good um

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870
these three rules and that's not good um
 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.530
these three rules and that's not good um
we we would love to see applications put

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540
we we would love to see applications put
 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.610
we we would love to see applications put
sort of more thought and care and sort

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620
sort of more thought and care and sort
 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.830
sort of more thought and care and sort
of planning into if a notifications

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840
of planning into if a notifications
 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.870
of planning into if a notifications
worthwhile or not and we have some new

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880
worthwhile or not and we have some new
 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.240
worthwhile or not and we have some new
capabilities especially with the low

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250
capabilities especially with the low
 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.000
capabilities especially with the low
priority notifications where you can

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010
priority notifications where you can
 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.140
priority notifications where you can
your application can generate

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150
your application can generate
 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.570
your application can generate
notification and put it in the shade so

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580
notification and put it in the shade so
 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.920
notification and put it in the shade so
when the user goes in there they see it

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930
when the user goes in there they see it
 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.970
when the user goes in there they see it
but it's not something that's going to

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980
but it's not something that's going to
 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.030
but it's not something that's going to
cause the phone to vibrate and buzz or

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040
cause the phone to vibrate and buzz or
 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.010
cause the phone to vibrate and buzz or
to LED to illuminate so it's not gonna

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020
to LED to illuminate so it's not gonna
 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.140
to LED to illuminate so it's not gonna
actively grab the users attention this

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150
actively grab the users attention this
 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.520
actively grab the users attention this
is gonna be there in case they go and

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530
is gonna be there in case they go and
 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.520
is gonna be there in case they go and
check so it's kind of that notifications

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530
check so it's kind of that notifications
 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.960
check so it's kind of that notifications
kind of along for the ride when another

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970
kind of along for the ride when another
 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.700
kind of along for the ride when another
notification does actually ping you then

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710
notification does actually ping you then
 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.530
notification does actually ping you then
they can consume all of them and yeah by

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540
they can consume all of them and yeah by
 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.910
they can consume all of them and yeah by
clustering them together and we've we've

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920
clustering them together and we've we've
 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.990
clustering them together and we've we've
talked about this a little bit on the

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000
talked about this a little bit on the
 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.250
talked about this a little bit on the
showi I think we kind of called them

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260
showi I think we kind of called them
 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.170
showi I think we kind of called them
opportunistic notifications right if you

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180
opportunistic notifications right if you
 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.490
opportunistic notifications right if you
have the opportunity if the users

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500
have the opportunity if the users
 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.950
have the opportunity if the users
already in the process of checking you

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960
already in the process of checking you
 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.780
already in the process of checking you
know what's what's going on then you

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790
know what's what's going on then you
 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.100
know what's what's going on then you
know give them that information an

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110
know give them that information an
 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.630
know give them that information an
example of this would be Google now is

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640
example of this would be Google now is
 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.920
example of this would be Google now is
weather right I think the default

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930
weather right I think the default
 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.230
weather right I think the default
weather is a low priority notification

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240
weather is a low priority notification
 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.000
weather is a low priority notification
so it only shows up if you already

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010
so it only shows up if you already
 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.160
so it only shows up if you already
expanded the notification chain right so

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170
expanded the notification chain right so
 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.200
expanded the notification chain right so
actually all of Google now notifications

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210
actually all of Google now notifications
 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.030
actually all of Google now notifications
are low priority with the exception of

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040
are low priority with the exception of
 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.150
are low priority with the exception of
time to leave so if we are monitoring

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160
time to leave so if we are monitoring
 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.130
time to leave so if we are monitoring
traffic and we realize that you really

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140
traffic and we realize that you really
 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.810
traffic and we realize that you really
need to leave soon because traffic is

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820
need to leave soon because traffic is
 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.740
need to leave soon because traffic is
heavy and the only way you're going to

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750
heavy and the only way you're going to
 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.520
heavy and the only way you're going to
arrive on time

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530
arrive on time
 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.320
arrive on time
is if you take off right now then we go

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330
is if you take off right now then we go
 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.300
is if you take off right now then we go
ahead and interrupt but that's actually

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310
ahead and interrupt but that's actually
 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.120
ahead and interrupt but that's actually
the only case of Google Google now doing

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130
the only case of Google Google now doing
 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.520
the only case of Google Google now doing
an interrupted notification and all of

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530
an interrupted notification and all of
 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.440
an interrupted notification and all of
the others are and we're calling them

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450
the others are and we're calling them
 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.790
the others are and we're calling them

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.140
notion of the you know they're just
there but yeah

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150
there but yeah
 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.270
there but yeah
I think it's I think low prior low

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280
I think it's I think low prior low
 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.550
I think it's I think low prior low
priority is the official name yeah yeah

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560
priority is the official name yeah yeah
 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.200
priority is the official name yeah yeah
so if you're if you're a developer and

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210
so if you're if you're a developer and
 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.000
so if you're if you're a developer and
you're figuring out how to do this it's

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.010
you're figuring out how to do this it's
 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.430
you're figuring out how to do this it's
actually extremely easy luckily if

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440
actually extremely easy luckily if
 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.660
actually extremely easy luckily if
you're using the notification compat

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:43.670
you're using the notification compat
 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.640
you're using the notification compat
class all you need to do is just pass in

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650
class all you need to do is just pass in
 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.280
class all you need to do is just pass in
a priority of I think is partied out low

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.290
a priority of I think is partied out low
 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.920
a priority of I think is partied out low
or there's a constant value for it and

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930
or there's a constant value for it and
 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.180
or there's a constant value for it and
the good thing is that if you're this

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190
the good thing is that if you're this
 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.400
the good thing is that if you're this
actually is only supported on a jelly

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410
actually is only supported on a jelly
 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.140
actually is only supported on a jelly
bean and above but if you're on earlier

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150
bean and above but if you're on earlier
 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.300
bean and above but if you're on earlier
versions of the platform you'll actually

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310
versions of the platform you'll actually
 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.340
versions of the platform you'll actually
see an interrupted notification it's

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350
see an interrupted notification it's
 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.380
see an interrupted notification it's
kind of like you know there's no way to

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.390
kind of like you know there's no way to
 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.080
kind of like you know there's no way to
show notification in the expanded state

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.090
show notification in the expanded state
 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.490
show notification in the expanded state
that that's not also in the collapsed at

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500
that that's not also in the collapsed at
 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.260
that that's not also in the collapsed at
an earlier versions but you will benefit

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270
an earlier versions but you will benefit
 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.270
an earlier versions but you will benefit
from the new kind of better more correct

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280
from the new kind of better more correct
 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.700
from the new kind of better more correct
behavior on newer devices without having

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710
behavior on newer devices without having
 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.020
behavior on newer devices without having
to do any sort of backward compatibility

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030
to do any sort of backward compatibility
 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.940
to do any sort of backward compatibility
code since that's already done for you

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:15.950
code since that's already done for you
 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.440
code since that's already done for you
it's worth saying that there's other

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.450
it's worth saying that there's other
 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.030
it's worth saying that there's other
priorities even lower while low is the

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.040
priorities even lower while low is the
 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.830
priorities even lower while low is the
only one that'll you know not interrupt

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:20.840
only one that'll you know not interrupt
 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.570
only one that'll you know not interrupt
the user I do believe we use the

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580
the user I do believe we use the
 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.980
the user I do believe we use the
priority to order the list of

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990
priority to order the list of
 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.870
priority to order the list of
notifications right so I think they have

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:25.880
notifications right so I think they have
 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.770
notifications right so I think they have
saying which is the extremely high

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:26.780
saying which is the extremely high
 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.750
saying which is the extremely high
priority or you know you can recognize

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:28.760
priority or you know you can recognize
 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.310
priority or you know you can recognize
that your notifications just qualify for

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:30.320
that your notifications just qualify for
 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.930
that your notifications just qualify for
the rules but isn't the most important

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:31.940
the rules but isn't the most important
 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.460
the rules but isn't the most important
thing in the user's world then you can

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.470
thing in the user's world then you can
 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.590
thing in the user's world then you can
set something between low and Max

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:35.600
set something between low and Max
 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.150
set something between low and Max
there's some intermediate levels you can

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:37.160
there's some intermediate levels you can
 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.680
there's some intermediate levels you can
really hinter the user so that they have

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:38.690
really hinter the user so that they have
 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.570
really hinter the user so that they have
they find that that lists more useful

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:40.580
they find that that lists more useful
 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.810
they find that that lists more useful
when it's sorted yeah and don't just set

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:43.820
when it's sorted yeah and don't just set
 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.450
when it's sorted yeah and don't just set
it to max because as you want your a

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.460
it to max because as you want your a
 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.280
it to max because as you want your a
notification to be above all the other

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.290
notification to be above all the other
 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.970
notification to be above all the other
applications

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:48.980
applications
 

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.070
applications
yeah I think the one major takeaway so

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080
yeah I think the one major takeaway so
 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.980
yeah I think the one major takeaway so
far is just be mindful of what the user

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:53.990
far is just be mindful of what the user
 

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.890
far is just be mindful of what the user
wants right it don't like your your

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:56.900
wants right it don't like your your
 

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.900
wants right it don't like your your
application and I think a Adam Powell

00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:58.910
application and I think a Adam Powell
 

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.790

want to barge them and bombard them with

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:11.740

imagine your notification is an airhorn

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:16.210
 

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.760
and after the users you know suddenly

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:18.770
and after the users you know suddenly
 

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.830
and after the users you know suddenly
startled by it then you have to pack

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840
startled by it then you have to pack
 

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.330
startled by it then you have to pack
that up with interesting information

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:22.340
that up with interesting information
 

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.530
that up with interesting information
that they care about and find relevant

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:23.540
that they care about and find relevant
 

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.090
that they care about and find relevant
they say thank you for sounding that

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:25.100
they say thank you for sounding that
 

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.550
they say thank you for sounding that
airhorn right then maybe when you're

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560
airhorn right then maybe when you're
 

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.890
airhorn right then maybe when you're
developing you can set a custom

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:28.900
developing you can set a custom
 

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.930
developing you can set a custom
notification ringtone or just a test

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:31.940
notification ringtone or just a test
 

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.060
notification ringtone or just a test
whether you really think you are

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:33.070
whether you really think you are
 

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.620
whether you really think you are
interrupting at the right time yeah or

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:35.630
interrupting at the right time yeah or
 

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.390
interrupting at the right time yeah or
we just changed the API to the name it

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:37.400
we just changed the API to the name it
 

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.000
we just changed the API to the name it
interrupts the user and then people will

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.010
interrupts the user and then people will
 

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.560
interrupts the user and then people will
yeah it will be more mindful like a

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:41.570
yeah it will be more mindful like a
 

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.780
yeah it will be more mindful like a
notification manager that interrupts

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:43.790
notification manager that interrupts
 

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:44.350
notification manager that interrupts
yeah

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.360
yeah
 

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.079
yeah
piss off the yeah and why it is worth

00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:47.089
piss off the yeah and why it is worth
 

00:08:47.089 --> 00:08:49.840
piss off the yeah and why it is worth
noting that users can silence your

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:49.850
noting that users can silence your
 

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.030
noting that users can silence your
notification or silence your application

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040
notification or silence your application
 

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.730
notification or silence your application
from generating any notifications they

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:54.740
from generating any notifications they
 

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.600
from generating any notifications they
can also uninstall your application if

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:58.610
can also uninstall your application if
 

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.130
can also uninstall your application if
it's becoming overly annoying so beyond

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:03.140
it's becoming overly annoying so beyond
 

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.750
it's becoming overly annoying so beyond
just it being the right thing to do

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760
just it being the right thing to do
 

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.790
just it being the right thing to do
there are good reasons to not annoy the

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800
there are good reasons to not annoy the
 

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.449
there are good reasons to not annoy the
user through notifications and that's

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:10.459
user through notifications and that's
 

00:09:10.459 --> 00:09:13.150
user through notifications and that's
especially true of notifications that

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160
especially true of notifications that
 

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.860
especially true of notifications that
are trying to like solicit positive

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:14.870
are trying to like solicit positive
 

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.680
are trying to like solicit positive
reviews in the store I would love to see

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:17.690
reviews in the store I would love to see
 

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.540
reviews in the store I would love to see
a study if that actually results in more

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:19.550
a study if that actually results in more
 

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.720
a study if that actually results in more
negative reviews per time I I would

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:22.730
negative reviews per time I I would
 

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.850
negative reviews per time I I would
assume that that could be likely yeah

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:24.860
assume that that could be likely yeah
 

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.620
assume that that could be likely yeah
yeah yeah we definitely some best

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:26.630
yeah yeah we definitely some best
 

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.540
yeah yeah we definitely some best
practices on you know when to solicit

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:28.550
practices on you know when to solicit
 

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.100
practices on you know when to solicit
reviews and and what not to do

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:30.110
reviews and and what not to do
 

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.840
reviews and and what not to do
especially I cannot test for five stars

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:31.850
especially I cannot test for five stars
 

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.579
especially I cannot test for five stars
of these things like that but certainly

00:09:33.579 --> 00:09:33.589
of these things like that but certainly
 

00:09:33.589 --> 00:09:36.280
of these things like that but certainly
I mean notifications are they're really

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:36.290
I mean notifications are they're really
 

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.019
I mean notifications are they're really
exciting that's more timely like if you

00:09:38.019 --> 00:09:38.029
exciting that's more timely like if you
 

00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:40.180
exciting that's more timely like if you
want to ask the user for review if if

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:40.190
want to ask the user for review if if
 

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.190
want to ask the user for review if if
there's any you know place to put it

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.200
there's any you know place to put it
 

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.269
there's any you know place to put it
it's not gonna be an identification

00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279
it's not gonna be an identification
 

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:45.009
it's not gonna be an identification
probably gonna be somewhere deep within

00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:45.019
probably gonna be somewhere deep within
 

00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:47.500
probably gonna be somewhere deep within
your app and either help or but so

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:47.510
your app and either help or but so
 

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.120
your app and either help or but so
somewhere that they're kind of already

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.130
somewhere that they're kind of already
 

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.819
somewhere that they're kind of already
exploring you know more about your app

00:09:51.819 --> 00:09:51.829
exploring you know more about your app
 

00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:52.810
exploring you know more about your app
and potentially they want to give you

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:52.820
and potentially they want to give you
 

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.030
and potentially they want to give you
feedback yeah or I mean normally after

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040
feedback yeah or I mean normally after
 

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.880
feedback yeah or I mean normally after
I've had a good outcome I find as well

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:56.890
I've had a good outcome I find as well
 

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.960
I've had a good outcome I find as well
right just do it you know if the first

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:58.970
right just do it you know if the first
 

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.370
right just do it you know if the first
launch whatever yeah

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:00.380
launch whatever yeah
 

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.900
launch whatever yeah
yeah they should have at least had a

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:01.910
yeah they should have at least had a
 

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.180
yeah they should have at least had a
chance to use it I would say probably

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:04.190
chance to use it I would say probably
 

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.160
chance to use it I would say probably
should never ask for a review but if you

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:06.170
should never ask for a review but if you
 

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.840
should never ask for a review but if you
are going to at least do it inside your

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:07.850
are going to at least do it inside your
 

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:09.220
are going to at least do it inside your
application not while they're using

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:09.230
application not while they're using
 

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.350
application not while they're using
another application right I guess

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360
another application right I guess
 

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.579
another application right I guess
another important thing to note is

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:12.589
another important thing to note is
 

00:10:12.589 --> 00:10:15.490
another important thing to note is
correct usage of toasts so a toast

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:15.500
correct usage of toasts so a toast
 

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.620
correct usage of toasts so a toast
should be a direct response to a user

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:17.630
should be a direct response to a user
 

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.329
should be a direct response to a user
action usually there's a nice little

00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:19.339
action usually there's a nice little
 

00:10:19.339 --> 00:10:22.210
action usually there's a nice little
confirmation so like you know message

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:22.220
confirmation so like you know message
 

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.699
confirmation so like you know message
sent or item archived to these types of

00:10:24.699 --> 00:10:24.709
sent or item archived to these types of
 

00:10:24.709 --> 00:10:25.900
sent or item archived to these types of
things where you're hitting a button and

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:25.910
things where you're hitting a button and
 

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:26.800
things where you're hitting a button and
then it's just kind of immediately

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:26.810
then it's just kind of immediately
 

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.790
then it's just kind of immediately
mirroring back like dip got it do not

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800
mirroring back like dip got it do not
 

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.630
mirroring back like dip got it do not
generate a toast when your application

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:31.640
generate a toast when your application
 

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.090
generate a toast when your application
doesn't have focus

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:34.100
doesn't have focus
 

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.680
doesn't have focus
I remember we talked about this when we

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:35.690
I remember we talked about this when we
 

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.720
I remember we talked about this when we
were working in the style guide a while

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:37.730
were working in the style guide a while
 

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.759
were working in the style guide a while
ago and this is one of the big things

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:39.769
ago and this is one of the big things
 

00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:41.710
ago and this is one of the big things
one of the biggest pet peeves right it

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:41.720
one of the biggest pet peeves right it
 

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.290
one of the biggest pet peeves right it
was it is so I have a couple of

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:44.300
was it is so I have a couple of
 

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.880
was it is so I have a couple of
different banking applications installed

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:45.890
different banking applications installed
 

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.889
different banking applications installed
on my phone I'll be using something else

00:10:47.889 --> 00:10:47.899
on my phone I'll be using something else
 

00:10:47.899 --> 00:10:49.600
on my phone I'll be using something else
and just in the middle of nowhere I'll

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:49.610
and just in the middle of nowhere I'll
 

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:50.920
and just in the middle of nowhere I'll
get a toast that says your banking

session has ended and I don't even know
 

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.929
session has ended and I don't even know
which application is responsible is it

00:10:55.929 --> 00:10:55.939
which application is responsible is it
 

00:10:55.939 --> 00:10:57.549
which application is responsible is it
thank your bank yeah I mean because I

00:10:57.549 --> 00:10:57.559

so really not helpful to show toast at

00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:09.079
so really not helpful to show toast at
 

00:11:09.079 --> 00:11:11.799
so really not helpful to show toast at
an hour sort of the reason we have a

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:11.809
an hour sort of the reason we have a
 

00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:13.059
an hour sort of the reason we have a
whole notification shade and

00:11:13.059 --> 00:11:13.069
whole notification shade and
 

00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:15.519
whole notification shade and
notification manager and all this is to

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:15.529
notification manager and all this is to
 

00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:16.809
notification manager and all this is to
have that that nice place for your

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:16.819
have that that nice place for your
 

00:11:16.819 --> 00:11:20.789

message also important not to treat
 

00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:23.409
message also important not to treat
notifications as a kind of almost like

00:11:23.409 --> 00:11:23.419
notifications as a kind of almost like
 

00:11:23.419 --> 00:11:27.009
notifications as a kind of almost like
error log I know there's there's some

00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:27.019
error log I know there's there's some
 

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:29.139
error log I know there's there's some
note applications where you know it'll

00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:29.149
note applications where you know it'll
 

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:30.579
note applications where you know it'll
generate notification that says like

00:11:30.579 --> 00:11:30.589
generate notification that says like
 

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:32.829
generate notification that says like

else right I just left but I'm glad you
 

00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:42.699
else right I just left but I'm glad you
took care of that and then told me about

00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:42.709
took care of that and then told me about
 

00:11:42.709 --> 00:11:45.519
took care of that and then told me about
it so obviously anything is just sort of

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:45.529
it so obviously anything is just sort of
 

00:11:45.529 --> 00:11:48.429
it so obviously anything is just sort of
your app managing itself I would even

00:11:48.429 --> 00:11:48.439
your app managing itself I would even
 

00:11:48.439 --> 00:11:51.009
your app managing itself I would even
say take this as far as we should be

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:51.019
say take this as far as we should be
 

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:52.449
say take this as far as we should be
notifying people about software updates

00:11:52.449 --> 00:11:52.459
notifying people about software updates
 

00:11:52.459 --> 00:11:54.819
notifying people about software updates
something we're working on which is yeah

00:11:54.819 --> 00:11:54.829
something we're working on which is yeah
 

00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:58.289
something we're working on which is yeah
Android itself not following that rule

00:11:58.289 --> 00:11:58.299
Android itself not following that rule
 

00:11:58.299 --> 00:12:00.519
Android itself not following that rule
but yeah it should involve other people

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:00.529
but yeah it should involve other people
 

00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:01.809
but yeah it should involve other people
should be time sensitive where should be

00:12:01.809 --> 00:12:01.819
should be time sensitive where should be
 

00:12:01.819 --> 00:12:03.399
should be time sensitive where should be
something user specifically requested

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:03.409
something user specifically requested
 

00:12:03.409 --> 00:12:06.009
something user specifically requested
awesome yeah very very good general

00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:06.019
awesome yeah very very good general
 

00:12:06.019 --> 00:12:07.509
awesome yeah very very good general
advice and just on the topic of

00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519
advice and just on the topic of
 

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:10.029
advice and just on the topic of
notifications while we're on it we also

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:10.039
notifications while we're on it we also
 

00:12:10.039 --> 00:12:12.460
notifications while we're on it we also
have a design pattern documented on

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:12.470
have a design pattern documented on
 

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.819
have a design pattern documented on
developer.android.com slash design that

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:15.829
developer.android.com slash design that
 

00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:17.679
developer.android.com slash design that
talks about you know lots of different

00:12:17.679 --> 00:12:17.689
talks about you know lots of different
 

00:12:17.689 --> 00:12:19.259
talks about you know lots of different
situations where you should show

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:19.269
situations where you should show
 

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:21.489
situations where you should show
notifications and in addition if you're

00:12:21.489 --> 00:12:21.499
notifications and in addition if you're
 

00:12:21.499 --> 00:12:23.710
notifications and in addition if you're
we touched a little bit on help and

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720
we touched a little bit on help and
 

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.819
we touched a little bit on help and
things like that there's also a pattern

00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:24.829
things like that there's also a pattern
 

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:27.460
things like that there's also a pattern
that talks about help and tutorials not

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:27.470
that talks about help and tutorials not
 

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.899
that talks about help and tutorials not
exactly related to notifications but

00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:28.909
exactly related to notifications but
 

00:12:28.909 --> 00:12:30.099
exactly related to notifications but
still definitely stuff that you should

00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:30.109
still definitely stuff that you should
 

00:12:30.109 --> 00:12:31.229
still definitely stuff that you should
read yeah

00:12:31.229 --> 00:12:31.239
read yeah
 

00:12:31.239 --> 00:12:33.519
read yeah
actually move on to yeah I can but

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:33.529
actually move on to yeah I can but
 

00:12:33.529 --> 00:12:35.169
actually move on to yeah I can but
design process let's do it

00:12:35.169 --> 00:12:35.179
design process let's do it
 

00:12:35.179 --> 00:12:38.019
design process let's do it
alright design workflow so we thought

00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:38.029
alright design workflow so we thought
 

00:12:38.029 --> 00:12:40.679
alright design workflow so we thought
this would be a fun topic to go into you

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:40.689
this would be a fun topic to go into you
 

00:12:40.689 --> 00:12:42.789
this would be a fun topic to go into you
just sort of talked about some of the

00:12:42.789 --> 00:12:42.799
just sort of talked about some of the
 

00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:44.710
just sort of talked about some of the
the ways that design teams at Google

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720
the ways that design teams at Google
 

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.899
the ways that design teams at Google
have their workflow which is likely

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:46.909
have their workflow which is likely
 

00:12:46.909 --> 00:12:48.719
have their workflow which is likely
almost the same as everywhere else

00:12:48.719 --> 00:12:48.729
almost the same as everywhere else
 

00:12:48.729 --> 00:12:50.469
almost the same as everywhere else
usually this stuff is pretty standard

00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:50.479
usually this stuff is pretty standard
 

00:12:50.479 --> 00:12:53.189
usually this stuff is pretty standard
but talk about sort of the the various

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:53.199
but talk about sort of the the various
 

00:12:53.199 --> 00:12:55.359
but talk about sort of the the various
artifacts that we create the reasons we

00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:55.369
artifacts that we create the reasons we
 

00:12:55.369 --> 00:12:57.159
artifacts that we create the reasons we
create them sort of how they what

00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:57.169
create them sort of how they what
 

00:12:57.169 --> 00:12:58.809
create them sort of how they what
purpose they serve at each stage of the

00:12:58.809 --> 00:12:58.819
purpose they serve at each stage of the
 

00:12:58.819 --> 00:13:03.069
purpose they serve at each stage of the
process start running through that so

00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:03.079
process start running through that so
 

00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:06.039
process start running through that so
the example we use is Google now I got a

00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:06.049
the example we use is Google now I got a
 

00:13:06.049 --> 00:13:07.329
the example we use is Google now I got a
chance to be one of the designers on

00:13:07.329 --> 00:13:07.339
chance to be one of the designers on
 

00:13:07.339 --> 00:13:08.250
chance to be one of the designers on
Google now

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:08.260
Google now

movie special features what it looked

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:36.130
movie special features what it looked
 

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.040
movie special features what it looked
like before it was awesome as it was

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.050
like before it was awesome as it was
 

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.110
like before it was awesome as it was
being created I always looked awesome

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:40.120
being created I always looked awesome
 

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:45.180
being created I always looked awesome
well we'll see so here's actually some

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:45.190
well we'll see so here's actually some
 

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.760
well we'll see so here's actually some
of the very first sketches of Google now

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:47.770
of the very first sketches of Google now
 

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.970
of the very first sketches of Google now
up on a white board and as you can see

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:50.980
up on a white board and as you can see
 

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.720
up on a white board and as you can see
not great at drawing perfect rectangles

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:53.730
not great at drawing perfect rectangles
 

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.560
not great at drawing perfect rectangles
but what what's great about sketches is

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:57.570
but what what's great about sketches is
 

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.450
but what what's great about sketches is
for soliciting really high level

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:00.460
for soliciting really high level
 

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.180
for soliciting really high level
feedback so when you show someone just a

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:03.190
feedback so when you show someone just a
 

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.880
feedback so when you show someone just a
bunch of sort of markings on a white

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:05.890
bunch of sort of markings on a white
 

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.500
bunch of sort of markings on a white
board like this they're immediately

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:07.510
board like this they're immediately
 

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.090
board like this they're immediately
engaged in the idea and coming up with

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:09.100
engaged in the idea and coming up with
 

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.670
engaged in the idea and coming up with
their own ideas and providing feedback

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680
their own ideas and providing feedback
 

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.880
their own ideas and providing feedback
on the level of they feel like like it's

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:17.890
on the level of they feel like like it's
 

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.200
on the level of they feel like like it's
appropriate to provide feedback to the

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:19.210
appropriate to provide feedback to the
 

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.970
appropriate to provide feedback to the
station whereas if you show someone you

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:20.980
station whereas if you show someone you
 

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.950
station whereas if you show someone you
know it's like perfectly rendered high

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:22.960
know it's like perfectly rendered high
 

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.260
know it's like perfectly rendered high
fidelity mock-up they'll start

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:25.270
fidelity mock-up they'll start
 

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.910
fidelity mock-up they'll start
commenting on really minor details but

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:26.920
commenting on really minor details but
 

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.680
commenting on really minor details but
they won't be like actually that's a bad

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:28.690
they won't be like actually that's a bad
 

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.420
they won't be like actually that's a bad
idea like you shouldn't be doing this at

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:30.430
idea like you shouldn't be doing this at
 

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.220
idea like you shouldn't be doing this at
all or um you know have you thought

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:32.230
all or um you know have you thought
 

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.320
all or um you know have you thought
about these other things that are you

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:34.330
about these other things that are you
 

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.870
about these other things that are you
know slightly related so it's important

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880
know slightly related so it's important
 

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.420
know slightly related so it's important
to sort of scale the fidelity of the

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:39.430
to sort of scale the fidelity of the
 

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.180
to sort of scale the fidelity of the
mock-ups you're creating with the the

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:42.190
mock-ups you're creating with the the
 

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.590
mock-ups you're creating with the the
type of engagement you want from the

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600
type of engagement you want from the
 

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.410
type of engagement you want from the
people you're showing them to so

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:46.420
people you're showing them to so
 

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.060
people you're showing them to so
obviously at this point we were just

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:48.070
obviously at this point we were just
 

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.450
obviously at this point we were just
trying to generate ideas on if we had

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:51.460
trying to generate ideas on if we had
 

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.530
trying to generate ideas on if we had
this sort of proactive software that was

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540
this sort of proactive software that was
 

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.850
this sort of proactive software that was
pulling information for you what

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:56.860
pulling information for you what
 

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.840
pulling information for you what
information would a pool would be

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:57.850
information would a pool would be
 

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.060
information would a pool would be
interesting so we you know we were kind

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:00.070
interesting so we you know we were kind
 

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.500
interesting so we you know we were kind

Google now from then we quickly sort of

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:31.570
Google now from then we quickly sort of
 

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.760
Google now from then we quickly sort of
staffed up the design team had more

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:32.770
staffed up the design team had more
 

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.010
staffed up the design team had more
people working on it and here's kind of

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:34.020
people working on it and here's kind of
 

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.900
people working on it and here's kind of
image of the the sort of war room we had

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:36.910
image of the the sort of war room we had
 

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.510
image of the the sort of war room we had
as we were quickly posting stuff up on

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:39.520
as we were quickly posting stuff up on
 

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.690
as we were quickly posting stuff up on
the wall for review so again it's that

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:42.700
the wall for review so again it's that
 

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.040
the wall for review so again it's that
sort of sketch level there's some more

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.050
sort of sketch level there's some more
 

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.480
sort of sketch level there's some more
higher fidelity things here that are

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:45.490
higher fidelity things here that are
 

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.630
higher fidelity things here that are
exploring visual design but the the sort

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:48.640
exploring visual design but the the sort
 

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.360
exploring visual design but the the sort
of purpose here is to go as broad as

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:51.370
of purpose here is to go as broad as
 

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.920
of purpose here is to go as broad as
possible instead of a steep responsible

explore as many ideas as you can and you
know you're you're trying to sort of

00:15:59.370 --> 00:15:59.380
know you're you're trying to sort of
 

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.900
know you're you're trying to sort of
solicit feedback from people and be

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:00.910
solicit feedback from people and be
 

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:05.160

creative so not being overly critical of
 

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.520
creative so not being overly critical of
any ideas you know to sort of shut

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:08.530
any ideas you know to sort of shut

brainstorming down but saying oh that's

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:10.150
brainstorming down but saying oh that's
 

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.310
brainstorming down but saying oh that's
cool but have you tried this and I was

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:11.320
cool but have you tried this and I was
 

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.380
cool but have you tried this and I was
kind of you know redirecting if you're

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:13.390
kind of you know redirecting if you're
 

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.690
kind of you know redirecting if you're
trying to steer things in particular do

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:15.700
trying to steer things in particular do
 

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.070
trying to steer things in particular do
a quick question I mean at this stage

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:17.080
a quick question I mean at this stage
 

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.140
a quick question I mean at this stage
are you thinking about layout I mean it

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:19.150
are you thinking about layout I mean it
 

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.700
are you thinking about layout I mean it
so in the earlier stage you're probably

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:20.710
so in the earlier stage you're probably
 

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.230
so in the earlier stage you're probably
thinking a little bit about Leia but

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240
thinking a little bit about Leia but
 

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.760
thinking a little bit about Leia but
more about you know the the

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:23.770
more about you know the the
 

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.010
more about you know the the
functionality the the actual product

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:26.020
functionality the the actual product
 

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.750
functionality the the actual product
itself like what will the user be able

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:27.760
itself like what will the user be able
 

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.400
itself like what will the user be able
to get out of this one of their benefits

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:29.410
to get out of this one of their benefits
 

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.390
to get out of this one of their benefits
you know what are the different things

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:30.400
you know what are the different things
 

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.160
you know what are the different things
they can do but at this stage are you

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:32.170
they can do but at this stage are you
 

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.600
they can do but at this stage are you
starting to think about layout yet and

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:33.610
starting to think about layout yet and
 

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.390
starting to think about layout yet and
and potentially even I guess like the

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:36.400
and potentially even I guess like the
 

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.970
and potentially even I guess like the
pixels themselves probably not right so

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:38.980
pixels themselves probably not right so
 

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.070
pixels themselves probably not right so
I know a lot of the the stages the

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:41.080
I know a lot of the the stages the
 

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.560
I know a lot of the the stages the
visual designers we're just starting to

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:43.570
visual designers we're just starting to
 

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.000
visual designers we're just starting to
think about what if it you know we were

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.010
think about what if it you know we were
 

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.320
think about what if it you know we were
doing automatic layout based on the

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:46.330
doing automatic layout based on the
 

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.670
doing automatic layout based on the
content and kind of taking the overall

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680
content and kind of taking the overall
 

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.440
content and kind of taking the overall
spirit of what the application was about

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:49.450
spirit of what the application was about
 

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:50.700
spirit of what the application was about
and applying that to kind of there's yes

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:50.710
and applying that to kind of there's yes
 

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.680
and applying that to kind of there's yes
so that was a little bit different than

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:52.690
so that was a little bit different than
 

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.910
so that was a little bit different than
normal

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920
normal
 

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.660
normal
the the layout is obviously we you can't

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:57.670
the the layout is obviously we you can't
 

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.580
the the layout is obviously we you can't
not have a layout it's writing one of

00:16:59.580 --> 00:16:59.590
not have a layout it's writing one of
 

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.470
not have a layout it's writing one of
these we're not trying to like these

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480
these we're not trying to like these
 

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.060
these we're not trying to like these
mock-ups yeah I guess I'm trying to get

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:03.070
mock-ups yeah I guess I'm trying to get
 

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.470
mock-ups yeah I guess I'm trying to get
out is like are you thinking about all

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480
out is like are you thinking about all
 

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.960
out is like are you thinking about all
the different situations for layout

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:06.970
the different situations for layout
 

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:07.800
the different situations for layout
because I'm you know as an Android

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:07.810
because I'm you know as an Android
 

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.300
because I'm you know as an Android
developer you have to think about you

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:09.310
developer you have to think about you
 

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.800
developer you have to think about you
know how does this look on a tablet how

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:10.810
know how does this look on a tablet how
 

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.840
know how does this look on a tablet how
does it oh yeah in portrait landscape at

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:12.850
does it oh yeah in portrait landscape at
 

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:14.579
does it oh yeah in portrait landscape at
this point we were just purely doing

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:14.589
this point we were just purely doing
 

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:17.260
this point we were just purely doing
phones and we figured we

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:17.270
phones and we figured we
 

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.569
phones and we figured we
you'll travel later your tablet ended up

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:19.579
you'll travel later your tablet ended up
 

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:22.120
you'll travel later your tablet ended up
just being sort of multiple columns very

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:22.130
just being sort of multiple columns very
 

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.100
just being sort of multiple columns very
hard so I mean in some ways we we still

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:24.110
hard so I mean in some ways we we still
 

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.110
hard so I mean in some ways we we still
kind of dodged that I mean it's an

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.120
kind of dodged that I mean it's an
 

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.179
kind of dodged that I mean it's an
effective layout for the device but it

00:17:28.179 --> 00:17:28.189
effective layout for the device but it
 

00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:30.580
effective layout for the device but it
wasn't it didn't provide a lot of custom

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:30.590
wasn't it didn't provide a lot of custom
 

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.490
wasn't it didn't provide a lot of custom
work for us sure I just do that layout

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:32.500
work for us sure I just do that layout
 

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.980
work for us sure I just do that layout
so yeah so we're still generating ideas

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:35.990
so yeah so we're still generating ideas
 

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.430
so yeah so we're still generating ideas
next up would be wireframes we actually

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:38.440
next up would be wireframes we actually
 

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.410
next up would be wireframes we actually
we were kind of short on time with us of

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:41.420
we were kind of short on time with us of
 

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.230
we were kind of short on time with us of
totally skipped wireframes here's my

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240
totally skipped wireframes here's my
 

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.910
totally skipped wireframes here's my
approximation of a wireframe this is

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:45.920
approximation of a wireframe this is
 

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.440
approximation of a wireframe this is
actually more higher fidelity than you

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:47.450
actually more higher fidelity than you
 

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.500
actually more higher fidelity than you
would have yeah so then we kind of you

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:50.510
would have yeah so then we kind of you
 

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.299
would have yeah so then we kind of you
know to full fidelity mock-ups these

00:17:52.299 --> 00:17:52.309
know to full fidelity mock-ups these
 

00:17:52.309 --> 00:17:54.280
know to full fidelity mock-ups these
were actually created for a like a Larry

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:54.290
were actually created for a like a Larry
 

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:57.430
were actually created for a like a Larry
Page review and you know at that point

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440
Page review and you know at that point
 

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.200
Page review and you know at that point
you're sort of presenting the full

00:17:59.200 --> 00:17:59.210
you're sort of presenting the full
 

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:00.610
you're sort of presenting the full
vision of the application for feedback

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:00.620
vision of the application for feedback
 

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.230
vision of the application for feedback
you're saying yeah we feel a lot of

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240
you're saying yeah we feel a lot of
 

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.970
you're saying yeah we feel a lot of
thought into this this is sort of how we

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:03.980
thought into this this is sort of how we
 

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.720
thought into this this is sort of how we
imagined it and you're trying to get

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:06.730
imagined it and you're trying to get
 

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:10.500
imagined it and you're trying to get
feedback on sort of fine details and

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:10.510
feedback on sort of fine details and
 

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:13.150
feedback on sort of fine details and
also kind of the spirit of the thing as

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:13.160
also kind of the spirit of the thing as
 

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.740
also kind of the spirit of the thing as
a whole as opposed to feedback you know

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:17.750
a whole as opposed to feedback you know
 

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:21.549
a whole as opposed to feedback you know
specifically on yeah these sort of you

00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:21.559
specifically on yeah these sort of you
 

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:24.630
specifically on yeah these sort of you
know the finer things like layout right

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640
know the finer things like layout right
 

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.340
know the finer things like layout right
so I you know it's you're giving them

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:27.350
so I you know it's you're giving them
 

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.290
so I you know it's you're giving them
what could potentially be pixel perfect

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:29.300
what could potentially be pixel perfect
 

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.880
what could potentially be pixel perfect
mocks he's ended up being very different

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:30.890
mocks he's ended up being very different
 

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.190
mocks he's ended up being very different
from what we actually shipped but they

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200
from what we actually shipped but they
 

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.840
from what we actually shipped but they
were at least at the time pixel perfect

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:34.850
were at least at the time pixel perfect
 

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:36.850
were at least at the time pixel perfect
to really help them visualize what this

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:36.860
to really help them visualize what this
 

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.799
to really help them visualize what this
thing's gonna be about but I guess like

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:38.809
thing's gonna be about but I guess like
 

00:18:38.809 --> 00:18:40.450
thing's gonna be about but I guess like
maybe because because it was you know

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:40.460
maybe because because it was you know
 

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.370
maybe because because it was you know
review for executives for somebody

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:42.380
review for executives for somebody
 

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.380
review for executives for somebody
that's kind of higher up you want to

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:44.390
that's kind of higher up you want to
 

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.510
that's kind of higher up you want to
make sure that they are fully kind of

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:46.520
make sure that they are fully kind of
 

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.730
make sure that they are fully kind of
they're seeing the actual vision maybe

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:48.740
they're seeing the actual vision maybe
 

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.500
they're seeing the actual vision maybe
not like you know sketches you don't

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:50.510
not like you know sketches you don't
 

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.870
not like you know sketches you don't
show sketches to like a c-level person

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880
show sketches to like a c-level person
 

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.030
show sketches to like a c-level person
I'm guessing right I well I I mean it

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:55.040
I'm guessing right I well I I mean it
 

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.100
I'm guessing right I well I I mean it
always depends I guess are on on the

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:57.110
always depends I guess are on on the
 

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.360
always depends I guess are on on the
executive and sort of how they're

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:58.370
executive and sort of how they're
 

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.570
executive and sort of how they're
engaged in the product but I think it's

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:01.580
engaged in the product but I think it's
 

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.250
engaged in the product but I think it's
it's often easier for people to get

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:03.260
it's often easier for people to get
 

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.440
it's often easier for people to get
excited about something that that looks

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:05.450
excited about something that that looks
 

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:11.830
excited about something that that looks
real so it and it's also it communicates

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840
real so it and it's also it communicates
 

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.530
real so it and it's also it communicates
sort of the amount of work and thought

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:14.540
sort of the amount of work and thought
 

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.350
sort of the amount of work and thought
that you've put into it when you dive to

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360
that you've put into it when you dive to
 

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.790
that you've put into it when you dive to
sort of fill fidelity mock-ups at that

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:18.800
sort of fill fidelity mock-ups at that
 

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.160
sort of fill fidelity mock-ups at that
stage and it lets you sort of test

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:21.170
stage and it lets you sort of test
 

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.510
stage and it lets you sort of test
certain boundaries like the the

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520
certain boundaries like the the
 

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.620
certain boundaries like the the
contextual header and Google now is

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:23.630
contextual header and Google now is
 

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.799
contextual header and Google now is
definitely something new and here we

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:26.809
definitely something new and here we
 

00:19:26.809 --> 00:19:27.850
definitely something new and here we
were actually using photographs that

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:27.860
were actually using photographs that
 

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.260
were actually using photographs that
were sort of interested

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:29.270
were sort of interested
 

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.110
were sort of interested
what feedback that was going to serve

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.120
what feedback that was going to serve
 

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.540
what feedback that was going to serve
generate and we weren't even at the time

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:34.550
generate and we weren't even at the time
 

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.740
generate and we weren't even at the time
we weren't super comfortable with

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:35.750
we weren't super comfortable with
 

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.780
we weren't super comfortable with
photographs but we wanted to put those

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:37.790
photographs but we wanted to put those
 

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.190
photographs but we wanted to put those
into the full fidelity mock-ups just

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200
into the full fidelity mock-ups just
 

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.960
into the full fidelity mock-ups just
kind of you know push that boundary of

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:40.970
kind of you know push that boundary of
 

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.960
kind of you know push that boundary of
what we'd be doing with Google brand so

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:43.970
what we'd be doing with Google brand so
 

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.190
what we'd be doing with Google brand so
then obviously you want to use full

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200
then obviously you want to use full
 

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.310
then obviously you want to use full
fidelity for sort of visual explorations

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320
fidelity for sort of visual explorations
 

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.830
fidelity for sort of visual explorations
so here we have kind of the full range

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840
so here we have kind of the full range
 

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.590
so here we have kind of the full range
of a photograph with a filter applied to

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600
of a photograph with a filter applied to
 

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.610
of a photograph with a filter applied to
it and then some sort of extremely sort

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:57.620
it and then some sort of extremely sort
 

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.280
it and then some sort of extremely sort
of block imagery very sort of field

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:00.290
of block imagery very sort of field
 

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.710
of block imagery very sort of field
generator yeah at the bottom here with

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720
generator yeah at the bottom here with
 

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.140
generator yeah at the bottom here with
you know the most simplistic of bridges

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:05.150
you know the most simplistic of bridges
 

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.630
you know the most simplistic of bridges
which is actually pretty ridiculous okay

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:07.640
which is actually pretty ridiculous okay
 

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.190
which is actually pretty ridiculous okay
that way we're you know just trying to

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200
that way we're you know just trying to
 

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.410
that way we're you know just trying to
see the range versus you know something

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:11.420
see the range versus you know something
 

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.280
see the range versus you know something
more like this so we spent a lot of time

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:14.290
more like this so we spent a lot of time
 

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.020
more like this so we spent a lot of time
on this contextual header one of our

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:17.030
on this contextual header one of our
 

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.390
on this contextual header one of our
super talented visual designers created

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:19.400
super talented visual designers created
 

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.250
super talented visual designers created
the sort of sequence where here we have

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:21.260
the sort of sequence where here we have
 

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.650
the sort of sequence where here we have
really kind of abstract art I loved

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:23.660
really kind of abstract art I loved
 

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.990
really kind of abstract art I loved
these I I actually kind of like this

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000
these I I actually kind of like this
 

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.660
these I I actually kind of like this
direction better than yeah there's very

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:31.670
direction better than yeah there's very
 

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.450
direction better than yeah there's very
very talented and yeah here it was a

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:34.460
very talented and yeah here it was a
 

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.710
very talented and yeah here it was a
mixture of time and day and whether

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720
mixture of time and day and whether
 

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.690
mixture of time and day and whether
that's supposed to place we ended up

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:37.700
that's supposed to place we ended up
 

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.340
that's supposed to place we ended up
focusing on place because we felt that

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:39.350
focusing on place because we felt that
 

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.900
focusing on place because we felt that
people often have this kind of

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:40.910
people often have this kind of
 

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.160
people often have this kind of
connection to where they live and this

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:42.170
connection to where they live and this
 

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.980
connection to where they live and this
is sort of you know almost you know

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:44.990
is sort of you know almost you know
 

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.960
is sort of you know almost you know
pride in their hometown and so we're

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:46.970
pride in their hometown and so we're
 

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:48.430
pride in their hometown and so we're
we're kind of urging that also when

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440
we're kind of urging that also when
 

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.570
we're kind of urging that also when
you're traveling it's really neat to see

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:49.580
you're traveling it's really neat to see
 

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.210
you're traveling it's really neat to see
the new headers so we dropped it's just

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:52.220
the new headers so we dropped it's just
 

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.830
the new headers so we dropped it's just
the the purely abstract but I thought

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840
the the purely abstract but I thought
 

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.710
the the purely abstract but I thought
these were just absolutely beautiful

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720
these were just absolutely beautiful
 

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.970
these were just absolutely beautiful
even more abstract we thought it was

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:57.980
even more abstract we thought it was
 

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.460
even more abstract we thought it was
those much before it was sort of mr.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:00.470
those much before it was sort of mr.
 

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.260
those much before it was sort of mr.
more abstract with some items in the

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:02.270
more abstract with some items in the
 

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.600
more abstract with some items in the
background of place and then we started

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:04.610
background of place and then we started
 

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.480
background of place and then we started
exploring this notion of cities in San

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:07.490
exploring this notion of cities in San
 

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.540
exploring this notion of cities in San
Francisco being shown here and some one

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:10.550
Francisco being shown here and some one
 

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:13.720
Francisco being shown here and some one
of Seattle here's you know that same

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:13.730
of Seattle here's you know that same
 

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:18.760
of Seattle here's you know that same
style sort of a country town

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:18.770
 

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.910
and then just yeah sort of that nature

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:21.920
and then just yeah sort of that nature
 

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.650
and then just yeah sort of that nature
one was kind of triggering the next as

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:23.660
one was kind of triggering the next as
 

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.230
one was kind of triggering the next as
we would get these posted up on the wall

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240
we would get these posted up on the wall
 

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.910
we would get these posted up on the wall
and you know sort of talk about you know

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:27.920
and you know sort of talk about you know
 

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.799
and you know sort of talk about you know
what it conveys and how people are gonna

00:21:29.799 --> 00:21:29.809
what it conveys and how people are gonna
 

00:21:29.809 --> 00:21:31.690
what it conveys and how people are gonna
feel as they see it so then the sprout a

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:31.700
feel as they see it so then the sprout a
 

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.669
feel as they see it so then the sprout a
little bit closer to where we landed was

00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679
little bit closer to where we landed was
 

00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:35.799
little bit closer to where we landed was
sort of a little bit more detail but

00:21:35.799 --> 00:21:35.809
sort of a little bit more detail but
 

00:21:35.809 --> 00:21:40.000
sort of a little bit more detail but
still illustrative and then here's where

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.010
still illustrative and then here's where
 

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.500
still illustrative and then here's where
we're filming in New York today so I

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:41.510
we're filming in New York today so I
 

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:42.790
we're filming in New York today so I
thought I'd show one of the early New

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:42.800
thought I'd show one of the early New
 

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.770
thought I'd show one of the early New
York ones

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:43.780
York ones
 

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.880
York ones
yeah when these sort of strong shadows

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:45.890
yeah when these sort of strong shadows
 

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.190
yeah when these sort of strong shadows
which we see a lot in a lot of Google's

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.200
which we see a lot in a lot of Google's
 

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.080
which we see a lot in a lot of Google's
design work

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:49.090
design work
 

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.330
design work
yeah the 45-degree angle yeah

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:52.340
yeah the 45-degree angle yeah
 

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.640
yeah the 45-degree angle yeah
which experiment with the kind of the

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:54.650
which experiment with the kind of the
 

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.220
which experiment with the kind of the
holiday style text input books as well

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:57.230
holiday style text input books as well
 

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:00.600
holiday style text input books as well
mm-hmm oh yeah it is and we ended up

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:00.610
mm-hmm oh yeah it is and we ended up
 

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.350
mm-hmm oh yeah it is and we ended up
dropping that because it didn't quite

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360
dropping that because it didn't quite
 

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.799
dropping that because it didn't quite
have the the sort of visual hierarchy

00:22:05.799 --> 00:22:05.809
have the the sort of visual hierarchy
 

00:22:05.809 --> 00:22:07.900
have the the sort of visual hierarchy
that we were looking for especially

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:07.910
that we were looking for especially
 

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.130
that we were looking for especially
about controlling the background it was

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:09.140
about controlling the background it was
 

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.160
about controlling the background it was
it was falling out but yeah this was the

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:12.170
it was falling out but yeah this was the
 

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:13.540
it was falling out but yeah this was the
one that we kind of sold as the

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:13.550
one that we kind of sold as the
 

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.650
one that we kind of sold as the
direction we really liked and then from

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:14.660
direction we really liked and then from
 

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.620
direction we really liked and then from
there it was you know iterating on you

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:17.630
there it was you know iterating on you
 

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.700
there it was you know iterating on you
know going out and creating all the

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:18.710
know going out and creating all the
 

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:23.440
know going out and creating all the
cities here we have London me yeah New

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:23.450
cities here we have London me yeah New
 

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:26.049
cities here we have London me yeah New
York or San Francisco and you know all

00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:26.059
York or San Francisco and you know all
 

00:22:26.059 --> 00:22:27.940
York or San Francisco and you know all
the different times of day and just I

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:27.950
the different times of day and just I
 

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.830
the different times of day and just I
personally loved all their pallets I

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840
personally loved all their pallets I
 

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.590
personally loved all their pallets I
mean to me the if you were to drop these

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:32.600
mean to me the if you were to drop these
 

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.210
mean to me the if you were to drop these
into something like you know cooler data

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:34.220
into something like you know cooler data
 

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.280
into something like you know cooler data
they'll be that commerce or even dribble

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:36.290
they'll be that commerce or even dribble
 

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:37.810
they'll be that commerce or even dribble
you know we they give you a kind of a

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:37.820
you know we they give you a kind of a
 

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.330
you know we they give you a kind of a
color range or like if you upload a

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:40.340
color range or like if you upload a
 

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.250
color range or like if you upload a
photo or upload a design they kind of

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:42.260
photo or upload a design they kind of
 

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.530
photo or upload a design they kind of
give you the general color scheme I feel

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:44.540
give you the general color scheme I feel
 

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.180
give you the general color scheme I feel
like these if you were to import those

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:46.190
like these if you were to import those
 

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.130
like these if you were to import those
they would result in some of the best

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:48.140
they would result in some of the best
 

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.370
they would result in some of the best
color palettes I just personally am in

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:51.380
color palettes I just personally am in
 

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.750
color palettes I just personally am in
love with especially the San Francisco

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.760
love with especially the San Francisco
 

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.430
love with especially the San Francisco
one yeah and the ones at night I was

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:54.440
one yeah and the ones at night I was
 

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.840
one yeah and the ones at night I was
really loved its New York one at night

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:55.850
really loved its New York one at night
 

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:59.169
really loved its New York one at night

so there's there's actually quite a few

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:04.550
so there's there's actually quite a few
 

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.790
so there's there's actually quite a few
more than this we're doing them over

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:06.800
more than this we're doing them over
 

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.060
more than this we're doing them over
time and staging out cities we started

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:09.070
time and staging out cities we started
 

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.820
time and staging out cities we started
targeting we were trying to get all the

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:12.830
targeting we were trying to get all the
 

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.610
targeting we were trying to get all the
cities by population for a while and

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:15.620
cities by population for a while and
 

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.530
cities by population for a while and
then realized we weren't getting some of

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:17.540
then realized we weren't getting some of
 

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.690
then realized we weren't getting some of
the the text centers so those got kind

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:19.700
the the text centers so those got kind
 

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.890
the the text centers so those got kind
of accelerated include those it's over

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:23.900
of accelerated include those it's over
 

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.060
of accelerated include those it's over
time you'll see more and more cities so

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:25.070
time you'll see more and more cities so
 

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.010
time you'll see more and more cities so
we also we actually do use some filters

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:27.020
we also we actually do use some filters
 

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.150
we also we actually do use some filters
on the photograph

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:28.160
on the photograph
 

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.650
on the photograph
in google now just we could have more

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:29.660
in google now just we could have more
 

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:30.820
in google now just we could have more
coverage at launch because these

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:30.830
coverage at launch because these
 

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.460
coverage at launch because these
obviously take some time to make but

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:33.470
obviously take some time to make but
 

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.500
obviously take some time to make but
this was sort of the art style that we I

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:35.510
this was sort of the art style that we I
 

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.480
this was sort of the art style that we I
love the ambition of it as well that

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:37.490
love the ambition of it as well that
 

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.520
love the ambition of it as well that
yeah we're gonna provide a localized

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:39.530
yeah we're gonna provide a localized
 

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.340
yeah we're gonna provide a localized
header for every major city yeah I know

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:42.350
header for every major city yeah I know
 

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.920
header for every major city yeah I know
which a lot of people were kind of

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:44.930
which a lot of people were kind of
 

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.200
which a lot of people were kind of
critical of and yeah I was trying to

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:47.210
critical of and yeah I was trying to
 

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.180
critical of and yeah I was trying to
make argument well it's a finite set I

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:49.190
make argument well it's a finite set I
 

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:51.700
make argument well it's a finite set I
mean reckoned but I think it'd convey

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:51.710
mean reckoned but I think it'd convey
 

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:52.870
mean reckoned but I think it'd convey
something about a putt right this is

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880
something about a putt right this is
 

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.400
something about a putt right this is
Google and there's an element of magic

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:54.410
Google and there's an element of magic
 

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.200
Google and there's an element of magic
and you know Google boils oceans and

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:56.210
and you know Google boils oceans and
 

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.330
and you know Google boils oceans and
does these crazy big tusks and I think

00:23:58.330 --> 00:23:58.340
does these crazy big tusks and I think
 

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.010
does these crazy big tusks and I think
you know it resonates with Google's

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:00.020
you know it resonates with Google's
 

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.540
you know it resonates with Google's
image and what we're trying to do if now

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:01.550
image and what we're trying to do if now
 

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.940
image and what we're trying to do if now
I think very very well yeah I guess it's

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:03.950
I think very very well yeah I guess it's
 

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.130
I think very very well yeah I guess it's
also actually important to talk about so

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:06.140
also actually important to talk about so
 

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.720
also actually important to talk about so
you know higher level why are we doing

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:07.730
you know higher level why are we doing
 

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.810
you know higher level why are we doing
all of this we we wanted to be sure that

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:10.820
all of this we we wanted to be sure that
 

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.280
all of this we we wanted to be sure that
when you went into the application you

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:12.290
when you went into the application you
 

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.950
when you went into the application you
understood that it was contextual and

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960
understood that it was contextual and
 

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.530
understood that it was contextual and
having the header change over time made

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:17.540
having the header change over time made
 

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.000
having the header change over time made
sort of every part even the artwork

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:19.010
sort of every part even the artwork
 

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:20.740
sort of every part even the artwork
contextual and have a change based off

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:20.750
contextual and have a change based off
 

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.780
contextual and have a change based off
of your location so it became this sort

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:22.790
of your location so it became this sort
 

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.490
of your location so it became this sort
of immediate sort of visual affordance

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:24.500
of immediate sort of visual affordance
 

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.620
of immediate sort of visual affordance
of oh these cards really are alive

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:26.630
of oh these cards really are alive
 

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.330
of oh these cards really are alive
they're about what's happening right now

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:28.340
they're about what's happening right now

that tone whereas Google Calm it's it's
 

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.210
that tone whereas Google Calm it's it's
white it's kind of about you know the

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:37.220
white it's kind of about you know the
 

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.430

infinite possibilities of finding
 

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.050
infinite possibilities of finding
anything this is you know obviously you

of we've we've created the search based

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:44.660
of we've we've created the search based
 

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.560
of we've we've created the search based
off of your current context so we felt

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:47.570
off of your current context so we felt
 

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.560
off of your current context so we felt
that that was sort of helpful to set the

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:50.570
that that was sort of helpful to set the
 

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:51.850
that that was sort of helpful to set the
users expectations of what the

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:51.860
users expectations of what the
 

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.560
users expectations of what the
application would do right off the bat

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:53.570

application would do right off the bat
with the header even the motion graphics

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:56.090
with the header even the motion graphics
 

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.510
with the header even the motion graphics
design was was done to convey that

00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520
design was was done to convey that
 

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.640
design was was done to convey that
though the notion of the cards dealing

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:00.650
though the notion of the cards dealing
 

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.470
though the notion of the cards dealing
in where you see them deal immediately

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480
in where you see them deal immediately
 

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.290
in where you see them deal immediately
it helps establish this mental model of

these were just created for you based on

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.640
these were just created for you based on
 

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.910
these were just created for you based on
what's happening right now

what's happening right now
also we one of the reasons I was

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:12.650
also we one of the reasons I was
 

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.250
also we one of the reasons I was
focusing on a card metaphor was it can

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:15.260
focusing on a card metaphor was it can
 

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.350
focusing on a card metaphor was it can
kind of help with expectations of you

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360
kind of help with expectations of you
 

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.790
kind of help with expectations of you
know like when you're playing cards this

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:18.800
know like when you're playing cards this
 

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.210
know like when you're playing cards this
may or may not be a good hand

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:21.220
may or may not be a good hand
 

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.530
may or may not be a good hand
thankfully the quality has been great

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:23.540
thankfully the quality has been great
 

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.190
thankfully the quality has been great
now in the beginning it wasn't so the

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200
now in the beginning it wasn't so the
 

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.220
now in the beginning it wasn't so the
managing expectations yeah like I could

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:30.230
managing expectations yeah like I could
 

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:34.510
managing expectations yeah like I could
cards this time it's so yeah so that but

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520
cards this time it's so yeah so that but
 

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.850
cards this time it's so yeah so that but
it's worth noting that in addition to

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:36.860
it's worth noting that in addition to
 

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.290
it's worth noting that in addition to
all the visual design I'm showing here

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:38.300
all the visual design I'm showing here
 

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.029
all the visual design I'm showing here
there was a lot of motion graphics

00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:40.039
there was a lot of motion graphics
 

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:41.379
there was a lot of motion graphics
that went into google now actually had a

00:25:41.379 --> 00:25:41.389
that went into google now actually had a
 

00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:43.719
that went into google now actually had a
dedicated motion graphics designer who

00:25:43.719 --> 00:25:43.729
dedicated motion graphics designer who
 

00:25:43.729 --> 00:25:47.019
dedicated motion graphics designer who
was working on cards dealing in the the

00:25:47.019 --> 00:25:47.029
was working on cards dealing in the the
 

00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:50.259
was working on cards dealing in the the
field expanding you know the the

00:25:50.259 --> 00:25:50.269
field expanding you know the the
 

00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:52.419
field expanding you know the the
microphone radiating and the sort of

00:25:52.419 --> 00:25:52.429
microphone radiating and the sort of
 

00:25:52.429 --> 00:25:54.969
microphone radiating and the sort of
circles coming off with a microphone as

00:25:54.969 --> 00:25:54.979
circles coming off with a microphone as
 

00:25:54.979 --> 00:25:56.979
circles coming off with a microphone as
an indication of appear speaking too

00:25:56.979 --> 00:25:56.989
an indication of appear speaking too
 

00:25:56.989 --> 00:25:58.419
an indication of appear speaking too
loud or not which i thought was really

00:25:58.419 --> 00:25:58.429
loud or not which i thought was really
 

00:25:58.429 --> 00:25:59.440
loud or not which i thought was really
interesting oh wow

00:25:59.440 --> 00:25:59.450
interesting oh wow
 

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.999
interesting oh wow
so like one of the problems with speech

00:26:00.999 --> 00:26:01.009
so like one of the problems with speech
 

00:26:01.009 --> 00:26:03.359
so like one of the problems with speech
recognition is for some reason people

00:26:03.359 --> 00:26:03.369
recognition is for some reason people
 

00:26:03.369 --> 00:26:05.229
recognition is for some reason people
well they assume the accuracy is not

00:26:05.229 --> 00:26:05.239
well they assume the accuracy is not
 

00:26:05.239 --> 00:26:06.940
well they assume the accuracy is not
gonna be great it's kind of naturally

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:06.950
gonna be great it's kind of naturally
 

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.549
gonna be great it's kind of naturally
just kind of start shouting oh yeah my

00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559
just kind of start shouting oh yeah my
 

00:26:09.559 --> 00:26:11.229
just kind of start shouting oh yeah my
parents are yeah I think everyone's

00:26:11.229 --> 00:26:11.239
parents are yeah I think everyone's
 

00:26:11.239 --> 00:26:16.869
parents are yeah I think everyone's
parents yeah and the problem that is

00:26:16.869 --> 00:26:16.879
parents yeah and the problem that is
 

00:26:16.879 --> 00:26:17.769
parents yeah and the problem that is
then you start blowing out the

00:26:17.769 --> 00:26:17.779
then you start blowing out the
 

00:26:17.779 --> 00:26:19.539
then you start blowing out the
microphone so actually the recognition

00:26:19.539 --> 00:26:19.549
microphone so actually the recognition
 

00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:20.710
microphone so actually the recognition
is much worse because if you can't even

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720
is much worse because if you can't even
 

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.080
is much worse because if you can't even
get a good signal yes we wanted

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:23.090
get a good signal yes we wanted
 

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.960
get a good signal yes we wanted
something to sort of show no too loud so

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:25.970
something to sort of show no too loud so
 

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.060
something to sort of show no too loud so
it actually hits sort of this outer

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:28.070
it actually hits sort of this outer
 

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:30.489
it actually hits sort of this outer
radius and turns red if you believe it

00:26:30.489 --> 00:26:30.499
radius and turns red if you believe it
 

00:26:30.499 --> 00:26:32.139
radius and turns red if you believe it
does that was the design at least I need

00:26:32.139 --> 00:26:32.149
does that was the design at least I need
 

00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:33.609
does that was the design at least I need
to go back and make sure we finish that

00:26:33.609 --> 00:26:33.619
to go back and make sure we finish that
 

00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:35.499
to go back and make sure we finish that
but yeah they have that kind of media

00:26:35.499 --> 00:26:35.509
but yeah they have that kind of media
 

00:26:35.509 --> 00:26:38.680
but yeah they have that kind of media
feedback and have it feel alive so kind

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:38.690
feedback and have it feel alive so kind
 

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:40.599
feedback and have it feel alive so kind
of continuing on with slides here we'll

00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:40.609
of continuing on with slides here we'll
 

00:26:40.609 --> 00:26:42.129
of continuing on with slides here we'll
ask more about motion graphics in oh

00:26:42.129 --> 00:26:42.139
ask more about motion graphics in oh
 

00:26:42.139 --> 00:26:43.539
ask more about motion graphics in oh
yeah sure thing well I mean motion

00:26:43.539 --> 00:26:43.549
yeah sure thing well I mean motion
 

00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:45.310
yeah sure thing well I mean motion
graphic also kind of comes into play in

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:45.320
graphic also kind of comes into play in
 

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.799
graphic also kind of comes into play in
the this is sort of the the most static

00:26:47.799 --> 00:26:47.809
the this is sort of the the most static
 

00:26:47.809 --> 00:26:51.789
the this is sort of the the most static
way of describing but here's the flow

00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:51.799
way of describing but here's the flow
 

00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:53.259
way of describing but here's the flow
you're basically trying to visualize the

00:26:53.259 --> 00:26:53.269
you're basically trying to visualize the
 

00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:55.960
you're basically trying to visualize the
sequence of steps these are useful for

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:55.970
sequence of steps these are useful for
 

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:57.430
sequence of steps these are useful for
knowing kind of you know or what your

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440
knowing kind of you know or what your
 

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.960
knowing kind of you know or what your
key frames are in terms of you need to

00:26:58.960 --> 00:26:58.970
key frames are in terms of you need to
 

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.489
key frames are in terms of you need to
animate from here to here and I have no

00:27:00.489 --> 00:27:00.499
animate from here to here and I have no
 

00:27:00.499 --> 00:27:02.619
animate from here to here and I have no
idea how to do that which is actually

00:27:02.619 --> 00:27:02.629
idea how to do that which is actually
 

00:27:02.629 --> 00:27:04.330
idea how to do that which is actually
not the best way of framing it to motion

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:04.340
not the best way of framing it to motion
 

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:09.629
not the best way of framing it to motion
graphics designers Mordo I said oh yeah

00:27:09.629 --> 00:27:09.639
graphics designers Mordo I said oh yeah
 

00:27:09.639 --> 00:27:11.859
graphics designers Mordo I said oh yeah
don't you want to evoke and what you're

00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:11.869
don't you want to evoke and what you're
 

00:27:11.869 --> 00:27:12.969
don't you want to evoke and what you're
trying to communicate with the graphics

00:27:12.969 --> 00:27:12.979
trying to communicate with the graphics
 

00:27:12.979 --> 00:27:16.089
trying to communicate with the graphics
but yeah but flows are also really

00:27:16.089 --> 00:27:16.099
but yeah but flows are also really
 

00:27:16.099 --> 00:27:17.680
but yeah but flows are also really
useful for just sort of understanding

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:17.690
useful for just sort of understanding
 

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.570
useful for just sort of understanding
the the sort of temporal complexity of

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:19.580
the the sort of temporal complexity of
 

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.430
the the sort of temporal complexity of
your application which is it's important

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440
your application which is it's important
 

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.570
your application which is it's important
to get it up on the board and look at it

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:22.580
to get it up on the board and look at it
 

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.149
to get it up on the board and look at it
saying is it actually too difficult to

00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159
saying is it actually too difficult to
 

00:27:25.159 --> 00:27:26.680
saying is it actually too difficult to
get from from this location sits a

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:26.690
get from from this location sits a
 

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:27.489
get from from this location sits a
little location there's too many

00:27:27.489 --> 00:27:27.499
little location there's too many
 

00:27:27.499 --> 00:27:28.839
little location there's too many
navigation steps it's going to take

00:27:28.839 --> 00:27:28.849
navigation steps it's going to take
 

00:27:28.849 --> 00:27:31.719
navigation steps it's going to take
these or too much time people often

00:27:31.719 --> 00:27:31.729
these or too much time people often
 

00:27:31.729 --> 00:27:33.639
these or too much time people often
think about complexity in terms of the

00:27:33.639 --> 00:27:33.649
think about complexity in terms of the
 

00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:36.249
think about complexity in terms of the
number of objects on screen but if you

00:27:36.249 --> 00:27:36.259
number of objects on screen but if you
 

00:27:36.259 --> 00:27:38.889
number of objects on screen but if you
make things simple simply by introducing

00:27:38.889 --> 00:27:38.899
make things simple simply by introducing
 

00:27:38.899 --> 00:27:40.450
make things simple simply by introducing
navigational steps you've really just

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:40.460
navigational steps you've really just
 

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.830
navigational steps you've really just
kind of shifted your complexity into a

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840
kind of shifted your complexity into a
 

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.889
kind of shifted your complexity into a
different type of complexity so it's

00:27:44.889 --> 00:27:44.899
different type of complexity so it's
 

00:27:44.899 --> 00:27:46.180
different type of complexity so it's
really good to look at the sequences so

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:46.190
really good to look at the sequences so
 

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:50.139
really good to look at the sequences so
you can see temporal complexity we also

00:27:50.139 --> 00:27:50.149
you can see temporal complexity we also
 

00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:53.700
you can see temporal complexity we also
then sort of final stages red lines

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:53.710
then sort of final stages red lines
 

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.080
then sort of final stages red lines
just for communicating sort of specific

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:56.090
just for communicating sort of specific
 

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.410
just for communicating sort of specific
values colors padding things like this

00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:58.420
values colors padding things like this
 

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.820
values colors padding things like this
because you want everything to be pixel

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:00.830
because you want everything to be pixel
 

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.270
because you want everything to be pixel
perfect and perfect alignment this was

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:04.280
perfect and perfect alignment this was
 

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.740
perfect and perfect alignment this was
actually a much earlier design of Google

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:05.750
actually a much earlier design of Google
 

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:08.950
actually a much earlier design of Google
now the red line but this is SHS we were

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960
now the red line but this is SHS we were
 

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.540
now the red line but this is SHS we were
moving on to engineering this was the

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:10.550
moving on to engineering this was the
 

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:11.740
moving on to engineering this was the
red line we used right then this is

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:11.750
red line we used right then this is
 

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.000
red line we used right then this is
actually something that that's a very

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:13.010
actually something that that's a very
 

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:14.470
actually something that that's a very
important tool for designers to

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480
important tool for designers to
 

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.990
important tool for designers to
communicate with developers right so as

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:17.000
communicate with developers right so as
 

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.150
communicate with developers right so as
a developer you generally you know look

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:19.160
a developer you generally you know look
 

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.710
a developer you generally you know look
at it you may look at a pixel perfect

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720
at it you may look at a pixel perfect
 

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.600
at it you may look at a pixel perfect
and they say okay I need to roughly

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:22.610
and they say okay I need to roughly
 

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.760
and they say okay I need to roughly
approximate this so let me just make

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:24.770
approximate this so let me just make
 

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.590
approximate this so let me just make
this like three dips or four dips and

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:26.600
this like three dips or four dips and
 

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.270
this like three dips or four dips and
that looks about right and and let me

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:28.280
that looks about right and and let me
 

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.980
that looks about right and and let me
actually just do this so as a designer I

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:29.990
actually just do this so as a designer I
 

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.660
actually just do this so as a designer I
mean if you're if you're communicating

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:31.670
mean if you're if you're communicating
 

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.670
mean if you're if you're communicating
and working with developers make sure to

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:33.680
and working with developers make sure to
 

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.170
and working with developers make sure to
give them these these piece of

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:35.180
give them these these piece of
 

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.940
give them these these piece of
information and another may just want to

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:36.950
information and another may just want to
 

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.460
information and another may just want to
add in here is make sure to note what

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:39.470
add in here is make sure to note what
 

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.530
add in here is make sure to note what
should stretch what should be fixed you

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:41.540
should stretch what should be fixed you
 

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.600
should stretch what should be fixed you
know what is responsive almost put in

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:43.610
know what is responsive almost put in
 

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.240
know what is responsive almost put in
like if it requires text like a text

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:46.250
like if it requires text like a text
 

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:48.160
like if it requires text like a text
description like this should stay fixed

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:48.170
description like this should stay fixed
 

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:49.690
description like this should stay fixed
and so on and so forth make sure to

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:49.700
and so on and so forth make sure to
 

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.890
and so on and so forth make sure to
include that that's one of the most

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:50.900
include that that's one of the most
 

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.420
include that that's one of the most
important tools I think for for

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:52.430
important tools I think for for
 

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:53.770
important tools I think for for
communicating between designers and

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:53.780
communicating between designers and
 

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.040
communicating between designers and
developers yeah yeah similar kind of

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:57.050
developers yeah yeah similar kind of
 

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:58.360
developers yeah yeah similar kind of
techniques for doing motion like do you

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:58.370
techniques for doing motion like do you
 

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:00.430
techniques for doing motion like do you
like I don't know how you'd how you

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440
like I don't know how you'd how you
 

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.960
like I don't know how you'd how you
would document that you wanted to

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:01.970
would document that you wanted to
 

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.010
would document that you wanted to
animate in a certain way would you just

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:03.020
animate in a certain way would you just
 

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.230
animate in a certain way would you just
use the keyframe type snapshots or do

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240
use the keyframe type snapshots or do
 

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.820
use the keyframe type snapshots or do
you have like a similar technique to

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:06.830
you have like a similar technique to
 

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.200
you have like a similar technique to
read lines for saying this should move

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:08.210
read lines for saying this should move
 

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.720
read lines for saying this should move
like this or you know we don't we do it

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:10.730
like this or you know we don't we do it
 

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:15.370
like this or you know we don't we do it
all with hand gestures which is not

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:15.380
all with hand gestures which is not
 

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.650
all with hand gestures which is not
nearly as exact as if we had a red line

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:17.660
nearly as exact as if we had a red line
 

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.130
nearly as exact as if we had a red line
but often the motion graphics designer

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:20.140
but often the motion graphics designer
 

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:24.370
but often the motion graphics designer
they're sort of the I mean you're

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:24.380
they're sort of the I mean you're
 

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:25.900
they're sort of the I mean you're
generating the videos that can then be

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:25.910
generating the videos that can then be
 

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:29.950
generating the videos that can then be
used you know to convert to the final

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:29.960
used you know to convert to the final
 

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.880
used you know to convert to the final
animations so from those you can extract

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:33.890
animations so from those you can extract
 

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:35.830
animations so from those you can extract
you know timing and that so I mean it'd

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840
you know timing and that so I mean it'd
 

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.300
you know timing and that so I mean it'd
be somewhere to like a sub red line a

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:37.310
be somewhere to like a sub red line a
 

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.590
be somewhere to like a sub red line a
developer going into Photoshop and

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:38.600
developer going into Photoshop and
 

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.630
developer going into Photoshop and
actually measuring sentences and that

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640
actually measuring sentences and that
 

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.280
actually measuring sentences and that
you have to like view the properties and

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:42.290
you have to like view the properties and
 

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:44.320
you have to like view the properties and
after-effects and it's some cases of me

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:44.330
after-effects and it's some cases of me
 

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:45.490
after-effects and it's some cases of me
if you have the resources you could also

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:45.500
if you have the resources you could also
 

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.200
if you have the resources you could also
probably you know spend some time to

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:47.210
probably you know spend some time to
 

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:49.450
probably you know spend some time to
prototype something you know I think I

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:49.460
prototype something you know I think I
 

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.470
prototype something you know I think I
don't know if we have any prototype

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480
don't know if we have any prototype
 

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.360
don't know if we have any prototype
engineers but I know that some companies

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:52.370
engineers but I know that some companies
 

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:53.950
engineers but I know that some companies
actually have folks that don't even

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.960
actually have folks that don't even
 

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.360
actually have folks that don't even
build the software the final shipping

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:55.370
build the software the final shipping
 

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.160
build the software the final shipping
software but they will build a prototype

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:57.170
software but they will build a prototype
 

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.950
software but they will build a prototype
that roughly approximates the you know

00:29:59.950 --> 00:29:59.960
that roughly approximates the you know
 

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.840
that roughly approximates the you know
the general behaviors interactions and

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:01.850
the general behaviors interactions and
 

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.500

that Jas or or even HTML Javascript
 

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.550
that Jas or or even HTML Javascript
something that's kind of really easy and

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:13.560
something that's kind of really easy and
 

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.830
something that's kind of really easy and
lightweight and easy to iterate on those

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840
lightweight and easy to iterate on those
 

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.000

tools can be very useful for again

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.010
tools can be very useful for again
 

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.430
tools can be very useful for again
communicating that idea mm-hmm yeah and

communicating that idea mm-hmm yeah and
then yeah creating latent process and

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600
then yeah creating latent process and
 

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.820
then yeah creating latent process and

commuting or only in the process you're
 

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:25.430
commuting or only in the process you're
just focusing on you know how do you

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440
just focusing on you know how do you
 

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.840
just focusing on you know how do you
want to sort of set the stage of your

present itself what do you want the
 

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:32.210
present itself what do you want the
users attention to focus on because much

you know seeing motion like or I will be

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:36.990
you know seeing motion like or I will be
 

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:40.100
you know seeing motion like or I will be
drawn to anything that's animating so as

you're doing the motion graphics design

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:41.460
you're doing the motion graphics design
 

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.870
you're doing the motion graphics design
is again about the users attention you

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880
is again about the users attention you
 

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.880
is again about the users attention you
know what you're notifying them of at in

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:46.890
know what you're notifying them of at in
 

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.040
know what you're notifying them of at in
that moment in time of what on what on

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:49.050
that moment in time of what on what on
 

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.990
that moment in time of what on what on
screen you want them to fixate on how

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000
screen you want them to fixate on how
 

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.010
screen you want them to fixate on how
you want to sort of draw their attention

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020
you want to sort of draw their attention
 

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.660
you want to sort of draw their attention
to something and it's another case of

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:53.670
to something and it's another case of
 

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:55.490
to something and it's another case of
like don't animate needlessly don't

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500
like don't animate needlessly don't
 

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.350
like don't animate needlessly don't
animate just for a visual flair and

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360
animate just for a visual flair and
 

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.210
animate just for a visual flair and
right have it have a purpose a story of

00:30:59.210 --> 00:30:59.220
right have it have a purpose a story of
 

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.520
right have it have a purpose a story of
your animation a reason you want users

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:01.530
your animation a reason you want users
 

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:05.930
your animation a reason you want users
to focus on something so yeah I mean

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940
to focus on something so yeah I mean
 

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.140
to focus on something so yeah I mean
like in Google now you know when you say

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:09.150
like in Google now you know when you say
 

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.660
like in Google now you know when you say
Google it goes into microphone mode so

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:11.670
Google it goes into microphone mode so
 

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:14.540
Google it goes into microphone mode so
we wanted people you know obviously you

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:14.550
we wanted people you know obviously you
 

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:15.770
we wanted people you know obviously you
might just say Google while looking at

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:15.780
might just say Google while looking at
 

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.440
might just say Google while looking at
it's the the search field you know

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:18.450
it's the the search field you know
 

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:19.910
it's the the search field you know
stretches down so you can see sort of

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:19.920
stretches down so you can see sort of
 

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.490
stretches down so you can see sort of
what you acted on yeah as you're going

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:22.500
what you acted on yeah as you're going
 

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.810
what you acted on yeah as you're going
into the mode obviously when you tap it

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820
into the mode obviously when you tap it
 

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:24.920
into the mode obviously when you tap it
you don't need to communicate that as

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:24.930
you don't need to communicate that as
 

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.230
you don't need to communicate that as
much as you literally touched it but for

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240
much as you literally touched it but for
 

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.790
much as you literally touched it but for
the voice input I thought that was

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:28.800
the voice input I thought that was
 

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.920
the voice input I thought that was
really effective way of I'm telling that

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:30.930
really effective way of I'm telling that
 

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.410
really effective way of I'm telling that
story of the search field has become the

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:33.420
story of the search field has become the
 

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.390
story of the search field has become the
microphone input so even though it's not

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:35.400
microphone input so even though it's not
 

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.010
microphone input so even though it's not
taking test entry at that point you're

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020
taking test entry at that point you're
 

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.040
taking test entry at that point you're
still speaking to this object so that's

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:40.050
still speaking to this object so that's
 

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:40.490
still speaking to this object so that's
awesome

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500
awesome
 

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.400
awesome
yes sort of the level of sort of

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:43.410
yes sort of the level of sort of
 

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:44.570
yes sort of the level of sort of
analysis you have to do in terms of the

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:44.580
analysis you have to do in terms of the
 

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.520
analysis you have to do in terms of the
motion graphics and and crafting that

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:46.530
motion graphics and and crafting that
 

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.610
motion graphics and and crafting that
story about how the application behaves

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:48.620
story about how the application behaves
 

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:53.050
story about how the application behaves
awesome yeah so

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:53.060
awesome yeah so
 

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.640
awesome yeah so
let's move on to some final social

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:55.650
let's move on to some final social
 

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.860
let's move on to some final social
engineering tips for as you are showing

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:57.870
engineering tips for as you are showing
 

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:01.400
engineering tips for as you are showing
your mock-ups so the one of the first

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:01.410
your mock-ups so the one of the first
 

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:02.840
your mock-ups so the one of the first
things that I found it's really

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:02.850
things that I found it's really
 

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:06.290
things that I found it's really
effective is you want sort of the

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:06.300
effective is you want sort of the
 

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.880
effective is you want sort of the
feeling to be in very collaborative as

engineers and project managers and
marketing people you're working with so

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880
marketing people you're working with so
 

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.900
marketing people you're working with so
one of the easiest things you can do is

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:13.910
one of the easiest things you can do is
 

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:16.640
one of the easiest things you can do is
showing your work live in the

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:16.650
showing your work live in the
 

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:18.440
showing your work live in the
application used to create it so as

people are generating feedback you're

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:19.770
people are generating feedback you're
 

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:21.560
people are generating feedback you're
adding notes you're making changes so it

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:21.570
adding notes you're making changes so it
 

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.360
adding notes you're making changes so it
feels like it's this sort of fluid

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:23.370
feels like it's this sort of fluid
 

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:24.920
feels like it's this sort of fluid
living document as opposed to like

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:24.930
living document as opposed to like
 

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:26.810
living document as opposed to like
printing it out and you know posting it

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:26.820
printing it out and you know posting it
 

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.010
printing it out and you know posting it
up on the wall and you know having

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:28.020
up on the wall and you know having
 

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.780
up on the wall and you know having
everyone's kind of look at it or even

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:29.790
everyone's kind of look at it or even
 

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.160
everyone's kind of look at it or even
just projecting it but it's like a

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:31.170
just projecting it but it's like a
 

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.470
just projecting it but it's like a
flattened PDF or something where it

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480
flattened PDF or something where it
 

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.180
flattened PDF or something where it
feels more finalized progress like

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:35.190
feels more finalized progress like
 

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.740
feels more finalized progress like
actual progress is being made right

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:36.750
actual progress is being made right
 

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:37.970
actual progress is being made right
there in that moment yeah exactly and

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980
there in that moment yeah exactly and
 

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.800
there in that moment yeah exactly and
like not only are you listening to them

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:39.810
like not only are you listening to them
 

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:42.140
like not only are you listening to them
but like their their input is being like

you know like directly influencing so
it's not like pair designing in a way

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:45.930
it's not like pair designing in a way
 

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.140
it's not like pair designing in a way
sort of pair programming or if you do

don't you know say oh well I'm the
 

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.920
don't you know say oh well I'm the
designer or that's my opinion

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:09.930
designer or that's my opinion
 

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:11.720
designer or that's my opinion
yeah act like back it up with specific

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:11.730
yeah act like back it up with specific
 

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.430
yeah act like back it up with specific
design principles with like actual

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:16.830
needs to be that way it's tough because
 

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.770
needs to be that way it's tough because
you know some things are so very you

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:18.780
you know some things are so very you
 

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.240
you know some things are so very you
know subjective some things are just

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:20.250
know subjective some things are just
 

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.130

like I have this intuition I can't

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.140
like I have this intuition I can't
 

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.690
like I have this intuition I can't
explain it but definitely you know big

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.700
explain it but definitely you know big
 

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.490

yeah even if it feels often it's not

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:29.730
yeah even if it feels often it's not
 

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.250
yeah even if it feels often it's not
subjective like there is there are

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:31.260
subjective like there is there are
 

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.990
subjective like there is there are
actual reasons why something should

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000
actual reasons why something should
 

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.700
actual reasons why something should
should be a certain way you know

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:34.710
should be a certain way you know
 

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:36.500

design principles and like or even just

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:40.050
design principles and like or even just
 

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:42.260
design principles and like or even just
existing user studies if you even have

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:42.270
existing user studies if you even have
 

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:43.670
existing user studies if you even have
done a user study on it yourself there

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:43.680
done a user study on it yourself there
 

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.870
done a user study on it yourself there
are previous user studies so point to

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880
are previous user studies so point to
 

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.200
are previous user studies so point to
the same results that you can anticipate

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:47.210
the same results that you can anticipate
 

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:52.520
the same results that you can anticipate
so I that that's very important to sort

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:52.530
so I that that's very important to sort
 

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.630
so I that that's very important to sort
of make sure that you're you're sort of

you're your take on the design is kind

00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:58.740
you're your take on the design is kind
 

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.920
you're your take on the design is kind
of dripping in science because if it's

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:00.930

you could just you know continue

00:34:04.639 --> 00:34:04.649
you could just you know continue
 

00:34:04.649 --> 00:34:06.979
you could just you know continue
debating forever yet like engineers

00:34:06.979 --> 00:34:06.989
debating forever yet like engineers
 

00:34:06.989 --> 00:34:09.740
debating forever yet like engineers
don't debate oh I think it should crash

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:09.750
don't debate oh I think it should crash
 

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.299
don't debate oh I think it should crash
more you know all right you should be

00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:11.309
more you know all right you should be
 

00:34:11.309 --> 00:34:15.500
more you know all right you should be
slower and you know the design does have

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:15.510
slower and you know the design does have
 

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.480
slower and you know the design does have
these these fun about principles and

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:17.490
these these fun about principles and
 

00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:19.940
these these fun about principles and
various usability heuristics things that

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:19.950
various usability heuristics things that
 

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:21.200
various usability heuristics things that
we've learned through years of testing

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:21.210
we've learned through years of testing
 

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:22.970

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980
on how people are gonna behave what
 

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.430
on how people are gonna behave what
they're gonna focus on if they're going

you're having engine is creating this is

00:34:29.059 --> 00:34:29.069
you're having engine is creating this is
 

00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:30.289
you're having engine is creating this is
probably a good moment to say that you

00:34:30.289 --> 00:34:30.299
probably a good moment to say that you
 

00:34:30.299 --> 00:34:32.569
probably a good moment to say that you
know the design guidelines that we have

00:34:32.569 --> 00:34:32.579
know the design guidelines that we have
 

00:34:32.579 --> 00:34:33.529
know the design guidelines that we have
on developer the edge of the complex

00:34:33.529 --> 00:34:33.539
on developer the edge of the complex
 

00:34:33.539 --> 00:34:36.409
on developer the edge of the complex
design I mean a lot of that is is taking

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:36.419
design I mean a lot of that is is taking
 

00:34:36.419 --> 00:34:37.639
design I mean a lot of that is is taking
into account all these studies that

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:37.649
into account all these studies that
 

00:34:37.649 --> 00:34:39.230
into account all these studies that
we've done all these kind of things that

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240
we've done all these kind of things that
 

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.389
we've done all these kind of things that
we have that you guys have had in your

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399
we have that you guys have had in your
 

00:34:41.399 --> 00:34:42.859
we have that you guys have had in your
minds for a while and putting it down on

00:34:42.859 --> 00:34:42.869
minds for a while and putting it down on
 

00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:44.750

paper not necessarily you know saying

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760
paper not necessarily you know saying
 

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.250
paper not necessarily you know saying
that these are the only things you

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.260
that these are the only things you
 

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.109
that these are the only things you
should be doing but a lot of that is

00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:48.119
should be doing but a lot of that is
 

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:50.269
should be doing but a lot of that is
driven by these these heuristics is your

00:34:50.269 --> 00:34:50.279

guidance good plug just said that as

00:34:55.309 --> 00:34:55.319
guidance good plug just said that as
 

00:34:55.319 --> 00:34:57.410
guidance good plug just said that as
well so yeah let's let's move on to

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:57.420
well so yeah let's let's move on to
 

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.839
well so yeah let's let's move on to
questions quickly yeah and before we

00:34:59.839 --> 00:34:59.849
questions quickly yeah and before we
 

00:34:59.849 --> 00:35:01.009
questions quickly yeah and before we
move that's questions are running a

00:35:01.009 --> 00:35:01.019
move that's questions are running a
 

00:35:01.019 --> 00:35:02.900
move that's questions are running a
little low on time but I just wanted to

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:02.910
little low on time but I just wanted to
 

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:03.799
little low on time but I just wanted to
