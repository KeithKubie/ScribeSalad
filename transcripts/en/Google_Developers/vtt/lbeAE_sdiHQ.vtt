00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.700
JOHANNDU TOIT: So
welcome, everyone,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.620
to the long-awaited
second episode.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.890
So just real quick--
we're joined today

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.150
by a few Googlers and GDEs.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.750
So, first off, what are GDEs?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.350
It's the local-- there are four
or five of us in the chat room

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.780
right now.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.890
So it's local people
with local expertise

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.770
helping on some Google Techs.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.970
If you are using
it in your startup,

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.450
we're here to listen
and maybe help.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.350
So next up, the
actual show is-- we're

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.630
trying to keep it monthly,
and that's the second one.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.840
We're trying.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.450
And then we're
going to see if we

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.400
can make this downloadable
MP3s, so anyone can [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.590
listen to it if you can't
get to the video today.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.080
And the live
Hangouts-- so if you're

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.820
interested in
joining the Hangouts,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.830
maybe you have something
to share or something

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.560
to show at the end
of the show, we're

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.129
going to give you a form to sign
up, give feedback, and join us.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.957
So off to Hiren.

00:01:06.957 --> 00:01:08.040
HIREN PATEL: Hi, everyone.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.540
So to introduce the
panel here today for you,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.910
we have an invasion of Cloud
GDGs, Google Developer Experts.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.230
And they are Johanndu
Toit, sitting

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.880
next to me, Dale Humby--
who's sitting on the Hangout

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.820
if you want to just wave,
hi-- Kenneth Kinyanjui who

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.500
is sitting in Nairobi joining
us, and myself, Hiren Patel.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.350
We also have Mercy Orangi who
is the developer ecosystems

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.745
community manager for
sub-Saharan Africa Google,

00:01:40.745 --> 00:01:43.890
if you just want
to wave as well.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.100
So what are we
talking about today?

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.660
The theme for today is
WordPress on App Engine.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.840
WordPress is a really
popular web framework,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.500
and Google App Engine is
a highly scalable Platform

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.000
as a Service offered by Google.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.500
And we're talking
about combining

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.770
the two in running your
WordPress web application

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.780
on a highly scalable platform.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.789
So why is it a good
time to do this?

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.680
Well, one of the reasons is that
the PHP runtime for Google App

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.560
Engine has just become
generally available.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.550
And this means
it's deemed stable,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.500
completely supported, backed
by a service level agreement,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.660
and so on.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.710
It's a good time to use PHP in
general on Google App Engine.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.530
So a schedule for today
looks as follows--

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.620
we're going to have a
small [? bit ?] of notes

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.320
from our spotlight
speaker, who's Mercy.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.060
We're then going to have Kenneth
introduce the main topic for 10

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.190
minutes, talking about
building your WordPress

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.430
project on Google App Engine.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.710
We'll then have a Q&amp;A
session for five minutes.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.210
So if you have any questions,
please pop them into the Q&amp;A,

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.435
so we have enabled the
Q&amp;A app for the Hangout.

00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:01.060
If you're on the
Hangout on [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.850
you should see the
Q&amp;A app, and you

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.190
should be able to ask
your questions there.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.770
You can also ask your questions
on the Google+ [? Invent ?]

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.360
or this page, as well as the
Google+ Google Developers

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.060
Africa community.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.310
So post your questions
to these three mediums,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.460
and we will field
them and answer them

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.934
at the end of main session.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:24.350
And then we'll have a closing
and wrap-up for five minutes

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.740
or so.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.700
So to kick things off, I'm going
to hand over to our spotlight

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.090
speaker, Mercy.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.235
JOHANNDU TOIT: So we've got
Mercy on the channel, who

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:36.390
you might not recognize.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.000
I don't know if you've waved
yet, Mercy, to show you.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.570
MALE SPEAKER: Here we are.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.870
JOHANNDU TOIT: So Mercy-- so
elevator pitch, who are you?

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.745
Where are you based?

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:48.691
What are you doing?

00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:49.690
MERCY ORANGI: All right.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.810
So, first off, thanks very much
for having me on your show.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.050
It's a great
privilege, I must say.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.130
So my name is Mercy Orangi.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.190
I'm the developer ecosystems
committee manager,

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.180
in [INAUDIBLE],
sub-Saharan Africa,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.550
in our [INAUDIBLE] team
called the Developer

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.780
Relations at Google.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.470
So that's me.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.600
Previously, I was working at a
local insurance asset managers

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.360
bank.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.690
And I got to work on
various in-house systems,

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.010
in terms of development
and automation.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.300
And the greatest project
for me when I was there

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.540
was one that turned out to
[INAUDIBLE] into creating

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.210
the investments platform
with the National Integrated

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.040
[INAUDIBLE] Registration
System, a database that

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.800
is owned by the government.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.640
This got to cut the
processing overhead

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.670
by 18%, which was a really
cool thing for the bank.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.310
I also used to
manage and organize

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.580
activities for GDG Nairobi--
that's Google Developer Groups

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.850
Nairobi.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.250
So things to do with monthly
meet-ups, [INAUDIBLE],

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.140
outreach programs, like computer
science for high schools, etc.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.420
So that's on the GDG.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.660
So coming into Google,
this offered me

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.660
a platform to engage more
with developer communities

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.760
on activities and the whole
thing, in my role currently.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.375
So, yeah, that's me.

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:24.842
And thank you very
much for having me.

00:05:24.842 --> 00:05:25.800
JOHANNDU TOIT: Awesome.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.404
So at Google, you're currently
running the Launchpad programs,

00:05:31.404 --> 00:05:32.730
is that correct?

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.540
MERCY ORANGI: Yeah,
so that's true.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.980
My current focus is on
the Launchpad program.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.440
So this is Google's program
that we use to get in touch

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.150
and try and engage with
startups in the region.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.320
So, globally, but I handle
the regions of Saharan Africa.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.450
So start-ups get to apply and,
if accepted into the program,

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.770
then they get to
[INAUDIBLE] a few

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.240
of the benefits that you them.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.800
A few being-- a few of them,
an example being cloud credit.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.820
We have Firebase
also, currently,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.820
one-on-one testing and
time with our experts

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.670
to actually critique the apps.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.400
So there's a lot that
startups in the region

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.570
can leverage on once on
the Launchpad program.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.267
Yeah.

00:06:23.267 --> 00:06:24.225
JOHANNDU TOIT: Awesome.

00:06:24.225 --> 00:06:26.350
So anyone can join
from across Africa?

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.414
They can just go sign up?

00:06:27.414 --> 00:06:28.330
MERCY ORANGI: Exactly.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.400
So that's true.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.040
Anyone-- anyone,
strictly anyone can

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.650
apply, provided
you've got a startup,

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.610
and it's something that
you want to start or scale,

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.400
depending on whatever stage
you are in your startup.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.098
Anyone can apply and get
to leverage the benefits

00:06:45.098 --> 00:06:47.930
if accepted onto the program.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.430
So, if you want to apply, the
application is open online.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.950
Just search for
developers.google.com/startups--

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.828
that's the URL-- and you're
going to see a button where you

00:07:01.828 --> 00:07:03.906
can apply.

00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:05.780
JOHANNDU TOIT: We'll
get Mercy to post a link

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.230
to anyone that wants to apply.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.410
And so, Mercy, just last
things-- interesting events

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.944
we should look out for?

00:07:12.944 --> 00:07:13.870
What's happening?

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.911
MERCY ORANGI: Sure thing.

00:07:14.911 --> 00:07:18.270
So there's one that is
currently in the pipeline.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.360
This is GDS.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.480
In full, that's Google
Developer Summit.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.090
So they're doing the first
of its kind in the region.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.190
And it will be held in three
cities in the region-- that's

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:37.060
Lagos, Nairobi, and Cape Town.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.190
Being the first in the
region, we actually

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.025
have a lot of expectation
from developers.

00:07:43.025 --> 00:07:44.900
We'd like you to apply and come.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.160
It's a technical event
focused on lead developers,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.870
lead designers,
CTOs and the likes.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.450
So feel free to apply and
shortlisted candidates

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.760
will be contacted
in early August

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.710
to give them much
more in-depth info

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.180
about the-- about the summit.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.480
So for you to apply just go
online and search for Google

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.390
Developer Summit Sub-Saharan
Africa, you'll see the website.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:20.860
But, better yet, go to Google+,
search for Google Africa--

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.440
the page-- and you will
see a post that they made.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.450
And feel free to apply.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.910
JOHANNDU TOIT: Awesome,
thank you very much.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.929
We know you a bit better now.

00:08:30.929 --> 00:08:31.720
MERCY ORANGI: Sure.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.768
Thanks a lot for having me,
it's actually a pleasure.

00:08:34.768 --> 00:08:36.809
JOHANNDU TOIT: So now off
to our remaining topic.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:40.340
Kenneth, sitting next to
her, is going to teach us

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.460
how to build a schedule block.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.240
I'm interested.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.742
It's all yours, Kenneth.

00:08:45.742 --> 00:08:46.700
KENNETH KINYANJUI: Hey.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.410
Hey, Africa.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.480
So today I'm going
to show you how

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:56.290
to deploy Your WordPress
website on a Google App

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.070
Engine in steps.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:02.030
So, just to tell
you about WordPress,

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:07.730
it's actually a free and open
source CMS-based platform,

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.400
that's actually based
on a PHP in MySQL.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.010
The magic lies between--
in its plug-in architecture

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.410
and template system.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:24.940
So it's very easy for you to
spin up your WordPress site

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.530
in a matter of hours,
and deploy it online.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:33.220
So it's actually powering 23%
of the top 10 million websites

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.920
on the web.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.980
Today I'm going to show you why
Google App Engine and WordPress

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.390
should be friends, and
where-- how do they meet?

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:51.680
And why should you deploy
your WordPress on App Engine?

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.550
So App Engine is actually
Google's Platform as a Service.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.460
And it allows you to
run your WordPress site,

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.540
or your applications
that you build then

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.630
deploy on App Engine, or
Google's infrastructure.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.060
And one of the magics
in it, it actually

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.455
allows you to have
automatic scaling.

00:10:10.455 --> 00:10:15.770
You don't need to have
a server system admin.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.930
So Google App Engine handles
most of those sys admin

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.460
tasks for you.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.720
It's actually very easy to
integrate with other Google

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.840
Platform services that actually
enhance your application.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.990
So today-- this is
what we'll be building.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:35.145
This is a screenshot
of a WordPress site

00:10:35.145 --> 00:10:37.880
that's actually been deployed
on Google App Engine.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.540
In the next couple of
minutes I'll show you--

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.240
I'll be covering the following--

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.700
What do you actually require
to do the deployment?

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.270
How do you actually set up a
Google Cloud Platform Project?

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.045
Which config files
do you need to edit?

00:10:55.045 --> 00:10:56.632
How do you run it locally?

00:10:56.632 --> 00:10:58.590
And how do you actually
share it with the world

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.910
by putting it up on App Engine?

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.630
And I'll give you
tips and tricks.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.410
So let's start.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:10.790
Basically you need a PHP SDK
server for Google App Engine.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.670
You also need a
local MySQL server

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.220
on your local environment and
also on your host environment.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.210
So in this case on your host
environment you use Cloud SQL.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.595
You also need a Google
Cloud Platform account.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.520
So, setting up a project
on Google App Engine.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:35.250
So what you need to do is
just go to cloud.google.com.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.620
And you'll actually initially
sign in on your Google+.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.090
You'll actually see
a button where I've

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.540
circled right in my console.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.830
This should be your
friend, especially when

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.840
you're trying to deploy.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.790
So when you hit that guy,
you'll actually see a pop-up

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:56.130
where you can actually-- you'll
see the existing projects that

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.800
are there on your Google
Cloud Platform account.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.490
So you need to
"start a new project"

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.180
and when you start
a new project,

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.845
you'll give it a project name.

00:12:05.845 --> 00:12:11.390
So in this case we'll give
ours Wordpress iPhone 2000.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.110
You'll also need to
define the data center

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.625
where your app will live.

00:12:15.625 --> 00:12:21.060
In this case, since my app
is in Kenya, or in Africa,

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.270
but most of my
users are in-- are

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.220
coming from Kenya and
sub-Saharan Africa.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.000
So when [INAUDIBLE] data
center, [INAUDIBLE] make sense,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.670
it's actually the
European data center.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.840
So you actually go
to Advanced Options

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.860
and actually select the
European data center.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.740
So remember, everything
that you will create

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.710
will have to live
in this data center.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.480
So once you hit that
guy, you actually

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.030
see [INAUDIBLE] the process of
your instance being created.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:56.302
And that should show
that things are going OK.

00:12:56.302 --> 00:12:57.760
So after this
[INAUDIBLE], you need

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.990
to remember that was the
first thing, creating a cloud

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.100
platform account.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.320
So the next thing will be
downloading the Google App

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.230
Engine PHP SDK from the
Google Cloud platform.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.230
And then install--
download it and actually

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:16.310
follow the install instructions
just directly under that.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.120
So there are a couple
of tasks that we'll do

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.520
on the Cloud Platform account.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.440
We'll actually create Google
Cloud Storage buckets,

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.370
which is very important.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.050
We'll also create a
Cloud SQL instance,

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:33.230
and also download the WordPress
on Google App Engine Starter

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.940
Kit.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.560
So the first thing is actually
hitting the Compute option.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.532
And you'll actually see
App Engine, Compute Engine,

00:13:43.532 --> 00:13:44.490
and [INAUDIBLE] Engine.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.340
So we are very most
interested with App Engine.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:55.230
So after that, so you know that
you're dealing with App Engine,

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.930
you need to create a Google
Cloud Storage bucket.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:08.460
So App Engine has this--
it's a Platform as a Service,

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.480
so it doesn't allow
you to actually write

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.960
on its file system.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.560
So you'll actually need
to come up with a way

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.930
to upload your media files.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.240
So that's why we need a
Google Cloud Storage bucket.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.910
And we'll actually create one.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:29.560
So the process of creating
one, we'll give it a name.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.744
So in this case we'll
give it WordPress on GAE.

00:14:32.744 --> 00:14:34.660
And then we'll actually
go to Advanced Options

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.900
and give it-- we'll actually
put it in the data center

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.670
European Union,
because remember we

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:46.880
started-- we put our app engine
up on the European data center.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.270
The next thing will be
creating a Cloud SQL instance.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:54.334
So remember, one of the
requirements is a MySQL server,

00:14:54.334 --> 00:14:55.750
and when your app
is on the cloud,

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.210
we'll actually need an
online instance of MySQL

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.060
running-- supporting your app.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.970
So in this case,
we'll use Cloud SQL,

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.520
which is one of the services
that's offered on Google Cloud

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.110
Platform.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:12.560
So creating an instance is
very easy, but remember,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.810
your database name has to be
called-- your database instance

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.420
has to be called WordPress.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.550
So you'll actually give
it-- create a Cloud SQL

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:28.640
instance with your project ID
being WordPress and GAE_2000,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.320
and its instance
name is WordPress.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.800
And remember, the data
center has to be in Europe.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.980
So once you've created
a Cloud SQL instance,

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.120
this should show
up showing that you

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.536
have a successful
installation of setting up.

00:15:44.536 --> 00:15:46.742
Now, the next final
step will actually

00:15:46.742 --> 00:15:49.410
be, now that that step,
which is [INAUDIBLE],

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.200
is actually downloading
the Google App Engine PHP

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.210
starter project.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.140
So a couple of Googlers have
been maintaining this project

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.060
and making it up to
date, and making it easy

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.385
for you to deploy WordPress
sites on Google App Engine

00:16:01.385 --> 00:16:02.010
infrastructure.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.060
So once you download the-- once
you download your App Engine

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.990
files for your various
platforms, be it Mac,

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.250
be it Linux, or Windows,
we need to unzip the file.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.980
And once you unzip
the file, you'll

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:23.540
have a couple of
interesting, important files

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.000
that will show up.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.205
So one important app in
any App Engine application

00:16:28.205 --> 00:16:30.455
is the app.yaml
file, whic is used

00:16:30.455 --> 00:16:32.030
to configure the application.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:35.010
The next most important
file is actually

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.490
the wp-config file, which
is very key in configuring

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.104
your WordPress instance.

00:16:40.104 --> 00:16:41.520
So in this case,
we're configuring

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.370
two GAEs, Wordpress,
and Google App Engine.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.895
So you need to edit
these config files.

00:16:47.895 --> 00:16:49.635
And the first one,
as you mentioned,

00:16:49.635 --> 00:16:54.250
will be the WordPress
config file, wp-config.php.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.310
And you'll be
interested in two GAEs.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.550
So you'll be interested
in the first GAE

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.320
being the local environment
and the local app engine cloud

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:02.820
environment.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:08.050
So there are two arrows, and the
first arrow shows a Cloud SQL,

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:12.105
and you have to replace
your project ID there.

00:17:12.105 --> 00:17:15.490
And you'll also-- the second
one actually configures

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:20.859
your local [INAUDIBLE] with
your root password and the MySQL

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:23.550
root password.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.970
So if you do it
successfully, so you

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:32.520
should have Cloud SQL,
WordPress-2000, and WordPress.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.270
So this shows you
that you have already

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:39.441
configured your wp-config file
to notice your app engine app

00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:39.940
instance.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.060
The next thing will be to
configure your app.yaml file.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.210
And you need to change
your project ID.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.000
So the reason for
this is when you're

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.720
deploying your app on
the Google App Engine,

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.180
and you're pushing it
from local to the cloud,

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.683
this is the part that
the app engine will

00:18:00.683 --> 00:18:03.020
look for and actually
configure your project.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.280
So you need to replace
that with your project ID.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.980
And once you do that, you have
[INAUDIBLE] and your project

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.350
ID is now WordPress GAE 2000.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.285
So the first thing--
the most important thing

00:18:15.285 --> 00:18:18.100
now is running your
WordPress locally.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.410
You need to know, is it working?

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:25.280
And so in the
beginning I told you

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.910
about starting a-- creating
a WordPress database.

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:34.090
So you'll go to MySQL and
create a Wordpress-- you create

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.150
a database named WordPress_db.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:42.220
So this goes into
your local storage,

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:50.940
and actually matches
to your App Engine app.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:55.740
So if you want to run your
app on Mac or Windows,

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.180
you can use the terminal
or use the launcher.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.930
So another important
thing to note

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.055
is that on Mac and
Windows, the SDK comes

00:19:03.055 --> 00:19:05.380
with its PHP binaries bundled.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.630
And just running the app is
just a push of a button away.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.270
So you just need
to run [INAUDIBLE],

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:20.350
and you need your WordPress
on GAE 2000 directory.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.930
So-- but if it's
on Linux, since you

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.660
have to use your
own PHP binaries,

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.270
I actually prefer to copy
a script that's there.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:31.660
So we give-- you do as you
do it on Mac or Windows,

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.070
and you actually give it the
next couple of-- the location

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:39.710
to where your PHP binaries
are installed in your system.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:43.390
So once you do that, you should
actually run App Engine locally

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.920
and install the PHP-- and
install [INAUDIBLE] show up,

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.340
and you'll now be able to
install-- work with WordPress

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.350
and your App Engine locally.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.400
So the most important
thing now is

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.160
you have App Engine running
locally in the local machine,

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.450
but it doesn't make
sense if you're

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.920
uploading on your laptop.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.920
So you need to push it online.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.820
So we need to deploy it.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.895
And deploying is very
easy on Google App Engine.

00:20:10.895 --> 00:20:12.656
It's just a button away.

00:20:12.656 --> 00:20:17.640
So you actually-- now,
remember we set up our project.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:24.890
So actually now, we do not use
[INAUDIBLE] the [INAUDIBLE],

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.390
and then give a command
update, and give your WordPress

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.000
on GAE 2000 update.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.977
And once you give
that command, it

00:20:34.977 --> 00:20:38.910
should actually trigger
a deployment command

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:43.280
and start deploying
the app automatically.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.190
So just like you did
on your local database,

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:53.840
you'll need to also set up your
WordPress_db inside your Cloud

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.660
SQL.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:02.486
So to do that easily, you just
run Google_SQL.pui and give it

00:21:02.486 --> 00:21:05.190
your Cloud SQL instance.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:09.720
So in this case, we'll give
it WordPress on GAE-2000,

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.890
and then the name of-- the
exact name of WordPress.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:16.210
So giving it that actually
automatically triggers

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.900
an [INAUDIBLE]
authentication [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.950
So naturally it will
direct you to your browser,

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:26.870
and when you accept, you'll be
able to access your Cloud SQL

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:27.670
instance.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.590
So you'll actually be
[INAUDIBLE] in that,

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:33.830
and you'll actually now create
a database, WordPress_db.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.850
So that's the most
important-- that's

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:39.060
what App Engine will be
looking for in WordPress.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.120
It'll look for that database.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.630
So now, as you did
it locally, if you

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.760
go to your project
ID [INAUDIBLE],

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.220
our [INAUDIBLE] will be hit by
this URL, which will actually

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:57.410
trigger it to install
WordPress in your instance.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:01.765
So once you install your app,
you'll actually create a user,

00:22:01.765 --> 00:22:05.410
and in this case, you
go to your WP admin,

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:06.976
and do a couple
of configurations

00:22:06.976 --> 00:22:09.040
that are really important.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.320
So you need to
activate a plug-in.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.010
You need to configure
emails, and also

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.030
remember you need to hook
up your Google Cloud Storage

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.140
buckets.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.830
So a couple of
plug-ins that are just

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.390
[INAUDIBLE] in the starter
kit that you will see,

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:29.490
is one, the batch manager, and
the other one is the Google App

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.860
Engine for WordPress plug-in.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:36.970
So you have to activate
these two plug-ins.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:40.670
The second now important thing
is configuring your email,

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:45.010
and also hooking up WordPress
to your Cloud Storage bucket.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.310
So you actually see
these couple of settings.

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.180
If you go to Settings,
you'll actually

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.590
see an App Engine option.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.605
And now you put the
App Engine email

00:22:53.605 --> 00:22:56.520
that you want any
notification to come to.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.880
So this really--
any notification

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.057
that affects your App Engine
app, which email do you

00:23:04.057 --> 00:23:04.765
want it to go to?

00:23:04.765 --> 00:23:07.530
This is usually the person
maintaining this application.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.450
And the bucket name.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.930
Remember we created
an instance, so we

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.650
created a bucket name
called WordPress on GAE.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:15.400
So remember, this thing
is very important,

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.480
and you need to put it there.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.630
Yeah.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.490
So actually, that's it.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.875
If you do that,
oh my God, you'll

00:23:23.875 --> 00:23:27.635
have a new world hitting
you on your screen

00:23:27.635 --> 00:23:31.370
and you'll have successfully
deployed your WordPress

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.710
on Google App Engine.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.030
There are a couple
of tricks and tips

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.050
that you actually
need to know if you're

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:43.900
doing this on a very big,
robust WordPress site.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.190
Remember, you need to change
update themes and plug-ins,

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.220
because that's the
magic of WordPress.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.917
And the beauty about
this is you have

00:23:51.917 --> 00:23:53.819
to maintain a local
version of the app

00:23:53.819 --> 00:23:56.110
so that you'll be able to
maintain themes and plug-ins.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:59.170
The reason because of
this is because remember,

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.700
you cannot upload onto Google
App Engine's file system.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.230
So you can upload
to your file system

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:06.680
and then do a redeployment.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.595
So each time you do
a version, and you

00:24:09.595 --> 00:24:13.290
want to reinstall a new theme,
you just install it locally

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.570
and then do a redeployment.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.840
And also to update
a theme, you do--

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.390
reinstall the theme
or the plug-in locally

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:21.930
and then do a redeployment.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:26.230
So in that case, you won't
have to-- you'll actually

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:33.130
be able to have these plug-ins
and themes on your WordPress

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.120
instance only.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.020
I think that's it.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.140
Thank you very much.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:37.985
Back to you, Johan.

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:43.620
HIREN PATEL: Cool.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.210
Thanks Kenneth.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.376
Thanks for that walkthrough.

00:24:45.376 --> 00:24:46.790
It was quite interesting.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.570
JOHANNDU TOIT: Thank you.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.160
HIREN PATEL: So we're looking
at a couple of questions

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.310
in the Q&amp;A session.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.385
Again, if you have questions
and you're watching this online,

00:24:56.385 --> 00:24:58.320
just pop them in for us.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.940
I'll start it out
with one question.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:04.310
So a lot of developers that
deploy their stacks on PHP

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:09.120
frameworks like the freedom
to edit their php.ini

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.695
config so that they can
control their runtime better.

00:25:11.695 --> 00:25:13.800
App Engine is a
Platform as a Service,

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.515
but does it offer the ability
to change the runtime using

00:25:18.515 --> 00:25:21.440
php.ini as well?

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.490
KENNETH KINYANJUI:
So it actually works

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:24.890
in the same concept.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:31.110
Remember where I mentioned that
to update a theme or a plug-in,

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:36.380
we need to not do it online
but actually do it locally.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.910
So you actually have
the php.ini file

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:43.610
that's actually stored locally
within your-- in the startup

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:44.490
kit.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:48.730
So let's say you want to control
the limit of applications--

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:53.530
the size of files that
you want to upload.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:57.736
You can go to your php.ini file,
edit it, and actually upload

00:25:57.736 --> 00:25:58.530
it.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.720
But if you want
to configure more

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.150
intricacies of the
runtime, you'll

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.070
not focus on the php.ini file.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.780
What you'd actually
be dealing with mostly

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.060
is the app.yatml file,
which actually configures

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.992
your runtime for App Engine.

00:26:16.147 --> 00:26:17.230
HIREN PATEL: Cool, thanks.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.980
That makes sense.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.610
The next question is, so
within the developer's console

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.180
on the Google Cloud
platform, I've

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.870
seen the Google
Cloud [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:27.910
launch for WordPress.

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:32.050
What is the difference
between that and this?

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:34.660
KENNETH KINYANJUI: So
remember how I told you

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:40.500
that sometimes some
developers want to control how

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.020
their architecture is running?

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.770
It's just sometimes
easier to-- some people

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.632
choose the option of either
launching in the launcher,

00:26:50.632 --> 00:26:52.090
but you don't
actually have control

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:55.020
and you don't know what's
happening in the background.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.960
So some people like to get
their hands dirty sometimes

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.150
and get to know the whole
process so that if anything

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.120
comes about, they
are going to fix it,

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.560
because they are the ones
who did the deployment.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:11.800
But once you have that launcher,
for example, let's say I need

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.430
[INAUDIBLE] and you didn't
know where to start,

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:20.400
so you have to, you know, find
maybe someone who's an expert

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.480
and actually come
and debug it for you.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.170
But if you actually
did it on your own,

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:27.120
you actually know
how to manage it.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.480
So it's either you can
[INAUDIBLE] either of the two.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.000
Depends on the use case.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.520
HIREN PATEL: Cool, thanks a lot.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.950
So we have a question from
someone on the Hangout On Air.

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:49.334
Being a developer, I am fond of
J-E-K-Y-L-L. I'm not too sure.

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:50.250
JOHANNDU TOIT: Jekyll.

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.083
HIREN PATEL: Jekyll.

00:27:51.083 --> 00:27:52.200
It's this framework.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:56.080
Can you deploy Jekyll
to Google App Engine?

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.670
KENNETH KINYANJUI:
Oh, Gentoo, Gentoo.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:58.470
Does he mean Gentoo?

00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.178
G-E-N-double-T-O?

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.240
JOHANNDU TOIT: If I can
pop something in here.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.690
Jekyll, if I remember correctly,
is a static site generator.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:10.125
KENNETH KINYANJUI: Oh, Jekyll.

00:28:10.125 --> 00:28:11.500
JOHANNDU TOIT:
Probably be better

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.354
to pop that on Cloud Storage
instead of App Engine.

00:28:15.354 --> 00:28:19.710
[INAUDIBLE] and discuss, and
we'll send it out to Community

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.220
and let them know how to do it.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.780
KENNETH KINYANJUI: Yeah.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:29.160
I think it's actually possible
to deploy Jekyll on Google App

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.010
Engine, but it actually-- it
will be better to do it-- no,

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:38.370
no-- since it's--
depending on-- OK.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.615
That's a bit tricky.

00:28:39.615 --> 00:28:44.025
We can actually debate on that.

00:28:44.025 --> 00:28:47.950
But I do know that's you can
deploy a static site on Google

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:52.895
App Engine just using Python,
[INAUDIBLE] having the Python

00:28:52.895 --> 00:28:53.805
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:53.805 --> 00:28:56.280
But I think Jekyll runs
in [INAUDIBLE], so I'm not

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.440
really sure on that.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.746
But you know, it's
something that you

00:29:00.746 --> 00:29:02.326
can debate on the Community.

00:29:06.118 --> 00:29:07.444
HIREN PATEL: Cool.

00:29:07.444 --> 00:29:09.360
JOHANNDU TOIT: We've got
a few more questions,

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.870
but we're running
out of time a bit,

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:14.522
so we're going to have to cut
it a little bit short there.

00:29:14.522 --> 00:29:18.730
But Kenneth is in the G+
community, so ping him.

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.600
Tell him what does work
and what doesn't work,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.300
and please post what you find.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.990
So just thank you for tuning in.

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:28.585
You might know or
not know there's

00:29:28.585 --> 00:29:33.500
a Google Developers Africa
group that you can go join.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.660
And we post all these updates,
all the status updates,

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.310
all that sort of thing.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:41.336
And then we'll be
posting feedback links

00:29:41.336 --> 00:29:42.710
so you can give
us some feedback,

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:43.710
either from [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.780
