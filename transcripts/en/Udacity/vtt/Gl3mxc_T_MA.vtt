00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.760
Although you guys were arguing a lot earlier, it

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.430
really did seem that your ideas compliment one another in

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.320
a way that gives us a global perspective on how

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.140
traits exist and are passed down from generation to generation.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like Mendel. Your theory does a

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.290
really good job of explaining how traits skip generations.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.480
&gt;&gt; And, Skinner, I guess you do have a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.970
handle on understanding how the environment affects various traits. And

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.800
I suppose you guys did a pretty good job

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.850
of explaining the biological components. But, I bet the genome

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.240
has still many more secrets, that we don't even know.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.460
&gt;&gt; Based on the fabulous work you guys did along with many others,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.860
we knew what the hereditary material did, before we even knew what it was.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.460
&gt;&gt; Although DNA, the hereditary material, was first isolated

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.600
in 1869 It's exact nature was a mystery until 1953 when work

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.350
by Rosalyn Franklin, Maurice Wilkins, James Watson, and Francis Crick

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.370
revealed the structure, and began to unravel the secretes of

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.370
how DNA codes for many of our traits. And we've

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.830
come a long way since then as well. We've learned

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.200
how DNA makes up our genomes and codes for many

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.410
of our traits. And technology's advancing at an ever-increasing pace,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.990
allowing people to obtain personal information about their very own

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.060
DNA. We're in an unique age of genomic information, and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.490
this course is going to give you an introductory look

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.290
at how you can use this information.
