00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.850
We're asked to subtract.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.710
And we have the complex
number 2 minus 3i.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.420
And from that, we are
subtracting 6 minus 18i.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.070
So the first thing
I'd like to do here

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.620
is to just get rid
of these parentheses.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.379
So we just have a bunch of
real parts and imaginary parts

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.150
that we can then
add up together.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.140
So we have 2 minus 3i.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.590
And then we're subtracting
this entire quantity.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.020
And to get rid of
the parentheses,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.960
we can just distribute
the negative sign.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.334
Or another way to
think about it,

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:31.097
we can say that this is
negative 1 times all of this.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.930
So we can just distribute
the negative sign.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.470
And negative 1 times
6 is negative 6.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.470
Let me do these in magenta.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.340
So this is negative 6.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.290
And then negative 1 times
negative 18i-- well, that's

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.260
just going to be positive 18i.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.010
Negative times a
negative is a positive.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.740
And now we want to
add the real parts,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.300
and we want to add
the imaginary parts.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.630
So here's a real part here, 2.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.360
And then we have a minus 6.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.260
So we have 2 minus 6.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.460
And we want to add
the imaginary parts.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.019
We have a negative.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.570
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.370
We have a negative
3i right over here.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.550
So negative 3i, or minus
3i right over there.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.120
And then we have a plus
18i or positive 18i.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.950
If you add the real parts,
2 minus 6 is negative 4.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.320
And you add the imaginary parts.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.160
If I have negative
3 of something

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.367
and to that I add
18 of something,

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:33.950
well, that's just going to leave
me with 15 of that something.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.860
Or another way you
could think about it,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.060
if I have 18 of something and
I subtract 3 of that something,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.850
I'll have 15 of that something.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.620
And in this case, the something
is i, is the imaginary unit.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.700
So this is going to be plus 15i.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.140
And we are done.
