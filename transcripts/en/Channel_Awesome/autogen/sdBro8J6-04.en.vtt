enjoyable summer blockbuster and this
one<00:26:00.790><c> I</c><00:26:00.970><c> think</c><00:26:01.330><c> is</c><00:26:01.630><c> the</c><00:26:01.810><c> same</c><00:26:02.020><c> except</c><00:26:02.410><c> we</c>

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:02.500 align:start position:0%
one I think is the same except we
 

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
one I think is the same except we
actually<00:26:02.740><c> get</c><00:26:02.860><c> a</c><00:26:02.890><c> little</c><00:26:03.100><c> bit</c><00:26:03.220><c> more</c><00:26:03.430><c> character</c>

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:03.790 align:start position:0%
actually get a little bit more character
 

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.370 align:start position:0%
actually get a little bit more character
which<00:26:04.060><c> i</c><00:26:04.180><c> think</c><00:26:04.240><c> is</c><00:26:04.510><c> even</c><00:26:04.810><c> better</c>

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:05.380 align:start position:0%
which i think is even better
 

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.370 align:start position:0%
which i think is even better
so<00:26:06.010><c> yeah</c><00:26:06.610><c> but</c><00:26:06.880><c> I</c><00:26:07.060><c> would</c><00:26:07.390><c> say</c><00:26:07.570><c> see</c><00:26:07.630><c> it</c><00:26:07.960><c> if</c><00:26:08.200><c> you</c>
