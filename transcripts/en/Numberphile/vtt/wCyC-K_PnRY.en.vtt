ROB EASTAWAY: "Jurassic Park,"
we've all seen the film, but

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.350
very few people have read
the book, including me.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.440
I've not actually read the book,
but I have looked at the

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.720
pictures because there's
something in there that is

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.110
just kind of really weird, a
little pattern, a beautiful

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.810
pattern that's very
little known.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.130
So I just wanted to
share it with you.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.330
So we're going to get
to it just by--

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.940
I've just got a random
piece of paper here.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.550
It happens to be brown.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.110
We're just going to fold this
bit of paper in half.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.520
So I fold it like this, crease
it, and you've kind of got a

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.920
seagull there.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.670
And if it forms a
V, of course.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.320
I mean, nothing surprising
so far.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.430
I'm going to be consistent
here.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.290
So I'm folding that which is
your left over right, and I'm

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.460
going to do it again.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.430
So fold it again, left over
right, and crease it.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.200
And if I sort of pull it apart
now, OK, so we've got, reading

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.270
left to right, can you see
there's a sort of peak, then

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.080
there's a valley, then
there's a valley.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.050
So we'll call this peak,
valley, valley, OK?

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.580
Or and remember this for later,
if I sort of close it

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.850
up a bit, it's a sauce
spoon, OK?

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.815
So I fold it over once,
and I fold it twice,

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:15.220
and I fold over again.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.260
Now, can you predict what the
pattern is going to be of

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.950
valleys and peaks?

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.970
Now, you'd probably think that
something as repetitive as

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.600
this is going to be some really
obvious pattern, and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.800
it's either going to alternate,
maybe valley-peak,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.420
valley-peak.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.640
Or you might think--

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.830
I to know-- it's going
to create a little--

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.040
obvious little zigzaggy
kind of pattern.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.270
But that's not the case.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.020
If I pull it out, it goes
peak-peak; valley-valley;

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.460
peak; valley-valley.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.490
So what's the pattern here?

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.540
And indeed, can you predict
what's going to happen when I

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.730
fold it for a fourth time?

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.560
So we do one, and two, and
three, and fold it a fourth

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.270
time, and unfurl it.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.200
Well, it's kind of good to try
and predict before you see it,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.220
but here we go.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.820
And now we've got peak-peak;
valley; peak-peak;

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.990
valley-valley-valley; peak-peak;
valley-valley;

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.370
peak; valley-valley.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.460
It's kind of--

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.790
if not random, it's certainly
not a really

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.360
obvious and easy pattern.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.030
And if just start closing this
up, and you turn these into

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.980
right angles, you can see that
what's emerging is something--

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.600
well, something that's clearly
not trivial, but it's

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.870
certainly not clear
what's going on.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.900
And this is where we turn
to the book, OK?

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.320
Could you get yourself your nice
cheap copy or brand new

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.030
copy of "Jurassic Park,"
and you turn to

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.950
page whatever it is.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.920
And you have this page which
says "first iteration," and

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.650
you've got this pattern.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.240
So this is actually what you get
when you fold our strip of

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.870
paper four times.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.680
So if you call a fold an
iteration, really you should

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.800
be calling this the
fourth iteration.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.290
I don't know why it's
the first iteration

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.820
in here, but anyway.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.630
The second question, of course,
is what is it doing in

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.200
"Jurassic Park?" And there's a
little cryptic reference at

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.620
the bottom of the page by
Ian Malcolm who's the

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.010
mathematician who features
in this story.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.770
"At the earliest drawings of the
fractal curve, few clues

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.510
to the underlying mathematical
structure will be seen."

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.710
So he talked about a fractal.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.200
So this is going to turn into
a fractal of some kind.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.820
Can you picture what that
fractal will be?

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.490
I certainly can't, not without
having seen it first.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.780
If we keep folding our paper,
which we're not going to do

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.080
because there's a limit to how
many times even with a long

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.730
strip of paper you
can fold it.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.300
Another fold, what's called
a second iteration here,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.040
produces this pattern,
which is--

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.050
I guess that what's kind of
interesting is, without

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.215
crossing over itself, it joins
and forms this little block,

00:03:57.215 --> 00:04:00.130
this little rectangle and
another square there.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.350
I think the reason why there are
fractals appearing in here

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.860
is that there's a sort
of theme about the

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.470
unpredictability of systems and
chaos, and the fact that

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.380
we've set up Jurassic Park, and
all these creatures are

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.829
going to behave in
a certain way.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.120
And here's this doom-monger
saying it could all go

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.600
horribly wrong because what we
think is predictable could

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.720
turn out to be chaotic
and so on.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.820
So that's the metaphor, I think,
that's being used.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.640
So if I keep folding
the paper, I

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.760
get the third iteration.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.920
It's getting a bit more
involved, but it's still hard

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.880
to see any pattern emerging
from this.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.150
And we go quite a lot of pages
further before we get to

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.620
what's called the fourth
iteration.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.040
Actually, there's been a few
more folds here, so the

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.780
numbers at the top are kind
of going out the window.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.320
But now we've got this big block
just from folding the

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.580
paper right over left,
and we zip ahead

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.840
to the fifth iteration.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.110
Well, now you've got these kind
of blocks appearing, and

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.010
they're a bit like lizards.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.160
I don't think that's a
deliberate reference to

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.010
Jurassic Park or anything, but
there's some things which are

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.940
almost animal-like
about this thing.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.810
And you keep going to what's
called the sixth iteration.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.630
There are lots--

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.160
way more than you can
fold a bit of paper.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.160
You get this rather stunning
pattern emerging.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.950
And in fact, what you'll find
is that each of these, the

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.900
main shape in the center, has
been then rotated and rotated.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.980
And typically, they're being
rotated by 45 degrees, and the

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.080
dimensions are being reduced
by the square

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.430
root of 2 each time.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.300
Why folding a piece of paper
could lead to something as

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.323
stunning as this is just--

00:05:41.323 --> 00:05:42.760
you know, it's mind blowing.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.550
We've all seen fractals.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.030
There's lots of fractals
that are famous.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.410
This one, which is so easy
to produce, is actually

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.470
remarkably little known despite
featuring in "Jurassic

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.100
Park."

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.240
And we go all the way to the
end, an infinite number of

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.710
folds of paper.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.260
We get what's called here the
seventh iteration, this

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.970
beautiful solid block.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.210
And even more stunning is the
fact you can picture sticking

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.950
another of these curves in.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.000
They would sort of fit together
like jigsaw pieces.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.285
You can see another dragon
curve outlined here.

00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:15.090
So if you imagine you've got a
black one and a blue one and a

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.210
yellow one, you could actually
stick them together to make a

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.110
really cool kitchen
floor tiling.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.410
It would be a bit hard to do.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.245
But to produce something like
this, I don't think anyone

00:06:23.245 --> 00:06:24.210
would predict that.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.140
BRADY HARAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.570
ROB EASTAWAY: Mm.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.240
I love it.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.710
And I love the fact that the
whole world knows about

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.760
fractals, but whenever I show
a group of people the dragon

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.950
curve, they say I've never
seen this before.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.060
And who would have thought
that you could

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.260
get to it so simply.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:47.100
[DINOSAUR ROARS]

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.700
ROB EASTAWAY: I think
he likes it.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.800
BRADY HARAN: If there are many
sides, then the angles become

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.200
too shallow so that the
next one would only

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.990
have a little bit.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.810
I'm going to put in another
polygon out here and match

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.800
that one there.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.840
I'd end up with only a little
sliver under there.
