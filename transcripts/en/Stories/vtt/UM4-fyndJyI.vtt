00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:02.120
INTERVIEWER: This
is a satellite image

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.420
of Porong, Indonesia in 2004.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.830
This is that same place in 2008.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.730
What happened in
between those two photos

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.380
wasn't an earthquake
or a typhoon.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.860
It was one of the most
mysterious natural disasters

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.340
in memory, and actually it might
not have been natural at all.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.940
On May 29, 2006, vast
quantities of mud

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.930
began bubbling up out of a
gas and oil field in Porong.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.940
The flow blossomed
into a full on mud

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.160
volcano, which is actually
a scientific term.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.560
It might not sound as scary
as a volcano spewing lava,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.850
but the mud spread quickly
and disastrously, completely

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.790
overwhelming 12
separate villages

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.190
in the area and displacing
ten of thousands of people.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.820
Now there are few
very important things

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.680
to say about this event, which
is called the Lapindo Mud

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.990
Flow, or Lusi for short.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.310
Firstly, it's the largest
mud volcano in the world.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.340
At its peak output, Lusi
exuded 180,000 cubic meters

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.260
of mud every day, which
is enough to fill about

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.010
75 Olympic swimming pools.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.550
Secondly, it's still very
much active, almost 10 years

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.350
after the first eruption.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.880
No one knows how long the
mud will keep flowing,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.930
but many experts predict
another two decades worth.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.760
Faced with that prognosis,
locals in the area

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.330
are doing their best
to live alongside Lusi.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.780
They've built levees to keep
the mud out of populated areas.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.710
And with few other industries
available for work,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.530
some have turned to
a form of tourism.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.110
It's not huge business,
but lots of Indonesians

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.320
are curious to see
firsthand what they'd

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.976
heard about in the media.

00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:40.850
[SPEAKING INDONESIAN]

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.090
INTERPRETER: I had watched a
lot of the news on television,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.320
but I didn't expect that
seeing it with my own eyes

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.020
could give such a different
impression, as I imagine

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.270
about 13 villages underneath
the mud, and it stills bursting.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.190
If this is called terrorism, I
suppose this is tragic tourism.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.690
INTERVIEWER: There's one other
thing about the Lusi disaster

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.850
that still has
people up in arms.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.440
No one's quite sure whether
people are to blame for it.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.960
Two days before the eruption,
a 6.3 magnitude earthquake

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.580
struck the region,
and initially experts

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.530
believed that to be the
trigger for the mud flow.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.420
But other studies
have since argued

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.060
that the blame lies with
the oil and gas drilling

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.990
at the site of the eruption.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.190
Courts in Indonesia have ruled
that the gas company, Lapindo

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.810
Brantas, was not at fault,
though the company has still

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.270
paid out millions in
compensation to the community.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.720
They've also tried and failed
to plug up the mud flow.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.230
One exasperated engineer
describe the volcano

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.330
as being simply
impossible to kill.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.140
Today, nine years later,
the mud is still flowing.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.920
The people of Porong
haven't forgotten

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.010
the loss of their villages,
nor the possible involvement

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.240
of Lapindo Brantas.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.450
They've staged some
protests in commemoration

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.480
at the site of the
accident, and they've

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.640
erected some permanent art
installations there too.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.470
One represents those
displaced by the mud,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.400
and another, more pointedly,
features an effigy

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.900
of the mining companies
owner, alongside a stone tomb,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.310
bearing the words let
this nation not forget.

00:03:13.306 --> 00:03:14.640
Hey everyone.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.480
If you're looking
for secret stories,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.090
check out this next episode
about a town in Russia

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.850
that the government kept hidden
from the world for years.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.220
It's been more than two decades
since the Soviet era ended.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.760
Russia and its people
have moved on--

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.120
well, except for
towns like this.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.940
SUBJECT: Zarechny.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.420
It's former name was Penza-19.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.740
INTERVIEWER: And as always,
don't forget to subscribe.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.430
Thanks for watching.
