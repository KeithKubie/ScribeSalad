- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:
bipedal, naked, large-brained. Long the

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.650
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:48.630
Aware that death is inevitable yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:56.130
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:03.510
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.330

we got here. An exploration made possible

- [William] Good afternoon everyone and
thank you to the organizers here of CARTA

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.380
for inviting me to participate and thank
all of you, a great crowd, for coming out

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.640
to see this fascinating topic explored. I
tend sometimes to be accused of nihilism

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.420
with regard to the origin of Homo because
my view is we actually know nothing about

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:37.690
the origin of Homo, just saying. And the
reason is simple in my view; is that while

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.050
it is true that we have a pretty good
fossil record of the genus Homo, the Homo

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.760
lineage as Bernard just finished
explaining, by around 2 million years ago

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:57.570
with some diversity and different adaptive
packages in different species: erectus,

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:06.420
habilis, rudolfensis. On the assumption
that these three forms shared a common

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.800
ancestor at some point. That common
ancestor lived older than 2 million years

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.600
ago in a period of time in which we have
not a fender and a tire and a piece of

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:28.590
gear shift, but in which we have a
fragment of tire thread, which we have a

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:36.200
fragment of a headlight. And we are trying
to reconstruct an evolutionary history of

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:45.510
a group for which we basically have a car
wreck. And this is what we have to solve,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.020
this is the problem we have to solve and
this comes from field work and I'm going

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.030
to illustrate for you today in my view
where I think the genus, the Homo lineage

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.510
arose and where we have to re-double our
efforts for increasing the representation

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:10.370
of this lineage older than 2 million years
ago. Now, as Bernard ably suggested, the

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.490
modern history of the study of the
evolution of the genus Homo really begins

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:23.020
with Louis Leakey and colleagues and the
recognition of the species, Homo habilis

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.940
in 1964 based on material from Bed I in
Olduvai Gorge dated to between around 1.7

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.130
and 1.75 million years, they discerned in
the type specimen of the species older by

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.690
Hominid VII what they thought was a
human-like dexterous ability in the hands,

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.490
they discerned a notable increase in
endocranial volume, brain size, in

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:51.380
relation to then known Australopithecus
species, mostly from southern Africa and a

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.250
reduction in tooth size which they saw as
emblematic of an overall gracilization of

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.000
the chewing apparatus in almost a
human-like arrangement. And putting these

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.840
three characteristics together with the
plentiful stone tools that had been

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.340
recovered for years in these sediments,
they arrived at the conclusion that this

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:19.350
species, habilis, belonged near the base
of the genus Homo. So convinced were they

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.970
of this conclusion that Philip Tobias, one
the co-authors of the species, was able to

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.660
write in 1965 that Homo habilis
represented that last remaining major gap

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.910
in the pleistocene evolution of the genus
Homo, "of the story of human evolution, "

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.760
to quote him directly. And in this
phylogeny shown here from one of Tobias'

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:45.670
papers, you can see the genus Homo is
represented as a single, gradually

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:54.420
evolving line characterized by uniquely
human characteristics related to large

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:01.130
brain size, reduced canine teeth, a
perfection of bipedal locomotion as we now

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:07.160
see it, a slowing down of the growth
trajectory, technology, language and so

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.060
forth. This was a package of
characteristics seen in modern humans and

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:20.200
thought to go back in time to at least 2
million years as an integrated whole,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.190
along this slowly emerging lineage
culminating in Homo sapiens. The problem

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.270
was of course is that older than 2
millions years ago, there was virtually no

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:38.360
fossil record that could be confidently
associated uniquely with our lineage. And

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.270
so whether these characteristics emerged
piecemeal, step-wise and therefore each

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.820
demanding a separate explanation for
origin, or whether they emerged as a

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:54.110
package together, where one explanation
would take care of them all, could not be

00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:00.310
discerned. Now a lot has happened, as
Bernard has pointed out in the years since

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:06.650
early 1960s. And beginning in the 1980s,
in large part due to the work that he and

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.140
others have done in those years, we now
see the genus Homo as a much more

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:20.950
complicated array of species. In my view,
there are at least three broadly

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:27.750
contemporaneous forms present at around 2
million years ago whereas in 1964, the

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:33.740
Leakeys would have said there's one in the
genus Homo: Homo rudolfensis, Homo habilis

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:39.650
and Homo erectus. And one of the lessons
that we have learned from the appreciation

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.140
of greater diversity in our own genus at
this period of time, is the idea that

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.130
there is not one adaptive package that can
describe them all, but there are perhaps

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:55.870
multiple ones. And the question is which,
if any, are germane to the origin of the

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:01.620
lineage itself? Or, are they all, in one
form or another, subsequent developments

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:08.500
to the establishment of the lineage?
Following on Bernard's talking about

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:15.610
Toyotas and clades, my appreciation, my
rendering of the information available

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:22.880
from these three forms between around 1.7
and 2 million years ago is that they do,

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.700
in fact, constitute a monophyletic group.
This is not the place to go into a

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.200
detailed rendition about the evidence for
it, but I think it speaks fairly clearly

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.200
to the idea that these three at 2 million
did in fact share a single unified

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:44.330
ancestry predating that time period,
moving back towards the 3 million year

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:50.870
mark. And the question is, where is it?
And who was it? And here's where we run up

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:56.300
against a roadblock. Now, why is this
important more than just for the purposes

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:02.550
of putting cladograms or phylogenies on
the page is because in the last decade or

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:09.480
two, information from global climate
change, paleo-climatic change, has made it

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.860
clear that the tim period in which many
people suspect the Homo lineage arose was

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:24.840
one of a very widespread, impactful change
in global climate, creating an expansion

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:31.570
of ice sheets, reduction in sea levels,
drying out of the African interior. And

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:38.680
that time period has been focused right
after the 3 million year mark; 2.8, 2.7

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:48.430
and so forth. And that drying out of
Africa has been seen as motive in the

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:55.710
origin of the robust Australopithecines,
the origin of the genus Homo, even to

00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:01.400
stone tool manufacture. This has become
the prevailing hypothesis that the

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.900
complexification, if you will, of hominids
and the origin of technology is all

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:12.170
associated with the local impacts of these
global changes. The problem is that

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:18.620
there's no fossil evidence for the genus
Homo that is informative on exactly what

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:24.230
those changes were at this particular
point in time. We do have of course

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:31.070
Oldowan tools at around 2.6 million. And
as Bernard and others have pointed out,

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:38.240
perhaps that is a proxy for the genus Homo
or maybe it isn't. It's not outside the

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.170
realm of possibility given what we know
about how chimpanzees can make tools that

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:49.810
some Australopithecus is capable of making
them, too. So, questions and an absence of

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:58.372
evidence. And here is the sum total of the
fossil record of the genus Homo between 2-

00:10:58.372 --> 00:11:04.710
and 2.5 million years ago. It would fit in
a shoe box and leave room for a decent

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:14.330
pair of shoes. All of these fossils have
been promoted by one person or another,

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:19.680
one group or another as identifying the
genus Homo older than 2.0 million years

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.740
ago and all of them have been doubted. And
I'm not going to go through them here to

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.960
point out the weaknesses and strengths of
the various arguments, other than to say

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.650
that the very fact that there's debate can
be traced to the fact that there's

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:42.200
relatively little evidence. And this is
why groups return to Africa, go to the

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.000
field to African sites, in East Africa, in
South Africa all the time focusing on this

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.420
time period which, in my view, is one of
the most intriguing of all the time

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:57.780
periods in human evolution to increase our
understanding of the fossil record. One

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:03.540
area where the group from The Institute of
Human Origins which I direct at ASU has

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:09.220
been focusing on, of course, for years is
Ethiopia. We've worked at the Lucy site

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:15.020
more or less continuously since 1990. And
colleagues of mine, Dr. Kaye Reed at ASU

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.580
and Chris Campisano and others, have
expanded the work, the IHO work in

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.400
Ethiopia, to a place called Ledi-Geraru as
seen here as slightly north and east of

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:31.480
the Hadar area. What attracted them to
this area? Two things, knowledge that the

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:37.940
environments represented by the sediments
in this area looked different from those

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:43.040
that were very common and well-understood
in the Lucy time period, older than 3

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:50.490
million, some 20, 30 kilometers away at
Hadar. And second, the suspicion verified

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:55.550
since then that the rocks may actually
represent a slightly younger time period

00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:00.940
and that's important because at Hadar, as
you will see, we have Lucy species,

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.730
Australopithecus afarensis up to about 3
million years and then we jump across

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.260
three quarters of a million years and we
have a jaw of Homo with some stone tools

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:17.460
at 2.3 million. Lucy, Homo; older,
younger. Gap in the middle, let's try to

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:25.580
fill it. And that was their mission. Now,
in the lower Awash Valley, these areas

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:31.160
around Hadar and middle Ledi and Gona and
Dikika and Woranso-Mille, there are

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:39.320
excellent sediments going backwards in
time from around 3 million years ago. And

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.510
we have an excellent set of sediments in
places like Gona and Hadar that take us

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:51.190
forward from around 2.5 million years ago.
It is the time period in between that is

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:56.770
critical and is germane to the questions
about where the three forms of Homo that

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:03.880
we know of at 2 million perhaps emerged
from? And these sediments are present

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:12.680
amply, now well-studied in the Ledi-Geraru
area spanning in time from around 2.8

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:18.610
million years to about 2.6 million years.
And what's really important to understand

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:23.850
about these sediments, and this is both an
advantage and a disadvantage is that they

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:31.310
are not continuous across time, but
instead are exposed in fault blocks,

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:37.450
adjacent fault blocks which means that
each block of sediment is a unified slice

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:43.370
of time separated from another block next
to it which has itself a unified period of

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:49.680
time with slight gaps in between them.
Disadvantaged because we can't trace

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.650
evolutionary events continuously but
advantage because fossils that come,

00:14:54.650 --> 00:15:00.030
demonstrably come, from particular fault
blocks can be narrowed to a very narrow

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:05.450
range of environments and associations
with other animal species, etc. So, a plus

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:12.570
and a minus. And here is the Ledi-Geraru
area. Kaye and her team have been working

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:16.830
her for more than a decade before they
found their first hominid. Looking at the

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:22.370
fauna, looking at the geology, trying to
understand the environments. And by the

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:27.730
way, this is an area called the Lee Adoyta
basin and you can see here, here's one

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:32.840
fault block, here's another fault block,
and here's a third fault block. They're

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.250
about three or four fault blocks just
exposed in this one view, very clearly

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:42.070
delineated. You can see one of the faults
running right through here. Now, back in

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:46.250
2013, Kaye and her group of
paleontologists were surveying an area in

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:52.700
the Lee Adoyta basin called the Gurumaha
block just in the one fault block. And at

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:58.450
the base of this one hillside, there's a
volcanic ash that is now well-dated, very

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:05.100
precisely dated to 2.8 to 2, plus or minus
a handful of years, in the million year

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:13.870
range. And on one winter's day, one of our
graduate students at ASU, Chalachew

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:22.540
Seyoum, was surveying up on this hillside
and found this little jaw. That jaw eroded

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:28.250
out of this hill, perhaps in a recent rain
storm and resides about 10, maybe 12

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:35.380
meters above that volcanic ash. And on the
hillside, there are no sediments up above

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:42.090
younger that the jaw could have floated
down from. It eroded out of that hillside

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:47.950
and it's around 10 meters above the tough.
So here's the jaw after it has been

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:54.230
cleaned up. And I'm here to tell you that
it answers some questions, answer some

00:16:54.230 --> 00:17:01.630
very specific questions. It doesn't answer
all the questions. But there's a myth out

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:07.710
here in Paleoanthropology that unless you
have a complete skeleton, you're not

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:11.480
prepared to answer any meaningful
questions and I wish to dispel that myth.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:16.940
You know, since Raymond Dart named
Australopithecus in 1925, there have been

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:24.530
a plethora of hominid species named,
recognized; Australopithecus africanus,

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:30.680
Paranthropus robustus, Paranthropus
boisei, Homo Habilis, on and on. Many of

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.750
them, if not most of them on the basis of
material that we here today would

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:40.280
consider, at best, imperfect. A fragment
of a jaw, a bit of a brain case, some

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:46.410
teeth, and the fact of the matter is is
that in the intervening years, the vast

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:51.580
majority of those species recognized on
the basis of imperfect material have been

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:57.490
verified as to be meaningful evolutionary
units. We are not at sea when we have

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:02.860
small fragments. We are limited in the
type of questions we can ask. If complete

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:08.070
skeletons were the answer to all of our
questions, then Lucy would have settled,

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:16.060
once and for all, the debate about when
early humans made a commitment to

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:21.300
terrestrial bipedality. Instead, she
generated what is now going on to five

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:28.770
decades of debate about that question. It
depends on the question and this question,

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:33.750
the question that we address to this jaw,
is it the same thing as Australopithecus

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:38.780
at 2.8 million or is it something
different? And I engaged in that question

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.770
with my former PhD student, Brian Brian
Villmoar now at University of Nevada, Las

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:50.260
Vegas, and Chalachew Seyoum our graduate
student who found the jaw. And we came to

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:54.890
the conclusion that in many respects, it
differs from your standard issue

00:18:54.890 --> 00:19:00.030
generalized Australopithecus jaw. Seen
here on the left is a nice jaw of Lucy's

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:05.700
species, Australopithecus afarensis and on
the right is a reconstructed from a scan

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:11.290
of the specimen from Ledi-Geraru. We
noticed that the jaw differs

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:16.650
rather...these two jaws differ rather
remarkably. The afarensis jaw is typically

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:24.280
long and narrow with fat molar teeth,
primitive pre-molars and so forth. And our

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:30.640
major comparison was to something like
this, one of the jaws from the Dmanisi

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:36.330
site dated to about 1.8 million years
which is attributed to Homo erectus. And

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.550
there's a much greater similarity in the
shape of the dental arch, in the form of

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:45.080
the teeth, the pre-molars being
symmetrical and so forth, to this 1.8

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:53.860
million year old Homo erectus jaw than to
Lucy's species. And it extends also to the

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.970
architecture of the jaw and I'm not going
to go into the details here, but

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:01.930
underneath the pre-molar, the afarensis
jaw is characterized by a highly sculpted

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:07.940
out, contour like a chimpanzee probably
due to the very large canine teeth absent

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:13.260
in the Ledi-Geraru jaw. The back part of
the mandible where the vertical part

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:18.160
called the ascending ramus arises from the
body of the jaw is located in the Ledi jaw

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:24.070
well back of the third molar, not forward
as it is in Lucy's species over the second

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:31.780
molar. And the upper and lower boundaries
of the mandibular borders beneath the

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:38.070
teeth and at the base are more or less
parallel. And in Australopithecus, they're

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:42.330
not, it gets shallower to the rear. And by
the way, it's also true of

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:47.870
Australopithecus africanus which is
slightly closer in age to the Ledi jaw in

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:54.540
South Africa, the same kind of thing. So,
when we made the comparison to jaws of the

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:59.590
genus Homo, later in time obviously
because we don't have much in the 2.5 to 3

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:05.840
million year period, the similarities were
very apparent to us. This is a jaw that

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:14.350
exhibits characteristics that forecast
anatomy that is common, the most common

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:19.960
anatomical patterns in jaws of the genus
Homo younger than 2 million. So we

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.910
published it, in not quite a year ago, in
the Journal of Science as a 2.8 million

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:30.650
year old jaw of the genus Homo. Now does
it answer questions about what were the

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:37.270
adaptive packages present early on in the
lineage leading to us? Of course. But what

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:45.950
it does do is that it puts one data point
in an area that is otherwise a void in the

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:53.380
evolution of our own genus. Question is
what kind of environment did it live in?

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.580
Did it live in a dry environment? Did it
live in an open one? Germane to the

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:03.950
questions about what drove early evolution
of Homo. And data that's been put together

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:11.750
by Kaye Reed and given to me for this
purpose shows that this jaw is found in a

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:19.740
context of animal species that lived in
essentially grassland environments, very

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:28.680
different in terms of how open or closed
the habitats were compared to time periods

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:34.700
in which Lucy's species lived. And this is
just a couple hundred thousand years

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:41.330
later. Now, I hasten to add here, I am not
asserting that the origin of the genus

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:46.630
Homo is due to a drying out of the
environment. But one thing we can say,

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:52.170
because of the very confined time period
of the Gurumaha fault block in which the

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:57.920
mandible and the fauna on which this
inference is made, suggest that the modal

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:03.610
environmental signal at 2.8 in this area
is one essentially of a grassland

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:09.070
environment. And we can see that by
looking at some of the other animal

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:14.280
fossils that have been found associated
with the horizon from which that mandible

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:20.260
has come. This is the Gurumaha block,
these are El Salafin bovid frequencies and

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:24.980
the horse frequencies, both of which of
course are well-known grazers. And

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:30.560
together, in the Gurumaha block, they
constitute nearly 40% of the macrofauna,

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.680
excludes elephants and hippos and stuff.
I'm not saying it's dry, we're saying it's

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:40.550
open. So it's 40% of the macrofauna and
that is very impressive compared to the

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:48.050
frequencies back in Lucy's time starting
just 200,000 years earlier. Opens up areas

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:55.630
for inquiry. And finally, some new data
coming out of Kenya from Sonia Harmand's

00:23:55.630 --> 00:24:02.850
group suggests that stone tool use, in
fact, began not with the genus Homo,

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:09.440
maybe. But perhaps as long ago as 3.5
million years when we have

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:16.660
Australopithecus. And if these finds are
verified, it opens up a whole new range of

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:22.600
possibilities looking at the adaptive
packages that constitute the ancestral

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:30.360
platform from which the genus Homo
emerged. And so to finish up, here we have

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.920
Ledi-Geraru, here we have our formerly
first appearance, a former first

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:40.740
appearance of stone tools now pushed back
here perhaps and does that imply that the

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:47.120
genus Homo itself has even an earlier
origin than we think of at 2.8, perhaps

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:53.168
back as far as Lucy? Or could Lucy herself
have been the first stone tool maker?

00:24:53.168 --> 00:24:54.300
Thank you.
