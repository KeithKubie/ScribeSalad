00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.340
Ever had an important event coming up, and
baam - huge zit in the middle of your forehead.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.910
Ugh.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.660
Hello cutis wearers, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.330
Acne vulgaris, also known as those annoying
painful oozing red bumps or dark dots on your

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.410
skin, is something that affects almost all
of us - especially during our teenage years.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.750
But what causes acne in the first place and
why is it so difficult to treat?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.660
Well, there are a ton of different ideas out
there - ranging from hormones to diet, to

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.210
our genetics and even psychological reasons-
like stress.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.330
Which might explain that pimple before prom.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.230
Although, little is known for certain; Some
of these hypotheses, however, do have more

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.880
support than others.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.040
One surprising new study, published in May
2016 in the journal Cell,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.989
blames your DNA.

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.480
Scientists from Yale took blood samples of
three individuals suffering from acne and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.489
discovered that all three samples of DNA had
mutations within the gene

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.040
NEK9.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.910
This gene is responsible for hair follicle
production on your skin.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.390
But, this mutation causes a defect in the
follicle which makes it produce large blackheads

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.770
and acne instead of normal hair.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.700
According to the lead researcher, Dr. Keith
A. Choate “all acne is dependent upon hair

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.790
follicles,”.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.260
So it makes sense to look at the genes responsible
for hair production in our search for what

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.260
causes acne.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.479
It’s an exciting new path of study.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.270
Now the Yale researchers looked at one specific
type of acne, called nevus comedonicus, but

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.390
a meta review of many studies on different
types of acne states seem to suggest that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.690
your mom and dad might be the problem.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.180
The review found that acne’s heritability
is actually around 80% for first degree relatives.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.180
So if you’re parents had acne, chances are
you will too.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.520
Another potential culprit might be naturally
occurring bacteria in your body.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.150
While research is unclear, there is some evidence
that bacterial organisms like

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.090
Propionibacterium, a common bacteria found
on your skin might cause acne.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.530
Some evidence that lends credence to this
argument is that researchers have found that

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.100
antibiotics can sometimes help with decreasing
acne.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.759
But, they’re not really sure if it’s the
antibiotic’s anti-inflammatory or anti-bacterial

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.720
properties that are doing the job.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.069
So it could be that inflammation is the problem
and not bacteria, but again no one knows for

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.069
sure.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.890
A common idea is that diet can wreak havoc
on your skin.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.320
Many people swear that certain foods
like chocolate or butter cause them to break

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.000
out; and hey every body is different, this
may be the case for you.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.680
But when it comes to scientific experiments,
the evidence to back this up is lacking.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.760
A meta review conducted by scientists at the
University of Nottingham’s Centre of Evidence

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.840
Based Dermatology looked at many studies that
considered the relationship between diet and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.840
acne.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.200
Altogether they found only one study that
showed what you eat makes a difference.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.940
A diet low in glucose seems to be associated
with better skin, but this is definitely not

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.379
enough to make conclusions.

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.379
So treat yourself :)

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.620
This lack of research and understanding as
well as the fact that there are different

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.610
types of acne with potentially different causes
behind it, makes it so tricky to treat.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.160
There is likely never gonna be one silver
bullet that cures it all.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.629
Luckily, for most of us, acne goes away after
our 30s.

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.599
On top of this, most acne, as uncomfortable
as it may be, is largely benign.

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.260
So, while it might ruin your day, it’s probably
not going to last forever.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.370
