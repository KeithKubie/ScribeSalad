1
00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:06.610
Every defense is associated with a disease and we'll now discuss some of the

2
00:00:06.611 --> 00:00:09.070
diseases of exaggerated defenses.

3
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.290
This occurs because every defense is a benefit which is associated with some

4
00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:19.291
costs and the costs are expressed when the defense is exaggerated or when it is

5
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.670
inappropriately deployed.

6
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.250
They range from mild things like itching and discomfort to death through organ

7
00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:29.350
failure triggered by septic shock.

8
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.140
<v 0>Okay,</v>

9
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.090
<v 1>so let's discuss immune defenses.
Quite inhalation and thrombosis,
tissue repair,</v>

10
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.010
fuel reallocation and defense from starvation defenses against dehydration and

11
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:46.030
volume depletion,
avoidance of pathogens and avoidance of predators.

12
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.700
So immune defenses have diseases that are associated with them that include

13
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.240
autoimmunity,
allergy,
asthma,
septic shock,
anaphylaxis,

14
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.470
and other immunopathology is
there.

15
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.630
Increased incidents in the modern world indicates important contributions from

16
00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:12.420
environmental factors.
The design issue is this,

17
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.510
the systems are devo designed with feed forward loops with positive feedback.

18
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.000
This is done to provide a rapid,

19
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.180
massive emergency response to infection that's associated with sepsis and with

20
00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:30.750
toxins which leads to anaphylaxis.

21
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.350
But this creates these vulnerabilities to unmanageable runaway processes and

22
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.380
that is why things like sepsis and anaphylaxis hit so quickly and cause such

23
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:44.640
massive symptoms.

24
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.330
Sepsis that has a cascading series of failures in multiple organs.

25
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.360
It resembles the power failures in continental wide powerness.

26
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.170
The failure of one component increases the chance that the remaining components

27
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:02.004
will fail.

28
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.540
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

29
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.540
<v 1>coagulation and thrombosis are both very good defensive reactions to wounding,</v>

30
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.820
but they have associated diseases as well.

31
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.350
So they are defenses against vascular injury and they contain the risk of

32
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:22.050
embolism that leads to ischemia and infarction.

33
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.660
To be effective,
clotting has to be fast to avoid hemorrhage.

34
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.120
The speed is achieved by positive feedback that amplifies the response.

35
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.670
Positive feedback creates two kinds of vulnerabilities and excessive response

36
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.990
and fishes cycles.

37
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.990
Those inflammation promotes clotting leading to embolism and embolism promotes

38
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:50.640
inflammation,
producing,
cascading local circulatory failure.

39
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.560
So this is part of the gradual component of the development of heart disease.

40
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.250
Tissue repair

41
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.370
<v 0>is he central.
We evolved stem cells to do it.</v>

42
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.390
And the design of our tissue repair mechanisms contains vulnerabilities to both

43
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.610
via fibrosis and to Neoplasia or to cancer.

44
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.030
Tissue repair replaces lost cells.

45
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.060
That's regeneration and it rebuilds lost s extra cellular matrix including the

46
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:24.550
base basement membranes of the extracellular matrix.

47
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.670
Excessive regeneration combined with oncogenic mutations,
causes tumor growth.

48
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.630
And after the age of about five,
interestingly,

49
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:39.400
repair of extracellular Matrix produces fibrosis and that leads to scarring.

50
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.490
But that does not happen in children younger than five.

51
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.880
Fibrosis can also lead to a loss of organ function.
For example,

52
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:53.830
with liver cirrhosis or pulmonary Sark,
sarcoidosis in the lung.

53
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.573
Yeah,

54
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.290
<v 1>fuel reallocation is essential for managing or physiology and for managing</v>

55
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:02.580
things like starvation.

56
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.360
But it has Associated Diseases Tho though those diseases,

57
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.370
uh,

58
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.160
elicit costs that rarely had to be paid until modern times.

59
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.650
Fewer reallocation support shifting physiological priorities,
for example,

60
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:21.390
during infection or pregnancy.

61
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.930
But in the context of obesity and chronic inflammation,

62
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.980
these same processes can lead to type two diabetes.

63
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.600
Our ability to store calories as fat created a vulnerability to obesity when

64
00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:39.870
continuous unlimited food is encountered.

65
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.810
Similar issues arise with dehydration and volume depletion.

66
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.270
We need to be well hydrated,

67
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.370
but the mechanisms that regulate our water content also contained

68
00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:54.240
vulnerabilities.

69
00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.450
Homeostatic control of water and sodium is done with endocrine mechanisms that

70
00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:04.770
evolved in environments that were chronically deficient in sodium chloride table

71
00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:09.000
salt,
dramatic increases in salt consumption,

72
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.253
stress,

73
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.350
our physiological systems that regulate sodium because sodium has a key role in

74
00:05:17.881 --> 00:05:19.890
the control of blood volume.

75
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.790
The result has been an increased incidence in hypertension.

76
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.720
We've also evolved defense mechanisms to avoid predators and pathogens and with

77
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.560
of course then to avoid these diseases associated with those pathogens.

78
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.650
We avoid pathogens by detecting proxies of high microbial density,
smells,

79
00:05:42.651 --> 00:05:45.890
tastes,
and sites.
Those are the things we think are disgusting.

80
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.740
We avoid rotten food,

81
00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:52.220
feces and humans who are just suffering from contagious disease.

82
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.160
When exaggerated such defenses can produce obsessive disorder,

83
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.300
so that's the disease of an exaggerated defense.

84
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.360
We avoid predators by staying away from open spaces and unfamiliar surroundings.

85
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.000
That is very useful if you're in a high danger environment like the Serengeti.

86
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.880
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

87
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.690
<v 1>However,
when exaggerated or inappropriately deployed,</v>

88
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.970
such behavior can produce Agora phobia.

89
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.380
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

90
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.280
<v 1>So to summarize,</v>

91
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.290
the exaggeration of every type of defense produces a characteristic associated

92
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:31.124
disease.

93
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

94
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.090
<v 1>Feed forward loops and positive feedback are part of the design of these systems</v>

95
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:41.180
because they provide a rapid emergency response,

96
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.900
but those very things create vulnerability to an unmanageable runaway process

97
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.370
like septic shock and embolism.

98
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

99
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.450
<v 1>The design of tissue repair makes us vulnerable to cancer in fibrosis.</v>

100
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.670
The design of fuel reallocation makes us vulnerable to type two diabetes.

101
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

102
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.080
<v 1>The design of water and sodium control makes us vulnerable to hypertension.</v>

103
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

104
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.480
<v 1>And the design of pathogen and Predator avoidance makes us vulnerable to</v>

105
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:17.420
obsessive compulsive disorder.
And Agora Phobia.
