Now that we have this book object and we've tested it, let's put it to use.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.679
You're going to write a program that takes a user input word, and tells how

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:13.284
many times it occurs. Your code will be able to do this. When you're done with

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:16.795
this you'll be able to run look up any word. It'll ask you to type a word and

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:22.138
it'll look it up. So, I'll type Hatter and press Enter. And it tells me Hatter

00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:27.580
occurs 55 times. I'm going to give you some pointers. You'll want to make a new

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.079
book, like we do in BookTester. You'll also need to use a scanner, don't forget

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.833
the import. Also, you saw how to read and enter a double, but you didn't see

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:39.430
how to read a string with the scanner. You'll need to look at the scanner

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.820
documentation. Scanner has a lot of methods, you'll want to use one of the ones

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.840
that starts with next and returns a string. If picking the right scanner method

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.140
makes your head hurt, click the link that says hints. I'll go over this part in

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.360
detail in the answer video.
