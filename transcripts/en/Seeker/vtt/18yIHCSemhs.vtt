00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
There are over one hundred elements on the periodic table

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.840
and one of them stands out out of all.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.320
It's used in electronics, architecture, jewelry,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.220
but what is it about gold that makes it so precious?

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.400
[INTRO MUSIC]

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.420
On Monday, August 24, 2015, the DOW Jones
Industrial Average plummeted nearly

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.980
1,100 points - the biggest decline on
record in a single trading day.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.119
Nearly every time something like this happens,
there's someone coming out of the woodwork

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.340
saying that gold is a better investment.
But gold is really just a pretty rock.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.680
How did it become so valuable? Most of the gold on earth comes from meteorites

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.390
that smacked down onto the surface two
hundred million years after the earth formed,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.120
and humans have been fascinated with it
for millennia. I mean gold has been used

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.080
as currency throughout advanced
civilization, and the earliest use of gold

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.240
coins dates back to ancient Egypt around 500 BCE.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.380
Before coins, there was a system of values based on weights of gold, silver, and copper.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.260
Romans, Egyptians, and ancient Indians all used gold as a form of currency.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.560
And as modern nation started to adopt paper currency, though, they used gold as a backing for its value.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.180
But we've moved away from that.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.640
While we don't use it to back our currency anymore, gold is still highly valued.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.040
Last I checked, it was about $1,148 per ounce and it's rarer than you think.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.500
The entirety of a year's worth of global gold production can fit inside of your living room.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.840
A large amount of gold and silver was just found in reservoirs underneath volcanoes in New Zealand.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.820
If mined, it could be worth billions for years to come.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.940
So why does this space rock mean so much to us and how did it become used as currency?

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.100
Well there are several theories and it's got a lot to do with chemistry.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.400
Elements like gasses and liquid make zero sense in terms of currency. Way too hard to carry around!

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.720
Alkaline metals of earths, well, try
dropping magnesium in water and see what happens.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.460
Not so fit for a currency.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.880
Lead and copper were tried as coinage in some places, like ancient China, but they quickly corroded.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.380
And lead, well, lead's always been a little toxic, so that's never good.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.120
And other precious metals? Some are too rare to be of any practical currency.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.460
And, well, some were too difficult to turn into anything.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.560
I mean it takes over 3,000 degrees to melt platinum.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.420
So that brings us back to silver and gold.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.860
Silver makes for a great currency: durable and rare enough to be desired.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.520
And gold? Well, it's pretty inert. It's the least reactive of any metal,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.440
so it won't corrode when exposed to things like water or oxygen.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.320
It won't ever rust or tarnish.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.500
So if you made a golden statue and left
it sitting in a public square for a thousand years,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.600
it would roughly look the same, where a copper statue would turn green in only a few years.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.700
Speaking of a statue, that's another plus in the gold column.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.860
It's so easy to manipulate and make stuff out of, whether that's art, jewelry, or coins.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.640
And that brings me back to another point.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.680
Gold beats out all other metals, even silver, in value because it's pretty.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.100
I mean, it's chemical symbol is AU from the Latin name aurum, meaning "shining dawn".

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.820
So, it lasts for a while and it's easy to manipulate and it's pretty.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.220
That would be used on pretty much everything aesthetic, like buildings, paintings

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.910
sculptures, jewelry, and now you have one
of the most precious things to humanity.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.160
So, why is it valuable? Because it's rare and pretty.
The end.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.720
So, while we do love our precious gold, other metals are just as, if not more,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.220
valuable for use in things like
electronics. There's a bit of a problem:

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.000
we might be running out.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Where should we turn? To space, of course.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.840
Trace explores whether we should mine an asteroid for platinum in this great video right here.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.920
TRACE: "Once asteroids are located, scientists use ground-based infrared telescopes and

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.610
spectrometers to see which minerals
exist in its structure.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.230
Different minerals absorb light at different wavelengths."
