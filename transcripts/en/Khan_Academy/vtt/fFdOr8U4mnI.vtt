00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.250
At the beginning of the week,
Stewart's checking account

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.530
had a balance of
negative $15.08.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.740
On Monday morning, he
deposited a check for $426.90.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.350
On Tuesday morning, he deposited
another check for $100.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.830
How much was in Stewart's
checking account

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.790
after the second deposit, so
after both of these deposits

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.080
right over here.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.130
So he starts off with
a negative balance.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.920
So a negative balance
means that he's

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.720
overdrawn his checking account.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.997
He actually owes
the bank money now.

00:00:32.997 --> 00:00:35.580
Luckily, he's now going to put
some money in his bank account.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.340
So he'll actually have
a positive balance

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.810
in his checking account.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.730
So he's starts off with
the negative $15.08.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.130
And then to that,
he adds $426.90.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.260
And then he adds another $100.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.010
So he started off
with negative $15.08.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.810
And then to that, he
adds $426.90 and $100.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.272
So that's $526.90.

00:01:09.272 --> 00:01:11.480
And so how much is going to
have in his bank account?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:18.540
He started owing $15.08, and
then he's going to add $526.90.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.940
So one way to visualize
it is, if you think

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.090
about it on a number line,
if this is 0 right over here,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.860
he's going to start
off at negative $15.08.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.060
But then he's going to add $526.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.840
So this right over here,
this is $15.08 to the left.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.200
That's how much he owes.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.680
And to that, he's
going to add $526.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.470
So I'm not drawing
this to scale.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.861
But to that, he is
going to add $526.90.

00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:56.360
So the amount that he's going
to be in the positive is going

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.940
to be $526.90 minus the $15.08.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.209
It's essentially going to be
this length right over here.

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.250
That's how much he's going
to be in the positive.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.730
And that's going to be
$526.90 minus $15.08.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.630
So that's going to be, and
we can even just rewrite this

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.460
so it actually looks
exactly like that.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.307
That's exactly the same
thing as $526.90 minus--

00:02:29.307 --> 00:02:31.390
adding a negative is the
same thing as subtracting

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.320
a positive-- minus $15.08.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.000
And this is-- I will do
this in another color--

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.290
$526.90 minus $15.08.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.300
Let's see, 0 is less than 8.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.110
Let's make that a 10
and borrow from this 9.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.820
So that becomes an 8, or I guess
you could say we're regrouping.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.290
Now, everything up here is
larger than everything there.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.380
So 10 minus 8 is 2.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.190
8 minus 0 is 8.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.570
We have our decimal.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.890
6 minus 5 is 1.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.695
2 minus 1 is 1.

00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:06.200
And then you have
5 minus nothing.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.734
So he is left with $511.82
after his second deposit.
