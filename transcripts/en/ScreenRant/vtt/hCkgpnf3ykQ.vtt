00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.709
In the past two decades, Hollywood has taken
a liking to true story movies, whether they

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.680
document part of the lives of people who really
lived or spin their own take on historical

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.880
events. However, while some true story films
may offer movie viewers an idea of what happens

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.140
to the people or locations after the credits
role, others fail to give the whole story

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.169
- whether it be the mysterious disappearance
of the main character or a famous building's

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:28.630
ties to World War II Nazis.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.919
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Movie Endings You
Never Got To See.

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:32.919
The Wolf of Wall Street

00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:37.810
Marking the fifth time director Martin Scorsese
and actor Leonardo DiCaprio teamed together,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.230
The Wolf of Wall Street told the story of
Jordan Belfort, a wealthy stockbroker who

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.160
was eventually brought down by the SEC and
FBI for defrauding investors. According to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.320
the film's epilogue, Belfort was sentenced
to 36 months in prison - of which he only

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.190
served 22 - and has since made a living teaching
seminars on sales techniques. In addition

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.329
to the prison time, Belfort was also ordered
to pay over $110 million to his victims, but

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.890
has since paid less than $12 million. Plus,
since his release he has attempted to fight

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.190
the requirement of paying anymore compensation
and been criticized for receiving more than

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.210
$1 million in rights payments for his part
in The Wolf of Wall Street. Of course, since

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.799
Belfort has admitted the depiction of his
drug use in the film is more tame than his

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.450
actual activities, his real life ruthless
nature shouldn't come as a huge surprise.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.450
Titanic

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.100
It's widely recognized that the love story
between Jack and Rose at the center of James

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.220
Cameron's 1997 disaster film Titanic is a
work of pure fiction, but many of the characters

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.319
aboard the ship were based on real people.
One historical accuracy included in Titanic

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.499
is that the band bravely played their instruments
while the ship sank. However, these musicians

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:42.810
were repaid for their services by the shipping
company that owned the Titanic who sent bills

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.929
to their loved ones. That's right, the family
of one musician in particular, the violinist

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.070
Jock Hume, was charged not only for the brass
buttons on his uniform, but for the shipping

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.490
cost to deliver his body home as well. According
to the White Star Line, Hume's pay was stopped

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.850
the moment the ship went down and the wages
owed to him didn't cover these costs. Considering

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.579
the noble actions of the Titanic's musicians,
demanding money from their families doesn't

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.130
seem like the best way to honor their memory.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.319
Erin Brockovich

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.300
The 2000 film Erin Brockovich starred Julia
Roberts as the titular single mother. A legal

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.610
assistant at the time, Brockovich championed
a small California town and took on a major

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.470
energy corporation that was poisoning townspeople
with carcinogenic chemicals in the groundwater.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.470
In the movie, Brockovich is able to win the
town a total of $333 million and received

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.230
her own bonus of $2 million, apparently showing
a happy ending to the situation. However,

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.880
the real end to this story isn't quite as
cinematically happy: the townspeople claim

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.490
their lawyers held onto their awards for six
months after the settlement, and that the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.770
amounts were significantly less than they
expected because of excessive legal fees.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.360
As if that isn't bad enough, Brockovich herself
has seemingly abandoned the town, using her

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.530
fame to launch a career as an environmental
activist and motivational speaker.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.250
Schindler's List

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.070
Steven Spielberg's 1993 historical drama Schindler's
List is based on the life of Oskar Schindler,

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.180
a wealthy businessman who went from focusing
on making money to saving lives during World

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.220
War II. Schindler ran a munitions factory
in early 1940s Germany, which he used to save

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.870
and protect the lives of more than a thousand
Jews before the war ended. However, because

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.730
of his previous relations with the Nazi Party,
Schindler was considered a war criminal by

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.730
the Allies and fled Germany in order to avoid
capture. Though the events depicted in Schindler's

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.930
List paint him as a hero, throughout the rest
of his life he suffered one failed business

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.630
venture after another, largely relying on
financial support from those he helped during

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.190
the war. Still, Schindler is well-regarded
for his accomplishments during WWII, so at

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.300
least he was successful when it really mattered.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.300
The Revenant

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.710
The most recent film from director Alejandro
Iñárritu is based on the story of how 19th

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.700
century frontiersman Hugh Glass survived a
brutal bear attack and managed to find his

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.100
way through the wilderness to safety. One
of the major driving forces for Glass is exacting

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.840
revenge on the two men that left him for dead,
John Fitzgerald and Jim Bridger. At the end

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.060
of&nbsp;The Revenant, Glass gets his vengeance
on Fitzgerald, but his own fate and survival

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.920
are left to open-ended ambiguity. However,
the real story of Glass&nbsp;provides some concrete

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.150
answers&nbsp;as to what happened to the frontiersman
after finding Fitzgerald. First off, by all

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.110
accounts Glass never actually attempted to
get revenge on Fitzgerald because the man

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.400
that had abandoned him joined the Army. As
a result, he was essentially untouchable unless

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.570
Glass wanted to face deathly consequences.
As for Bridger, Glass did find the boy that

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.340
left him for dead, but because it had been
at the urging of Fitzgerald, he decided to

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.600
be forgiving. As for Glass's death, he was
killed during a skirmish with the Arikara

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.960
Native American tribe&nbsp;10 years after surviving
the bear attack. So,&nbsp;The Revenant&nbsp;not only

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.320
takes some artistic liberties with the ending
of Glass's story, but with most of the conclusion

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.680
to his mission for revenge as well.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.780
Remember the Titans

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.770
Despite being based on the true story of T.C.
Williams High School's 1971 football season,

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.220
Remember the Titans features a number of historical
inaccuracies. The biggest being that T.C.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.900
Williams had been racially integrated many
years before, and the big merger at the heart

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.100
of the film was simply combining three schools
together. Additionally, according to a former

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.270
player of Coach Herman Boone, he wasn't quite
the inspiring character portrayed by Denzel

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.290
Washington in Remember the Titans. Though
the movie notes Boone left the Titans five

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.020
years after their 1971 season, it doesn't
mention that it was in disgrace following

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.450
accusations of verbal and physical abuse as
well as a player mutiny and the departure

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.500
of multiple assistants. However, despite the
way he left T.C. Williams, Boone has still

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.560
largely been regarded as a hero because of
his portrayal in Remember the Titans.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.470
12 Years a Slave

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.130
Steve McQueen's 2013 Oscar-winning biographical
drama 12 Years a Slave follows the enslavement

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.490
of free African-American man Solomon Northup
in the southern United States during the 1800s.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.870
Though Northup is eventually freed and goes
on to write the memoir on which the film is

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.860
based, 12 Years a Slave notes that the circumstances
surrounding his death and burial are unknown.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.810
After his time as a slave, Northup became
an active member in the abolitionist movement,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.870
but there are no historical documents relating
to when or how he died. It has since become

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.870
a puzzle for historians, with some theories
including that Northup became a spy for the

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.370
Union Army during the Civil War or that he
was kidnapped again or, simply, that he was

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.290
murdered. Of course, given what we know about
the time period, and the fact that 12 Years

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.199
a Slave depicts what can happen when an African-American
man goes missing, it seems likely this story

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.340
doesn't have a happy ending.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.650
The Theory of Everything

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.430
Eddie Redmayne won an Academy Award for his
portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.300
of Everything, but the film glossed over some
of the more unpleasant aspects of the famous

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.199
physicist's life. The Theory of Everything
follows the love story between Stephen Hawking

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.770
and Jane Wilde, who marry and have children,
before falling out of love and finding happiness

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.710
elsewhere - while still remaining friends.
However, in actuality, Stephen and Jane went

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.330
through a painful divorce and it was many
years before they became friends again. Additionally,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.590
circumstances surrounding Stephen's relationship
with his second wife Elaine, led many to believe

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.199
she abused him. So, although The Theory of
Everything's epilogue is technically accurate,

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.930
it doesn't quite tell the whole story.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.930
Big Miracle

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.070
The 2012 drama Big Miracle tells the true
story of how a group of people came together

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.091
despite their differing beliefs in order to
save a family of gray whales trapped in the

00:06:57.091 --> 00:07:01.370
ice near Point Barrow, Alaska. Although the
film does depict the death of the youngest

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.590
whale, named Bamm-Bamm, it shows the other
two, Fred and Wilma, swimming freely away

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.960
into the ocean, seemingly saved by human intervention.
However, no one actually knows if the two

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.010
whales ever really escaped the ice. Since
the National Marine Fisheries Service didn't

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.230
attach radio tracking tags to the whales before
they were freed, we only know for sure that

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.490
they left the section of the ice where they
were previously trapped. But, considering

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.441
their injuries, it’s unclear whether they
survived the swim back to open ocean. Although

00:07:26.441 --> 00:07:30.170
many have tried to since find the whales,
they haven’t had any luck, so we're not

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.860
sure this was truly the big miracle the film
made it out to be.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:34.860
Moneyball

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.530
The 2011 sports film Moneyball follows Oakland
Athletics general manager Billy Beane, played

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:44.240
by Brad Pitt, who manages to build a baseball
team despite the franchise's limited budget.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.960
Beane accomplishes this feat using a new method
of statistical analysis known as sabermetrics,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.620
leading the team to a more successful season,
even though they don't make the World Series.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.860
A title card at the end of the film explains
that the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.009
using Beane's method, but they weren't the
only team to adopt sabermetrics. Michael Lewis'

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:05.860
2003 book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an
Unfair Game revealed Beane's exact methods

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.240
that led to the team's success, and the author
has since admitted it "probably cost the A's

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.400
an opportunity or two." So the major lesson
of Moneyball isn't just to be innovative,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.110
it's also to protect your secrets to success
if you want to stay successful.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.300
So what do you think of our list? Did we miss
