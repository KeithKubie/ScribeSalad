LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.460
This is our last session on
the evening for day one.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.660
Louis Gray here, with my
co-moderator Daniel Sieberg,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.300
who has returned.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.515
Thank you very much.

00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:18.410
DANIEL SIEBERG: Happy
to be here.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.440
LOUIS GRAY: And Greg
DeMichillie, from the Cloud

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.340
Platform team, is a Director
of Product

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.160
Management on Cloud.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.920
GREG DEMICHILLIE: Hey, guys.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.420
LOUIS GRAY: And cloud has had a
really solid update here at

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.000
Google I/O, a lot of
good information.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.240
And so we wanted to take this
time at the end of day one to

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.480
really walk through those
updates and understand from

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.780
you, what's going on with cloud
at Google, and what do

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.690
people need to know?

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.375
GREG DEMICHILLIE: Sure.

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:41.940
Well, as you mentioned, it was
a pretty big day for us here.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.000
When I think about what we're
doing in the cloud at Google,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.670
it really comes back to the
fact that over the past 14

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.190
years at Google, we've been
building this amazing

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.760
infrastructure for
our own use.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.030
And whether people knew it or
not when they used Maps and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.050
Gmail and Search, they've been
using this incredible

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.040
infrastructure.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.810
But until now, it's been
something that's only

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.700
available for Googlers.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.519
And now with the cloud, we're
actually letting third-party

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.000
developers, any developer out
there, run their applications

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.340
on this same world-class
infrastructure.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.420
And I think that's probably
the biggest,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.320
most exciting thing.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.660
About 11 months ago, we were
here at Google I/O when we

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.640
first launched the
Cloud Platform.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.780
And it's been a busy 11
months since then.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.690
We launched, I think something
like 163 new features in the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.960
11-month period, which is
really phenomenal if

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.680
you think about it.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.790
But that's because we get
to build on top of this

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.200
incredible infrastructure that
already exists within Google.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.410
So I then look at and think
about what we actually

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.220
announced here.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.050
There's sort of a couple
big issues.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.375
The biggest one is probably
Compute Engine.

00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:46.000
For folks who know, Compute
Engine is our infrastructure

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.970
as a service product.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.670
It allows people to run virtual
machines running

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.480
operating systems of their
choice in our infrastructure.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.820
And as of today, as of, in fact,
about 40 minutes ago,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.030
it's live and open for sign-ups
for any developer.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.740
So any developer out there
who wants to can go to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.170
cloud.google.com, and sign-up,
and start firing up virtual

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.860
machines and playing with
what we can do in the

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.110
infrastructure.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.020
So that's probably the single
biggest announcement.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.570
We also talked quite a
bit about App Engine.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.860
And again, for people who have
been using the Cloud Platform,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.340
they know that App Engine is
a platform as a service.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.370
Basically, it allows developers
to concentrate

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.040
their code on the part that
makes their app different.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.940
And to not write that
boilerplate code that just

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.580
makes sure that it scales up
when I get traffic and scales

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.340
down when I don't get traffic.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.630
App Engine handles all that.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.650
App Engine's been usable for
Java and Python and Go.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.900
And we announced today that
we're adding PHP to the mix,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.160
which we think is a pretty big
move in terms of millions of

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.470
developers out there who now
can use App Engine without

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.780
having to learn a
new language.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.860
LOUIS GRAY: And so PHP is one of
those things that comes up.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.790
Why PHP?

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.710
Why are we doing that now?

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.100
GREG DEMICHILLIE: Yeah.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.400
I mean, that one's actually
pretty easy.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.170
If you look at any of the
statistics out there, three

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.240
quarters of the world's websites
are powered in some

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.670
form by PHP.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.320
So it's just incredibly
widely used.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.500
And so that made it a real
obvious target for us.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.030
We really wanted to take
and not just build

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.390
your father's PHP.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.300
So we wanted to take PHP, which
people know and love,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.830
but bring to it the App Engine
magic, which lets you build

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.860
websites that scale up much
faster than with any other

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.580
technology.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.200
And equally important, when
there's no traffic, we scale

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.340
everything down to zero and you
have absolutely no charge

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.630
when there's no traffic.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.530
LOUIS GRAY: Excellent.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.810
And one thing I noticed-- and
Daniel and I were talking

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.380
about it earlier, which is
probably where he was going--

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.400
when we look in the keynote,
where cloud started to be part

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.740
of the announcements from the
other teams, and two parts in

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.310
particular.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.830
One, we were looking at Android,
where we talked about

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.645
Google Cloud Messaging and the
sheer volume of updates that

00:03:50.645 --> 00:03:53.940
are happening every single day
with applications on Android.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.460
And the second piece was
Google+, talking about using a

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.330
Google data center as your
dark room for photos.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.580
And I think what I'm hearing
from them and from yourself is

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.160
this real abstraction of where
the data actually is and

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.250
putting the data
center to work.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.090
Maybe you can talk about that,
about how the Cloud Platform

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.280
is really benefiting the other
platforms here at Google.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.190
GREG DEMICHILLIE: It all
comes back to the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.240
fact that at Google--

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.490
to do the amazing things we do
at Google, we've had to invent

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.290
new technology.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.520
We've had to invent new data
center technology.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.730
We've had to invent new file
systems with things like GFS.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.570
And what people don't
even understand is--

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.000
LOUIS GRAY: And that's
Google File System.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.920
GREG DEMICHILLIE: Google
File System.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.070
2002, 2004, we wrote these
papers that really changed the

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.640
way data centers are run.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.650
What people don't realize is
at Google, we've actually

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.180
already moved a generation
beyond those.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.930
We actually now use even more
powerful technology on our

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.245
infrastructure.

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.710
I think what you're seeing
across Google is--

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.030
whether it's in Google+, whether
it's in Android or in

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.110
the cloud, it's all helping
customers and developers do

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.880
things that they never
could do before.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.660
And in the Cloud Platform, very
few people could afford

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.260
to build the kind of data
structures we--

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.085
data centers we can.

00:05:06.085 --> 00:05:07.380
I'll give you one example--

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.800
networking.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.880
Everybody knows how important
networking is to application

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.380
performance.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.360
At Google, we led a partnership
that actually is--

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.320
we are the only non-ISP to
have laid submarine cable

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.030
under the ocean, across
the Pacific Ocean.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.580
And we did that because
high-quality networking

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.730
bandwidth is critical to
our core products.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.970
And what we're doing
with cloud is now--

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.010
other developers can just come
along for the ride and get the

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.500
advantages of the networking,
and the performance, and the

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.360
data centers we're doing.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.460
And I think you see that
across Google, that the

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.390
investments that we've made in
infrastructure pay off across

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.570
the whole company.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.535
DANIEL SIEBERG: Now, for people
who aren't here at I/O,

00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:49.966
they may not know that there's
actually a cloud--

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:52.020
we're part of the cloud, in a
sense, right here because of

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.830
the data sensing experiment
that's going on.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.330
GREG DEMICHILLIE: Yeah.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.440
DANIEL SIEBERG: And in fact,
there's one just below our

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.720
feet right now.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.050
Talk a little bit about what
that is here at I/O, what are

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.630
we learning from that?

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.070
What is it all about?

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.240
GREG DEMICHILLIE: Yeah,
this is cool.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.690
One of the things we wanted to
do was we wanted to build a

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.960
real-world example of the Cloud
Platform, and we wanted

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.020
it to be part of
Moscone Center.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.310
So all across Moscone Center,
there's 525 of

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.640
these little sensors.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.970
And they are running open source
Arduino processors,

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.160
open source software.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.440
And they're collecting data on
things like the humidity, and

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.900
the temperature, and the noise
level, which is a little

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.820
quieter now than it was
a few minutes ago.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.360
But you can imagine when
tracks are out.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.870
So we're measuring just the
ambient information about the

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.140
volume and the temperature.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.820
And there's pressure
mats counting how

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.590
many people walk by.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.070
Now, you can imagine there's
525 of these collecting

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.060
multiple data streams
per second.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.920
And we're all funneling that
into a Google Cloud Platform

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.150
application.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.000
And we're collecting that
data and using App

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.660
Engine to ingest it.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.110
We're using Compute Engine to
do some analysis for it.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.250
We're using our big data
products to allow people to

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.880
query it and visualize it.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.060
And if people come over to the
sandbox over here, they can

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.390
actually explore and visualize
some of this data and see,

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.410
where were the popular places
that people were hanging out?

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.210
Where and when was
it really noisy?

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.460
And again, this is all done in
a way that when we're done,

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.370
the data's all going to be
turned over to the community

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.930
in the tools so that people can
continue to examine and

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:24.650
look at this data.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.610
So I think it's just a really
cool example of the physical

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.940
world meeting the Cloud Platform
in a way that allows

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.805
developers to really see a truly
large-scale application.

00:07:35.805 --> 00:07:37.000
LOUIS GRAY: You mentioned
big data.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.130
It's a term that gets
thrown around a lot.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.420
You had an announcement today,
which was Cloud Datastore.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.350
Maybe you can walk us through
that and help us understand

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.440
how it fits with the other
storage options

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:45.870
that are out there?

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.110
GREG DEMICHILLIE: Yeah, that's
a great example.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.490
The Cloud Datastore--

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.330
let me back up for a second.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.400
At Google, if you think about
it, we've had to build

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.220
technologies with very big
databases and data sets to do

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.520
things like search the web.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.270
And from the beginning, we knew
that SQL databases were

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.500
just not going to cut it.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.670
So we've built what is probably
the world's largest

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.040
NoSQL data store for our
own use at Google.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.810
And we had previously made that
available just through

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:14.840
App Engine.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.970
And to give you a sense of the
scalability of this, this data

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.720
store in App Engine is currently
processing 4 and 1/2

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.460
trillion requests per month.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.270
Not billion, trillion
requests per month.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.180
And the big news now is that
data store is now not just

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.410
available from App Engine,
it's available

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.650
from Compute Engine.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.299
Or actually, any place
with a REST API.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.710
So any developer, no matter
what programming language

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.610
you're using or environment
you're in, you now have access

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.720
to this incredibly
high-performance, highly

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.510
scalable data store.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:48.690
And we think that's also a big
step forward because NoSQL

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.830
databases really are at the
heart of a lot of modern,

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.450
highly scalable web
applications.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.040
I don't think people understand
when we say Google

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.500
scale, what we mean.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.630
We count in trillions,
not billions.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.690
LOUIS GRAY: And trillions--

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.090
the joke would be, I've
forgotten how

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:02.640
to count that low.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.110
GREG DEMICHILLIE: Right.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.960
Even Carl Sagan would call a
trillion a big number, right?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.980
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.860
And you were saying what it
can do for our partners.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.490
What are some interesting
implementations that you've

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.120
already seen with
Cloud Datastore?

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.660
GREG DEMICHILLIE: Yeah, so
there's a couple really good

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.350
examples of the Cloud
Platform.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.950
A couple have been
around mobile.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.510
Not surprisingly, there are
a lot of people out there

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.920
building mobile applications.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.960
And almost any application, you
immediately need to have

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.240
some sort of a back end, whether
it's a game because

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.890
you want to connect people
together, or whether you just

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.290
want to collect information
about what features are being

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.270
used or not.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.530
Any mobile application worth
its salt has a back end.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:45.550
So some of the examples we've
seen are FreshPlanet, which is

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.315
a company that makes a mobile
app called SongPop, which I

00:09:48.315 --> 00:09:49.240
don't know if you've seen.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.380
You challenge your friends and
it will play little snippets

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.940
of a pop music--

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.000
it's in different categories--
and the first one to identify

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.590
the song wins.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.830
They currently are built
on App Engine.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.070
And they're really proud to say
that they have only two

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.930
developers who built their back
end of the application,

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.050
despite the application
scaling up and being--

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.590
I think the fifth most popular
application in the store.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.140
Another one that's really
popular right now, for any of

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.180
our viewers who are in Europe,
they might know that the

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.700
Eurovision Song Contest
is going on right now.

00:10:22.266 --> 00:10:25.340
The Song Contest is very big in
Europe, and part of it is

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.480
voting on what song should
be the best.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.570
What we've done is they've built
the Eurovision back end

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.390
on top of Compute Engine.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.840
And so they're seeing
peak loads of

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.690
50,000 requests a second--

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:38.900
peak loads.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.740
And we're able to meet that, and
90% of those we deliver in

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.580
under 24 millisecond latency.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.480
So think about that.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.190
At peak, we're delivering the
vast majority of their

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.695
requests in 24 milliseconds
or less.

00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:52.160
LOUIS GRAY: And what's
interesting about that is,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.090
first, we're talking big numbers
with trillions, and

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.720
now we're talking about little,
tiny numbers, like

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.670
microseconds.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.970
GREG DEMICHILLIE: Yeah.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.500
LOUIS GRAY: And trying to work
even smaller than that.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.030
GREG DEMICHILLIE: Absolutely.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.880
One of things that we've really
tried at Google is we

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.700
know that speed matters.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.980
So we've tried really hard in
the Cloud Platform to focus on

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.080
not just fast performance,
but consistency.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.030
Because it's very frustrating
if you're building an

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.200
application and one day your
data performance is just fine

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.800
and the next day it seems
to be slow, and you

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.340
can't figure out why.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.430
So it's really been sort of a
hallmark of ours to think

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.200
about not just raw performance,
but consistency

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.520
of performance as well.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.470
DANIEL SIEBERG: Louis touched on
big data, and I would love

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.180
to hear from you on what are
the sort of secrets to

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.340
unlocking big data?

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.130
What are companies doing to
kind of make that useful?

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.400
Because people talk about it a
lot, but I think that a lot of

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.100
people struggle with really what
to do with what it means.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.340
GREG DEMICHILLIE: The hard part
of big data really comes

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.220
in a couple forms.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.970
One is just the sheer size
of the data means that

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.750
traditional database management

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.460
tools just don't work.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.950
You need to think about the
data in a different way.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.070
And clearly, that's where things
like NoSQL data stores,

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.540
the Cloud Datastore come in.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.420
But the other thing about big
data is a lot of it is about

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.970
how you aggregate different
data from

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.200
different sources together.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.180
It's how do I take my log data
and how do I combine that with

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.240
my user data?

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.380
And how do I combine that
with my sales data?

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.180
And do it in a way that lets
a casual business analyst

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.150
actually make sense of it.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.965
And that's where things
like BigQuery come in.

00:12:27.965 --> 00:12:32.150
BigQuery is our product that
allows you to, almost

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:37.320
magically, take these giant
NoSQL databases and query them

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.060
as though they were SQL.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.590
You write SQL-like queries as
though it were a SQL database,

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:45.710
but underneath it's, in fact,
automatically sharding and

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.820
it's a highly scalable
NoSQL infrastructure.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.610
So I think that the challenges
of big data really come in

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.320
multiple dimensions.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.750
But mostly it comes back to
people wanting a platform that

00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:00.140
takes care of the grunt work,
for lack of a better word.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.080
I mean, there's a lot of work in
building up big data that's

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.830
not unique to your data set.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.110
And we're really trying to
take that away, so that

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.200
developers get to focus on the
fun part, if you will.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.430
The things that make their app
different rather than the

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.195
things that make their app the
same as somebody else.

00:13:15.195 --> 00:13:16.740
LOUIS GRAY: And I'm glad
you mentioned BigQuery.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.080
One cool thing about Google
Developers Live is we don't

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.550
just start and stop at I/O. We
have Google Developers Live

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.780
events year-round.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.140
And we regularly have guests,
like Michael Manoochehri from

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.160
your team, to go ahead
and come in

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.620
and talk about BigQuery.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.270
And you mentioned
that it's fun.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.140
And there's something fun about
seeing somebody take a

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.900
big data set, be it Wikipedia
or something of that order,

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.520
and running a query against
it and seeing

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.250
those real-time results.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.540
So I've enjoyed watching that as
we've done our GDL events.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.420
And so one thing you also talked
about, without giving

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.230
any secrets away--

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.646
I don't want [INAUDIBLE] to come
over here and get us all

00:13:46.646 --> 00:13:47.090
in trouble.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.440
GREG DEMICHILLIE: Thank you.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.350
I appreciate that.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.150
LOUIS GRAY: But you
talked about the

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.340
uniqueness of Google.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.240
And you said sometimes we're
working on the next generation

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.270
of a file system or any other
piece of your equipment that

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.390
people haven't even thought
of or caught up to yet.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:02.280
What is it that's unique about
the Google environment that

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.560
gives you access to incredible
delivery?

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.870
GREG DEMICHILLIE: I think if
you step back, we invented

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.080
everything we invented
because we had to.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.470
Google has big goals.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.290
When Google set out to say,
we're going to index the

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.220
entire world wide web, that
means you need to store an

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.660
entire copy of the
world wide web.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.450
And you quickly realize that
normal file systems

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.690
don't work for that.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.810
So you have to invent your
own file system.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.710
It really is a case of us
setting huge objectives--

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.060
having a Gmail system where
you can have 25

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.360
gigabytes of email.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.430
Well, that makes you have to
invent new technology.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.870
So I think that's one part of
the secret at Google, is that

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.500
we aim for big goals.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.000
And as part of that, that
forces you to invent new

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.220
computer science and invent
new data centers.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.210
And the other part is we invest
in our infrastructure.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.500
One of the things--

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.050
[INAUDIBLE] said this in
the keynote, so I feel

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.540
like I can say it.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.190
We spent $2.9 billion on
infrastructure last year.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.310
That's a phenomenal
amount of money.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.620
And we do that because it's so
critical to our own success.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.770
We have to do it to be able to
keep advancing the state of

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.270
what we do.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.030
And the Cloud Platform, we are
just really fortunate enough

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.080
to be able to take these amazing
things that Google

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.410
develops for its own use and
offer them up for other

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:25.670
developers to use.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.080
And that's really where
the magic comes in.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.740
I think it's fun to see
technologies that we develop

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.780
and to have us not just write
a public paper about it,

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:34.810
although we do that.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.870
We continue to publish
academic papers.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.550
But to go to the next step and
say, here's an academic paper.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.270
And here's a running version
in Google Cloud that

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.920
you can play with.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.370
I think that's pretty fun.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:46.890
It's pretty amazing at Google.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:50.830
So I really think it's the
combination of there's Google

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.000
big and Google scale, and
we aim for that in

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.100
everything we do.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.000
And then in cloud, we get to
come along for the ride and

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.500
invite other developers
into the party.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.630
So that's really a lot
of fun for me.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:01.950
LOUIS GRAY: Earlier we
had the team on--

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.280
we call it Performance Alley.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.490
The Chrome team came and
they talked about

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.600
making the web faster.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.940
And one of the things that we
touched on is it's an old

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.290
adage that you don't really
solve a bottleneck, you just

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:11.730
move it somewhere else.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.795
And you continue to find out
whether it's a computation, or

00:16:13.795 --> 00:16:16.590
it's a server, or it's the
network, or it's the cloud.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.880
And it seems like with the cloud
platform, a lot of the

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.940
work we're doing here at Google,
we abstract a lot of

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.340
that away from the developer.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.710
So the developer doesn't
have to worry anymore.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.230
How do you start that kind of
analysis and chase that

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.950
bottleneck so it continues
to move and

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.060
becomes less of an issue?

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.550
GREG DEMICHILLIE: No, you're
absolutely right.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.360
Every time you make one area
faster, you now have-- there's

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.160
always one area that's at
the top of the stack--

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.460
the area you want to work
on most, right?

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:43.610
And that's the fun that as you
nail one area, then the bar

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:44.940
just keeps being
raised higher.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:50.570
And I think that notion of
constantly chasing the next

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.460
performance metric is
really important.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.150
In Compute Engine, for example,
as part of the

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.430
sign-ups we demonstrated
spinning up a thousand VMs--

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.380
or just a couple hundred VMs.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.530
Don't want to oversell.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:07.329
And our VMs are currently
starting up in the range of 20

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:08.960
to 30 seconds to sort
up in a VM.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.230
When we talk to customers, they
say, oh, that's amazing.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.960
That's phenomenal.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.079
But we look at that and
go, OK, that's fine.

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:19.490
But that's not really
where we want to be.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:20.819
And the reason is we really
want to change

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.190
the way people work.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:23.990
An example--

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.710
one of the things we announced
today that I really think is

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.080
going to change the way people
think about cloud applications

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.220
is around--

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.430
this may sound mundane, but
it's around billing.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.800
Today, with almost every cloud
provider, your time is

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.970
measured in hours.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.710
So if you make a 15-minute
compute job,

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:44.040
you pay for an hour.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.410
It's sort of like if I made a
phone call from 15 minutes and

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.340
the phone company charged
me for an hour.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.900
That wouldn't be right.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.080
Well, because our VMs start up
so fast, we actually charge by

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.590
the minute.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.000
There's a 10-minute minimum.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.630
But then after that, you
only pay for the

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.080
actual minutes you use.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.930
And we think this really kind
of changes the way people

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:02.840
think about problems.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.980
You can start to throw cores
at a problem, if you will.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.960
Like, why not double the number
of cores and make the

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.450
job take 20 minutes instead
of 40 minutes?

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.850
Because now, I can do that.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.230
And actually, it's cost
effective to do that.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.920
So we think the performance, the
sub hour billing is going

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.750
to open up a lot of new ways for
people to use computing.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.710
So that's probably, in the
non-product area, one of the

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.460
things I think is most
interesting and we're getting

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.190
a lot of good response for.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.010
But you couldn't do that if we
didn't nail the startup time

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.660
and make the performance
really fast.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.170
But you're right, so doing
performance in one area then

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.380
opens up new possibilities
in others.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.030
DANIEL SIEBERG: I know we're
running out of time, but I

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.550
would love if you could
address the idea of

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.880
information security, which is
obviously something I'm sure

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.240
that you think about a lot.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.330
But in terms of the ISO standard
that's applied to

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.210
managing data and all of that,
I think that's absolutely

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:00.770
worth talking about.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:01.040
GREG DEMICHILLIE: Yeah.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.690
So obviously, at Google, it's
critically important that we

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.710
have-- information security
is just a core part of

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.710
everything we do.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.640
But what customers want is
they want some external

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.210
validation of that.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:17.190
And the ISO standard
27001 is that.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.720
They come through and they audit
your physical security

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.220
of your data centers, your
logical security, your access

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.210
control privileges.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.040
They can come in and do audits
at various points and times.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.540
And so we have now completed the
ISO 27000 certification on

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.410
App Engine, Compute Engine,
and cloud storage.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.590
And one of the things we've
heard from, particularly some

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:41.640
of the larger customers, is that
it's a confidence sign.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.220
And we're going to continue to
do more certifications as time

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.800
goes forward because we think
they're a good way of

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.150
demonstrating how important
security is and how seriously

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.070
we take it at Google.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.980
But you're right, it's
foundational to the whole

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.210
notion of doing cloud
computing.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.070
So I was really happy
that we did that.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:05.480
And again, stepping back, it's
another example where we have

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.240
to invest in security
for our own

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.510
purposes, anyway, for Google.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.740
And again, then the external
developers can just take

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.600
advantage of that.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.680
So yeah, I was glad that we got
that and we were able to

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.360
announce that today.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.140
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.410
LOUIS GRAY: And I'm glad you
were able to join us.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.540
I really appreciate you
waiting to do the

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.160
last slot of day one.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:22.450
GREG DEMICHILLIE: No problem.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.020
I'm in between the attendees
and I think

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.050
like food and drink.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.600
So I appreciate the
chance to be here.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.410
LOUIS GRAY: It's been
really exciting to

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.500
talk about Cloud Platform.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.560
I mean, the kind of scale that
we have at Google is really

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:32.990
tremendous.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:34.790
I'm really glad to see that
we're really taking that to

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.230
the development community.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.480
One thing we do at GDL is we
talk to our developers every

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.710
day throughout the year, in
their language, in their time

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.570
zone, from a location
that makes sense.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:44.560
We're real excited to
do that at I/O.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:44.845
GREG DEMICHILLIE: Yeah.

00:20:44.845 --> 00:20:45.990
And encourage developers
to try it

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.130
out and give us feedback.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.790
We have product forums.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.110
We have pre-release forums.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:51.900
We have issue trackers.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.050
We want to hear.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.720
The PHP is a classic example.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.170
PHP was partly driven by the
fact that we had direct

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:58.670
feedback from you just
saying we want this.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.970
So we want to hear from people
about what's the next thing

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.485
that they would like
to see us do.

00:21:03.485 --> 00:21:03.820
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.120
Great.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.640
Well, thank you so much.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.370
Daniel Sieberg and I will be
back here tomorrow morning.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.040
I'm really looking
forward to that.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.260
We kick off our GDL at I/O
broadcasting even before the

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.320
sessions kick off tomorrow,
from 9:00 to 10:00 AM.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.000
What we're going to be doing
is showcasing a lot of the

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.470
work you did in the sandboxes.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.370
DANIEL SIEBERG: Exactly.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.640
That's what I was doing for
the better part of this

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.090
afternoon, was wandering
around to different

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.240
sandboxes--

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:25.930
YouTube.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.030
We talked to some folks about
Drive, Google+, and, of

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:29.970
course, Maps.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.590
So we're going to bring all
of that to you tomorrow.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.850
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:33.900
So we're going to run through
those sandbox partners and we

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:34.900
have a really special treat.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.560
We're going to have Bradley
Horowitz from Google+ to do a

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.890
deep dive around lunchtime
tomorrow for those of you in

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.280
the Pacific side.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.220
So we welcome you coming back
and talking GDL at I/O.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.500
In the meantime, subscribe to
Google Developers on YouTube.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.070
You won't miss a single thing
from us throughout the year.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.270
And check us out at
developers/google.com/live.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.520
We'll see you tomorrow morning.
