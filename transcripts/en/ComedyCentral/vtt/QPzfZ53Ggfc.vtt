00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:12.112
Go. GO!

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.548
What do you want?

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:16.416
Go down the slide,
or get out of the way.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.151
You think I even want
to be here, Kyle?

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.554
My therapist told me
I need to force myself to go out

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:22.556
and do things
to overcome my anxiety.

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:24.558
Can we move him, please?

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:25.826
Oh, oh, I see.

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:27.661
People with anxiety shouldn't
be allowed at water parks,

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:28.896
is that it, Kyle?

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:30.797
Hey, everybody,
just so you know,

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:33.267
Kyle thinks people with anxiety
should just stay home.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:34.968
Yeah. I'm trying to
come out of my shell,

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.871
but Dr. Kyle here is just
worried about his place in line.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:45.212
Get off my towel.
Get off my towel.

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:47.948
Goddamn it. I seriously
can't get a minute of peace.

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:49.416
Why is it that people
who don't have

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:50.651
a Buddha box
are always flipping

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:52.586
Buddha boxes off the heads
of people with anxiety?

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:55.322
I got news for you, Cartman.
Everyone has anxiety.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.724
Everyone gets nervous.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.559
Everyone is afraid
being around people.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.929
Everyone has feelings
they'd rather stay home alone.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.297
And you know what they do?

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:06.366
They get over it, and they stop
being a piece of shit.

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:09.703
Everyone has anxiety?

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:11.571
Yes.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.740
Oh my god, I know
what I have to do now.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.876
You're right, Kyle.
You're right.

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:19.112
What? No, no, what
did I just do?

00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:22.282
Should've just let him be
on his phone, dude.
