00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.700
Hey,

It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.701 --> 00:00:07.850
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
And Ah,

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.890
just checking in on you.

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.450
I'm just checking in on you to see how your work weeks ago and

5
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.050
you know,
fucking weird one this year.
It's 4th of July on a Wednesday.
You know,

6
00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:24.170
if it's on the Tuesday,
maybe your boss gives you the Monday off,
right?

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.550
You got a three day fucking week after a four day weekend.
It's beautiful.

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.240
You know,
it's on Thursday.
Maybe you don't have to come in Friday.

9
00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:36.920
There's your four day fucking weekend.
Not this year.
Ah,
no.

10
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.000
All fucking powdered wig itself came in on a Wednesday.

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.560
Fucked everybody Monday.
Tuesday.
Right?

12
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.840
Everybody fucks off for Wednesday.
Now you gotta come back Thursday,
Friday.

13
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.650
It's cool to get the day off,
but you didn't get the consecutive days off,

14
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:59.120
you know?
Do you know he got fucked up the night of July 3rd,
right?
And yesterday.

15
00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:03.190
What'd you do?
You eat a bunch of fucking burgers?
Is that what you did?
Uh,

16
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.320
I am finally on the other side of this.
God damn cold.

17
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.860
I caught one of these posts,
global warming,

18
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:15.090
Mother Nature is going to start getting rid of us called this fucking thing.

19
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.380
It came on slow,
you know,

20
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.910
and then it just started picking up speed and it just grabbed me by the fucking

21
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:28.230
throat and just choke,
slammed me.
Uh,

22
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.240
yeah.
So I'm finally,
finally on the other side of it though.

23
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.690
He wouldn't know what to hear me right now,
but I am,
um,

24
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.350
I want to thank all you guys for your postcards and your well wishes

25
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.490
meant a lot to me.
You know,

26
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.970
when I was sitting there laying there in the hospital bed,
uh,

27
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.660
I actually was the first guy who ever went to the hospital for a common cold in

28
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.370
uh,
the San Fernando Fernando Valley area.

29
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.500
They made a plaque for me and everything.

30
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.490
I went in there and the doctor was just like looking at my chart.

31
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.480
They find looked up,
he's like,
so you got the sniffles?
And I was like,
yeah.

32
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.401
It's like,
you know,

33
00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:13.490
I have a whole emergency room full of people that got stabbed and shot.

34
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.600
And I was like,
yeah,
I know.

35
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:18.980
But like one of my nostrils is like really clogged up and I just can't like deal

36
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:22.670
man.
Um,
I tell you guys,
I saw that,

37
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:26.930
that documentary on Mark Ronson
that his name,

38
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.300
no,
not mark Ronson.

39
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.620
The fucking guy who played with David Bowie is Mark Ronson,
the guy,

40
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.193
Mick Ronson.

41
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.710
Mick Ronson is the one mark Ronson is this is your mother,

42
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:43.950
your father,
your sister,
whatever that fucking song is.

43
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.570
It's Jalyn by in eight and some peanut butter.

44
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.920
It's a fucking [inaudible].
Dabba do let me see your titties,

45
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.050
right?
Isn't that how that song went?
Uh,

46
00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.593
Mick

47
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.250
play with David Bowie when he was Ziggy start us in the spiders and I'm fucking

48
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:10.320
incredible guitarist.
Credible musician,

49
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.930
a producer wrote songs,
you know,

50
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.970
learn how to write out all the music and all this shit.

51
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:20.500
And he got no fucking credit.
Got No fucking credit,
didn't get any money.

52
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.610
They fucked him.
I just,

53
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:26.500
the music business is the absolute worst.

54
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:30.520
I can't tell you how many fucking times I've seen that.

55
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:32.270
<v 2>Okay.</v>

56
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.650
<v 1>You know,
the drummer and the Bass player on those first two Ozzie Solo albums,</v>

57
00:03:36.651 --> 00:03:41.070
like they just,
they just fuck those guys.
They just,

58
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.413
you know,

59
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.730
guys coming in and writing riffs and writing entire fucking songs,

60
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.090
but they're two,
they don't have a good lawyer.
Nobody tells them what's up.

61
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.770
They don't get the,
uh,
you know,

62
00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:56.370
and then it's like sound by Ozzy Osborne and then did they get fucked out of

63
00:03:56.371 --> 00:03:58.860
millions of dollars?
How do you do that to a kid?

64
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.510
It's just this reoccurring thing in the fucking music business is fucking guy

65
00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:09.840
was writing all these riffs.
He was writing the string arrangements.

66
00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:14.360
He was in the fucking studio with one of those conductor ones.
They didn't,

67
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.660
you didn't get any fucking credit.

68
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.890
It's fucking brutal.
Uh,
but what was amazing was watching the guy,
uh,

69
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.930
I saw him,
I was like,
Jesus Christ,

70
00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:28.050
that guy looks like fucking Randy Rhoads same haircut,

71
00:04:28.051 --> 00:04:30.030
same fucking Les Paul and all that.
I'm like,
wait,

72
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.670
Randy Rhodes came after Mick Ronson.
So then I just looked googled Randy Rhoads,

73
00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:37.980
a Mick Ronson influence at a bunch of Shit,

74
00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:42.060
came out saying that he was a fan of thought that was pretty cool,
you know,

75
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.090
and already had more of the classical guitar type of stuff in there.
But,

76
00:04:45.091 --> 00:04:49.710
you know,
say,
uh,
let's see.
Yeah,
it's a good documentary.

77
00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:51.990
I saw it on a plane though.
You know,
whenever you want to play at every,

78
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.220
everything's fucking good guys.
I look lady,
I fucking,
I'm still,

79
00:04:56.221 --> 00:04:59.260
I'm coming out of this shit man.
You know,

80
00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:02.660
I don't know what it feels like to be trapped in a mine.
Yeah,
I'll fuck.

81
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.120
Are there some kids right now trapped somewhere?
The news is just so brutal.

82
00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:10.330
I just,
I wasn't ready to,
I just see like the headline.
I just go,
ah,

83
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.710
I just walk away.

84
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:14.650
I don't know how people just sit there watching other people's suffering.

85
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.940
It's one thing to say,
hey,
these kids are trapped in a mine right over there.

86
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.280
Grab a shovel,
come with me.
Then you can do something.

87
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.490
But they just know this sitting there and there's nothing you can fucking do

88
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:29.100
about it.
You know,
Kinda fucked.

89
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.420
Do a bunch of kids end up in a month?
Is that what happened?
They had a mine,

90
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.130
I had a fucking movie stuck on a giant lily pad or something like that in the

91
00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:38.880
middle of the river.
I don't know.
I bet.
Uh,
you know,

92
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.050
I've been like fucking hallucinating all God damn week.
But,
uh,

93
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.130
one of the good things about being this sick as I haven't drank in like fucking

94
00:05:47.131 --> 00:05:50.970
five days,
you know,
and uh,

95
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.600
I got some active work next week,
so whenever I got acting work,

96
00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:58.040
I shut down all the fun,
you know.
Oh Billy,
no fund,

97
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.620
<v 3>you know,
try to keep my face not fucking,
I'll fucking puffy and shit.</v>

98
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.800
Um,
so anyways,
Oh God,
I got nothing.

99
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.960
Jesus Christ.
They got nothing.
But I gotta knock this up.

100
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.473
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

101
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.520
<v 1>This is how funny I am when I'm fucking sick for five days.</v>

102
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.270
I'm basically not funny at all.
Okay.

103
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.120
And I would appreciate it if you guys would just cut me a little bit of

104
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.460
<v 3>fucking slack.
All right.
You know what I had,
I had a few,</v>

105
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.930
uh,
I fucked up,
uh,

106
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.490
when I was uploading the Monday morning podcast when,
uh,

107
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.880
they can,
my,
the battery on my laptop died.

108
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.740
<v 1>So 15 minutes in the middle got cut out.
So we had to edit it,
edit it together.</v>

109
00:06:43.741 --> 00:06:47.610
So there's some fucking people wrote in some questions that I'm going to re

110
00:06:47.611 --> 00:06:48.990
answer them the best I can.

111
00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:51.890
By the way on Instagram I found this account that I've been following

112
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.600
<v 3>called don't be a Brad and it's basically a trashing like essentially a meathead</v>

113
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.010
white guy,
frat boys.

114
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.753
<v 4>MMM.</v>

115
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.290
<v 1>You know,
it's funny,
they kind of,
they kind of,
you know,</v>

116
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.170
it's hilarious because you know,
there's a lot of truth to it.

117
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:15.860
But then also it's like you completely judging these people by their skin color

118
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.860
and nobody gives a fuck cause it's fucking white guys.

119
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:22.900
But a lot of them are just really good looking guys who are in frats and they're

120
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.690
getting a lot of pussy and your fucking annoyed by it because you're a nerd.

121
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.870
So you started this account.
Having said that,
it is funny,

122
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.700
like they literally have one of them yelling at about six.

123
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.430
Do you know what my dad does?

124
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.663
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

125
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.480
<v 1>You know,
and everybody makes fun of these Frat kids.</v>

126
00:07:42.481 --> 00:07:45.180
It's not their fucking fault,
it's their parents.

127
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.790
It's like making fun of millennials.
It's like,
it's not,

128
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.670
it's the people who raised them that fucked them up.

129
00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:55.140
But it's a very funny account
I'll be in.
A lot of it,

130
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.840
you know,
is just unathletic people making fun of people who are athletic.

131
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.590
Um,
and then there's also something to where,
you know,

132
00:08:04.591 --> 00:08:08.550
there's a curse to be in fucking good looking.
You know,

133
00:08:08.551 --> 00:08:09.600
I was reading this one time,

134
00:08:09.601 --> 00:08:14.010
this article in rolling stone in this guy who was just like this heartthrob for

135
00:08:14.011 --> 00:08:18.480
fucking 15 years was now like in his sixties and he was doing this fucking,

136
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.350
this interview and they were talking to him and he was reflecting on what kind

137
00:08:22.351 --> 00:08:27.180
of a person he was back in his twenties in his thirties he said,
well,
you know,

138
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.290
I was,
he was basically saying he was a really good looking guy.

139
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.400
He was on a TV show and in movies and he had a big Dick.

140
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.810
So he only had to develop so much as a human being.

141
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:41.483
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

142
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.750
<v 1>it was really fascinating.
So then when he got old,</v>

143
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.580
he wasn't as good looking.
He was creepy to younger women and shit.

144
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:55.610
He actually had to finish developing all development as a human that he never

145
00:08:56.671 --> 00:09:00.330
had to do before because all he did was just show up in all the women.

146
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.770
Faith did that.
He pulled out his giant Dick,
you know,
or he fucking went to town.

147
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.241
It was dealt with.

148
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:09.330
Daddy went back down to the movie set and made another hit movie.
It was very,

149
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:11.430
very interesting.
So I actually was thinking of that.

150
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.530
What I was looking at that don't be a Brad.
Okay.

151
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.803
<v 4>Uh,</v>

152
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.620
<v 1>Instagram account.
Well,</v>

153
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.540
it's like this isn't these kids 100% their fault.

154
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.690
Like if your kid is walking around and acting like an asshole and then go and do

155
00:09:25.691 --> 00:09:30.160
you know what my dad does for a living?
Uh,
you spoiled the shit out of that kid.

156
00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.080
That's your fucking fault.
That,

157
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.880
I mean that's complete failure as a dad.

158
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.260
If your kids out there being a fucking,
you know,

159
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.540
Mauldin off to some bouncer that could fucking twist them up like a pretzel and

160
00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:46.090
then screaming like,
my dad's going to come down here.

161
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.210
<v 4>Oh my God.
I just be like son,
son.</v>

162
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.840
<v 1>Fight your own battles.
Like what are you doing?</v>

163
00:09:53.841 --> 00:09:57.260
I'm going to come down here and do what?
Sue Him cause you're a fucking asshole.

164
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.330
I don't want to see you get a concussion but he should have slapped the shit out

165
00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:02.990
of you.
All right.
Republican?
Yes.

166
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.640
<v 4>Douche question mark.
Uh,
hey bill,</v>

167
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.350
I'm a fan of your comedy.

168
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.680
<v 1>I'm still a fan of you,</v>

169
00:10:11.681 --> 00:10:15.650
but artistically you're starting to sound like a red pill.
Republican Douche bag.

170
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.070
You know,

171
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:22.540
isn't it just classically classical like way that the politics is discussed now?

172
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:24.803
<v 4>You know,</v>

173
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.080
<v 1>like his whole,
the thing is called Republican douchey question mark.</v>

174
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.080
I like,
I don't understand these people where if,

175
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.140
if you're a republican that automatically you're a Douche.

176
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.260
If you're a democrat you're automatically a Douche.
You know what I mean?

177
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:43.330
You know?
You know what I'm saying?
Like,
like,
you don't think anybody on either.

178
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.690
Like everybody on that side is just douche bags.
Um,

179
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.240
anyways,
he goes,
no offense,

180
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.340
you're always going on about how Hillary is evil while our country is going down

181
00:10:55.341 --> 00:10:59.690
the shitter.
And she would've saved us from a lot of these headaches.

182
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.820
All right,
well that's pretty vague.

183
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.150
Our country has been going down the shitter for a long time,
sir.

184
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.910
I don't know what you're talking about when exactly,

185
00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:13.720
wasn't it going down the shitter?
You know,
I was speaking to that,

186
00:11:13.721 --> 00:11:17.770
you know,
back in the,
uh,
of that fucking don't be a Brad.

187
00:11:17.771 --> 00:11:22.771
One of the frat boys had Ronald Reagan tattooed on his calf.

188
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.970
Not a picture.
It just said Ronald Reagan.
That fucking was,

189
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.200
that's hilarious to me.

190
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.073
<v 4>You know,</v>

191
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.650
<v 1>Ronald Reagan is like rich white people's Abraham Lincoln.</v>

192
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.240
Like he set them free in a way by,
you know,

193
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.290
by,
you know,
deregulating everything.

194
00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:48.560
So then these fucking robber barons could get back to what the fuck they wanted

195
00:11:48.561 --> 00:11:52.990
to be doing.
Um,
oh look at that.
I just made fun of her,

196
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:58.360
sir.
Uh,
do I sound like a red pill?
Republican Douche bag will be this guy.

197
00:11:58.361 --> 00:12:02.770
He's like literally speaking in soundbites like how fucking like how boring a

198
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:07.490
conversation,
what to discuss politics with this person.
Um,

199
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.660
anyways,
he say you say you don't like Trump Trump,

200
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:16.080
but you sound like a closet fan who's just too afraid to say you love him cause

201
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.140
you lose a part donut store.
Employee number two.

202
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.320
Thank you.
Missed a word in there buddy.
Um,

203
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.640
I'm not afraid to say that I like Trump.
If I like Trump,
I don't like him.

204
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:29.010
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

205
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.240
<v 1>I don't like him.
And</v>

206
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:31.170
<v 2>yeah,</v>

207
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.490
<v 1>his fucking wife.</v>

208
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.750
The fact that she wore that jacket that said I don't really care to you.

209
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.230
When she was going to see those kids and then tried to say like,

210
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.500
oh that had to do with fake news like this,

211
00:12:43.501 --> 00:12:48.380
such passive aggressive fucking pussies.
Yeah.

212
00:12:48.381 --> 00:12:50.210
That had nothing to do with fake news.

213
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.550
Like you're telling me nobody at the White House.
This is about fake news.
Well a,

214
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.360
just to let you know if they are first lady,

215
00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.370
people might think you're talking about the kids,

216
00:12:58.371 --> 00:13:03.370
you might not want to wear that.
It was such like a fucking,
you know,

217
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.490
it's bad enough when a guy's that ignorant bought a woman,
does it?

218
00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:07.780
She's actually had kids.

219
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.500
She knows what it's like to have a fucking kid and they sit there and have these

220
00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:14.440
kids and fucking cages and she wears a jacket like that.
It's just,

221
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.580
and I was fucking,
they're not human.
So anyways.
Um,

222
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:19.970
<v 2>yeah,</v>

223
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.290
<v 1>he said,
I can't tell if it's set.</v>

224
00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:24.770
Your fan base is all a bunch of moderate morons.

225
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:26.280
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

226
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.020
<v 1>Who would rather be concern contrarians than pick the good guys are the bad
guys.</v>

227
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.670
Why don't you just pick a side because clearly this is a good guy,

228
00:13:35.671 --> 00:13:39.330
bad guy thing going on here.
Question Mark.
Uh,

229
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.990
that's probably one of the most ignorant,
condescending fucking,

230
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.180
<v 2>yeah.</v>

231
00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.940
<v 1>Emails I've ever gotten.
You didn't make one fucking point.</v>

232
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.560
You just spoken big broad soundbites.
I get it.
I get it.

233
00:13:51.561 --> 00:13:54.140
You're a Democrat and you think everybody who's a Republican,

234
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.290
he's a Douche and the country's going down the shitter.

235
00:13:57.291 --> 00:13:59.990
And if we picked a Democrat,
it wouldn't be going down the shitter.

236
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.180
And there are good guys and there are bad guys.

237
00:14:02.181 --> 00:14:06.380
And the good guys are Democrats are the bad guys are Republicans.
Right?
Hey,

238
00:14:06.381 --> 00:14:11.030
by the way,
did you see the house,
the Obama's just fucking bought,
you know,

239
00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.430
how the fuck did they have the money to buy that fucking house?

240
00:14:13.431 --> 00:14:16.820
Explain that to me.
You know,
every fucking one of them,

241
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.590
whether you wear a blue tie or a red tie,

242
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.410
they come out of the White House worth fucking,
you know,

243
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:24.710
tens of millions of dollars other than Bill Clinton because he stuck his cigar.

244
00:14:24.711 --> 00:14:27.830
That woman's Pussy.
He had a lot of fucking legal bills.
Uh,

245
00:14:27.831 --> 00:14:30.140
but even they give her the fucking Clinton set it up with Pete.

246
00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:31.191
Hundreds of billions.
Well,

247
00:14:31.191 --> 00:14:33.830
actually Bill Clinton said he came out of the White House in debt,

248
00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.350
but he also said audit not have sex with that woman.

249
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.610
So he probably had fucking millions of dollars.
Uh,
I don't like any of them,
sir.

250
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.290
I don't,
uh,
I liked,
uh,

251
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.720
Bernie Sanders,
Bernie Sanders.
I liked,

252
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.430
I'm not saying he would've solved everything,
but uh,
God knows CIB.

253
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.580
He,
he got,
he got the majority of the vote and the Democrats said,
fuck that.

254
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.890
We're still giving the Dobbin the domination to Hillary.

255
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.240
And she was fine with that.

256
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:06.920
That had the fucking nerve to sit there and bitch about the fucking election.
Uh,

257
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:11.690
that last election was 2:00 AM at a bar,
sir.
There was no,
there was no wedding.

258
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.610
There was no winning.
That one.
Uh,
I mean,

259
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.750
Hillary literally said in 2008 to the bankers.
Don't worry.

260
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:23.540
I got you guys like out basically cover for you guys.
I mean,

261
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.490
you should be tried for fucking trees and when you do shit like that,
uh,

262
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:32.030
I don't see any difference between her or Trump.
I don't,
they're complete,
uh,

263
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.650
pieces of shit that are out for themselves who act like they're there for you.

264
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.370
And it's weird if they were a certain color fucking shirt

265
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.240
some half the country believes it.
Uh,
all right.

266
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:48.080
25 year old buying an old house.

267
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.160
All right.
Hey,
Billy doughboy from 25 years old,

268
00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:54.890
just graduated with my masters and got a dream job.

269
00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:56.590
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

270
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.410
<v 1>a dream teaching job in Philly.</v>

271
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.830
You're teaching in Philadelphia where you got your work cut out for you.

272
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.463
Fuck with you.

273
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.063
<v 5>MMM.</v>

274
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.370
<v 1>Anyways,
I got my dream job teaching in Philadelphia.</v>

275
00:16:11.371 --> 00:16:13.830
Where the fuck did it just go?
I just lost everything here.

276
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.540
Oh,
belly.
All right.

277
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.190
Okay.
With how cheap the housing market is.

278
00:16:24.191 --> 00:16:28.060
I figured it would be a smart decision to buy a house now rather than wait 10

279
00:16:28.061 --> 00:16:32.950
years.
Uh,
I found a great old house in Philly.
It's in my price.

280
00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:35.350
Wage should be price range,

281
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.340
move in ready and has all the details I love about old houses.

282
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.340
They accepted my offer and they closed at the end of the month.
That's exciting.

283
00:16:42.341 --> 00:16:45.520
25 years old and you got a house dude,
you get your dream job,
you're crushing it.

284
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.670
I gotta do is pick the right lady and you're good.

285
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.160
You pick the wrong one and she'll take all of it from you.

286
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:55.600
But you won't see that Hashtag on Twitter.
Will Ya?
Uh,

287
00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.540
after listening to your podcast for a couple of years,

288
00:16:58.541 --> 00:17:01.390
I know that you have a love hate relationship with your old house.
Yes I do.

289
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.210
Is there any advice that you have for me,

290
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.930
for me as I move in and make my first real adult purchase?

291
00:17:07.931 --> 00:17:12.190
Thanks for keeping me and many other teachers saying with your podcast.
Um,

292
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.160
all right,
well if you're going to buy an old houses,
uh,
Jesus,

293
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.270
I don't even know where to begin.

294
00:17:18.271 --> 00:17:22.380
The first thing I would start with is the guts of the house.
Uh,
if he,

295
00:17:22.381 --> 00:17:23.191
if he got the money,

296
00:17:23.191 --> 00:17:27.000
if you can redo the electrical and the plumbing or find out to what extent it

297
00:17:27.001 --> 00:17:31.440
has been redone because I had a bunch of cloth wiring and galvanized pipes in my

298
00:17:31.441 --> 00:17:34.860
walls.
You don't want to fire and you don't want to get flooded.

299
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:39.360
So that's usually a big thing there.
Um,

300
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:40.920
<v 5>yeah,</v>

301
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.790
<v 1>yeah,
I say had a minor gas leak,
you might want to look for stuff like that.</v>

302
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.760
Once you get to the guts
that I would deal with the,

303
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.840
as far as,
um,
you know,
there's gonna be a bunch of Shit,
you know,

304
00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:58.860
I check out your roof.
That's another thing I would check for termites.

305
00:17:58.890 --> 00:17:59.790
That's another thing.

306
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:02.953
<v 4>MMM.</v>

307
00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:08.050
<v 1>I actually have all like the skeleton keys for every door in the house that I</v>

308
00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:11.330
got them.
So they all work.
And then within two and a half,

309
00:18:11.331 --> 00:18:13.500
three years of doing it,
the house settled some more.

310
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.030
And now most of the bolts don't line up with the thing.
And I just,

311
00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:18.140
I just stopped fighting the house after a while.
It's just like,
all right,

312
00:18:18.141 --> 00:18:22.810
I get it.
This house is almost a hundred years old and,
uh,

313
00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.850
it's going to do what the fuck it wants to do.
So,
um,
I would just,
you know,

314
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.300
once you get the electrical,
the plumbing done,
that's like the biggest thing,

315
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:33.680
then you can slowly kind of fix up everything else.
But a,

316
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.930
and what I tried to do is,
um,

317
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.610
you know,
as I upgrade,
like,
you know,
you upgrade the electrical and the plumbing,

318
00:18:42.611 --> 00:18:45.400
nobody's going to see that.
So,
you know,
fuck with the character of the house.

319
00:18:45.401 --> 00:18:49.030
But like,
uh,
the worst,
the worst thing you can do is,

320
00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.230
is to take stuff out of your house and replace it with Home Depot Shit.

321
00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:54.581
Um,

322
00:18:54.581 --> 00:18:59.581
I would find some sort of old school hardware store that has just that,

323
00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:04.360
those old doors from,
um,
the time of your house.
You can find those places.

324
00:19:04.361 --> 00:19:08.050
They'll have all the door knobs and all the locks and all of that shit.

325
00:19:08.051 --> 00:19:11.800
You can gradually just go room by room and Redo it.
Um,

326
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.780
and once you're fine with your old doors,
not only the an odd size,

327
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.210
they're also really heavy because,
um,

328
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:24.390
back then the trees they were cutting down were much older than it's not wet

329
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.760
wood or something that's more dense wood.
I don't really understand it,

330
00:19:27.761 --> 00:19:32.761
but they're super heavy as opposed to all these shit would and fucking crap that

331
00:19:33.281 --> 00:19:36.760
they have down at the,
uh,
home depot.
And the worst thing,

332
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.450
what I like about your email is that you actually seem to love old houses

333
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.970
because there's nothing worse than someone who doesn't give a fuck about it.

334
00:19:42.971 --> 00:19:45.970
Old House buys it just to flip it.
And it's funny,

335
00:19:45.971 --> 00:19:49.270
as they got the house to give it a makeover and everything,

336
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:52.030
the guys that got it keep all the shit and then they take it down to those

337
00:19:52.031 --> 00:19:55.300
hardware stores and they sell it.
And that assholes like me,

338
00:19:55.301 --> 00:19:59.890
you have to fucking buy it back to fucking make the house look right again.

339
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.820
Um,
all right.
That's my advice.

340
00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.990
My advice is the plumbing,
the electrical and your roof.

341
00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.160
That's what I would start with.

342
00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.880
Then you can deal with all the fucking drafts and all the other bullshit.

343
00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:15.723
<v 4>MMM.</v>

344
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:20.180
<v 1>All right.
I'm sorry guys.
My energy is just fuck,
I got nothing.
All right.</v>

345
00:20:20.181 --> 00:20:24.260
French guy with muscular dystrophy looking for lady advice.

346
00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.070
Most share William t rouge.

347
00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.600
<v 4>Uh Huh.</v>

348
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.020
<v 1>What does that my something bill redhead.</v>

349
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.240
I'm a 39 year old man

350
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.980
and I've take it a fancy to this awesome lady.

351
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:45.780
We sometimes spend time together working on each other's professional and hobby

352
00:20:45.781 --> 00:20:48.580
projects and we have lots of fun.

353
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.910
The Times we do hang out together to specify we're not coworkers,

354
00:20:53.951 --> 00:20:57.070
but we have a similar circle of friends.
Here's the catch.

355
00:20:57.071 --> 00:21:02.071
She's 27 but I'm 39 and have a disease called muscular dystrophy in case you

356
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:07.000
don't know what it is.
It's a disease similar to the kid in the wheelchair,

357
00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:11.830
in the gym,
Jeffrey show and set.
Uh,
the differences that in my case,

358
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.760
I'm a hard headed guy,
refused to accept my fate.

359
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.150
It exercise like crazy as a young lad.

360
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.810
While I still had some muscle mass to be able to physically function well above

361
00:21:22.811 --> 00:21:26.100
expectations up to my adult years.
That's great.
Uh,

362
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.320
it's only showed a little in the way that I've walked,
but that's it.

363
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:36.600
Also being physically disabled has really,
uh,

364
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.240
maybe learn to not take anything for granted and focus on my strengths,

365
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:45.100
which is really increased by personality skills and gave me game enough to have

366
00:21:45.101 --> 00:21:48.640
a few great relationships,
not lower my standards and it's worked so far.

367
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.750
All right,
so what is the problem sir?
This seems,
it seems all good.

368
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.233
Uh,
anyways,

369
00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.650
since I've developed feelings for this 27 year old girl,

370
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.280
I've been hesitant to tell her about it.
If she says no and rejects me,

371
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.410
no big deal.
I've been rejected before,

372
00:22:05.411 --> 00:22:08.650
like most other guys out there and it's something I can handle.

373
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.920
It's basically going to suck for a couple of days tops and everything is fine

374
00:22:11.921 --> 00:22:16.780
after that.
But I guess I'm more afraid if she says yes,
she's still young.

375
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.550
I'm hitting the gym as much as I can to keep myself out of any wheelchair and

376
00:22:21.551 --> 00:22:25.630
crutches and slow this thing down as much as I can.
However,
in the past 10 years,

377
00:22:25.631 --> 00:22:28.740
this disease has really been taking a toll on me,
Jesus Christ.

378
00:22:28.741 --> 00:22:31.840
I think that it's shit that I bitch about this.
Someone dealing with this crap.

379
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.590
I feel my body is going downhill to the point that stairs now look like

380
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:39.550
mountains.
If I fall,
I can't get up on my own,
which is scary to me.

381
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.880
This girl has been single for a while and has been complaining about being

382
00:22:42.881 --> 00:22:46.390
single,
but she's also young and as her whole life ahead of her and I'm not sure

383
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.270
if I'm still going to be able to wipe,

384
00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:53.110
be able to wipe my own ass in 10 years and I don't want to put someone through

385
00:22:53.111 --> 00:22:57.430
the same pain in the future as that woman had family guy was married to Joe in

386
00:22:57.431 --> 00:23:02.320
the wheelchair.
Uh,
should I invest my feelings and not regret it,
you know,

387
00:23:02.321 --> 00:23:03.340
so at least I tried,

388
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:06.310
or should I just keep it to myself and not waste a vital part of her life?

389
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:11.140
She does say yes.
MERCI beaucoup.
The Leer.

390
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:16.600
Amen.
See Shit.
Just sweet frank quote.
Well,
I don't know what the fuck.

391
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.540
Thanks a lot.
MMM.

392
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:23.450
<v 2>Okay.</v>

393
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.660
<v 1>And same if I am something.</v>

394
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:28.873
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

395
00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.170
<v 1>I don't.
What is your see quo,
ma'am?</v>

396
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.300
I mean literally that's I am when?
Same

397
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.970
on gross budget.
Okay.

398
00:23:38.971 --> 00:23:43.860
I'm a big fan of the Bruins and I hate the Montreal Canadians with a passion.

399
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:47.060
He wrote that in French.
Did Tesla,
Canadians de Monterrey,

400
00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:51.830
all of echo on Paschall.
Just we call mail.
Oh,
girl.

401
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.620
Participant.
They Bruins.
Um,

402
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.070
I would fucking tell her everything you said to me said,
listen,

403
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.700
I got feelings for you.
I really like your partner.
I'm 39 years old.

404
00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:02.750
I have muscular dystrophy.

405
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:05.700
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

406
00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.040
<v 1>And I don't want to waste your fucking,
I will know if I'd say all that.</v>

407
00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.310
I'd fucking ask around and then,
you know,

408
00:24:11.311 --> 00:24:13.980
if you guys hit it off then I would say all that other shit,

409
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:18.650
<v 4>you know?
Does that make sense?</v>

410
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.780
<v 1>Just don't dump the whole thing on it though.</v>

411
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.310
Still talk about him ever having to wipe your ass in 10 years have figured

412
00:24:24.311 --> 00:24:25.360
that'd be a fucking buzzkill.

413
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:27.653
<v 4>MMM.</v>

414
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:31.820
<v 1>But you know,
you do want to be fucking up front.
I would,
I would think,</v>

415
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:33.953
<v 4>uh,</v>

416
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.030
<v 1>I got a buddy of mine,
his wife's like that.
She's got the same thing.</v>

417
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.460
I tell her she has ms hectic.

418
00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.320
So she has like days where she's like super tired and everything.
Uh,

419
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:49.320
why do I complain about Dumb Shit?
Lay for this?
People like this out there.
Uh,

420
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:50.660
sir.
I would ask her out.

421
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:52.533
<v 4>Okay.</v>

422
00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:58.520
<v 1>She's a big girl.
She's fucking 27 years old.
All right.
Ask her out.</v>

423
00:24:59.480 --> 00:24:59.870
Do every year.

424
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.080
You're probably fucking live in more in the moment than most people.
Um,

425
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.500
you know,
fuck.
I mean,
life flies by.

426
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.720
Forget about when you're dealing with some shit that you're dealing with.

427
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:15.290
So you know,
you're a good guy.
You're actually care about it.
You know,

428
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.720
she care about another person like that.

429
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:22.460
You don't want to waste the best part of their life dealing with you.

430
00:25:22.461 --> 00:25:27.350
But,
um,
who knows?
Maybe you guys hit it off,
ask her out,
dude,
ask her out,

431
00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:29.900
you know,
but then it moves on to another level.

432
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:34.340
Then I would talk about that other stuff and see what she says.
Um,
all right.

433
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:38.990
Drug dealing roommate.
Well,
this is going to be easy.
Um,
move out or kick them up.

434
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.680
All right.
Hey,
Billy,
ball breaker.
I'm from the,
I'm from right outside of Philly.

435
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.860
Another one.
Don't hold it against me.
Dom Arrera is a good shit.

436
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:50.360
I have nothing against Philadelphia.
I just had a fucking tough show there.
Okay.

437
00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:51.220
And I made fun of Philly.

438
00:25:51.221 --> 00:25:53.000
If I was somewhere else who would've mids in front of somewhere else,

439
00:25:53.001 --> 00:25:54.230
but I don't have a problem with it.
All right.

440
00:25:54.231 --> 00:25:58.030
But I'm 28 and one of my roommates is a deal.
Oh.

441
00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.550
And congratulations filling one of the super bowl.
You know,
I can say that now.

442
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.410
The pain's gone away.
Uh,

443
00:26:03.411 --> 00:26:08.411
it was great when I first moved in at 22 and I'll add to do for some pot was

444
00:26:09.231 --> 00:26:12.470
walk upstairs.
But now we've sort of grown up and he's pushing some other shit,

445
00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:14.690
which worries me about the safety of our crib.

446
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.100
Should I approach him and asks him to knock it off or just fuck his girlfriend

447
00:26:19.101 --> 00:26:22.730
and end the friendship.
That's hilarious.
Thanks.
And instead of go fuck yourself.

448
00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:25.610
I wish you the lovely Nia and your baby girl.
Nothing but the best.

449
00:26:25.611 --> 00:26:29.960
See you in AC in October.
Go Birds.
Uh,
go birds.

450
00:26:29.961 --> 00:26:34.640
Is that the Orioles?
Is that the eagles?
There's a lot of birds down there,
man.

451
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.360
Um,
what should you do?
Well,

452
00:26:39.361 --> 00:26:41.320
I don't think when somebody is dealing coke,

453
00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.103
<v 4>uh,</v>

454
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.760
<v 1>heroin,
what else would be up?
The ecstasy</v>

455
00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:50.653
<v 4>math.</v>

456
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:53.160
<v 1>I don't think you can just say,
hey,
we get knock it off.</v>

457
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:54.780
Like they have their stereo too loud.

458
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.810
I mean this person has made a decision that this is how they get to earn a

459
00:26:57.811 --> 00:27:02.730
living.
So I would get the fuck out of there is what I would do.
Um,

460
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:07.230
I would not fuck his girlfriend because he might be trying get his own fucking

461
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.410
drugs is drugs.

462
00:27:10.411 --> 00:27:12.900
Might tell them to do some fucking crazy to you while you're sleeping.

463
00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:15.750
So I would,
uh,
I get the fuck out there is what I would do

464
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.180
because one of these days you're going to be asleep and the door's going to get

465
00:27:20.181 --> 00:27:20.740
kicked in,

466
00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:24.890
is going to be the cops and you're gonna be fucking face down with a boot and

467
00:27:24.891 --> 00:27:27.380
your backend fucking handcuffed.
And then they're going to be like,

468
00:27:27.381 --> 00:27:32.090
did you know he's dealing drugs?
Uh,
know that he's going to write you up.
You,

469
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.110
let's bullshit.
He used to buy them off me.
Uh,
cause he's a piece of shit.

470
00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:37.730
Well maybe he's a good one.

471
00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:40.970
We use a drug dealer with a heart of gold and he gets you out of it.
Yes.

472
00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.690
You don't need that the fuck.
Get out of there.

473
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.350
Do you want names on the lease?
Uh,

474
00:27:49.351 --> 00:27:52.620
I would check them out if he doesn't leave that I would just find someplace else

475
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:57.360
to live.
Um,
all right.
Let me read a little advertising here.

The big fish eats it,

We bought some fancy fucking couch.
It's stinks.

511
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:10.090
It's too many pillows.
You just can't even relax on it.
I hate that couch.
Uh,

512
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.760

It wasn't us.

It was hymns.

546
00:32:25.551 --> 00:32:27.620
Can I tell you guys a fucking hilarious story?

547
00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:31.520
I was at the laugh factory a couple nights ago

548
00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.690
and I get off stage and this guy comes up to me

549
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:41.930
like he does hair transplant and he's got like his card,
right

550
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.520
when I just realized the volumes way down or this fucking thing.
Hello,
hello,

551
00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.580
hello.
So the guy fucking,

552
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.940
he comes up to me after my set,
he goes,
hey man,
I can fix that.

553
00:32:56.941 --> 00:32:58.980
I could fix that.
Talking about my bald head.

554
00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.800
And he's got this before and after photos gut.
Now here's the thing,

555
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:06.480
this is the third time.
This same guy has approached me.
All right?

556
00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.660
The first time it was,
it was fucking,
I laughed.
It was hilarious,

557
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.940
you know,
cause he said the same thing.
He came up to me,
he goes,
Hey,

558
00:33:14.941 --> 00:33:19.360
I can fix that.
I didn't go to his place and say Amen.

559
00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:22.110
I don't like the way I look.
You know,

560
00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:27.140
he just walked up to me and was so convinced that I thought I looked as awful as

561
00:33:28.471 --> 00:33:30.090
he evidently thought.
I looked,

562
00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.150
that he thought it was totally fine to come up to me and just say,
Hey,

563
00:33:33.151 --> 00:33:37.980
I can fix that.
You know?
And I laughed and I said,
Oh man,
I go,
I'm cool.

564
00:33:37.981 --> 00:33:39.600
I'm cool.
I liked the way I look.
You know,

565
00:33:39.601 --> 00:33:42.600
I'm actually getting better roles now that I look.
I look like a fucking,

566
00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:48.420
you know,
before I used to,
I look like how doody,
I didn't get good parts.

567
00:33:48.421 --> 00:33:51.120
Now,
you know,
I get to play fucking assholes because I look like one.

568
00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:56.370
I always was one,
but I did always look like one.
So he's like,
oh,
hi.
You know?

569
00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:00.300
Then I ran into when I was down in Largo saved guy and I was just like,

570
00:34:00.301 --> 00:34:03.990
Jesus Christ my buddy.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Right?

571
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:09.560
So anyways,
I was doing,
uh,

572
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:15.300
Kevin Nealon show a Tuesday at the laugh factory and I get off stage and this

573
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:18.200
fucking guy comes up to me again.
He goes,
hey,
you know,
I can fix that.

574
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.310
And he goes,
I'm the best in the business.
First of all,
dude,

575
00:34:22.311 --> 00:34:24.200
if you're the best in the business,
then like,

576
00:34:24.201 --> 00:34:28.310
why are you fucking running up to comics who just got off stage at a comedy
club,

577
00:34:28.311 --> 00:34:31.730
handing out Your Business Card?
You know,
you like a fucking,

578
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:34.820
like a I go rapper who just started,

579
00:34:34.821 --> 00:34:36.790
who selling mix tapes out of his fucking coffee,

580
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.170
the best in the fucking business.
You know,
I,

581
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:45.050
people should be walking into your office as you pose,
you rushing up to people,

582
00:34:45.051 --> 00:34:48.770
right.
So I said to the guy,
I go,
Jesus Christ,
here I go,

583
00:34:48.771 --> 00:34:50.750
this is a third fucking time.
He came up to me,

584
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:55.570
I'm fine the way I look.
I look fine.
He goes,

585
00:34:55.571 --> 00:34:58.450
you look like an area is what he said.

586
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:03.700
So I finally,
I just kind of snapped a little bit on it,

587
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:08.550
you know what I mean?
Cause it was like,
it kind of was not funny anymore.

588
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:12.080
It was just like,
dude,
like

589
00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.210
you're fucking harassing me here.

590
00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:16.710
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

591
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:21.360
<v 1>I don't want,
I'm sorry,
I don't want fucking hair plugs.
What do you do?</v>

592
00:35:21.361 --> 00:35:23.430
You know what it is?
He wants to fuck.
He wants,

593
00:35:23.431 --> 00:35:27.450
he wants a fucking comedian that's got some TV credits that he could do it.

594
00:35:27.451 --> 00:35:31.320
So you can be like,
you know,
you know,
just,
just as bill bird,

595
00:35:31.321 --> 00:35:34.300
I'll stand there going,
I love my hair products,
you know,

596
00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:36.510
and his fucking commercial so you can go out and get a boat.

597
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:41.280
Cause that's where I felt like he was trying to use me,
you know what I mean?

598
00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.780
Try to use my bald head so we could go out and get the fucking boat and the big

599
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.070
tinted whore off off of my fucking,
you know,
male pattern baldness.

600
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.830
I thought he was gonna use me like,

601
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.860
like fucking Sharon Osborne did to those people on that fucking album.

602
00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:02.160
Charles finally.
Yeah.
Do I go?
I go enough buddy enough.

603
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:04.010
What you stupid fucking hair plugs.
They don't want,

604
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:07.530
I don't want you dumb ass hair plugs.
And he's like,
all right,
sorry.

605
00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:12.660
I appreciate what you do.
And I felt bad because he kind of walked away.
But uh,

606
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:16.860
how funny is that?
He's fucking slinking up to you in a comedy club.

607
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.360
He does hair transplants.

608
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.260
It's like 10 o'clock at night and he's slinking up to me hand and my business,

609
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:23.700
his business card.

610
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.940
And he had the fucking nerve to say I'm the best in the business.

611
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.780
The why does this feel so dirty,
sir,

612
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.990
that he's going to fucking ask me if I wanted an abortion.
Um,

613
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.820
alright.
Hymns wasn't us.
It was hymns.

614
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:46.080
66% of men lose their hair by the age of 35.

615
00:36:46.081 --> 00:36:48.420
Is that right man?

616
00:36:48.421 --> 00:36:51.110
There's a lot of people out there with hair plugs cause you don't see six,

617
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:56.490
it's almost seven on a 10 guys thing is when you start to lose you to notice

618
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.810
hair loss,
it's too late.
It's easier to keep the hair.

619
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:04.650
You have to replace their hair.
You've lost,

620
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:10.550
I asked you why the guys turn to weird solutions or do nothing when they can

621
00:37:10.951 --> 00:37:12.990
turn to medicine in science.

622
00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.790
Well cause you just fucking man up and accept your fate.
I Dunno.

Doctors will review and Ken's prescribe you product products are shipped

633
00:38:02.131 --> 00:38:03.210

634

hims.com/burr.

ms.com/per for himss.com/pr yeah.

639
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:29.310
For those of you who don't want to be polled personally,
I don't give a shit.

640
00:38:29.311 --> 00:38:30.870
I actually love having a shaved head.

641
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.570
I'm not even gonna lie to you and I know I look like a freak,

642
00:38:33.571 --> 00:38:38.440
but it's kind of fucking awesome.
Um,
you know,

643
00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:43.420
people think you know Jujitsu.
You don't know Jujitsu.
All right.
Um,

644
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:45.580
hey,
I can help you with that.

645
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:50.530
Jesus Christ buddy.
I know he looked bad.

646
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:52.960
I didn't know I looked that bad that you could just fucking walk.
Right?

647
00:38:52.961 --> 00:38:55.870
I can imagine if he gave boob jobs and he just walked up to some check,
hey,

648
00:38:55.871 --> 00:38:58.300
can I help you with that?
Now you look terrible.

649
00:38:58.301 --> 00:39:01.330
What tits go this way or the other?
Go the other way.
All right,
quip.

650
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:05.280
The truth is most of us are brushing our teeth.
Rog,

651
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:08.763
pay you,
brush your teeth,

652
00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.760
run a not for long enough and forget to change our brush on time.
All right,

653
00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:13.540
fair enough.

654
00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:18.540
That's because most brands focus on selling flashy gimmicks rather than better

655
00:39:18.611 --> 00:39:21.820
brushing,
but not quit all that.
These guys equipment.

656
00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.410
So what makes quip so different?
You may have asked,
maybe you didn't ask,

657
00:39:26.411 --> 00:39:31.030
but I asked for you for status.
Quip is an electric toothbrush.

658
00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:34.120
That's a fraction of the cost of bulkier brushes.
Oh,

659
00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:38.470
that's a guy I didn't know it was electric.
I have a gas toothbrush a while,

660
00:39:38.471 --> 00:39:40.600
still packing,
just I have to cook,

661
00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:43.580
plug it into the stove or plugging in.

662
00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.810
There will be electric bill while still packing just the right amount of

663
00:39:46.811 --> 00:39:51.130
vibration to help clean your teeth.
Quip built quips built in timer,

664
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.490

uh,

Quip also comes with a mount that's suctions right to your mirror and unstick us

672
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:29.740
And finally,
everyone loves quip.
They were on Oprah's oldest,

673
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:35.700

This is the oldest,

684
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:26.080
the fuck was I just going to go look up.
That made me want to look something up.

685
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:30.000
It wasn't for hymns.

686
00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:33.980
I have no idea if I already forget or you forget.

687
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:38.210
<v 3>All right guys.
I apologize.
I'm fucking sick.

All right.
God bless you.

God bless the United States Republicans,
Democrats,
Libertarians.

691
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:58.220
You can go to hate groups.
People would love groups,
anti social people.

692
00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:00.161
Well,

705
00:43:25.231 --> 00:43:29.310
presence of mind to fucking make a youtube video out of it.

706

You know?
So guys like make it just sit down.

707
00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:35.190
I was laughing my ass off last night I went to bed and I was watching people

708
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:39.560
shooting bottle rockets out of their ass,
having a Roman candle fights,

709
00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.370
seen somebody take one to the face.

710
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:46.700
Do you know some guy in Maine lit something off on top of his fucking head and

711
00:43:46.831 --> 00:43:50.610
he died instantly.
They were like,
he let off.

712
00:43:50.611 --> 00:43:54.600
They said some a mortar or something fucking insane

713
00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:59.790
at what kind of,
you know,
kind of a fucking asshole would do something like that.

714
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:03.960
He must have had it.
There's no way.

715
00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:09.480
Everybody knows once you get up to anything like a pack of firecrackers on your

716
00:44:09.481 --> 00:44:11.370
head,
you like that.
That's funny.

717
00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:14.670
You're going to fucking kill your ear drums and you know,

718
00:44:14.671 --> 00:44:16.230
but you're going to survive.
But what?

719
00:44:16.231 --> 00:44:21.090
What do you put an m 80 in his mouth or something?
Well,
I don't know,
Bill.

720
00:44:21.091 --> 00:44:24.720
You fucking brought it up.
All right.
Relax.
What's this look up?

721
00:44:24.721 --> 00:44:28.650
Main guy dies.
Fireworks.

722
00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:34.470
All right.
Shoots off fireworks from top of his head dies instantly.

723
00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:38.460
A 22 year old man was drinking and celebrating the 4th of July.

724
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:42.750
Happy Birthday to America.
Don't put it on my head.

725
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:46.820
Happy Birthday to America.
I'll fucking light it.

726
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.380
Happy Birthday.
Wow.

727
00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:53.840
<v 4>Michael.
Oh my God.
Somebody calling.
Do it.</v>

728
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.920
<v 3>Um,
that's how I went down.</v>

729
00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.670
22 year old man who was drinking and celebrating the 4th of July.

730
00:45:00.671 --> 00:45:03.580
I tried to launch a firework from top of his head.
Killed him instantly.

731
00:45:03.581 --> 00:45:07.240
Authority said
30.
Said,

732
00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:09.710
you've got to be an authority to say that somebody is fucking dead after the

733
00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.090
light.
Something off on their head.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Claire.
Claire,

734
00:45:14.091 --> 00:45:17.250
the way.
Clue.
Yes.
Yes,
he is dead.
Well,

735
00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.630
they kind of knew that he has brains all over the sidewalk.
Watch your mouth,

736
00:45:20.631 --> 00:45:22.730
woman.
Watch your mouth.
Woman.

737
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:27.350
It's one of my favorite quotes in sports over the last fucking,

738
00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.000
I don't know how many months,
six months.

739
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:33.560
Watch your mouth woman when that woman called,
uh,
asks,

740
00:45:33.561 --> 00:45:36.410
Lebron won,
it was like to be a punk ass bitch and then that guy's going,

741
00:45:36.411 --> 00:45:39.500
watch your mouth woman,
watch your mouth woman.
And you know,

742
00:45:39.501 --> 00:45:41.420
you would think that the broads would've had such,

743
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:44.360
which have fucking difficulty with it.
Like you know,

744
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:49.510
I realized that she said something to Raga Turi tend towards him but that few

745
00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:53.720
excuse go change your brown lady.
All right.

746
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:57.020
I love that they didn't say anything because even they knew even they knew that

747
00:45:57.021 --> 00:45:58.520
I guide,
you know,
that bitch was out of line.

748
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:05.120
I'm just talking shit today.
Um,

749
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:10.540
they won't say what kind of firework it was.
All right.

750
00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:15.310
Apparently he thought that was a great idea that have just when you died in this

751
00:46:15.311 --> 00:46:18.370
stupid fucking way and when somebody starts it off when they start your yield

752
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.930
eulogy off with apparently.
Yeah.

753
00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:25.090
Apparently this guy taught us sticking his head in the garbage disposal was a,

754
00:46:25.091 --> 00:46:29.410
you know,
going to give him a good buzz.
I mean,
I'm sorry to bring it up Claire,

755
00:46:29.411 --> 00:46:32.170
but you know how did even get it in there

756
00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.290
all a little ya.
Um,

757
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:40.950
his friend said they thought they thought they dissuaded him from doing it.

758
00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:44.910
The next thing they knew,
he ignited the firework and he was killed instantly.

759
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:47.610
What the fuck did he shoot off?

760
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.100
There was no rushing him to the hospital.

761
00:46:53.101 --> 00:46:55.770
There was no Devin left when I got there.

762
00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:01.320
Said 25 year old Cody.
Jesus Christ.
The names of this generation.

763
00:47:01.321 --> 00:47:06.120
Huh?
Devin Cody
jeep wrangler.
Uh,

764
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:09.900
Devin was the kind of person who would do something stupid.
Absolutely.

765
00:47:09.901 --> 00:47:13.530
He was the kind of person who would pretend to do something stupid to make

766
00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:15.750
people laugh.
Well,
he wasn't faking it.

767
00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.613
<v 4>MMM.</v>

768
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:23.150
<v 3>All right.
This is the first fireworks fatality since they legalized fireworks.</v>

769
00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:27.200
January 1st,
2012 while he just fucked it up for the whole state.

770
00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:32.380
It's bad enough.
Everyone's heroin now you're going to give them fireworks.

771
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:37.540
How many,
what next does isis get their own juice store?

772
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:40.220
<v 4>Come on,
people.</v>

773
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:46.470
<v 3>Over 80% of bottle rockets are shot out of people's anuses in this state alone.</v>

774
00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:52.480
This needs to stop.

775
00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.253
<v 4>Woo.</v>

776
00:47:55.790 --> 00:48:00.620
<v 3>That's going on in main street right now in Maine.
Hi.
Do you know me?</v>

777
00:48:00.621 --> 00:48:01.850
Of course you don't

778
00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:08.450
have your regular housewife here in Maine.
My son is on heroin.

779
00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:13.190
My other son shot a Roman candle up his ass.

780
00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:18.170
I'm sorry to be graphic.
He was trying to shoot it out of his ass.

781
00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:22.400
But apparently
his excitement,

782
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.020
oh,
it's getting who?
I mean,
in order to light the wick,

783
00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:27.430
you gotta be able to see it.

784
00:48:27.431 --> 00:48:32.050
So I don't know how many things were done when we were kids.
We just,

785
00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:36.490
we let them and we ran away.
We hit under our desks.
That's what we did.

786
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:42.590
Devin was a great person.
Um,
and in New Jersey,

787
00:48:42.591 --> 00:48:47.591
a 52 year old man blew up a large piece of his leg below the knee when he set

788
00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.220
off a tennis ball size firework in Montana,

789
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:54.170
Montana,
Montana,

790
00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:58.970
a 32 year old man was killed at his billings home in a fireworks accident

791
00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:01.370
involving a mortar tube.

792
00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:03.120
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

793
00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.060
<v 3>All right.
At least there was some sort of mortar around.
I mean mode around,</v>

794
00:49:06.061 --> 00:49:07.950
I mean,
first of all,

795
00:49:07.951 --> 00:49:11.460
when you start lighting off shit where your neighbors starts screaming and

796
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:14.940
comment,
you know what,
what do you think is going to happen?

797
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:16.550
<v 0>Okay,</v>

798
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:18.350
<v 3>let's look up a mortar tube here.
Everybody.</v>

799
00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:21.530
I'm learning about fireworks through the death of my fellow Americans.

800
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.100
<v 4>Um,
I spelt motor.
All right.</v>

801
00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:31.160
<v 3>Firework,
mortar tubes.
How about some images?
Let me see.</v>

802
00:49:31.161 --> 00:49:34.340
What the fuck these things look like.
Is there some sort of,

803
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:38.510
all right,
all I see is army guys.

804
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:40.003
<v 0>Okay.</v>

805
00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:44.760
<v 3>Yeah,
that's not good.
You know when,
when the shit you shooting off.</v>

806
00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.910
Oh,
there we go.

807
00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:53.070
Well there's one that looks like a little barber shop thing.
What a fucking dope.

808
00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:57.210
He shot that off his head.
You know what probably happened,

809
00:49:57.211 --> 00:50:00.930
I would guess is that there was some sort of discharge from the bottom end of it

810
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:02.820
in the concussive force.

811
00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.420
But it seems like there was no Devaney fucking blew his head off.

812
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:11.620
No.
Jesus want to wait to start.
I had such a wonderful weekend.
Um,

813
00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.520
I didn't mean this when I was talking about funny shit.
I was just talking about,

814
00:50:14.521 --> 00:50:19.020
you know,
people haven't,
Roman candle fights come up.
We all did that shit.
Right?

815
00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:20.280
That's bad.

816
00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:25.280
That is the evolution of all weaponry and all right.

817
00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:30.110
Anything that has an device,
anything that,
that,
uh,

818
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:34.340
it's supposed to divulge.
Anything that,
that fucking blow shit up.
You just,

819
00:50:34.341 --> 00:50:39.110
you start or do you anything that you can shoot at a target?

820
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:43.940
It always starts simple.
Let's light it off.
You know,

821
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:48.590
let's,
let's point it in that direction at the trees,
right?

822
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:54.490
And then what?
Then you move up to a,
let's torture some insects.
Uh,

823
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:57.470
let's shoot a bird.
And eventually,

824
00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:58.740
<v 2>yeah,</v>

825
00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.240
<v 3>because you know,</v>

826
00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:05.700
the way human beings are that we always try to top one another and we get bored,

827
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:09.870
which is the reason why we went from walking to the horse to the car.

828
00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:12.510
I'm really in deep right now.
I know.

829
00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:13.590
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

830
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:18.150
Eventually you're going to move to the,
the,
the ultimate prey,
the human being.

831
00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.870
You know,
something that can think the same way.

832
00:51:21.871 --> 00:51:26.160
You do something that may have done better in math than you did.
You know,

833
00:51:26.161 --> 00:51:29.640
that's the challenge.
This person passed Algebra.
I did not.

834
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:34.750
We're both trying to kill one another is,
you know,

835
00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:38.060
first outside,
inside lasts,

836
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.960
going to come into play here when we're out in the woods

837
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.910
are opposite angles being congruent?

838
00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:51.080
Is that going to be the death of me or do I just have that extra something?

839
00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:56.190
Do I want it a little bit more?
Am I able to block out the fifth commandment?

840
00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:02.370
Do I have such a strong religious background that I can hear God's voice in my

841
00:52:02.371 --> 00:52:06.570
head telling me that I'm right telling me to deliver

842
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:12.830
that animal?
Is that even a man anymore?
It's a fucking handle.
Deliver that animal

843
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:19.350
in the express lane to its maker.
Right?

844
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:22.470
Do I have that?
I mean,
it's inevitable.

845
00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:25.860
That's personally why I don't fuck with fireworks.

846
00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:31.280
I don't fuck with fireworks because I know that I am scatterbrained and I get

847
00:52:32.041 --> 00:52:37.041
bored easily and I have 10,000 fucking hobbies and eventually lighting it off in

848
00:52:37.651 --> 00:52:42.030
the driveway is not going to be enough for me.
Okay.
I have neighbors.

849
00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:43.650
I have neighbors that I get along with.

850
00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:49.200
Maybe I'm bored with the fact that I get along with them.
Maybe I want to stop.

851
00:52:49.201 --> 00:52:53.340
Maybe some days you just wake up and you just want to start some shit and you

852
00:52:53.341 --> 00:52:58.240
just happened to have some fireworks that don't just blow up.
They,
they,

853
00:52:58.241 --> 00:53:03.120
they go way up in the air
and you want to shoot somebody.

854
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:07.420
Right.
Anyways,
uh,

855
00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:10.500
my condolences to anybody,
uh,
who knows somebody that died.

856
00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:13.380
Now I don't have any condolences for the people that died cause you fucking dead

857
00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:17.880
and you either dead or I think you were in a better place because someone who's

858
00:53:17.881 --> 00:53:22.510
dumb enough to blow themselves up on the July 4th weekend with their own goddamn

859
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:23.580
explosive,

860
00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:28.580
I don't think ever had the brains really hurt another human being knowingly.

861
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:33.510
I never knowingly lied.
Knowingly hurt another fucking human being.

862
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:36.540
I mean,
honestly,
if you're that fucking stupid,

863
00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:39.410
obviously he'd go out and hurt somebody black,
you know?

864
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:45.270
Do you really have the mental capacity to understand,
you know,

865
00:53:45.271 --> 00:53:46.104
your actions?

866
00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:30.753
<v 0>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

867
00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:54.150
[inaudible]

868
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:56.220
<v 7>okay.
What's going on?
It's built burn.</v>

869
00:54:56.221 --> 00:55:01.221
It's the Monday morning podcast for July 5th,

870
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:05.670
2010 one day after the birthday of this country.

871
00:55:05.671 --> 00:55:08.940
Happy Birthday to America.

872
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:12.920
Happy Birthday to the USA.

873
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:17.760
Happy Birthday.
Fuck every other country.
You know,

874
00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:20.040
like a Sadie way.

875
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:23.540
You fucking Douche bags.
Um,

876
00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:27.680
Jesus Christ.

877
00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:32.030
Happy Birthday to one of the most hated countries on the face of the fucking

878
00:55:32.031 --> 00:55:35.690
planet.
You know,
everybody's shitting on us.

879
00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:39.540
All those fucking World Cup referees.
You know,

880
00:55:39.541 --> 00:55:43.590
people tugging on our shirts,
kicking us in our fucking American balls.

881
00:55:43.591 --> 00:55:44.760
They don't see any of it.

882
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:49.730
No reason why we're out of the World Cup is because of our foreign policy.

883
00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:53.420
That's why.
That's why we were always off sides.

884
00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:57.950
They never were the gun.
I East does whoever the fuck kicked our ass?

885
00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:01.870
I don't know.
Um,
is the World Cup still going?

886
00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:05.650
Is the world still watching?
Let me ask the world the question.

887
00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:09.970
When your team gets knocked out,
do you tap out and like,
ah,
fuck the World Cup,

888
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:14.820
you know when you go back to your hut and your grind up corn in that little

889
00:56:14.821 --> 00:56:18.660
guacamole bowl,
do you do that?
Um,

890
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.750
what exactly is done?
Do you continue watching?
I mean,

891
00:56:21.751 --> 00:56:26.751
cause I watch NFL football and when the New England Patriots got raped by the

892
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:33.340
Baltimore Ravens,
I continued to watch the uh,
the playoffs.
Playoffs.
Yes.

893
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:37.530
Playoffs.
I continued to watch him and uh,
so I was wondering,

894
00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:40.270
you guys are so into soccer.
Yes.

895
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:44.590
And I am calling it soccer because it's,
it's our birthday this week,

896
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:48.220
so I'm not going to fucking cow down to you motherfuckers would say call it

897
00:56:48.221 --> 00:56:50.260
football,
you know,

898
00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:54.250
just cause you have a ball and you can only kick it with your foot.
You know,

899
00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:57.010
you guys think you're so clever.
Oh,
that's real football.
Really.

900
00:56:57.070 --> 00:57:01.900
You can kick it with both feet,
can't ya?
Why isn't it ball?
What's the deal?

901
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:07.900
Um,
look at me with the head of fucking steam.

902
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:12.700
I'm hung over to feel like shit at a bunch of fucking 4th of July barbecue.

903
00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:17.950
You know,
is it ever good?
Is it ever good?
Oh,
look at the ribs.

904
00:57:17.951 --> 00:57:22.951
All slathered in fucking glistening in fucking fat and you get over there and

905
00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:28.870
you stick your fat American face right into it.
It's all over your face.

906
00:57:28.871 --> 00:57:33.280
Like some fucking two year old trying to eat birthday cake,
you know,

907
00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.040
and you run your hands through your hair with it,

908
00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:41.110
get their fucking grizzled Moose look go.
And
it's right.

909
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:46.240
Then you have sex with some underage girl in a hot tub and you have to fleet of

910
00:57:46.241 --> 00:57:51.160
France because in France sets a fucking acceptable America.

911
00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:56.740
Um,
no,
actually I had some great,
uh,
some great food yesterday.

912
00:57:56.741 --> 00:58:01.570
I just had too much of it.
I just could not stop stuffing my fat face.

913
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.980
I was that kind of full where I couldn't stay in one position.

914
00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.930
I was like sitting down and then after a while that wasn't comfortable,

915
00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:13.300
then I'd stand up for a minute and then that wouldn't be comfortable than I had

916
00:58:13.301 --> 00:58:18.301
to like lean on the side of the person's house fucking with the foundation at

917
00:58:18.971 --> 00:58:22.780
that point.
But it was a good time.

918
00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:27.010
Birthday of America.
Actually went to a party,
uh,

919
00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:31.680
there was just a little bit into the Hollywood hills and,
uh,

920
00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:35.650
was looking out over la and it's absolutely fucking hilarious.

921
00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:40.810
The amount of illegal fireworks that are shot off,
I don't know,

922
00:58:40.811 --> 00:58:45.550
in every city or an la in particular because I've never had like a bird's eye

923
00:58:45.551 --> 00:58:46.384
view.

924
00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:51.160
And somebody made this hilarious joke that whereas we will looking out,

925
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:55.300
it looked like when America bombed a United States,

926
00:58:55.301 --> 00:58:59.590
I should say the United States bombed a Baghdad.

927
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:02.500
And then as we were watching the fireworks going off,

928
00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:06.370
this should have been like a little CNN logo down on the left hand side of our

929
00:59:06.371 --> 00:59:07.204
eyeballs.

930
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:10.900
And then we all had a big laugh after this person made that hilarious joke.

931
00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:16.090
Now remember that Shit,
you know,
it really made me feel like,

932
00:59:16.091 --> 00:59:20.830
you know,
what the fuck
wasn't that a deep thought?

933
00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:24.110
It really made me think,
what the Fuck Gi bill.

934
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:26.480
I don't think you need to elaborate on that anymore.

935
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:30.050
I think you really summed it up.
Nah,
just thinking like,
what,
uh,

936
00:59:30.051 --> 00:59:34.370
what would I be doing?
You know,
if,
uh,

937
00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:37.880
if I was sitting in a city that was getting bombed and I worked in like a

938
00:59:37.881 --> 00:59:41.690
fucking,
you know,
I was like,
ah,
I always say a hardware store for once.
Bill,

939
00:59:41.691 --> 00:59:46.670
can he come up with a different job?
Uh,
maybe I put shoes on the bottom of uh,

940
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:51.770
uh,
lamas,
feats,
feet,
feet.
You know,

941
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:55.610
there's a lama like is that like an Australian animal or is that from the mid?

942
00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:58.370
Uh,
I always said the Midwest,
the Middle East.

943
00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:03.410
Every once in a while you see a lama in this fucking country and it almost

944
01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:05.930
causes an accident cause you like,

945
01:00:05.931 --> 01:00:10.310
what the fuck happened to that ponies neck?
Um,

946
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:16.070
not really made me think like I,
I,
I laughed and then I felt bad.

947
01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:19.070
Like where the fuck do I get off laughing?
There's nothing funny about war.

948
01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.350
Even if we got to go in and we got to do the shit,

949
01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:22.550
there's just nothing funny about it.

950
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:25.820
Cause there's a bunch of people on the fucking ground who had nothing to do with

951
01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:29.060
shit.
You know,
they had nothing to do with that maniac.

952
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:30.590
And is Tom Selleck mustache.

953
01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:34.640
They just trying to fucking survive and then these people come in there to

954
01:00:34.641 --> 01:00:39.641
rescue them and they ended up getting fucking blown up and then here I am,

955
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.790
feed my face like a fat fuck,
you know,

956
01:00:46.791 --> 01:00:50.030
just full of pork,
corn bread,

957
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.600
some Nilla wafer dessert about four beers

958
01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:00.280
and I'm eye balling a slice of pizza watching fireworks in the fucking Hollywood

959
01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:02.970
hills,
Eh,
it looks like bad to Baghdad.

960
01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:10.370
We all should have just projectile vomited right there in a tribute to the the

961
01:01:10.371 --> 01:01:13.820
end of the Roman Empire.
You know when they used to do,
they had those rooms,

962
01:01:13.821 --> 01:01:14.990
those puking rooms.

963
01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:19.160
You just sat there stuffing your face and then you would fucking go in there and

964
01:01:19.161 --> 01:01:19.994
just puke.

965
01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:24.800
Which is another fucking reason why these fucking European clients really need

966
01:01:24.801 --> 01:01:28.340
to sit down and read a history book.
They always talk about how dumb we are,

967
01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.470
the exact same shit that they're making fun of us for.
They've all done two,

968
01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:38.030
three times over every fucking one of them.
And I'd rattle off the stats,

969
01:01:38.031 --> 01:01:42.190
but I don't know him
please.

970
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.020
You can tell me that little fucking midget Napoleon didn't.

971
01:01:45.021 --> 01:01:49.820
Stuff is fat face that little fucking Danny Devito look and Douche.
Douchebag.

972
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:55.030
Huh?
What happened to him?
He went to Waterloo.
What's up with debt?

973
01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:59.240
Fucking Waterloo.
This is like typical fucking American.
Uh,

974
01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:00.770
shit-talking.
I know,

975
01:02:00.771 --> 01:02:05.180
I know the major fucking players and I know the major battle names,

976
01:02:05.181 --> 01:02:08.870
but I have no idea what happened.
He went to Waterloo,

977
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.760
which I believe was at in Austria.

978
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:15.530
Was that right down the street and Connecticut?
Where the fuck did that happen?

979
01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:18.350
All I know is he went there and he got his little fucking ass kick.

980
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:20.250
Did he ride pony into battle?

981
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:24.000
Because he was so little that if he actually fell off a real horse,

982
01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:26.340
it would be fallen off like a fucking skyscraper.

983
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:31.890
That little douche rubbing his fucking stomach cause he had an ulcer because he

984
01:02:31.891 --> 01:02:35.510
has that little dwarf stomach that can,
if they can't died,
Jess,

985
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:40.440
more than a couple of strawberries and he's sitting there trying to fucking dive

986
01:02:40.441 --> 01:02:44.340
in and be the big guy.
He won't do you want,
except it won't accept that he's,

987
01:02:44.341 --> 01:02:48.580
he's a little guy with little organs and a little intestinal track.

988
01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:51.230
So what does he do?
He stuffs his face trying to Audi.

989
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:55.460
It is fucking drill sergeant,
you know,
eaten a Bronto Burger,

990
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:56.550
whatever they did back then.

991
01:02:56.551 --> 01:02:58.890
Next thing you know he's got an ulcer and this now pepto,

992
01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:01.320
there's no fucking pepto,
you know,

993
01:03:01.321 --> 01:03:05.730
it's the 15 hundreds I did that on purpose just for all you fucking snobs.

994
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:08.880
I know he was around in the 18 hundreds wasn't,

995
01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.480
he was at the 17 hundreds I dunno.
One of those ones where the,

996
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:16.530
where you're fucking,
you're wore too much makeup,
you know,

997
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:19.440
and you're curled up your hair like that chicken little house on the prairie

998
01:03:19.441 --> 01:03:22.380
that I was making a reference to,
Nelly,
Nelly Olson,

999
01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:26.940
who's got a fucking book coming out,
doesn't she?
You know,

1000
01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:31.530
seeing now that's how you do it as a child star when you fall off.

1001
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.860
She never got involved in drugs.
You know,

1002
01:03:34.861 --> 01:03:39.861
she just kept fucking living off of her residuals.

1003
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:42.780
Granted she had the options,

1004
01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.580
cause evidently that series plays all over the world.
You know,

1005
01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:52.650
but now she writes a book,
you know,
you just keep milking it.

1006
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:57.680
You just write a book still Nelly Still Nellie after all these years and you

1007
01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.200
answer the same fucking questions over and over again.

1008
01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:04.560
How close was that character to their real you?

1009
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:06.930
If they're a little bit of Nellie in you,

1010
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:11.400
if they're a little bit of Nelia and all of us,
you know,

1011
01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:15.060
and people wonder why those celebrities end up snapping in those fucking

1012
01:04:15.061 --> 01:04:15.720
interviews.

1013
01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:20.720
Somebody sent me a youtube video this week about Mel Gibson who's having another

1014
01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:24.190
rough week by the way.
He still no,
no,

1015
01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:28.530
no audio tape of him being a Douche has really come about.

1016
01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:29.940
I think that's just the,
uh,

1017
01:04:29.941 --> 01:04:33.750
the ex girlfriend claiming he did some shit like that.

1018
01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:36.960
Either that or he's got a fucking unbelievable fucking lawyer,
which you know,

1019
01:04:36.961 --> 01:04:40.590
could be either or.
But uh,
what the hell is it?

1020
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:45.390
Where the fuck is he youtube video.
Oh Man,
I was on such a role.

1021
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:50.010
What is my voice hurt?
Like I did a bunch of,
oh,
there it is.

1022
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.540
Like I did a bunch of shows this weekend.

1023
01:04:52.290 --> 01:04:56.190
Was it because I was drunk yelling at people.
Um,
all right.
Uh,

1024
01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:59.460
Mel Gibson's the,
here's a youtube video,
look up Mel Gibson,

1025
01:04:59.461 --> 01:05:02.370
Dean Richard Calls Dean Richards and asshole.

1026
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:06.690
And somebody asked me my opinion on it and I think he was,

1027
01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:12.880
I think it was well within his fucking right to call him an asshole.
Uh,

1028
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:17.530
basically what happens is this guy goes to passive aggressive route where

1029
01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.830
Malcolm's onto hype is movie and Dean's like,
you know,
hey,

1030
01:05:20.831 --> 01:05:22.540
it's great to have you here,
but blah,
blah blah.

1031
01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:26.150
And you can see Mel Mel's already defensive because he's got that anti-semite

1032
01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:30.940
rant hanging over his fucking head.
So He's already fucking just,

1033
01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.070
you know,
he can say it in his face like,
ah,
fuck,

1034
01:05:33.071 --> 01:05:35.800
let me just get through this fucking interview with this guy bringing this shit

1035
01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:37.030
up.
So the guy,

1036
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:41.500
the we fucking soft sells of whatever he did it passive aggressive.
Oh,

1037
01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:46.180
this about the movie that about the movie.
And then he goes,
yeah,
you know,

1038
01:05:46.181 --> 01:05:49.570
it's kind of some familiar ground.
I feel like I'm visiting an old friend,

1039
01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:51.790
which is a really country way of saying like,
yeah,

1040
01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:55.510
I've already seen you do this movie before,
but he doesn't come out and say it.

1041
01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.890
Mel Handles all of it with grace.
And then finally in the,
in the end,
you know,

1042
01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:04.120
he fucking suckers and with the overhand right going,
oh yeah.
Uh,

1043
01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:09.030
so how do you think the public's gonna receive you?
And,
and he goes,
well,

1044
01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.730
what do you mean?
He goes,
you know,
with a,
you know,

1045
01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:15.790
some of your troubles that you've had in the past.

1046
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:21.680
And Mel goes,
uh,
well,
you know,
my life's kind of been a roller coaster a,

1047
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:25.300
and the guy just keeps going and goes,
what exactly are you talking about?

1048
01:06:25.301 --> 01:06:29.140
And he just fucking,
because you know,
when you got drunk and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1049
01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.350
And he brings that shit up again.
And Mel's like,
dude,

1050
01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:35.470
he spent four fucking years,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.
This is my thing.

1051
01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:41.170
It's like one of those deals where Mel Gibson,
he did say it.
So,

1052
01:06:41.171 --> 01:06:44.110
but my thing is if you're going to fucking trash the guy for it,

1053
01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:45.470
just go ahead and trash them.

1054
01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:49.330
Don't sit there and act like you're the guy's fucking buddy.

1055
01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.690
And then out of nowhere hit him over the head with it.

1056
01:06:52.691 --> 01:06:57.340
So he ends up calling the guy and asshole the guy is an asshole.
And uh,

1057
01:06:58.390 --> 01:07:01.690
the other point is that Dean Richards,
Guy,
I swear to God,

1058
01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:06.900
if you tapped his phone,
he tapped that guy's fucking phone.
You don't think that,

1059
01:07:06.901 --> 01:07:11.740
that he would say anything that would involve some sort of,
uh,

1060
01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:13.450
apology.

1061
01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:17.830
I'm just really tired of people acting like they don't have any sort of fucking

1062
01:07:17.831 --> 01:07:18.970
issues whatsoever.

1063
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.540
I'm not saying that you're a straight up fucking racist or right beginning,

1064
01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.200
you never caught yourself.
You know,
you're walking down the street,

1065
01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:30.340
it's late at night,
you see some of,
of a particular race.
And what do you think?

1066
01:07:30.341 --> 01:07:33.130
You think in the worst shit,
you know,

1067
01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:36.940
and then it turns out for some reason you have to interact with them and then

1068
01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.940
they're the exact opposite of what the fuck you thought your were.
They were,

1069
01:07:39.941 --> 01:07:43.840
I mean,
I dunno,
I'm just sick of people.
When somebody does something like that,

1070
01:07:43.841 --> 01:07:47.980
everybody gets to be like holier than Thou and act like a,

1071
01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:53.500
they don't think any fucked up thoughts.
And secondly,
second,
second of Lee.

1072
01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:58.480
Second of all,
I think I'm on third of all at this point.
And,
and,
and uh,

1073
01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:01.660
see my,
my third point,

1074
01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:03.550
I'm just gonna switch between numbers and letters here.

1075
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:07.510
Mel Gibson has a lot of fucking issues,
right?

1076
01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:12.220
So how do you cure the guy of these fucking hateful ish issues?

1077
01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:18.740
You fucking drag them across the Goddamn Coles and rub his fucking face in it.

1078
01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:19.151
I mean,
I,

1079
01:08:19.151 --> 01:08:23.540
I really don't think that that's going to make a guy with fucked up thoughts

1080
01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:28.560
really sit back and reflect,
you know,
I mean,

1081
01:08:28.690 --> 01:08:31.760
it's up to that dude,
whether he wants to sit back and reflect,
but,
you know,

1082
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.140
I don't think like a,
I'm trying to think of a good fucking analogy.

1083
01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:40.610
I got it.
Like when I lived in Boston,

1084
01:08:40.611 --> 01:08:43.820
I absolutely fucking hated the Yankees and I fucking hated their fans.

1085
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.120
And then when I moved down in New York and I had to interact with them,
you know,

1086
01:08:47.121 --> 01:08:48.080
they weren't as bad,

1087
01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.440
but I still thought that they were Douche bags at the end of the day.
All right.

1088
01:08:51.441 --> 01:08:55.370
That was a bad example.
Whatever.
I fucking waiting the podcast,

1089
01:08:55.371 --> 01:08:56.204
you know what I'm saying?

1090
01:08:56.270 --> 01:09:01.100
At some point I think the public has to forgive Mel Gibson,

1091
01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:03.920
particularly anybody that he went off on.

1092
01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:07.160
I think he should be a nice guy to him and then he can realize,
wow,

1093
01:09:07.161 --> 01:09:11.750
what the fuck was I thinking?
Here's so and so.
He's part of the group X,

1094
01:09:11.751 --> 01:09:15.410
Y and Z that I went off on.
I really was a drunk Douche bag,

1095
01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:20.360
but I think if you're a fucking racist comment and you think that shit,

1096
01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:24.260
I think mace mostly,
maybe you'll,
you'll probably remain that way,

1097
01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:29.261
but if you're actually truly trying to not be a racist content anymore,

1098
01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:34.280
if the group that you attacked is a fucking asshole to you,

1099
01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.770
not a fucking asshole.
That's a bad,

1100
01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:41.300
but like just constantly is yelling at you.
I don't,

1101
01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:46.130
I don't see where you think that that guy is going to turn the fucking corner.

1102
01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:51.740
You know,
where the fuck are you calling us?

1103
01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:56.270
Douchebags you fucking cunt.
Oh yeah.
What was I thinking?
You know what I mean?

1104
01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:01.250
Does that make any sense whatsoever?
I don't fucking note.
Whatever.

1105
01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:06.020
Look it,
I can separate the racist guy from his movies.

1106
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:15.410
Uh,
who's kidding?
Who it's hard to.
It's a,
it's a fucking difficult thing,

1107
01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:20.300
you know?
And the guy did say it,
so I guess he does deserve that.
But you know,

1108
01:10:20.301 --> 01:10:23.450
I just thought that was a really fucking pussy ass way.

1109
01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.640
I just thought if you watched the interview,

1110
01:10:25.641 --> 01:10:29.630
the guys being really passive aggressive,
he's taking swipes at the movie,

1111
01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:33.830
you know,
saying it's like,
oh,
this is,
he's basically saying,
Mel,

1112
01:10:33.831 --> 01:10:38.450
this is you doing shit.
I saw you do 20 years ago.
What's up with that?
But he put,

1113
01:10:38.451 --> 01:10:41.420
he was saying it in this,
you know,
you know,

1114
01:10:41.421 --> 01:10:45.560
I just felt like I was a visiting an old friend,
you know?

1115
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:49.430
What about doing the stunts?
Is it harder to do the stunts now that you're older,

1116
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:54.380
you know,
that type of ship?
Yeah.

1117
01:10:54.381 --> 01:10:57.860
Dean yet is harder.
Is it harder for you to see your Dick when you sit down?

1118
01:10:57.861 --> 01:11:01.790
When you take a shit,
you old fat.
Fuck yeah,
we're getting older.

1119
01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:04.010
What is your point?
I'm trying to sell a movie here.

1120
01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:06.590
You're taking me out at the knees.
Why?

1121
01:11:06.591 --> 01:11:08.420
If you would just going to take me out at the knees.

1122
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:13.010
Why didn't you just do a rant on your show rather than have me get up at fucking

1123
01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:17.820
in the goddamn morning for you to pretend like you actually respect me on some

1124
01:11:17.821 --> 01:11:21.780
level.
I Dunno.
I guess that's my problem with the video.
Like I uh,

1125
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.880
those of you listening to my podcast,

1126
01:11:23.881 --> 01:11:28.860
you know how much I hate passive aggressiveness.
Um,

1127
01:11:30.090 --> 01:11:32.900
it's just a,
I dunno,
it's really a,
uh,

1128
01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:37.470
it's one of the bitchy qualities you can have as a fucking human being.

1129
01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.080
You know,
if you're going to be a con,

1130
01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.930
stand there flat footed with your shoulders squared up and just hit them.

1131
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:45.990
100 files going to say full force.

1132
01:11:45.991 --> 01:11:50.991
Just like fucking Jeff Farmer who I'll be getting to later full force with being

1133
01:11:52.051 --> 01:11:56.160
a cunt towards them.
You know,
it's like you have a piss somebody off,

1134
01:11:56.161 --> 01:12:00.030
you cut them off in traffic and they're behind you and you look in their face

1135
01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:03.900
and you know they're mad at you,
right?
And you drive for like two,

1136
01:12:03.901 --> 01:12:07.110
two and a half miles,
and then you make a rightness still going straight.

1137
01:12:07.111 --> 01:12:11.490
And as you make a right,
they drive by and then they beep at you.
You know,

1138
01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:16.530
plan is,
they go by
that,
that type of shit.

1139
01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:20.300
Lean on the fucking whore.
The second I do something right,

1140
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:23.610
don't wait till I make a right turn and you could fucking beep at me and then

1141
01:12:23.611 --> 01:12:25.860
drive away Jesus Christ.
That was it.
That what?
You know what?

1142
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:30.210
That was a nice God damn example.
There was really a nice example.

1143
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:36.600
Um,
anyways,
I went out and I bought some new clothes this weekend.

1144
01:12:36.601 --> 01:12:39.110
Everybody,
it's,

1145
01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:43.830
it's Kinda one of those weird things when you become an adult where,
uh,
as a kid,

1146
01:12:43.831 --> 01:12:44.700
I don't know about you guys.

1147
01:12:44.701 --> 01:12:49.230
I know these kids nowadays are all fucking spoiled with their iPads,
you know,

1148
01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:52.140
and they have box of condoms or whatever the fuck they get at school every

1149
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:54.360
goddamn day.
Um,

1150
01:12:56.180 --> 01:13:00.000
it was just picturing people like 18 listen to this,
thrown their hands up.

1151
01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:03.730
Like what do we don't get that?
Um,

1152
01:13:05.850 --> 01:13:08.100
yeah,
there's that weird thing when I was a kid,
you got,

1153
01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:11.910
you got new clothes once a year,
you know,

1154
01:13:11.911 --> 01:13:16.140
Christmas didn't count because those were from your grandmother and that was

1155
01:13:16.141 --> 01:13:21.030
pleased.
Beat the shit out of me.
Clothes.
Um,
I guess you got a couple of things,

1156
01:13:21.031 --> 01:13:25.920
but like basically you got new clothes at the beginning of every year.

1157
01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:28.440
That's how I worked in my family beginning of every year.

1158
01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:32.490
You went down to the fucking Levi store,

1159
01:13:32.770 --> 01:13:37.770
you got like three different pairs of fucking corduroys and you got a new pair

1160
01:13:37.771 --> 01:13:41.220
of sneakers and you got like three shirts and that was it.

1161
01:13:41.221 --> 01:13:45.990
See you next September.
They're fuck,
oh,
that was it.
That was it.

1162
01:13:45.991 --> 01:13:49.590
And the rest was hand me downs from your older brothers and sisters,
not sisters,

1163
01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:54.180
older brothers or whatever,
or oldest sisters.
If you're abroad,
you know,

1164
01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:59.720
trying to fucking make this,
this podcast for everybody.
Uh,

1165
01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:03.840
why don't I just sound like fucking Dana carvers carved visa George Bush.

1166
01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:08.550
That sounded like that to me.
Trying to do the podcast for everybody,

1167
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:10.980
not Gani dead.
Um,

1168
01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:15.670
wouldn't be prudent.
That's a terrible impression bill.

1169
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:18.400
Once you shut the fuck up and talk about you stupid clothes,
fine.

1170
01:14:18.401 --> 01:14:22.510
I will my podcast,
I'll fucking talk about whatever I want to talk about.

1171
01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:27.070
We think about that.
Um,
yes,
he got and that was it for the whole fucking year.

1172
01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.730
And you sneakers look good until about September 30th.
And then,

1173
01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.350
and then that was it.
And that was fucking it.
But,
uh,

1174
01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:39.850
but the weird thing as an adult is,
uh,
you know,

1175
01:14:39.851 --> 01:14:42.070
you think I'm going to say that you buy clothes more often.

1176
01:14:42.071 --> 01:14:44.950
The reality is is you don't,
you don't,

1177
01:14:44.951 --> 01:14:49.780
you let a couple of school years go by and,
uh,
then one day,

1178
01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.610
you know,
you have to go to an event that you haven't gone to in awhile,

1179
01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:54.820
like say like a barbecue.

1180
01:14:54.821 --> 01:14:57.100
I can't remember the last time I went to a fucking barbecue.

1181
01:14:57.101 --> 01:15:02.101
And you start fishing out your barbecue clothes from the bottom of your God damn

1182
01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:06.430
dresser drawer.
You know,
bring a bathing suit.

1183
01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:10.570
I pull out this fucking bay.
Then students got a Mustang,
Mustang,

1184
01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.680
I can't even talk this week.

1185
01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:16.810
He has a mustard stain from like fucking back when Clinton was in office and I

1186
01:15:18.101 --> 01:15:20.740
don't know what it was now,
like I'm up on bathing suits styles,

1187
01:15:20.741 --> 01:15:24.970
but I could just tell it was not in style anymore and everything was just

1188
01:15:24.971 --> 01:15:29.080
fucking linty and old looking and all that shit.
So I was like,
ah,
God damn it,

1189
01:15:29.081 --> 01:15:33.700
I got to go to the fucking mall.
So I go to the mall,

1190
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:38.800
I had to buy some new sneakers and I go into the foot locker and they're selling

1191
01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:43.630
Lakers tee shirts that says 16 for,
this is Los Angeles Lakers,

1192
01:15:43.631 --> 01:15:47.350
16 fucking NBA championships on it.

1193
01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:52.030
And the footlocker guy comes up dressed like a ref,
you know,

1194
01:15:52.410 --> 01:15:55.510
and he comes up to me and he's just like a,
hey sir,

1195
01:15:55.511 --> 01:15:58.000
is there anything I can help you with?
I said,
yeah,

1196
01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:02.290
you can fix that tee shirt right there and have it say Los Angeles Lakers,

1197
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:06.670
11 NBA championships.
And he's like,
what are you talking about?

1198
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:11.200
I'm like,
cause you won.
Your first five is the Minneapolis Lakers.

1199
01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:15.250
All right,
sick Los Angeles Lakers.

1200
01:16:15.251 --> 01:16:18.820
It should say Minneapolis slash Los Angeles Lakers.

1201
01:16:18.821 --> 01:16:20.920
She got that Los Angelenos.

1202
01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:23.890
Those first five championships are not yours,

1203
01:16:24.130 --> 01:16:28.180
so why don't you fucking cave in your chest a little bit down to about 11

1204
01:16:28.181 --> 01:16:33.181
championships and I'll keep mine way the fuck out there with my 17 NBA

1205
01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:38.110
championships from the Boston Celtics,
all of them in Boston.

1206
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:41.080
Are you guys still confused about that?
La?

1207
01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:45.010
Think about how many times have you burned down your city.

1208
01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:50.230
You haven't burned it down 60 times.
Your burned it down 11 times.

1209
01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:52.900
You fucking asshole.

1210
01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:57.550
Classic people from Los Angeles just pat in their fucking resume.

1211
01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:02.140
You're a fucking PA on a project.
All of a sudden you're an executive producer.

1212
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:06.280
You win 11 championships as the Los Angeles Lakers and all of a sudden now

1213
01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:09.830
you're walking around with 16 NBA Championships.

1214
01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:14.540
You got a lot of fucking nerve.
Just like tiger woods wife,

1215
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:18.830
you got a lot of fucking nerve Stan the fuck down.

1216
01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:25.070
I don't know.
I can't remember if I talked about this last week,
uh,

1217
01:17:25.071 --> 01:17:26.060
on the podcast.

1218
01:17:26.061 --> 01:17:30.650
But after watching some world cup soccer and watching these fucking pansies,

1219
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:34.310
every time anybody comes near them,
flopping around,

1220
01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:38.990
like they just got fucking tasered.
I was like,
you know what?

1221
01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.400
I Bet Pau Gasol,

1222
01:17:40.401 --> 01:17:43.820
that's where he learned his flopping around on the fucking court out there.

1223
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:46.400
Either that or used to watch a fishing show.

1224
01:17:46.401 --> 01:17:50.090
I can't figure out what he just outgrew the sport,

1225
01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:55.190
the big fucking goof.
Ah,
his fucking face.

1226
01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:01.460
How do you fucking start squinting bef before you even start driving to the

1227
01:18:01.461 --> 01:18:02.660
Goddamn rim?

1228
01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:10.940
If Pau Gasol ever puts out a ringtone,
that's what it's going to sound like.

1229
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:18.950
He found me.
Oh,

1230
01:18:18.951 --> 01:18:21.320
I just can't get over it.
I just can't get over that.

1231
01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:23.660
We fucking lost to those assholes

1232
01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.860
and Colby choked and POW choke.

1233
01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:32.180
They both choked in game seven and no one's ever going to fucking remember.

1234
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:34.040
If it wasn't for this podcast,

1235
01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:39.470
I'm going to be bringing it up for you is
um,
all right.

1236
01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.290
Anyway,
so it's July everybody.
We're over the hump another year.

1237
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:48.680
Another year is flying by.
All right.

1238
01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:53.570
And I want you guys to realize that it is July 5th.
All right?

1239
01:18:53.571 --> 01:18:55.190
In the end of August is coming.

1240
01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:59.940
So you make sure that you do something fun every God damn weekend.
Alright,

1241
01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:03.500
senator,
how about you guys?
As you get older,
I don't know what the fuck happens.

1242
01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:06.860
It's May and you're like,
oh my God,
summer's coming.

1243
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:10.950
And then the next thing you know it's,
it's,
it's,

1244
01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.410
it's over and you're like,
I didn't do shit.
I didn't do one fucking fun thing.

1245
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:20.440
All I did was work and right as you get mad and you're going to actually

1246
01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:25.310
examined how the fuck you let another summer slip away,

1247
01:19:25.311 --> 01:19:30.311
all of a sudden it's preseason football and you get so fucking excited that you

1248
01:19:30.441 --> 01:19:34.370
forget that you wasted another summer.
Yeah.
As you guys a question,

1249
01:19:34.450 --> 01:19:37.580
when was the last time you went inner tubing down a Goddamn river?

1250
01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:42.200
Isn't that what you're suppose to do in some sort of wrangler Jean cutoffs.
Oh,

1251
01:19:42.201 --> 01:19:46.130
by the way,
by the fucking way,
speaking of wrangler,

1252
01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:49.610
do you want to know why that,
that,
that um,

1253
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:52.520
reference was in my fucking head when I went,

1254
01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:54.890
I'm really bringing the voice down for this story.
Everybody,

1255
01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:58.780
when I went to go shopping yesterday,
you know,

1256
01:19:58.790 --> 01:20:01.400
which is one of the great activities you can do with your girlfriend when you

1257
01:20:01.401 --> 01:20:02.240
need new clothes.

1258
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:05.930
I mean if you ever just want to watch your girl's face just light up,

1259
01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:10.020
just say that to her.
Hey Sweetheart,
you want to go shopping?
Oh my God.

1260
01:20:10.021 --> 01:20:11.550
He finally gets me.

1261
01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:15.660
<v 8>Guess who I am?
I would love to go.</v>

1262
01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:18.910
<v 7>So we go over to the fucking mall and I'm like,
alright,</v>

1263
01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:23.650
I need to buy some clothes,
some barbecue clothes,

1264
01:20:23.890 --> 01:20:27.130
some clothes that I can wear hanging out of barbecue.

1265
01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:32.310
So I won't get trashed at this fucking barbecue cause it's going to be a bunch

1266
01:20:32.361 --> 01:20:33.194
of comedians there.

1267
01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:36.890
I'd already get a bunch of shit if there was a bunch of pipe fitters down there

1268
01:20:36.891 --> 01:20:40.250
or whatever,
they would already be breaking balls.
So I got to go down there.

1269
01:20:40.251 --> 01:20:41.360
I gotta be looking.
All right,

1270
01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:48.500
so we go to the mall and she takes me into target or is the women call it

1271
01:20:49.771 --> 01:20:53.700
Tarjay.
That's the little fucking,
oh my God,

1272
01:20:53.701 --> 01:20:55.820
we're being frisky joke.

1273
01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:01.960
And this is the amazing thing about women is women can go into a target and find

1274
01:21:02.271 --> 01:21:06.960
something and,
and uh,
make it work as they say.
God,

1275
01:21:06.961 --> 01:21:09.180
I can't believe I know that fucking expression.
Okay.

1276
01:21:09.181 --> 01:21:11.280
I'm really gonna have to bring up my excuse here.

1277
01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:15.750
My girl watches that fashion show and I actually am aware of that guy with the

1278
01:21:15.751 --> 01:21:20.350
glasses who goes make it work.
Um,
and this is basically how it works.

1279
01:21:20.351 --> 01:21:25.230
My girl watches those reality shows and uh,
I might even bring her in here.

1280
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.350
Hey,
Neha.
Yeah,

1281
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:29.280
<v 8>you want to come in on the podcast?</v>

1282
01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:35.650
<v 7>All right.
All right.
Knee is coming in on the podcast.
Everybody.
Yeah,</v>

1283
01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:40.620
I'm going to explain basically how it works.

1284
01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.520
One.
I uh,
the lovely Nia,
everybody.

1285
01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:50.880
I was actually,
I was talking about how when I needed some new barbecue clothes,

1286
01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:52.610
right.
Um,

1287
01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:58.200
that you took me to target and I was beginning to say that target,

1288
01:21:58.201 --> 01:22:02.880
like there's something about women that you can go into a target and actually

1289
01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.430
whatever you find you can make it work.

1290
01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:09.630
And then I realized that that was the saying of that gun.
Yes.

1291
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:14.170
<v 8>So now I'm feeling like work.
Yeah.
Like people can be like,</v>

1292
01:22:14.171 --> 01:22:15.550
you actually watched those shows.

1293
01:22:15.551 --> 01:22:18.730
How long do I last when I watched those reality shows with you?

1294
01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:22.690
About five minutes before I kick you out.
Kick you kick me out.
Why?

1295
01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:27.340
Because you act like a dick.
What do you mean?
I don't have like a dick.
I start,

1296
01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.520
I start trashing the people on the show.
Yeah.

1297
01:22:32.521 --> 01:22:36.330
Well you make little jokes and stuff and it's funny and then you get annoying

1298
01:22:36.331 --> 01:22:39.660
and you hinder my ability to enjoy it.
It's like kick you out.

1299
01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:45.090
All right.
I want to defend my thing.
So she brings me into target.

1300
01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.310
I thought t to go.
What's that?

1301
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.980
I thought we were going in there for you to find workout clothes,

1302
01:22:50.130 --> 01:22:52.940
workout clothes,
which,
so she brings me into,

1303
01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:56.160
into the corner of the store and she shows me these fucking,

1304
01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:00.270
I didn't even know champions still made workout clothes and they've since

1305
01:23:00.271 --> 01:23:03.900
changed their logo and she's like,
ah,
look at these,

1306
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:06.100
you like these workout clothes.

1307
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:08.980
And it literally looked like the kind of shit you'd wear.
Like,

1308
01:23:08.981 --> 01:23:09.581
you know when you get,

1309
01:23:09.581 --> 01:23:13.810
you get arrested for something and then seven years later when they let you out

1310
01:23:13.811 --> 01:23:16.960
of jail,
they give you your clothes back.
That's what the fuck it looked like.

1311
01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.510
Basketballs worth.
Yeah.
And I said,
yeah.

1312
01:23:19.511 --> 01:23:22.960
And they're also like that Jordan level where it's all the way down to your

1313
01:23:22.961 --> 01:23:25.700
calves still.
If they don't realize that it's actually,
they've,

1314
01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:29.400
they found a happy medium between the Larry Bird's and the Michael Jordan.

1315
01:23:29.401 --> 01:23:33.970
Jordan.
Yeah.
Which is a little bit above the knee.
And uh,
so what did I do?

1316
01:23:33.971 --> 01:23:36.970
I went in there and I said,
I'm,
I'm,
I was in there for like three seconds.

1317
01:23:36.971 --> 01:23:40.130
I'm like,
yeah,
I'm not buying any shitty,
really irritate.

1318
01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:42.370
You got fucking mad at me because belt,

1319
01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:46.540
whenever we go shopping together and I have suggestions or whatever,

1320
01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:50.140
you just walk in,
look for not even three seconds.

1321
01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:53.080
You're being very generous to yourself.
You walk in,
you're like,

1322
01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:56.440
I'm not fucking doing this.
You don't even look.
You don't even take the time.

1323
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:58.750
I was right,
but I was right.

1324
01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:03.250
They had tank tops next to like Dickies said like,
yeah,

1325
01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.330
like I want to get a snake out of fucking toilet and then go play some hope.

1326
01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:11.620
It's not,
that's not for men.
Target is not for men.

1327
01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:15.550
I don't think it is unless,
unless they're getting staff buy,

1328
01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:18.970
buying can openers and beer glasses.
That's what the fuck they're getting.

1329
01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:22.160
Then I bought,
what are they going to buy?
Slacks.
They had lots of slides.

1330
01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:26.170
They are lots of tee shirts and stuff that you could have gotten,
you know?

1331
01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:27.310
Oh yeah,
they,

1332
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:32.110
I could've got some sneakers in there too with the Velcro fucking snap things

1333
01:24:32.111 --> 01:24:35.260
over the front is if to say I,
you know,

1334
01:24:35.490 --> 01:24:38.110
I lost part of my foot in a boating accident.

1335
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:41.950
They don't need to be that expensive.
If it's workout clothes.

1336
01:24:41.951 --> 01:24:44.530
Of course you want to look nice,
but you don't have to spend a ton of money on,

1337
01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:48.580
I don't know.
I don't believe in that unless you're a fucking tennis player.

1338
01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.310
If I were a tennis player,
I would want cute tennis outfit,

1339
01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:55.600
but if it's just me in here doing my stupid Jillian Michaels workout,

1340
01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.070
I don't know.
This is my thing like,
well,

1341
01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.590
how the fuck did me going into getting some shit for going to a barbecue slash

1342
01:25:02.591 --> 01:25:06.730
some new workout clothes?
Go to me wanting to buy a cute tennis outfit.

1343
01:25:07.810 --> 01:25:11.440
I didn't realize that this was supposed to be an outfit that transitioned you.

1344
01:25:11.441 --> 01:25:14.670
It's not an outfit.
It's not an outfit barbecue.

1345
01:25:14.690 --> 01:25:18.640
I didn't realize that was what brought you in here to try to save face because I

1346
01:25:18.641 --> 01:25:22.450
said make it work and now you're just,
I'm just further into the muck bike.

1347
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:23.920
All right.
That's it.
People.

1348
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:27.640
I had to go to a barbecue and I went to the mall and I bought a cute outfit.

1349
01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:31.000
You did Mike,
you Nafa.
You looked really nice yesterday.
Yes,
I did.

1350
01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:31.870
I look respectable,

1351
01:25:31.930 --> 01:25:36.280
although I did the classic old guy thing where I had the brand new sneakers in

1352
01:25:36.281 --> 01:25:37.340
the older socks.

1353
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:42.670
You know what's funny is that when you were putting them on for half a second,

1354
01:25:42.671 --> 01:25:46.900
I wanted to suggest that you wear socks that were a little bit lower so that you

1355
01:25:46.901 --> 01:25:50.410
wouldn't see so much of the sock.
They were ankle level.
I know,

1356
01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:53.710
but you could've gotten him like a little bit lower.
So I don't know.

1357
01:25:53.711 --> 01:25:57.790
And have that little ball on the back of them.
When did those become guy socks?

1358
01:25:58.750 --> 01:26:01.050
Those Chris Everett Lloyd's back.

1359
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:04.570
But they're just the low socks you see of the sneaker and not so much the side.

1360
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:08.390
I gotta be honest with you and as I dunno,
I have people write in about this.

1361
01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:12.650
I feel like when you wear shorts,
sneakers and socks,

1362
01:26:12.651 --> 01:26:17.390
if there's too much socks showing,
eh it's,
it gets a little,
I don't know.
Dorky.

1363
01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:21.470
Yeah.
Jesus.
You know this just class.
So you,
so you basically,

1364
01:26:22.690 --> 01:26:25.880
I'm the guy you love and you let me walk around this barbecue yesterday looking

1365
01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:29.750
like a Douche.
Fill this your own way to keep the women's away from me.

1366
01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:31.370
Is that what you were doing?
Didn't look like a Douche.

1367
01:26:31.371 --> 01:26:34.940
She looked really good and be anytime awhile.

1368
01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:38.180
I don't know if we should get into this,
but why?
Why not?

1369
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:39.650
What are we going to have an argument on here?

1370
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:41.630
Do you think these people give a shit about us?

1371
01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:44.600
We're trying to fill up and do an hour of their day.

1372
01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:48.920
I think they how mad they are that they have to work July 5th and the company

1373
01:26:48.921 --> 01:26:52.010
across the street has a cool boss hog are actually closed.

1374
01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.550
What is the problem now?
I just,
you know,

1375
01:26:55.551 --> 01:26:59.300
if I were to make a suggestion like that,
you really knew what to fuck.
Almost

1376
01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:05.020
[inaudible] is that what I sound like?
Well,

1377
01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:08.270
I remember making a suggestion yesterday and that didn't work out too good

1378
01:27:08.271 --> 01:27:11.480
either.
That's why I didn't want to bring it out.
Oh,

1379
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:12.470
you don't want to talk about that.

1380
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:16.520
You don't want to talk about the fact that I said your dress was a little linty

1381
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:21.280
l your dress was a little linty.
Yes.
And we can then,

1382
01:27:21.281 --> 01:27:25.880
and then when I came home and I changed,
and this is,
this is the hardest,

1383
01:27:25.881 --> 01:27:27.800
like help guys out here.
You ever,

1384
01:27:27.801 --> 01:27:31.150
do you know what the hardest fucking thing is when is when standing up now I'm

1385
01:27:31.151 --> 01:27:31.910
standing up now,

1386
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:36.350
cause I want to make a point here is it had nothing to do with you.

1387
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:41.480
I was just,
I was,
you know,
I was like,
you know the dress,

1388
01:27:41.630 --> 01:27:43.510
you just dress up in a just a little bit too long.

1389
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:45.860
It's just one of those ones you throw over.
Look at me.

1390
01:27:45.861 --> 01:27:47.870
I'm already getting nervous trying to explain to you.

1391
01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:49.610
I said I'll buy you another one.

1392
01:27:49.611 --> 01:27:52.580
And then the next thing you know that was just like at fucking,
there was,

1393
01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.400
there was the meltdown.
I'm all set and I use a meltdown offline.

1394
01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:00.500
Started crying in the mall on the birthday of our country.

1395
01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.240
I don't give a shit about the birthday of this country.
I don't,

1396
01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:08.930
sorry everyone.
Wow.
I'm African American.

1397
01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:12.590
There's still a little annoyance there,
so I'm not exactly,
yeah,

1398
01:28:12.591 --> 01:28:16.930
America's freedom.
Fuck you.
Gotta to take it all the way to there.

1399
01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:23.150
Right.
Anyway,
wait a minute.
This isn't about that.

1400
01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:26.810
Oh my God.
Do you realize the emails we're going to,
they're going to get,
well,

1401
01:28:26.811 --> 01:28:31.130
why don't you go the fuck back to fucking Africa?
They should say it.
Go ahead.

1402
01:28:31.131 --> 01:28:35.650
Let them get it all out there,
but I know Gil,
you go Mel Gibson's,

1403
01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:36.560
get it all out there.

1404
01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:39.740
Let's not mince words here that Jesus Christ in the eight you know,

1405
01:28:39.741 --> 01:28:42.640
I try to keep it light and you just went Fox News on me.

1406
01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:46.820
You just went Fox News on me or whatever.
No,
actually no.

1407
01:28:46.821 --> 01:28:49.800
The ultra liberal fun back to haunt me.
Yeah.

1408
01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:54.950
If I become a successful actress that this is going to be played on some sort of

1409
01:28:54.981 --> 01:28:59.930
website.
A Ne hates this country.
That's not what I'm saying,
but anyway,

1410
01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:04.770
what are you saying?
I'm just saying that you know,
wait a second.

1411
01:29:04.771 --> 01:29:06.330
When people celebrate 4th of July,

1412
01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:09.140
are they really like eating their barbecue and drinking their beer?

1413
01:29:09.150 --> 01:29:12.600
Thinking about this country and our forefathers and would it really?
No,

1414
01:29:12.601 --> 01:29:15.040
they're not.
They're just like,
Yay,
I don't have,

1415
01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:18.140
I don't have work tomorrow and I get to get drunk.
Yeah.

1416
01:29:18.150 --> 01:29:22.370
Most of them on the text messages telling people how before the July,

1417
01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:26.640
like it's Christmas.
No one cares.
I don't think

1418
01:29:29.370 --> 01:29:30.210
your popularity.

1419
01:29:30.211 --> 01:29:35.211
Nia was through the roof now podcast and now,

1420
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:39.090
you know,
it was funny was I will listeners on a journey up and down.

1421
01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:41.910
I don't wash in a rollercoaster.
That's what,

1422
01:29:41.911 --> 01:29:43.920
that's exactly what Mel Gibson just said.

1423
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:48.820
I just watched that thing and he just said that.
She just said that shit.
No,

1424
01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:54.760
there's fucking no passive aggressive Douche bag was sitting there going,

1425
01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:59.400
uh,
w w was came on acting like he wanted to talk about his movie,

1426
01:29:59.401 --> 01:30:02.590
but he really just wanted to sort of steer it back around to that time you went,

1427
01:30:02.591 --> 01:30:07.150
you went off.
So,
and then he was,
he was going like a,
he goes,
well,
you know,

1428
01:30:07.210 --> 01:30:08.520
you don't want,
when I saw your movie,

1429
01:30:08.521 --> 01:30:12.270
I just felt like I was visiting an old friend that we were on some,

1430
01:30:12.271 --> 01:30:15.720
some familiar ground.
He was basically saying like,
yeah,

1431
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:19.530
I've seen this fucking movie before.
But,
but he was doing it in the sing song.

1432
01:30:19.531 --> 01:30:21.660
He fucking voice very jerky.

1433
01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:24.600
So he starts with that and then then he asked and he asked him about doing

1434
01:30:24.601 --> 01:30:27.270
stunts.
Is it harder to do now that you're an old fuck?

1435
01:30:27.271 --> 01:30:30.990
Was basically the subtext.
And then in the end he goes,

1436
01:30:30.991 --> 01:30:32.760
how do you think America's going to receive you?

1437
01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:35.400
So then Mel had to play it off like he didn't know what he was talking about.

1438
01:30:35.401 --> 01:30:37.170
And then he basically brings it around and then the end,

1439
01:30:37.690 --> 01:30:40.440
Mel calls him an asshole.
And at one point when Mel was saying,
he goes,
well,

1440
01:30:40.441 --> 01:30:45.120
you know my life has been sort of a roller coaster.
He did say that.
So Nia,

1441
01:30:45.121 --> 01:30:49.650
do you want to try to,
I didn't mean to.
So you think like Mel Gibson.

1442
01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:51.870
All right,
well look,
I'm not going to lie to you.

1443
01:30:51.871 --> 01:30:55.050
You guys did have a rough couple of hundred years there at the beginning of this

1444
01:30:55.051 --> 01:30:56.790
country.
Started off a little slow for you guys.

1445
01:30:57.700 --> 01:31:01.230
What do you mean 400 it wasn't a couple hundred.
It was,
it was a couple hundred.

1446
01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:03.480
It was go online.

1447
01:31:03.481 --> 01:31:08.481
Right now near this fucking country is only 230 fucking four years old.

1448
01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:13.950
It is.
Yeah.
1776 that's when he officially became America.

1449
01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:17.820
That was 400 years.
400 Nia.
It's the two thousands right?

1450
01:31:17.821 --> 01:31:22.710
So that would be the 16 hundreds you guys came over with those fucking pilgrims

1451
01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:26.520
in their butter.
What do they make?
Oh,
their oil.
What?

1452
01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:31.590
What do we use the pilgrim as a,
it was one of this old colony gas.

1453
01:31:31.591 --> 01:31:35.670
Nobody remembers those guys showing my age.
I don't know.

1454
01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:39.300
They came over with smallpox.
Infected blankets.
You gave him to the Indians.

1455
01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:43.710
That's all I know.
Who did the pilgrims on the Nina.
The pinta in the Santa Maria.

1456
01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:46.620
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
We didn't do the smallpox thing.
Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.

1457
01:31:46.650 --> 01:31:47.730
You're getting ahead of yourself?

1458
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:51.810
We came over and we starve to death and then we acted like we were friends with

1459
01:31:51.811 --> 01:31:53.810
the Indians going,
hey man,
like how do you,

1460
01:31:54.090 --> 01:31:56.490
how do you make [inaudible] sit down and have dinner with us?

1461
01:31:56.740 --> 01:32:01.530
Call it thanksgiving.
Yeah.
Why don't I will kill you?
Why don't you teach us how,

1462
01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:05.710
right?
How to make,
how to survive out here.
And then once they did that,

1463
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:10.270
we would just like,
wouldn't it be awesome if we all lived here and they didn't

1464
01:32:13.010 --> 01:32:17.410
Hae Jebidiah why don't you sneeze into the fucking blankets and we'll give it to

1465
01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:21.890
him.
Yeah.
We went germ warfare way back in the day.
Yeah.

1466
01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:26.200
And then we gave him like $48 for the entire Midwest.

1467
01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:33.300
The Louisiana purchase.
No,
we did we buy that off of France?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1468
01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:34.840
Bought that off of France,
but whatever.

1469
01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:38.650
So that the French word over here murdering the Indians,
weren't they?

1470
01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:42.580
I don't fucking know.
All I know is they got,
yeah.

1471
01:32:42.610 --> 01:32:46.840
So I guess is proving that we both can,
we don't know.
Shit.
Don't know shit.

1472
01:32:46.841 --> 01:32:51.550
There's a bunch of people judging us right now.
Um,

1473
01:32:52.090 --> 01:32:53.680
well it's one of those things like,
you know,

1474
01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:57.100
like that type of shit you learn and it just really doesn't come up in your

1475
01:32:57.101 --> 01:32:58.510
everyday life.
You know,

1476
01:32:58.511 --> 01:33:01.600
as I figured out how to get these bankers off my goddamn back,

1477
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:05.380
the Louisiana purchase really doesn't come up,
I guess.
Can you name,

1478
01:33:05.381 --> 01:33:07.050
can you listen?
Let's see.
How dumb we are.

1479
01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:11.920
Can name as many American wars as you possibly can.
Okay.

1480
01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:16.630
World War One and two.
Bang.
Don't went with the easy ones right off the bat.

1481
01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:21.880
Civil war,
uh,
the Iraqi war.

1482
01:33:21.970 --> 01:33:23.670
Operation Freedom as

1483
01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:30.760
the Cold War.
Was that an actual wow.

1484
01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:36.580
Wow.
My girlfriend's an idiot.
Wait a minute.
I'm not an idiot,
but no,

1485
01:33:36.581 --> 01:33:40.330
I'm not very good at history.
All right.
I admit it.
I'm not,

1486
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:43.600
I don't know anything about it.
So then what are your trash in the country for?

1487
01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:48.640
I Dunno.
Can you just tap out and just say you're sorry.
Just say you.
Sorry.

1488
01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:52.300
Just say,
just say,
because what are you doing?

1489
01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:56.200
Do you think it's any better anywhere else?
Do you,

1490
01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:58.300
when you really look around the world,
where are they?

1491
01:33:58.301 --> 01:34:01.540
Where is everybody really holding hands and all getting along?

1492
01:34:02.050 --> 01:34:05.710
Isn't it everywhere that there's,
they have and the have.
Okay,

1493
01:34:05.711 --> 01:34:10.280
let's talk about Sweden.
Let's,
Ah,
let's talk about how you own,

1494
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:14.140
they only universal health care.
They only let good looking people in Stockholm,

1495
01:34:14.141 --> 01:34:18.490
Sweden,
and the second we got out of there,
we took the train out of there.

1496
01:34:18.490 --> 01:34:20.560
All of a sudden,
that's where they kept all the Brunettes,

1497
01:34:20.710 --> 01:34:25.300
all those Muslim looking dudes in that shitty fucking gray communists.

1498
01:34:25.301 --> 01:34:28.240
Look in mall we went to,
you remember that shit.
Well,
I mean,

1499
01:34:28.241 --> 01:34:32.350
isn't it sort of like Manhattan now?
That's not a good example,

1500
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:37.150
but maybe in more,
you know,
you know international Richard Cities,

1501
01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:38.410
you have people who yes.

1502
01:34:38.411 --> 01:34:42.280
Can Afford to get their hair done once a week and have gym memberships and nice

1503
01:34:42.281 --> 01:34:46.270
clothes and eat it.
Yes.
Just like here,
like here.

1504
01:34:46.630 --> 01:34:49.870
I know it's the same thing.
It's the same thing.
All right.
It's the same thing.

1505
01:34:49.871 --> 01:34:54.030
You don't think those Blondie's looked down on the brunettes and then a Brunette

1506
01:34:54.030 --> 01:34:58.550
Sco,
brunettes,
Sweden.
Yeah.
Within,
where the fuck were they?
They were there.
Yeah.

1507
01:34:58.551 --> 01:35:02.210
We were both walking down the street and Stockholm going,
Jesus Christ,

1508
01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:06.860
everyone's beautiful.
Look at Deca.
Yeah,
I felt like a fucking Mongrel.

1509
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:11.420
There was hot guys working on h and m like model guy.
Like,
like uh,

1510
01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:15.110
like movie star looking chicks working at like a newspaper stand.

1511
01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:19.490
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then what?
Remember that we got outside this Nia,

1512
01:35:19.491 --> 01:35:21.860
I'm telling you every where you go,
you go over to England,

1513
01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:26.630
they got their Rothschild's,
they got their royal fucking family.
You know,

1514
01:35:26.690 --> 01:35:31.160
they weren't even mingle with those fucking people who work on the tube or

1515
01:35:31.161 --> 01:35:34.700
whatever the fuck they do.
Right.
And then people in London,

1516
01:35:34.701 --> 01:35:38.630
they look down on people in Liverpool and people in Liverpool looked down on

1517
01:35:38.631 --> 01:35:43.430
people in another city.
But I only know two cities in England.
Right,
right.
Yeah.

1518
01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:46.280
So there you go.
It's all the same shit.
What do you think are going to go?

1519
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:46.761
You're going to,

1520
01:35:46.761 --> 01:35:49.400
you're going to move to where you're going to go to Canada and they're going to

1521
01:35:49.401 --> 01:35:53.870
be nicer.
I apparently,
they are very nice in Canada.
It's a really,
really,

1522
01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:56.870
you think so?
I don't know.
He just through Toronto out there,

1523
01:35:58.490 --> 01:36:00.020
every time anyone brings up Toronto,

1524
01:36:00.021 --> 01:36:03.620
they have nothing but nice things to say about it.
So,
but no,

1525
01:36:03.621 --> 01:36:07.670
I've never been there.
So you know,
this was supposed to be a nice,
cute segment.

1526
01:36:07.671 --> 01:36:10.490
I didn't take that.
It was really,
it really wasn't supposed to be about Oh,

1527
01:36:10.491 --> 01:36:14.090
you and your clothes and going to target.
Next thing you know,
you,
yeah.

1528
01:36:14.091 --> 01:36:17.180
Next thing you know,
you were having a reality moment.
Hissy fits.

1529
01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:21.510
I am thrown at celebrating the birthday of this country.
Okay.
I am,

1530
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:26.870
I am so mad at America right now.
I'm not mad at America.
This is a great country.

1531
01:36:26.871 --> 01:36:31.580
Of course it is.
But See,
took you 20 minutes to come back around.

1532
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:34.730
It is.
I do,
I live,
I like living here.
I don't have a pro.

1533
01:36:34.731 --> 01:36:39.690
I'm not just like this fucking cook for you.
Sucks man.
I'm not liking
me.

1534
01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:42.650
And let me tell you something here.
That's how we talk.

1535
01:36:42.651 --> 01:36:46.430
Whenever we talk about hippy,
really liberal people,
we always,

1536
01:36:46.730 --> 01:36:50.690
we always end our centers with me.
And Yeah,
m y a,

1537
01:36:50.691 --> 01:36:54.800
N O and if you guys want to see the ultimate Hippie,

1540
01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.030
you sent me Yosemite,
Yosemite,

1541
01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:09.470
Yosemite mountain giant double rainbow.

1542
01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:12.290
This guy said double rim.
Yeah.

1543
01:37:15.210 --> 01:37:19.610
You guys [inaudible] you have to watch this video.
Yeah.
This guy,

1544
01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:23.660
if he's on drugs,
he's the coolest guy ever.
But if he's sober,

1545
01:37:23.661 --> 01:37:26.840
he's one of the biggest,
he's such a Douche.
She had to live in the wilderness.

1546
01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:30.740
He basically sees uh,
a full on double rainbow.

1547
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:35.030
On Rainbow.
Yeah.
What does it mean?
And he starts fucking car.

1548
01:37:35.031 --> 01:37:38.990
I don't want to read it.
I don't ruin it for you.
Um,
here's another one.
Um,

1549
01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:44.720
I have like,
this is unbelievable week for you.
Two videos here.

1550
01:37:45.230 --> 01:37:48.830
Uh,
Jones's good ass barbecue and foot massage.

1551
01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.720
Oh look that one up Jones,

1552
01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:55.230
good ass barbecue and foot massage.
You've got to see that.

1553
01:37:55.231 --> 01:37:58.320
And this is one of the creepiest videos I've ever seen.
Creepy,

1554
01:37:58.321 --> 01:38:03.000
weird hippie yoga teacher slash.
Farmer.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1555
01:38:03.130 --> 01:38:06.780
You got to look at that one and a terrifying.

1556
01:38:07.110 --> 01:38:10.420
And then possibly my favorite

1557
01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:12.600
<v 7>I've ever seen.
If you guys are wrestling fans,</v>

1558
01:38:12.601 --> 01:38:14.400
you guys know how I love Rick Flair.

1559
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:18.330
And when he got on the mic and started talking about who he was going to fight

1560
01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:21.860
that weekend,
there was nobody better.
You got to see this lookup,

1561
01:38:21.930 --> 01:38:25.860
best wrestling promo ever jump in Jeff Farmer,

1562
01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:29.830
this guy is the worst I've ever seen any so and that,

1563
01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:34.270
that's like four videos.
Like,
like the mean gene guy is going,

1564
01:38:34.271 --> 01:38:36.470
jumping Jeff last week that you know,

1565
01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:39.370
we're going to actually do the gpt boy Jhumpa Jeff last week you've got attacked

1566
01:38:39.371 --> 01:38:43.060
by so and so,
uh,
you know,
how do you know?
And,
and he really,

1567
01:38:43.061 --> 01:38:45.550
he really beat you down and then you're supposed to jump in.

1568
01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:49.300
Well let me tell you something,
come on this Saturday at the royal rumble,

1569
01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.100
but he doesn't,
he just goes,
you know,

1570
01:38:51.101 --> 01:38:55.630
and he really beat you down and the guy just goes yup.
And then there's just

1571
01:38:55.710 --> 01:38:58.290
<v 8>long awkward pause.
Well,</v>

1572
01:38:59.270 --> 01:39:04.270
he turned the tables on me in a way that I didn't appreciate it and you just got

1573
01:39:04.641 --> 01:39:07.610
to see it.
There's like four of them.
And uh,

1574
01:39:07.670 --> 01:39:12.560
then there's another person who actually,
uh,
what is this one?

1575
01:39:12.561 --> 01:39:14.780
Fat nerd.
Wow.

1576
01:39:15.230 --> 01:39:19.150
Gangster threatens X.
Not at all.
One,

1577
01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:24.050
that's all one g and then it says guilties,
whatever that is.
G,
U,
I.
L,

1578
01:39:24.051 --> 01:39:27.590
D,
I,
e.
S.
And if they spelled it wrong or if that's a video game,
it's basically,

1579
01:39:27.591 --> 01:39:29.860
it's some really fat woman who,
uh,

1580
01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:34.900
got kicked off playing video games and she's a really pissed off about it and

1581
01:39:35.331 --> 01:39:39.350
she starts showing some of the moves she learned in Jujitsu block strike.

1582
01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:41.760
It's really bad.
Just,
just check all of those out.
But uh,

1583
01:39:42.230 --> 01:39:45.320
it's almost getting to the point where I have to wrap up the podcast.
So Nia,

1584
01:39:45.321 --> 01:39:47.060
you fucking Pinko commie.

1585
01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:52.370
Thanks for coming on the podcast in spewing your fucking hatred.

1586
01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:56.360
Hatred.
I'm not a Cami.

1587
01:39:57.170 --> 01:40:01.970
I love this country.
It's like a love,
not love,
hate.
I know.

1588
01:40:02.190 --> 01:40:04.340
Yeah.
You got the love hate thing,
which I'll,
I'll never,

1589
01:40:04.341 --> 01:40:07.900
I'll never be able to appreciate it as a white guy because my life is,

1590
01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:12.320
it's awesome in this country.
Perfect.
Anything you want,
it's tremendous.

1591
01:40:12.321 --> 01:40:16.160
I get a USA today and a bag of cash every day from the government.
Yup.

1592
01:40:16.190 --> 01:40:20.900
You're a white male,
ages 18 to 45.
Oh,
it's perfect.
It's,
it's a,
yeah.

1593
01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:25.170
Bankers don't fuck me over.
Nobody's,
you need it to be,
it's tremendous.
No,

1594
01:40:25.190 --> 01:40:28.620
you love living in this country.
You love the fact that you can,
you know,

1595
01:40:28.670 --> 01:40:31.850
make something out of yourself.
You can really come from nothing.

1596
01:40:31.851 --> 01:40:34.530
And that's the thing,
you know,
you know immigrants come,

1597
01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:36.890
you're really trying to save it right now

1598
01:40:39.170 --> 01:40:40.710
who don't speak a word of English.

1599
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:45.830
And then they do rise up amongst the ranks and have great likes.
Cesar Milan,

1600
01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:49.670
the dog whisperer.
Look at him.
Look at him.
Yes,
he,
he did it.

1601
01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:51.820
He came into this country illegally.
Right.

1602
01:40:51.821 --> 01:40:54.550
Then he swam across the river like 12 dogs tied to his bad.

1603
01:40:55.870 --> 01:41:00.470
Isn't that how we came in?
I think he did come illegally,
but he did become legal.

1604
01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:03.280
But so he's becoming,
yeah.
So there you go.
He has to,

1605
01:41:03.281 --> 01:41:05.170
I mean like how much money he's making.

1606
01:41:05.410 --> 01:41:08.890
Tyler Perry jumping Jeff Farmer Tyler.

1607
01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:12.220
Billy Carter are immigrants,
Huh?

1608
01:41:14.590 --> 01:41:18.070
Well,
yeah.
Oh,
immigrants.
All right.
Uh,
uh,

1609
01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:19.990
that fucking English speaking lady on.

1610
01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:24.190
So you think you can dance Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Arnold Schwartzenegger.
Yeah,

1611
01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:27.880
look at him.
Kelly.
40 yards in California.

1612
01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:32.020
It's pretty impressive.
Yeah.
You love this country.

1613
01:41:32.021 --> 01:41:34.810
But there are some things that bothered me about it.
Like everyone else.

1614
01:41:34.811 --> 01:41:38.170
Everyone else has various issues with this country too.

1615
01:41:38.890 --> 01:41:41.200
Maybe I'm not supposed to talk about it cause it's the 4th of July.

1616
01:41:41.950 --> 01:41:44.440
It's one of those things.
I know what you're saying.
Look you guys,
you know,

1617
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:45.580
thank you.
You know,

1618
01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:48.280
you go down to the corner store next to no 12 cops are pulling you out of your

1619
01:41:48.281 --> 01:41:51.820
car.
You know,
beating the crap out of you.
I get it.
Sure.
Yeah.

1620
01:41:51.821 --> 01:41:55.990
That doesn't happen to me.
I get annoyed this how spoiled I am as a white guy.

1621
01:41:56.380 --> 01:41:59.340
I get annoyed at airport security when they want,

1622
01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:03.610
when they want me to go through the little misty thing.
Are you a terrorist?

1623
01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:07.510
I get so fucking mad and I remember in that moment go and like,
why?

1624
01:42:07.511 --> 01:42:11.140
I can't imagine how those Mexican dudes in Arizona are feeling right now getting

1625
01:42:11.141 --> 01:42:12.910
pulled over every five seconds yet.

1626
01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:16.420
I'm sure they're not excited about 4th of July this weekend.
Well,
what are you,

1627
01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:20.690
what are you supposed to do?
What are you supposed to do?
You know what?

1628
01:42:20.691 --> 01:42:24.730
I don't understand social profile.
I don't know.
You know what?

1629
01:42:24.731 --> 01:42:28.540
I think once the sun goes down and your outside,

1630
01:42:28.541 --> 01:42:32.530
everybody racially profiles you do you have to think the worst of people so you

1631
01:42:32.531 --> 01:42:37.300
can get to your car in the parking lot.
Okay.
Yeah.

1632
01:42:37.301 --> 01:42:41.860
If I see a black dude or Latino dude,
they're in a gang.
If I see a white guy,

1633
01:42:41.861 --> 01:42:46.840
he's a serial killer
or a pedophile,
you know?

1634
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:52.300
Right.
Okay.
Yeah.
White guys are either spicy a woman,
she's a whore.

1635
01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:56.680
She's a streetwalker.
We're not interested lady about children,

1636
01:42:57.650 --> 01:43:01.960
feisty children.
They're a children of the corn.
That's,
yeah,
they just,

1637
01:43:01.961 --> 01:43:05.560
they just came out of the milkweeds.
Yeah,
you have,

1638
01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:10.090
you have to racially profile,
uh,
at,
at,
at night.

1639
01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:15.190
And I think the bigger a pussy you are slashed,
the more vulnerable you are.

1640
01:43:15.190 --> 01:43:18.430
Like someone like me never took any martial arts trading.
I just said,
you know,

1641
01:43:18.431 --> 01:43:21.820
I got like about 700 fights under my belt all within my,

1642
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:25.180
which is with my brothers,
you know.
So those don't count.

1643
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:28.390
They have to stop at a certain point because they have to answer to your dad.

1644
01:43:28.391 --> 01:43:30.370
But like I,
I go out in the parking lot,
you know,

1645
01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:34.900
fire him or fought off phone out there in the world.

1646
01:43:36.490 --> 01:43:37.660
Uh,
not as much as you,
I'm going to go,

1647
01:43:37.670 --> 01:43:40.930
that's the point it was going to make like a woman feels more vulnerable.
Yeah.

1648
01:43:40.931 --> 01:43:42.970
Like I don't walk around worried about getting raped.

1649
01:43:42.971 --> 01:43:47.200
The only time I have to worry about that is if I go to prison,
you know?

1650
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:51.470
Yeah.
Knock on wood.
So what,

1651
01:43:51.471 --> 01:43:55.250
at what time do you start racially profiling when the sun goes down?

1652
01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:58.320
So during the winter,
during the winter,
it starts earlier,
like around five.

1653
01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:01.890
I was going to say it's awfully early to start racially profiling.
No,

1654
01:44:02.210 --> 01:44:05.240
you know what it is.
This is when,
when,
when the second shift comes in,

1655
01:44:05.630 --> 01:44:08.270
if you know what I mean.
When the second shift comes in,

1656
01:44:08.271 --> 01:44:10.610
that's when I start racially profile.
At the beginning of the day,

1657
01:44:10.611 --> 01:44:12.100
people would get up at eight in the morning,
wouldn't,

1658
01:44:12.170 --> 01:44:13.730
no matter what color you are,
you get up in the eight in the morning,

1659
01:44:13.731 --> 01:44:17.330
you're a good person.
All right.
Your work to the end of the day.

1660
01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:19.310
Generally speaking,
you're a good person.

1661
01:44:19.810 --> 01:44:21.440
You can get them at eight in the morning.
You're good.
Yeah,

1662
01:44:21.441 --> 01:44:24.260
you're a good person unless you're that serial killer who just goes to work

1663
01:44:24.261 --> 01:44:25.300
every day and like,
yeah,

1664
01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:29.300
but I'm just saying generally speaking or got a fucking piece of shit on Wall

1665
01:44:29.301 --> 01:44:33.770
Street or a banker looking,
I,
there's a lot of flaws in my theory.
All right.

1666
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:34.730
But I'm,
I'm talking about,

1667
01:44:34.731 --> 01:44:38.600
I'm talking about just like worrying about physical violence.
Okay.

1668
01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:39.980
If you get up eight in the morning,

1669
01:44:39.981 --> 01:44:43.100
like it's very hard to get your ass kicked between eight and five in the morning

1670
01:44:43.101 --> 01:44:46.310
and five in the afternoon.
This is what I'm saying.
But APP wants this,

1671
01:44:46.590 --> 01:44:50.840
your kid on the school yard,
there you go.
Exactly.
As an adult.
There you go.
Right.

1672
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:55.070
So,
but after,
once the sun starts going down on the second shift comes out,

1673
01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:00.130
you know,
that's when,
uh,
like that,
that's when,
you know,

1674
01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:04.220
all of a sudden,
the fucking 28 days,
people come up from the manholes,

1675
01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:09.500
you know,
drug dealers come out,
the fiends come out,
depending on where you're at.

1676
01:45:09.501 --> 01:45:14.180
That's when,
yes,
that's right.
That's right.

1677
01:45:14.181 --> 01:45:15.650
The fucking stockers,

1678
01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:19.850
the guys with the date rape drug who honestly puts the date rape drug in

1679
01:45:20.230 --> 01:45:21.950
somebodies morning coffee,
you know,
do it.

1680
01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:26.540
When was the last time somebody got raped?
When the sun was up?

1681
01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:30.490
When the sun was up?
I am sure people get raped on this.
Sun Is no,

1682
01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:33.880
if you get rates on the sun is up,
you're asking for it.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1683
01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:36.320
Well I have to top your,
I don't like this country thing.

1684
01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:40.870
I'm trying to bring some of their hate on me.
Okay,
good.
Um,
yeah,
so I'll,
I'll,

1685
01:45:40.871 --> 01:45:44.060
I'll,
I'll admit that I,
I'll admit that to you.
I,
yeah,

1686
01:45:44.061 --> 01:45:45.680
I racially profile at night,

1687
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:50.030
but if there's a bigger group of people around and I feel safer than the racial

1688
01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:54.530
racial profile profiling goes down.
But seriously,
if I,
if I,

1689
01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:57.740
you know,
if you're a white guy with the shaved head during the day,

1690
01:45:57.741 --> 01:46:02.240
you have cancer at night,
you're part of,
you're part of a fucking Arion group.

1691
01:46:06.050 --> 01:46:06.590
Yeah.

1692
01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:11.590
I think I would be nervous if I was coming out of somewhere or,

1693
01:46:12.170 --> 01:46:16.100
and there was a whole gang of white guys that were like look like they were in a

1694
01:46:16.101 --> 01:46:18.530
frat and they were being loud and rowdy.

1695
01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:22.070
That would make me really nervous if I was walking and they were chanting rape

1696
01:46:22.071 --> 01:46:25.190
is rape,
rape is right dude,

1697
01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:29.750
oo do you agar bomber or some shit like that and they're all,
you know,

1698
01:46:29.751 --> 01:46:32.120
slapping each other on the back with their Letterman jackets.

1699
01:46:32.121 --> 01:46:37.010
That would make me very nervous to see cause because you saw the accused,
right?

1700
01:46:37.011 --> 01:46:39.800
I mean what are you basing this on?
I don't know.
I don't like those.

1701
01:46:39.801 --> 01:46:43.470
I don't like jockey kind of Frat guys.
Anyway,
this is awesome.

1702
01:46:43.610 --> 01:46:47.310
This is such a great podcast.
Okay.
Cause I date.

1703
01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:52.080
See everybody.
Yeah.
See that's the thing.
Everybody does it,

1704
01:46:52.081 --> 01:46:54.750
which gets me back to this.
Everybody does that shit.

1705
01:46:55.050 --> 01:46:58.500
And then when somebody and yeah,
and then when somebody steps out of line,

1706
01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:02.040
everybody gets to act like they don't think anything fucked up.

1707
01:47:02.041 --> 01:47:04.500
And I'm not saying,
you know that I uh,

1708
01:47:04.501 --> 01:47:08.510
that this is something right about like they look there,

1709
01:47:08.530 --> 01:47:11.880
there's gray areas where you have to think the worst of people so you can get to

1710
01:47:11.881 --> 01:47:15.480
your fucking car,
unlock it,
get in the shit.
Yeah.

1711
01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:17.640
I got freaked out the other night when I got in my car.

1712
01:47:17.641 --> 01:47:19.680
I just immediately felt like there was someone in the back seat,

1713
01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:21.770
like one of those horror movies.
Right.

1714
01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:24.840
And then I was also nervous because I had been singing with the radio.
It's like,

1715
01:47:24.841 --> 01:47:27.390
great,
this person tends to kill me and they think I'm a nerd.

1716
01:47:29.490 --> 01:47:31.580
Probably makes it easier to kill.
Yeah.

1717
01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:35.640
I'm going to miss this guy with this thing,
especially with the bucket seats,

1718
01:47:35.641 --> 01:47:38.580
it's so easy to reach around and just stab you in the fucking chest.

1719
01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:42.600
We're back in the day.
I mean we share the same car again and scare me.
Okay,

1720
01:47:42.630 --> 01:47:45.960
well I won't say I won't say that then.
Oh,
by the way,
by the way,

1721
01:47:45.961 --> 01:47:50.420
everybody I've made the decision.
Um,
yeah,

1722
01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:52.980
and basically by you guys,
you know,
to like,
listen,
we're,
we,

1723
01:47:53.190 --> 01:47:57.180
we both exposed a lot of a ugly parts about itself.

1724
01:47:57.181 --> 01:48:01.350
So before you guys fire up any fucking emails trashing my girlfriend or me or

1725
01:48:01.351 --> 01:48:04.890
whatever,
look in the fucking mirror.
Okay,
go,
go look,

1726
01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:07.370
go look at your cookies before you delete them on the Internet.

1727
01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:11.880
Look at the last fucking 17 websites you went to.
So let's,
let me ask you that.

1728
01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:13.650
How about that?
That's a great podcast segment.

1729
01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:18.030
Let me here and I want to hear from everybody.
Men,
women,
black,
white,
Latino,

1730
01:48:18.031 --> 01:48:22.950
Asian.
I want to hear you guys.
I want to hear like some of the times when,
uh,

1731
01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:27.060
you know,
you've,
you've done your own little racially profiling or you looked,

1732
01:48:27.061 --> 01:48:30.060
or people who aren't white,
how you think,
how you look at some white people.

1733
01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:32.760
Cause I think that's really interesting.
Like you don't hear that.

1734
01:48:32.761 --> 01:48:34.260
Like it's always white people on TV.

1735
01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:36.900
You have to like confess and apologize behind the podium,

1736
01:48:36.901 --> 01:48:41.820
like my old bit go and like,
you know,
they had that rap music.
It was loud.

1737
01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:43.500
I got nervous.

1738
01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.810
I didn't realize that they were the swim team and they were just trying to get

1739
01:48:48.811 --> 01:48:53.130
amped up.
Didn't you see them in the,
in their little speedos?

1740
01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:56.760
I don't know the music,
just blurt everything out.
You know.

1741
01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:58.680
So I want to hear from,
I want to hear from basically,

1742
01:48:58.681 --> 01:49:03.300
I want to hear from fucking everybody,
but basically times when when you've,
uh,

1743
01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:08.540
you've thought shit like that,
um,
or whatever.
I don't know,

1744
01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:11.610
just so we can get something positive out of this because so many times somebody

1745
01:49:11.611 --> 01:49:12.780
makes a comment like that,

1746
01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:15.510
like you made that kind of give a shit about the country's birthday and then

1747
01:49:15.511 --> 01:49:19.290
immediately that's,
that's the sound bite they take and then it becomes all it.

1748
01:49:19.291 --> 01:49:22.290
Then you actually get into,
oh yeah,
yeah.
Cause your uncle got,
you know,

1749
01:49:22.890 --> 01:49:25.080
got the shit kicked out of him because,
uh,
he,

1750
01:49:25.081 --> 01:49:29.850
his muffler was dragging as he drove himself to church in the cops felt that

1751
01:49:29.851 --> 01:49:34.260
they needed backup.
Exactly.
Yeah.
So,
um,
all right.
Yeah.
Okay.

1752
01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:37.530
So let's,
uh,
what was the last,
I just lost my entire train of thought.

1753
01:49:37.710 --> 01:49:40.400
You were saying you want people to write in all know ethnicity,

1754
01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:42.180
but I was going on,
I was going on.

1755
01:49:42.181 --> 01:49:45.390
There was one other fucking thing that happened yesterday.

1756
01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:50.200
You said I have decided you've got to speak into the mic.
Oh,
you said the,

1757
01:49:50.201 --> 01:49:54.550
I have decided to,
uh,
I get nothing.
Was this about the car?

1758
01:49:55.210 --> 01:49:59.730
Oh yes.
No,
the car I want to get.
No.
Yeah,

1759
01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:03.580
this is it.
Okay.
My girlfriend's beyond fucking cool.
Right,
right.
Sorry.

1760
01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:06.490
There was a little bit of a poor coming up there.
I was like,
you know,

1761
01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:10.600
you get like that air bubble just comes up.
My girlfriend's beyond cool.
Um,

1762
01:50:11.590 --> 01:50:15.280
I'm gonna get,
I'm gonna get that dodge challenger.
Um,
I'm going to get it.

1763
01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:18.370
And I actually,
I was looking at the one down there with the fucking stick shift.

1764
01:50:18.371 --> 01:50:19.960
I don't know when I'm getting it,
but I'm getting that car.

1765
01:50:19.961 --> 01:50:22.060
I don't give a fuck if I got to get a used one.
But,

1766
01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:25.480
and I think it's hilarious because the stick shift one,

1767
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:30.750
you actually have to pay a gas guzzler tax 1300 bucks out here and because it

1768
01:50:31.001 --> 01:50:35.280
only takes you,
that's even better.
So I keep the fucking side,

1769
01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:39.760
the passenger seat looking cute.
All right missy.

1770
01:50:41.530 --> 01:50:44.890
So anyways,
I think it's funny,
like it says it gets 14 miles city,

1771
01:50:44.891 --> 01:50:47.860
which means if you actually drive it like a fucking any sort of a man,

1772
01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:51.240
you're only getting like nine.
And how much is that going to cost you?

1773
01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:55.990
It's a that don't fucking kill my fun.
Alright.
No,

1774
01:50:55.991 --> 01:50:59.740
that's going to be,
the car will drive the Prius around like a couple of quiz.

1775
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:04.150
Right.
We'll do that.
And then,
and then it's uh,
the cars,
the shit,

1776
01:51:04.330 --> 01:51:07.390
it's a great car.
It's like a great girlfriend.
She's a cheap date.

1777
01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:08.680
She doesn't want anything.

1778
01:51:08.830 --> 01:51:12.280
And then that'll be the whore that it bring out every Sunday the garage comes
up.

1779
01:51:12.281 --> 01:51:13.550
Bubba,
Bubba,
Bubba,
Bubba,
Bubba

1780
01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:21.910
[inaudible].
Okay.
That's what I want to do.
Make the tires squeal,

1781
01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:25.960
capture the last drop a youth I've had.
I know that,
you know,
cause I actually,

1782
01:51:25.961 --> 01:51:30.961
I looked at a bunch of cars I looked at like those use BMWs by can't believe

1783
01:51:31.121 --> 01:51:33.280
it's that someone already farted in his car seat.

1784
01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:37.600
You when they try to like they're brand new and uh,
I just think everything,

1785
01:51:37.630 --> 01:51:41.980
everything looks like a fucking Mercedes or BMW and the,
that dodge challenger,

1786
01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:45.130
despite the fact that the Camaro's out there and the Mustang,

1787
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:48.730
it's still is one of the most unique looking bad ass cars out on the road.

1788
01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:52.540
And I know it's American,
which means it can go fucking in a straight line.

1789
01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:57.370
It's the shit.
But if you take a turn,
unlike those Julep over.
Yeah.

1790
01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:00.550
Unlike those German cars,
it's a little excitement with it,

1791
01:52:02.170 --> 01:52:05.540
you know?
Yeah.
No,
you don't give a fuck.
You know,
she,

1792
01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:09.380
my girl doesn't want me to get the car.
It's so much money.
Yeah,
no,

1793
01:52:09.450 --> 01:52:12.070
I get it again.
Well that's why,
you know,
that's why you cool.
Cause any of it.

1794
01:52:12.071 --> 01:52:14.920
Yeah.
Oh my God.
Get that.
And I'm going to sit down whenever you want.

1795
01:52:14.921 --> 01:52:19.240
A new guitar.
I say,
go get it.
You've earned the money to spend on it.

1796
01:52:19.241 --> 01:52:23.020
So go get yourself a new guitar.
You and I look that you give that.
Yes.

1797
01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:26.890
You're very supportive about giving me the green light to spend my money on

1798
01:52:26.891 --> 01:52:28.660
myself.
That's a great thing.
You know what,

1799
01:52:28.661 --> 01:52:31.230
this is the long she'd been on the podcast and yeah,
I gotta tell you,

1800
01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:34.240
you bring a lot to the podcast.
Okay.
You bring,
you bring jokes,

1801
01:52:34.450 --> 01:52:37.240
you bring a bubbly attitude and you bring a little controversy.

1802
01:52:38.010 --> 01:52:41.920
You bring a little controversy.
I was really surprised.
I was really surprised.

1803
01:52:41.921 --> 01:52:44.880
But you know,
said I not have said that.
No,

1804
01:52:44.890 --> 01:52:47.750
you should have because there's no way anybody shut it off after that.

1805
01:52:48.170 --> 01:52:50.510
There's no way anybody's shut it off after that.
And uh,

1806
01:52:50.810 --> 01:52:52.640
I think generally speaking,
we'll get good emails,

1807
01:52:52.641 --> 01:52:54.830
but there will be a bunch of fucking douche she wants.

1808
01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:58.220
I would like to point out that back in the day I really wanted to get one of

1809
01:52:58.221 --> 01:53:02.770
those,
uh,
flag Bikini's
Oh.
Dot.

1810
01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:06.650
They were awesome.
So like hot and sexy and whatever,

1811
01:53:06.651 --> 01:53:10.940
but then you go,
if you really look like a trashy,

1812
01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:14.390
especially if you wear it in a different country,
if you buy one of those Nia,

1813
01:53:14.391 --> 01:53:19.160
I will learn to ride a fucking motorcycle just so you can be on the back with

1814
01:53:19.161 --> 01:53:22.990
your booty crack peeking outing out of the flat.
I saw that.

1815
01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:27.470
Like there's no way for a woman to ride on the back of a motorcycle without her

1816
01:53:27.471 --> 01:53:28.670
fucking underwear hanging out.

1817
01:53:28.671 --> 01:53:33.440
I saw this skinny girl was on the back of a bike yesterday in her entire,

1818
01:53:33.441 --> 01:53:37.430
like,
you know the Thong where you have like,
it's not,
it's not a g string,

1819
01:53:37.431 --> 01:53:39.560
it's a thong.
So you have that slice of Pie,

1820
01:53:39.561 --> 01:53:44.540
bit of fabric is hanging out.
The top of it was where,

1821
01:53:44.541 --> 01:53:45.071
where the,

1822
01:53:45.071 --> 01:53:49.140
the tramp stamp tattoo should have been by the time she leaned forward.
Yeah,

1823
01:53:49.390 --> 01:53:53.880
it was great.
It was America is speaking of which I saw a girl,
a couple,

1824
01:53:54.110 --> 01:53:57.860
well I saw her,
this,
this last pool party I went to and she's a great girl,

1825
01:53:57.861 --> 01:53:59.630
but she has a,
uh,
made in

1826
01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:06.530
the USA Tattoo in the tramp stamp area.
Wow.
It's,
God bless her.
Awful.

1827
01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:10.010
She's a great girl.
And I said,
oh,
so are you,
you know,
in the the,

1828
01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:13.700
the armed forces or something?
Fuck the whole base.

1829
01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:23.480
No,
she was just like,
I just love this country.
When you put the microphone,

1830
01:54:23.481 --> 01:54:24.081
there you go.
I love,

1831
01:54:24.081 --> 01:54:28.160
I love what this country stands for and I'm really proud to be an American.

1832
01:54:28.161 --> 01:54:32.480
And I said,
all right,
you let her get away with that.
I mean,
what was I gonna say?

1833
01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:36.200
Okay,
I respect that.
What were you gonna say?
Cause I thought,
no,

1834
01:54:36.290 --> 01:54:39.590
I'm just really patriotic.
Yeah,
no,
you're,
you're right.

1835
01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:42.290
I just kind of accepted it.
She said she,
I asked her,

1836
01:54:42.291 --> 01:54:47.291
she gave me an answer and moved on and now I'm exposing her on the vodcast sorry

1837
01:54:49.650 --> 01:54:53.060
,
you were talking about how like,
you know,
cause I'm always looking at cars,

1838
01:54:53.061 --> 01:54:57.800
right?
Yeah.
On the Internet and all that type of shit.
And uh,
he was saying,

1839
01:54:57.801 --> 01:55:00.290
why do they always have like the women draped over him and all that?

1840
01:55:00.291 --> 01:55:04.040
Because the whole thing,
it's that guy visual thing.
You know what I mean?

1841
01:55:04.041 --> 01:55:06.380
Like when I,
when I look at the,
I'm not lie to you,

1842
01:55:06.381 --> 01:55:08.390
like when I was looking at that challenge or I actually got,

1843
01:55:08.391 --> 01:55:12.620
I got a little aroused and I'm not even,
I'm not even joking.

1844
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:15.710
No,
I'm serious.
Remember how you wanted to get off the lot.

1845
01:55:15.711 --> 01:55:18.390
But I was sort of lingering with one of my hands in my pocket.

1846
01:55:19.730 --> 01:55:22.200
I had filled up a little bit longer.
I know,

1847
01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:29.000
but I'm saying like she is tapped into that with that made in the USA thing.
Um,

1848
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:33.800
oh.
Like guys will be into that,
that whole sort of like fuck.

1849
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:38.680
And I got a bear.
I got a fucking car on.
This is my fucking woman.
Yeah.

1850
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:42.380
4th of July.
You got a sparkler.
She's blowing you.

1851
01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:47.050
She's a lesbian.
Did she?

1852
01:55:47.051 --> 01:55:50.440
Good looking lesbian.
That's where I draw the line.
Oh,
there you go.
Okay.
Yeah.

1853
01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:53.670
I have no tolerance for not good looking lesbians.

1854
01:55:54.510 --> 01:55:58.080
I'm really a snob when it comes to this power rate.
A lot of lesbians I like,
Oh,

1855
01:55:58.290 --> 01:56:01.950
now you just dug the hole again.
Like there's ugly straight people.

1856
01:56:01.951 --> 01:56:03.290
There's ugly lesbians.
So what did,

1857
01:56:03.450 --> 01:56:07.290
what did I like good looking lesbians and I like what you do because you're a

1858
01:56:07.291 --> 01:56:11.770
straight man that has a fantasy of being with like a couple of,
I don't know,

1859
01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:14.190
I'll just jerk off in the corner like a gentleman.

1860
01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:19.600
I would rather you admit to wanting to have a threesome with lesbians and say

1861
01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:22.660
you'll just want to be free if I want to wear a raincoat.
Yeah.

1862
01:56:22.661 --> 01:56:24.100
Like I'm in my creepy years,

1863
01:56:24.101 --> 01:56:28.810
I'm 42 dark socks pulled up to the knees when tips,
sneakers,

1864
01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:33.850
shoes.
I mean,
um,
no I don't,
I don't have like any,
uh,

1865
01:56:34.810 --> 01:56:36.760
I,
I don't have any,
I have zero tolerance.

1866
01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:41.720
Be attractive as a lesbian step up your game.
I have had it.

1867
01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:45.930
Why Mediocre looking glass?
I didn't realize I was such a problem.

1868
01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:48.380
There is one group of people in this country.

1869
01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:51.440
There you that I think needs to get out.
Take the hit off me.

1870
01:56:51.810 --> 01:56:54.200
Maybe they're talking about these illegal immigrants.

1871
01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:57.890
As long as you're good looking,
you can come into this fucking country.

1872
01:56:58.610 --> 01:57:01.220
I am equal up kick ugly.
We believe.
Yeah.

1873
01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:05.780
That's what I get to stay for some reason.
Well,
you're not ugly,
Huh?

1874
01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:11.590
Uh,
I'm a very,
very attractive.
Okay.
Please.
What?
Please,

1875
01:57:12.010 --> 01:57:15.550
how hard did you laugh the other day when you,
you,

1876
01:57:15.551 --> 01:57:20.170
you would put those little fashion fucking slits in your,
in your jeans.

1877
01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:23.400
Hmm.
And I was joking that I was going to do it my jeans.
I said,

1878
01:57:23.401 --> 01:57:27.210
what would you do if I said that?
And my jeans exposing my creamy thighs.

1879
01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:30.000
How hard did you laugh?
I'm a fucking mutiny.

1880
01:57:30.001 --> 01:57:33.150
I'm one step away from being a fucking albino.
All right.
We're all like,

1881
01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:37.590
we're like an hour to minutes in here.
That very controversial.
Nia Renee Hill.

1882
01:57:37.591 --> 01:57:41.580
Everybody look at that took up like an hour your day.
Happy fourth,

1883
01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:46.140
everybody forth.
And,
uh,
I'm sorry.
If you had to work today,

1884
01:57:46.141 --> 01:57:50.570
I hope this,
uh,
this podcast made it a little more enjoyable.
Uh,
Hey,

1885
01:57:50.571 --> 01:57:53.350
can I get a God bless the troops or something from your knees?
Absolutely.

1886
01:57:53.630 --> 01:57:58.040
God bless the troops.
100%.
There you go.
There you should go perform for them.

1887
01:57:58.070 --> 01:58:00.860
They're doing a lot.
So you want me to go do that Gig on the front lines?

1888
01:58:00.861 --> 01:58:02.780
I'm going to fucking do it.
I think you should.

1889
01:58:02.890 --> 01:58:05.960
I'm doing that and I'm getting the fucking challenger.
I eat the America.

1890
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:09.410
They don't get nearly as a pre.
I mean everyone says they appreciate the troops,

1891
01:58:09.411 --> 01:58:11.510
but I don't know that they get a lot of love,

1892
01:58:11.511 --> 01:58:14.390
especially from people who are anti this war,

1893
01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:18.240
but they're doing a lot of shit that most people wouldn't do.
So I commend them.

1894
01:58:18.490 --> 01:58:20.400
Yeah.
This goes back to my brave,
my bit,

1895
01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:22.850
that bit that I was doing what they were saying,
being a mother,

1896
01:58:22.990 --> 01:58:27.970
it's the toughest job on the planet.
Really.
Go fight a fucking war lady.

1897
01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:31.720
Put your apron and go make a pie.
It's America's birthday.

1898
01:58:32.050 --> 01:58:34.990
It's America's birthday.
All right.
Thanks for listening to everybody talk to you.

1899
