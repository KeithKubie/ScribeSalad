While cardinals are almost always bishops,

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.439

It's rare like *your former job was the director of the Sistine Chapel choir* rare

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.369
but not unheard of. In fact, every stage in this whole process is subject to the sitting Pope's whim so rules without exceptions are themselves exceptions.
