00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.101
- Seriously where
is the bathroom?

00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:03.336
- The bathroom is downstairs.

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:04.837
- It is downstairs?
- It's downstairs.

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:06.773
- And it's good for both?

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:07.674
- Yes, there's both.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:08.508
- Okay, great.

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:10.676
- Bye buddy.

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:13.246
- Did he mean both pee and poop?

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.416 line:0%
- Hey everyone, welcome

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:19.819 line:0%
We're talking about
episode eight today.

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.155 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And we are joined by
Drew and Helene, as always,

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.023
and Josh Segarra,

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.026 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
- What's up guys?
- Yeah!

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:27.694
- Hello!

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:28.794
- What about us?

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:30.196
- Hi, hello.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.463 align:start size:97% position:3%
I didn't know if I was
allow to stand up in the ...

00:00:31.463 --> 00:00:33.199
- I was so stressed to
high five on camera.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.667
(laughter)

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:35.502
- Whoa!

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.702
Sick ride, baby!

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:37.937
- [Man] I got it for Chase.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.472 align:start size:84% position:16%
I think he's wheely
gonna like it.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:40.774
You know, 'cause the wheels.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:41.607
(Lance laughs)

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:42.875
- Hi, Lance.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.810
- Now, you guys knew each other?

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.647 align:start size:88% position:13%
- We've known each other
for a decade, yeah.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:49.282
- Not super close, but man,

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:50.716
we've been buddies
ever since, man.

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:51.884
- [Chris] Just from the
theatre world, right?

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:53.119 align:start size:84% position:16%
'Cause you do
Broadway too, yeah.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.487
- Because we do the theater,

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:56.222
Josh and I know each other.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.891
- Our show has so many
Broadway people in it.

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.192
- Really trained people

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:00.894
- And Drew.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.895
- And then Drew.

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:04.363
- I've never seen a stage.

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:05.331 align:start size:97% position:3%
- He's never seen a Broadway
show, you've never gone-

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:06.532
- Don't like plays.

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:07.734
I hate 'em.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.169
- You saw Angels in
America Part One.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.571
Did you see the second part?

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.072 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I still haven't seen it.
- He came to set and was like,

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:14.073
"I'm gonna go see
the second part,"

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.407
we were like, "Mm-hmm."

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:17.510
- Still hasn't seen
it as if it's running

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.645
and it's a possibility.

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.813
(Drew laughs loudly)

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:21.814
- What are you doing here?

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:23.049
- Oh, um.

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:25.851
Sex?

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:26.686
- Hell yeah.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:29.588
That's what I'm talkin about.

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:31.057 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Here's a weird thing
we just remembered

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.324
is that you auditioned for a

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:33.659
thousand different
roles, didn't you?

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.694
- I did.

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:35.928
- Sorry.

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:37.429 align:start size:81% position:19%
- No way, that was
awesome though!

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.365
Those are days that
actors remember.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:40.332
You kidding me?

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:41.667
Now that it worked out this way.

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:42.601
I remember that day for sure.

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:43.769
I read three different parts.

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:44.937
- Do you remember-

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:45.905
- It was the flight attendant,

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.373
then it was the roommate,

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:48.841 align:start size:97% position:3%
and that was hilarious 'cause
now I know what happens.

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:50.009
And that's super fun, right?

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.243
Imagine that all the time

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:53.012 align:start size:84% position:16%
and that would've
been very fun, buddy.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:53.846
(laughing)

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:55.081
- Then they said,

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.349 align:start size:88% position:13%
"Hey man, you wanna come
play with this one?"

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:57.683
I said, "Heck yeah,
I love this guy."

00:01:57.683 --> 00:01:58.951
And it was awesome, man.

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:01.954
- We basically had to
make it fit you better.

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:03.589 align:start size:84% position:16%
So we spent a little
time with you,

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:05.525 align:start size:84% position:16%
started hearing
the words you said.

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:06.793
Like: oh hell yeah.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:07.760
(laughing)

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.128
And that became a part...

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:11.631 align:start size:84% position:16%
Your voice became a
part of the character-

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.232
- I don't know why you're
lying on camera, Sarah,

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:15.968 align:start size:97% position:3%
because we all know that
Lance is your spirit animal.

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:17.737 align:start size:84% position:16%
Lance has lived inside
of you for years.

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:19.372 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Once I found it,
it really came-

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.140
- I remember going up to you
on set on night and saying

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.142
"Can you say, 'Oh
hell yeah,' here?"

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:24.210
and you said, "Oh hell yeah."

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.311
(laughing)

00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:29.748 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No! Gimme that. Give
it. Absolutely not.

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:30.983
Not drinking alcohol tonight.

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:32.485
You're 14.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:34.921
Plus you're contractually
obligated to drink Voss.

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:36.489 align:start position:0%
- What did you do for your
birthdays when you were little?

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.658
- So in Orlando,
where I grew up,

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:41.327 align:start size:84% position:16%
for many years we
went to this resort.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.930 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I remember, it's
either my 13th or 14th,

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.065
and I remember men,

00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:50.403
just beautiful men, in Speedos.

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:53.273 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I remember this pool being
like, "This is the best!"

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:55.574 align:start size:97% position:3%
An arcade, they had
WrestleFest, the video game.

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:57.510
They had an indoor pool,
outdoor pool, but men!

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.679
So we go to the
top of the slide,

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.447
and I meet two men!

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:02.848
Gorgeous men.

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:06.953 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I say, "Guys, what's
going on here, man?"

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:09.422
And it's the first time
I learned what Pride was.

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.091
Pride is the weekend of June,

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:14.193
and they were holding
Pride at that resort.

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:16.295 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I was also
having my birthday.

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:18.097 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So for your 13th
birthday you went to Pride.

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:21.434 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Pride at a pool with
a slide, an arcade.

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:22.668
- That's great.

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:23.436 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And I made some
of the best friends.

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:24.603
- Wow!

00:03:24.603 --> 00:03:25.705
We grew up differently.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.506
(laughing)

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:29.342
- Hey, did he puke
on my back at all?

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.812
- Barely.

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:34.714
Well, a lot. He puked a lot.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.316
- Yeah, I could feel it.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.884 align:start size:94% position:6%
- This is the episode
where these two characters

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:41.620
reconnect, Brooke and Lance.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.988
And we really, when
we were writing it,

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:45.390
we were just like, what are...

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.059
Almost leaning into
the rom-comness of it

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.528
A little bit of...

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.295 align:start size:94% position:6%
What are these iconic
places we can put them in?

00:03:50.295 --> 00:03:52.231
One of them was on the bridge.

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:54.166
On the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:55.401
We had to shoot...

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.836 align:start size:88% position:13%
We had to shut down
small part of the bridge

00:03:57.836 --> 00:04:00.572
and redirect tourists
who were very eager

00:04:00.572 --> 00:04:02.174
to see who was shooting and then

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:03.009
they didn't really care.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.977
(laughing)

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:06.412
- They liked Case though!

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:07.913 align:start size:97% position:3%
Case got stopped many times!
- Case got recognized.

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:09.381
- Case would get
stopped sometimes.

00:04:09.381 --> 00:04:11.550 align:start size:94% position:6%
- A couple times filming,
people would come up

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.486 align:start size:94% position:6%
to me and be like, "Who's
filming over there?"

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:15.922
And I'd be like, "Uh, me."

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.558
(laughing)

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:19.759
"It's me."

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.194 align:start size:81% position:19%
- To take it down,
you think like,

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:22.595
"I wanna be on a tv show."

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.430 align:start size:97% position:3%
Then you're closing off
parts of the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.931
You're there waiting
for the sun to go down,

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:28.101
and you're like, "Whoa!"

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.401
It was crazy.

00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:30.769
- That was such a special...

00:04:30.769 --> 00:04:32.872
The scene watching
those characters have

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:34.106
separated from each other.

00:04:34.106 --> 00:04:36.275
You watched him help
your little brother,

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:38.343
and that is, I think,
something a lot of us

00:04:38.343 --> 00:04:40.412
can relate to with
past relationships

00:04:40.412 --> 00:04:41.780 align:start size:84% position:16%
is they become a
part of your family.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.415
- Of course.

00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:45.051
- I think that she
thought that her life

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:46.752
was gonna be this
big thing, and then

00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:49.855 align:start size:97% position:3%
she is faced with this
person who is a part of it,

00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:51.724
and she's like, "I
don't need this."

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:54.526 align:start size:97% position:3%
Then realizes how important
those simple things are

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:55.961
and that kind of a connection.

00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:56.895
- And not to be too dramatic

00:04:56.895 --> 00:04:57.797
'cause this is a comedy thing,

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.065
but we did talk about,

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:00.466
'cause we both have
a parent who died,

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:03.736 align:start size:88% position:13%
and we talked about
relating to having an ex

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:06.038
that knew our parent
and then being like,

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:07.640
we're breaking up with them,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.575 align:start position:0%
but you still feel a
connection because you're like,

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:12.378
they knew me when I was
then or they knew them.

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:15.248
- And they were there with
me while that was happening.

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.083 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So we liked that about
your character in the season.

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:18.784 align:start size:84% position:16%
That you're
introduced as a dummy,

00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:20.553
or introduced as a comic relief,

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:22.654
or as like a this guy.

00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:25.725 align:start size:97% position:3%
But humanizing him throughout
and seeing that he is

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:28.093 align:start size:94% position:6%
a solid person, he is
like a rock and he is like

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:29.127
feels like home.
- Home to her.

00:05:29.127 --> 00:05:30.629
- It's even like on the bridge,

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.966 align:start size:94% position:6%
he says something about
his mom's friend's Connie.

- You just know
there's a shorthand.

00:05:36.835 --> 00:05:38.604
- That you know who Connie is.

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:41.240
- In the middle of laughter
you see two people connect.

Taking care of their
younger brother.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.177
- Totally.

00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:46.912 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:49.014

00:05:50.415 --> 00:05:51.517
That's why I'm happy to be here.

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:52.452
- That's nice.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.855
- Heavy.
