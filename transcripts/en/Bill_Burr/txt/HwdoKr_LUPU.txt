Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr. It's time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       just checking it on you. I'm just checking it on. You Do da Duda Iowa. Got One more fucking day before I fucking go home. One more day in the film. I still got three more after this, but I get to go home and see my little daughter. They're very excited about that. Um, and by the way, I asked the director if it's okay if I tell you what movie it is, cause I never know, you know, do you leak out information? He said it was cool. So the movie's called Front Runner Front Rado and it stars Hugh Jackman and uh, directed by Jason Reitman. Okay, there you go. So, oh, freckles has a little part in there. Don't blink your eyes, you might miss me. But uh, that is what I am working on out here. And um, every time I go down to set, I'm telling you, they show me something that they shot and it looks really, really fucking cool.

Speaker 2:          00:01:09       So I'm very excited to be in a, in this movie here. But uh, yeah, so I got one day, one a I like, I got one scene today site and I'm the first one out of the gate. That's about as good as it gets. You know what I mean? Sometimes you the first scene and the last scene, but you get to see everybody else act and everything like that. And that's cool, right? The only thing that's bad about being there the entire fucking day is for whatever reason, um, when you're on a movie set, you just eat like a fucking, I don't even know why. You don't even know why you're eating. You're just sitting there going, why am I eating right now? Just standing around and all of a sudden they bring around some fucking, uh, oh Halloween's coming up here. Some fucking Halloween cookies.

Speaker 2:          00:01:56       They start eating like Erin in the fifth grade, literally eating it, looking at another adult who's also eating, getting you both say the same time. But the fuck are we doing? Um, I've actually been pretty good on this shoot and the food's been awesome. So, uh, and I did lay off the Halloween cookies and I'm doing my fucking catio today. But in a professional, God dammit, you guys all know what a freckle booze bag bag am, right? You all know how I can't lay off the booze. Um, I've been doing it man, 70 fucking days. So a, I don't know, think on day 73 already be 20% of the year already have that in. I might go a year, I might go a year. I might fucking bows tonight. I don't know. Who knows? It's exciting. It's an exciting time. You think that world series game last night was fucking riveting? That was, that was a joke compared to watching me try to walk by a bar. Um, I was on set last night so I didn't get to, I saw, uh, it was three

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       to one and then, uh, we were shooting the final thing and I checked the score and I saw was three to three is like, Holy Shit. The Astros came back and um, we ended up wrapping and uh, it was like five to three. Houston.

Speaker 4:          00:03:18       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:03:18       So I, you know, we go down there, we get out of our fucking clothes and all that shit. We had get back into the regular clothes to head back to the hotel, everything shut down here. And me and another actor went into the, this bar that we saw that was open and uh, try and get something to eat. I think it was like after 12 at that point was gonna slip tickets around the area that we're staying at. And uh, we walked into the bar and saw that it was five to five. I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. Well, maybe it was seven to five. Seven to five. Yeah. The last I saw it was five to three Astros' and in the time it took me to get off set, jump in the van and head back, it became seven to five Astros.

Speaker 3:          00:04:03       And I was like, what the fuck happened? I'm missing one of the greatest world series games probably ever. And um, so we go in there and we asked the guy behind the bar, right. You know, and the guy's like, he's like, sorry, fellows. The fucking, I can't even explain how high this guy's voice was. I Dunno if he was in the middle of transitioning or whatever. I have no idea. But it was like, it was like Michael Jackson level high inexplicably, and the guy had stubble on his face. I don't get it right. Um, you look like a giant, like marionette puppet and he's gone. Sorry fellows. If you want [inaudible] you gotta go. So fortunately this guy with the high pitch voice told us where to go. We ended up going all the way down the street and uh, like four or five blocks down and it was really cold, uh, for Atlanta. I thought he meant I'm sitting with a little fucking sweatshirt and we went down and found this bar that was still open and we get in there, it's seven to five. And as we walk in the door, the Dodgers hit a home run, I think to make it seven to six.

Speaker 4:          00:05:15       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:05:15       They're only down by running. It's like, you've gotta be kidding. This is unbelievable. And um, unfortunately the game ended day. I was sitting there because I wanted the Astros to tie it up cause I want more, more baseball. I want to see a, I want to see a seven game series here. But uh, I wanted the Dodgers to tie it up cause I was hoping, you know, I wasn't going to bed. I was fucking wired. I was hoping to get like 15 innings of baseball, but congratulations to the Astros. You know, and things are getting a little chippy out there. I guess they're imitating some guy in the Dodgers. That guy with the Blue Mohawk, I don't know anybody's fucking name. I guess he flips the bat and sticks his tongue out so they're like, oh yeah, well we're going to flip the bat. We're going to stick our tongues out. These are adult males, everybody, um, stupid shit ever. But it's been a, a incredible series. So I'm hoping game three, I'll actually be, uh, I'll be home and I can sit down and watch it. Now watch game three will suck. You know what I mean? The pictures dull, not even a good one. They believe stranded base runners. Um, and that's it. That's all the fuck I got. I don't know what to tell you. I'm just been, um,

Speaker 3:          00:06:26       working like a maniac. So I mean the first scene tonight, uh, today, which is great because, um, I'm actually going to do a little promotion here. Um, there's a 30 for 30 coming out, an arguably one of the greatest, if not the greatest entertainer of all time and wrestler of all time ric Flair, the ric flair, 30 for 30 is coming out and they're having a premiere tonight and uh, I'm going to go to it and I think ric flair is going to be there. So I'm going to go a little Jim Norton here and try to get my picture cause I've had a Twitter photo up on my, uh, whatever they buy Twitter accounts since then. That was taken in June of 2014. I still remember, I got to meet him, talk to him. He was the coolest fucking dude ever was telling stories and uh, just an awesome guy.

Speaker 3:          00:07:18       So I'm hoping that tonight I can update my photo. I'll call that be haven't updated it in three years because it was a ric flair photo. Hopefully I can update it again with another one. Um, and if I don't, who gives a shit? I get to watch the ric flair 30 for 30, which everybody should watch. I don't care what's going on in your life. I don't care if your wife's going like maybe third time together. We go to the pumpkin patch. [inaudible] you got to say, lady, this is one. I'm not doing the Tivo want this one. I'm going to watch live fucking what do I lie? Right? You got to see this one live. And um, how do you, how do you wrap up ric flair story in 30 minutes.

Speaker 4:          00:08:01       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:08:02       Is that what it means? Right. 30 stories, 30 minutes long. They've already done way more than 30, so they should, you know, I already saw Dan, the Dan Marino football life and that was 30 minutes like with commercials or something like that was her day should have been at least 90 minutes. Um, how much the game has changed and how much the game had the change. And how did it had it be dead to become borderline illegal to cover a receiver past, you know, your first little, you know, two yard chuck or whatever you're allowed to do. Now all of that had to happen. NFL had to try to go global and try to get all these fucking, you know, half fans by, by running up the scores. All of that had to fucking happen for Dan Marino's records that stood for 30 years to start the fall.

Speaker 3:          00:08:54       That's all I'm saying. You know, that should have been 90 minutes. No, I guess you can't do that. Cause then all the other legendary players who'd be like, well, how come my we Joey dirty 90, he sticks his Toga, flips the bat and then they'd get all fucking upset. I did things too, you know. So anyways, I'm looking forward to that and um, I dunno, and that's it. Other than that, I'm going out of my mind, uh, being stone sober, remembering every fucking waking moment of the day. Um, every day that I'm sober, I'm reminded why I drank. You know, I, I got to go to an AA meeting. I got to hear people talk positively about being sober. Cause I gotta be honest with you, I don't fucking get it. And when I fucking lay off the booze, all it does is make me want to try drugs.

Speaker 5:          00:09:52       You know?

Speaker 3:          00:09:54       I never smoke weed. I don't smoke. I'm not into it. I just don't, I'm not into it. But then if I don't drink everyone they know a couple of times a month, I'm just like, I got to fucking do something to break up the monotony. I have such a respect for these straight edge people. I don't know how they do it.

Speaker 5:          00:10:11       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:12       Can I tried to tell me about being sober? He goes, you know, you don't understand. Is that like, you know, alcohol kills. I haven't seen endorphins. I don't know what it is that actually makes you feel good about your life. He goes, I don't drink. I'm actually, I don't need it. I don't need a bill. I'm like high on life, you know? And I was just looking at him. I was just, I couldn't help but think you're full of shit. No you're not. You know, when you're high on life, when you're a kid, you know, and you never throw out your back and your shoulders not fucked up. You don't have a psychotic nerve issue. Your feet don't hurt. He just get out of bed. You're brand new, you're jumping around the fucking house doing cartwheels and shit, running around. Hey, let's go in the living room.

Speaker 3:          00:10:59       You just get up and you'll run to the other room. Then you're high on life. Yeah, you don't have any credit card debt, right? You know, got a lady in your life going to wish they didn't have a date night, right? None of that bullshit. Then you can be high on that. You on life. Then you know what happens. Uh, you know what happens? You become an adult, all right? And all of a sudden you started understanding why, why it is that technically, you know what I mean? If you live in down on the equator, you actually standing sideways, okay? And why you don't go flying off the fucking plan. You start to understand it. It's the weight, the weight of the universe being on this thing that's fucking spin it right. And all this fucking debt you're fucking accumulate and it's all coming down on you. And the holidays coming up right on the holidays. Fun Anymore, Huh? Do you get into the Christmas spirit the way you got to start growing around and fucking seeing everybody and getting on a fucking plane. Watch it some Douche bag after they just said, only one thing per person in the overhead compartment. Stick three fucking bags up there.

Speaker 5:          00:12:14       You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:12:16       And that's when the stewardess comes by and she just goes, can I get you something? Could you like something to drink? It's like, yeah, lady. You know those little bottles of booze you have? How many of you think you could carry in both your arms? Why don't you stuff a few in your fucking breezier over there and bring them over here so I can get to this goddamn flight? Right. Um, or maybe, you know, maybe you still enjoy that time of year. It's that time of year when you could say, look at that. I was just singing a Christmas song when I was still in the fucking was that headphone as a beer commercial head for the mountains. That taste is smooth and it's Busch beer. Busch beer. I love how they have the balls to do a commercial now as if their beer tastes good.

Speaker 3:          00:13:05       Everybody knows that. Busch Beers for, that's what that's like when you're hung over and you want to get back in the game. You know that said, you know, Cook me. Let me fucking slit your fucking eyelids. Cause you were all swollen up from the booze the night before. And that's what that bears, let's put Busch beer and all those fucking beers. Cores, light, Busch, Busch light. All of those fucking beers are when you drank so hard the night before. You know, and you just don't have an opinion not to drink the next day and you need to get back in the game. It's the cortisone shot of alcohol. That's what it is.

Speaker 5:          00:13:44       It's fucking stupid

Speaker 3:          00:13:46       fucking commercials with the guy standing next to a damn river. What does that all about? To let me know how watered down that fucking Cannop pisses that I'm going to be drinking. But God bless you because it still gets me fucked up. Um, anyways. I don't know. Do I need therapy? I don't know what it is. I think I just need to get home. Um, so anyways, um, yeah, I just been going on in my mind here, unless I'm down on the set, if I'm just fucking hanging out and it keeps saying, I keep threatening to myself that I'm going to go down to the college football hall of fame, but I don't think I'm going to make it again today because I got to go the fuck an elliptical burn off all the food I ate yesterday. I didn't do bad. I ate the fish yesterday and I got to tell you, the catering on this movie has been out fucking standing. It's been delicious. You know, I dunno what, what catering has gone to another level since I started doing my, uh, my three lines per movie acting career. You know, why don't they have awards for that? For people like me on movies,

Speaker 5:          00:14:50       you know, they,

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       they are best supporting actor. Right. But you mean you still gotta be like a major part of the movie? What about people like me? Where's my award? I think that my award, just an awards show. They should do that. Just have it on youtube. And they just had, right. You have a host nobody's heard of and a bunch of actors you can't fucking name, you know, and then you let people vote, you know, best two lines in a movie for 2017. And uh, I dunno, whatever awards you, you win. It's like made out of chocolate or something. You eat it or something. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's a little, it's a shot of the flask. I don't know. I don't pretend to understand these fucking things. Anyways, guess what I'm doing next week? Everybody, other than seeing my beautiful family, spending every fucking second with them, um, is I am going to be playing the surf Baldwin ballroom, sorry, in Iowa.

Speaker 3:          00:15:46       And this is where, uh, you know, uh, uh, buddy Holly, the big bopper and Richie Valens all did their last show. It's a little fucking more, but, you know, but I want to go there. I want to see it right. And I'm flying right into the same airport that they took off from and crashed. And everybody's going, dude, what the fuck? And it's like they, they had ice on their wings. That's what happened. That's why they crashed that in an experienced pilot. And they had ice on the wings and they didn't have the, they didn't have the technology back then, the spray, the chemicals. So I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I'm going to be all right. Um, so anyways, I'm going to be doing that on a Thursday of next week. And then Friday, Saturday, I'm in one of my favorite goddamn cities in the world. Milwaukee, Wisconsin. All right. And, uh, Dean del Ray's going to be doing the Thursday one and then I got forsee and Bard. Nick,

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:45       In Milwaukee for Z. Bart, nick and myself and one of my favorite cities ever. And, uh, I have to somehow try to maintain being sober. I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it, but I don't know how much fucking longer I can go. I got 70 days in. All right. You know what it is. I know when I have that neck strength that I'm just going to be on again for another two fucking years. That's what I'm hoping. What I can do is I'm going just what I'm going to do when I come back, when I returned after this injury, right? When I make my return to the big leagues of Booze, I would like to fucking, I would like to boos the way I smoke cigars now cause I got that under control. Like I smoke a cigar like once every fucking three weeks or something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:17:38       That's how, right. Right. 12 to 15 a year. I'm so full of Shit. I've smoked more than that this year, but whatever, I at least I make an attempt. Okay. The third base coach with the cigars is holding people up. All right? But that fucking lunatic with the booze is just waving me around every time. Um, I don't know. I gotta be honest with you. Having a is a great way to fucking not drink. You know what I mean? You can't just sit there and getting drunk when you have a kid in the house. And plus even if you do like a moron, the next morning your kid's going to wake up at like seven in the morning and then I'll give a fuck about a hangover. Um, so I guess it's just one, I'm on the road. I don't know what it is or maybe I just like booze and you know, it's all of that shit.

Speaker 3:          00:18:28       I really enjoy it. I miss it. You know, I think I'm going to sober dial my fucking my booze itself. Um, anyway, so I'm going to be doing that. And then I go up to Green Bay and uh, and then that Monday night Boba bubble though to go to green bay as a Monday night football game that I was going to go to with [inaudible] and Bart. Nick, I'm on, you know, I can't even say, unfortunately, I got to get back to do my last three days on the movie. And, um, so I can't make that one. But Jesus Christ, if you're not going to go to Lambeau field, it's a pretty good excuse, right? Cause you're going to be in a great fucking movie starring Hugh Jackman called front runner. There'll be coming out in 2018 please tell all your friends, please go to the movie theaters and go see it.

Speaker 3:          00:19:15       Um, who knows if the schedule changes, maybe I'll get to go, but I think versus the, and partner could still gonna go. Um, and that's it. Other than that, I don't think I have anything left to tell you other than my shoulders completely fucked up again. Um, I turned the corner with my rotator cup and um, that I went too far. I don't know if it's cause I did depths or I tried to do a pull up with one of those fucking assist bands, things, you know, I tried to do, I just pushed it too far and then I got to start all over again. It's fucking frustrating. How are you going to do? He can't do it. Hey, you know, it's fucking annoying. Two years, say ag nerve last year and I got my fucking shoulder, you know, but fortunately I've been eating like a lady, some staying in shape here.

Speaker 3:          00:20:03       Alright Indochina, everybody. Ah, we're doing the reeds here and don't cheat. Oh fuck, fuck the reads. You know something? I was reading this thing about this couple, that mountain climbs and they were trying to climb one of the more difficult ones where you're literally walking in the jet stream. It was wind was blowing so bad they couldn't sleep at night. So of course one of these fucking morons gets lifted up in the air by the wind, slammed down between two rocks. Her foot gets stuck in between the rocks and then the wind is blowing so hard, it twists her body around and she breaks her fucking leg. Now the other two fucking jerk offs who were also completely safe before they decided of out

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       of the bucket blue on a nowhere to put their lives at risk, right? With absolutely no respect for anybody else in the world who gets tortured, who lives in these horrible fucking war torn conditions. You know what I mean? And all they want to do is just be able to come home and be safe. These two fucking free morons.

Speaker 4:          00:21:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:21:10       Decide that they're going to go up there with deliberately put their lives at risk. So now the other two assholes have to carry this lady down with their spiral fracture taking turns while walking into the jet stream. And I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing during this when I'm reading this, my supposed to be thinking, wow, what incredible human beings. I don't, I just think what a couple of fucking morons because then some poor bastard has to fly a helicopter up there and try and meet them and risk his fucking life.

Speaker 4:          00:21:39       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       Sandra? I, I just, I don't know. I don't know how people in the coast guard do it. I don't know how these people in like helicopters around the fucking world, their job. What is your job, sir? What is your job man? We all want is my job. Oh, I rescue fucking morons.

Speaker 2:          00:22:02       You don't have, I mean the fire department has that too. To a certain extent. You know, somebody sitting there smoking a cigarette, eating a pop tart and bed nod off and he likes his fucking bed on fire, right? Then they got to go in there and go get the guys he's hiding in the closet, you know with the frost and still around his lips that start in the milk. They have to go in there. They got to go get the gun. I don't have the MD. You want to talk about fucking hero? How do, how do they do that?

Speaker 4:          00:22:32       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:22:33       You have to go risk your life to save a fucking moron. Is there making the call? Yeah. Hey, well, hey my, my wife broke her leg. I got, Oh yeah, where are you? Where's your house out? Nah, we climbed up a mountain. The fuck did you do that for? Oh God, I would love to take those calls. What the fuck did you do that for? Great. Great. So now let me guess. Now you want us to go up there and go get you. You fucking moron. You know we should leave you up there, right. You know you deserve that. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:23:13       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:23:14       Do you understand the person flying up there and the helicopter isn't it, is expecting it to. He's becoming a father and another month and he might not make it because you fucking idiots left a perfectly good hotel room and decided to climb up there. So what? You could talk loudly about it in a bar with your frostbit and cheeks. You dumb cunts. Tell you what, walking up a thousand feet down the fucking mountain, I'll check the forecast. Maybe I'll pick you up in a week.

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       I guess you got to be cut out for that job. I don't know. All right. In, don't cheat. All right. Talk about how every man looks better in a suit. You know, every day I'm checking out guys walking by, you know, you know, I like it. Nice George Michael Stubble. I'm not gonna lie to you, right? But I gotta be telling me, be honest with you.

Anyways, this is from George and who allegedly exists and wrote this and this is not from some advertising company.

Speaker 2:          00:34:05       I decided to try me on these because I love bill burrs. Me On these jingles. I smile every time he sings it. A man wrote that. Now, if this was a lady, I believe that a lady would be emotionally open enough to say that I smile every time he sings it. I think this has been edited. Um, although it's so easy to skip ads in a podcast, I always capital's listened to bill's reads and I'm so glad me undies has stuck with them. It's probably been two years since I first bought a pair of me undies and now I have a monthly subscription because they are that comfortable. Doesn't this Raul read is phony before me undies. I used to buy the three pack of underwear at the retail stores until I realized that I wanted to treat my junk to something more comfortable and that starts with a great pair of BMDS, cradling my family jewels.

Speaker 2:          00:34:55       This is so fucking written by their advertising teams. I know you guys are writing them in. I know you're writing these guys telling you like, I mean that there's no fucking way you write it that eloquently. This was totally edited. I'm calling bullshit. But anyways, to get 20% off the best, softest underwear and socks you'll ever own, free shipping and 100% satisfaction guarantee. You know, we have to go.

Okay, well I got, I got to work in my little workout. I'm going to go put, put on my pink legwarmers you know, and do a couple of buck blasters.

Speaker 2:          00:35:40       All I do now is I just get on the elliptical. That's all I do. And I put on my fucking, uh, you guys want to hear about why my cardio? This is my cardio. I like to listen to mindless music when I'm on, you know, I finally have given into gym music. Like I used to walk around the gym and I'd be like, Ugh, why are they playing? Pour some sugar on me? It's like, you know, cause it's actually, you know, I go through different periods. Sometimes I didn't want to listen to a fucking absolutely genius, um, album or something like that. Or I just don't even want to think. And lately I don't want to fucking think and I know what it is, is because I'm missing my family. That's what it is that I mentioned that 5,000 fucking times. So right now I just want to go into like, you know, it's like, why, you know, I like washing dishes. It's fucking mindless, you know what I mean?

Speaker 7:          00:36:31       Uh, but the water in the tank with the top and I Bunkage

Speaker 2:          00:36:34       until it's clean and it's just gives you something to do, something to focus on. Like why can't I get that fucking brand flake that looks like now it's been sandblasted under this bowl here. Why can't I get that off clock? Shocking. You know, you get a little anger out. Um, here, here is my, um, my mindless music. I listened to fail it steel feel it still from Portugal, the man [inaudible] [inaudible] and my comment at a left field,

Speaker 7:          00:37:06       Oh god, he got it. Got that Gagaku

Speaker 2:          00:37:09       that gets me, it gets me through the first five minutes. And then I listened to mark Ronson, uptown funk. Oh, this is the same song, the same song they write every summer, right? Boop, boop. I listen to that shit. Right? Slightly embarrassed. But I listened to it and then I listened to the honey drippers rocket at midnight. And uh, then I just have a bunch of Tom Petty, and this isn't mindless music, but I'm kind of stopping listening to that. I kind of switch off. Then I've listened to three mindless songs in a row and I love Tom Petty, but he just died. So it makes me sad. So I just saw primus. So after those three mindless songs, I then go into, oh, I go into awesome music music that I really like. I'll listen to Primus or Mars Volta, my new favorite band, fucking dope found out about them fucking 15 years after they were together. So stupid. Um, so anyways, and that's when I have to go do so everybody, you guys want to share with me your a little cardio fucking list. I need you. I need, I need another three fucking songs as mindless as those first three that I just sent to you. This silly to happy. And next thing you know, I looked down and all I had, you know, I only do like a half hour, you know what I mean? I only do a half hour because these needs have to last me a lifetime. All right, I'm with this bullshit. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       there's going to be a little music here and you're probably not going to know what the music is and I'm not going to know what it is either because Andrew Feminists, uh, you know, he goes deep, he goes deep into the music world. So if you have any questions, just ask what song it is on our Twitter app at the MM podcast. All right. And ask Andrew and they very polite, respectful way, what the song is. I'm sure he'll get back to you. All right. And uh, then we'll play after that. There'll be another half hour, this podcast, a classic half hour, um, of, of classic clips from a Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast that, um, I don't know, maybe from early this year, maybe from three years ago. I have no idea. You might even listen to me talking about how much fun I had boobs in the night before, you know, uh, that's it. All right. Have a great weekend and I'll talk to you on Monday.

Speaker 8:          00:39:39       [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:40:04       anyways, I get them into the biggest, dumbest fucking fight last night with my girl, right? We had this great day, you know, everything's going great. So I stay in, I take a night off from comedy and I say, Hey, why don't we watch, why don't we watch a movie? You know what I mean? Cap Off this wonderful fucking day. Everything's going great. What could go wrong? This is like the beginning of a horror movie where they just show like the perfect family and everything's great and people are wearing like white linen, you know? And then all of a sudden they just start showing the camera and the bushes, like a POV of like Mike Myers. This is basically what happened. So 60 minutes comes on, right? Who doesn't want to watch that show and pretend they're smart, you know, I like it some more that Morley safer comes on and you know, we smells like an old person. Some old people don't smell like old people, but he looks like he smells like an old person, you know, smells of cigars, ash trays, you know, couple of wars, maybe a date rape. Um, so he's interviewing Meryl Streep, alright, the great Meryl Streep, and they're going through all oral, oral frigging life and all the movies and all the different characters that she's played. Oh, first of all, they start, they start the report off with Morley safer just sitting there, right. Smelling a fucking Ben Gay in whiskey. Right. And uh, he says, how you,

Speaker 10:         00:41:34       how over in England, you know, they, you know, I dunno, they make their, their actors, they, they award them by calling them lords and they night them. But over here in America, all we do is just give him the shiny statue and it's just like, starts off right off the bat for some reason, just shitting on America. I don't know why. Like an Oscar is somehow beneath sir, uh, Anthony Michael Hall. I mean, or, or Lord, what it Lord of what, what are what. At least you can fucking hold our statue, your lord of what kingdom, that phony horseshit that you have with Prince Charles in the popper or whatever the fuck is going on over there. You know, look up the Rothschilds night you over there, then that fucking means something. Then you can come become part of their yacht convoys. They go around the world figuring out how to take over another currency, right?

Speaker 10:         00:42:34       Then you're in with them. Okay. But if you're, if you're fucking, you know, Lord of this and your, your wing man is the Duke of Elton John. I mean, that's the whole thing is fucking stupid, right? So right off the bat, it's already bugging me. But I know Nia hates when I talk to the TV rights. So I, you know, I keep my big fucking Yap shut and they started talking about Meryl Streep [inaudible] gone through the whole thing and then I'm the old guy there smelling of uh, you know, prescription meds goes, uh, you know, whenever they talk about the roles you play, they always say, you know, you play independent minded women, very strong women. And Merrill goes, I know that's, yeah, that's what they say. You know, when a guy, they never say to a guy, oh, you're playing a strong willed character, Yadda Yadda Yadda.

Speaker 10:         00:43:16       I let that go, whatever, no Biggie, I'll take that. It's probably true. The fuck do I know I'm not a whole woman. Right. But then they show her after she played Margaret Thatcher and she's given a speech to a bunch of women's young girls. She's trying to inspire them and she, she takes a quote from Margaret Thatcher and it was something along the lines of, if you want a bunch of people to talk around, talk is staying around talking about doing something. You know, something, I go to Iga, you got to talk to men, but if you want it to actually get done, you gotta get a woman and then all the chicks go, whoo, like flipping out. Right? So I laughed and I'm like, Yay. Reverse sexism, right? Just seeing, you know, my, my whole fucking theory how everybody is just a piece of shit. You just don't have the power to act out what the fuck you want to do because that, that right there, if you flip that around as a guy, if you're running for president, it's fucking over.

Speaker 10:         00:44:16       He can't be like, let me tell you know, tell you what after I get you jobs and after I fix this economy, okay. And I'm the man to do it because I'll tell you right now, if you're looking for someone to stand around and talk about doing, you get a woman, you want to get done, you gotta get 'em man, here are my nuts right here on the podium. Volt from me. November 4th go fuck yourself. Right? You did that. Your presidential campaigns over. She does it. It's fucking adorable. And it's just as fucking ignorant. You know what I mean? What a fuck do you get off saying that we stand around and do nothing, Meryl Streep or quoting Margaret and you too, Margaret Thatcher.

Speaker 10:         00:44:58       Let me taste you bitches something. All right, we faked a fucking lunar landing. Okay? You think that's just talking. Anybody can land on the fucking moon. That's easy. But to pretend you did it all right and get everybody to shut the fuck up about it. That, that, that, that right there, that takes skill. So whatever. So I make that little comment and um, did I just go with it that, that, that, that are certainly fucking porky pig. So, so I make that comment and like, you know, I've been with Nia long enough that I can tell by the side of her face when she's just thinking about like, what if I just grabbed everything I really cared about and walked out of this house right now?

Speaker 10:         00:45:36       She got like that fucking mad at me, you know? And I'm like, she's just like, right after the story was over, she just shut the fucking thing off. And, uh, I only happen to excel. I'm walking to seven 11 and get some ice cream. I've not even, what happened was all going great. You know, I might be asshole there. What am I? Am I supposed to just fucking sit there with my mouth hanging open with drool coming out when I watch TV? If somebody says something Douchey, I'm not supposed to say it. Yeah. Whatever, whatever. So I just finally just said, you know what? Fuck this. I take the dog out. I go around the block. What do I do? I'm calling my guy friends, right? They're all backing me up. I'm not saying who I called, I don't name names. All right. And they're all laughing their ass off and they get 100% agree with me, which is all I'm looking for at this point. I just want people to say that I'm right. I don't want to learn anything from this experience. Just tell me I was right so I can be an ignorant ass again. I don't know. Why don't you guys weigh in on that? Am I a Dick for saying that? Should I just let that one go? You know? Oh, you know what she said? That fucking drove me up the wall. She goes, why are you, she didn't say intimidated.

Speaker 10:         00:46:55       She used one of those words. Why are you threatened by what she said? It's like I'm not threatened. I, yeah, Jesus Christ. Then I take the bait, you know, it just sends me right all day, like threatened about what? Oh my God. This person that I don't know who has never called me, nor will ever call me, who has no effect on my life. How do you get threatened by that? I'm just calling it for the bullshit. That is, cause you know what? This is what fucking drives me nuts. I can't stand when somebody tells me that this shit sandwich tastes worse than my shit sandwich. Okay, go fuck yourself. At what point am I supposed to have empathy as I'm sitting here eating the shit sandwich and you're telling me how much worse yours yours is. You know, at the end of the fucking day, you know what I mean?

Speaker 10:         00:47:43       Sure. Mine might be on a, you know, a better slice of bread, which I guess would make it taste a little bit better, but at the end of the fucking day, right? The end of the fucking day. All right, I'm going to end up in a FEMA camp with you. Okay? You think when the next fucking psycho comes along, I'm going to make the cut. What the fuck do I put? What do I bring to the world? Huh? Exactly. And be standing right next to you. So go fuck yourself and you just fucking woman. Every time she sneezes, they give her another goddamn award. She still pitching, still fucking bitching. You know it's, I remember when I did this Oscar nominated part out. Go Fuck yourself with your wigs. Don't think just, you know, that's what fucking pisses me off when I watched this shit. If you really want to know my perspective is from where I come from, I can't bitch about shit cause everyone's like, oh go fuck yourself. You hit the lottery. Right. But I gotta sit here and listen to you bitch. Even if you fucking killing it, even if you're killing it, you know, Yale School of drama and he's still doing the ball. Go Fuck yourself with your goddamn yachts. Alright, there you go. That, that felt good. It's probably ignorant.

Speaker 8:          00:49:20       [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         00:49:22       dental assistant billion. I recently, I recently watched a talk show appearance. You posted on your Twitter you mentioned. Yeah, I did the, uh, the Willie Hunter show.

Speaker 5:          00:49:34       MMM.

Speaker 10:         00:49:35       And I think that that's what I posted when that fucking twice that I'd like to choke to death with a garden hose sent me that tweet. Um, yeah, it was on the Willie Hunter show. And he said, you mentioned you were a dental assistant, um, for your father. Did you ever consider becoming a dentist? Did you ever, did your father ever have ambitions for you to become anything in particular? Um, no. My Dad, my parents were great. Like they, they wanted you to base it. They didn't force anything on you. It was like whatever you wanted to do.

Speaker 5:          00:50:10       MMM.

Speaker 10:         00:50:11       They supported it 100%. And I remember being working with my dad in the dental office when I told him that I was going to become a comedian. We were in like the break room and I remember I was sitting there like going like, how is guy going to take this when he has such a classic like stable job here? You know that I'm going to tell him that I'm going to fucking

Speaker 9:          00:50:40       basically make a living, try to make a living doing exactly what he's been yelling at me for for the last fucking 20 years of my life, which was fucking off and acting like an idiot and screwing around all the shit that you know, when he would give me Christ check up box in a town clown, what do you be giving me? Shit. Which I totally deserved because if you ever saw the grades I got in school, I mean they, they, they are, they are horrific, fucking horrific. The high water mark for me was like a c minus or a c like I was, it was brutal. I want you to head to go to summer school every fucking year of high school except my sophomore year because my math teacher hooked me up in my senior year. I should've gone. I just didn't give a fuck.

Speaker 9:          00:51:31       I was like, what's the point? You know what I mean? That's like, you got the ball with 10 seconds left in you. What are you going to do? You just fucking, you know, you're down by 30 dad. Just throw up a half court shot. Did it go in? Who gives a fuck? It doesn't matter. You know? Um, so no, I mean for half a second. You know what you know, and I did like, I like the, uh, I like the pouring up models when I was in a, when I was in the dental office, that was my favorite thing. I was in the back. I was isolated. I wasn't around anybody and it tapped into that little kid thing of playing in mud

Speaker 10:         00:52:07       and he used to pour up the models and they had this vibrating thing and you had to tap on it to make sure you have got all the bubbles out. And I prided myself on not being able, you know, I've, I've having it without no having no bubbles. If you got bubbles, if there was bubbles on the bottom, basically, you know when they stick that pink shit in your mouth, they got to take a, uh, an impression of your teeth. Then somebody's got to take that out of your mouth going in the back room and then you got it. You got to mix this powder with water up in the little green rubber bowls. Jesus, this is all coming back to me. And then you poured it into the fucking impression you took. And then there was this, this thing that sounded exactly like your cell phone vibrating on a table and you just, you just tapped it on that to get all the air bubbles out of it. And if you didn't do it enough after one of the things set and you took it out, um, if the bubbles were at the bottom, that's where the teeth were the most crucial thing, the exact fucking thing that trying to get a gauge on so they can, you know, whatever the hell they were trying to do, make a bridge or something. Um, the whole thing would be fucked. And then you couldn't go and just rapport the model into that same mold because somehow like it had shrunk up little bit and it wouldn't be

Speaker 9:          00:53:25       accurate. And my dad used to flip out.

Speaker 10:         00:53:30       He would, he would take them off, he'd be like, Christ, there's air bubbles and this, you know, and it was beyond your boss yelling at you. It was also my dad's. So I already had, you know, I was going through my fucking teenage and early twenties when you're rebelling the most against your fire. Already had the live with the guy. And then I was working with the most fucking hilarious and he used to give me shit. Bye. You know, like I was his kid.

Speaker 4:          00:53:59       Okay.

Speaker 10:         00:53:59       But we, we really have, we actually talked about how we had to tone that shit down because it didn't come off as professional in front of patients or whatever. But uh, but that was a part I thought if I ever got into dentistry that I would, I would, I would work in the lab.

Speaker 9:          00:54:15       I liked that part of it, like, um, and not just pouring up the models like the actual, I know there was a precision to it that I liked. I didn't like to fight. I didn't like the, uh, the front line shit going in the mouth with all that crap and looking at people's fucking horrific teeth, just horrible fucking teeth. All my jokes were about that shit when I first started. I told you guys that story, right? I used to work totally clean when I first started stand up. Um, and not because I want it to be this comedy purist. I just was afraid of offending somebody in the crowd, getting heckled, not having a comeback, losing my place in my act and then bombing horrifically. Yeah. And, and just having my career and total fear catastrophizing, like way of looking at it. And um, yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:55:07       Oh Jesus Christ, that really just fucking brought me back to, I was standing on stage at sticks, stitches. Fucking somebody heckled me was that the vault in Boston, somebody had called me and I completely lost my fucking train of thought and I had nothing and I didn't. And it took me like basically three seconds to, to, to re to remember what the fuck I was talking about. And um, it was the longest 30 seconds of my life and I didn't know enough to just say to the crowd like, what the fuck was I talking about? Cause they'll tell you, they'll remember. They're not nervous, they're listening. They, they're not having like this outer body experience. Um, but anyways, I remember people would come into the dental office in their teeth would just be just,

Speaker 4:          00:55:49       yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:55:49       just what an absolute fucking mess.

Speaker 10:         00:55:53       And they can tell you right now, I hate coming to the dentist. And it's like, yeah, dude, I can smell it. You don't have to smile. I can tell you don't like coming to a dentist. You only like fucking brushing your teeth. Well just one guy said this, one of the first jokes I did too. Oh that's right. So I will work totally fucking clean. And then my last at my, and you just, you know when I looked like a young Ron Howard, I look like Richie Cunningham and I was totally clean and I was clever and I had these perfect talk show monologue jokes and everyone was going like, oh dude, you're going to do the tonight or this is going

Speaker 9:          00:56:24       to be perfect for and blah blah blah blah blah. And then the last joke in my act, I quoted this patient who kept having to get fillings and root canals and he, and he said, doc, you know, I don't understand what's going on. I mean I brushed my teeth almost every day. And then my, my snappy comeback to that, that I thought of that later became the last joke on my act. I said, really deal. Wipe your ass almost every time you take a shit. And that's what I would close with after working totally clean. I would say that disgusting lie. Do you wipe your ass almost every time you take a shit? Having everybody in the crowd after looking at this fucking Norman Rockwell come to life fucking character wholesome is hell right.

Speaker 4:          00:57:11       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:57:11       And I really was back then as opposed to the piece of shit that I am now after 20 years on the road that I became. Um, and I literally, they had to conjure up pictures of somebody skipping, wiping their ass and just that whole, and they would just literally recoil. Then I would just be like, you know,

Speaker 11:         00:57:33       thanks a lot. Can I get everybody? You would great. And um,

Speaker 4:          00:57:38       yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:57:39       I had another horrible one that I did, um, where I actually brought a prop on stage and if you'd like to see that, I tell the story on the Willie Hunter show and a willys and up and coming comic at the comedy store. I've, and he's the go through the Hula Hoop, took the hula hoop from that girl in, fucking threw it into the the street. I tell that story too. If you want to see that shit, check out his show.

Speaker 8:          00:58:34       [inaudible] Hey, what's going on? It's built, Bro. This is the Monday morning

Speaker 11:         00:58:37       podcasts for Monday, October 26th, 2009. Holy Shit. Halloween's coming up. I haven't even bought a pumpkin yet. What the fuck is that all about? Um, hey, how come there's not pumpkin's the whole time of the year? All those things. Seasonal, you know, like tomatoes. Evidently tomatoes are seasonal. We just don't realize that, which is why they taste like shit 90% of the year or according to Jimmy Dore, they pick them before they're even ripe and they just paint them red. Um, is that true? I mean, how long would that take to sit there with that little fucking Crayola? It wouldn't, they taste like wax. What's the deal with Pumpkins?

Speaker 12:         00:59:23       You can get Pumpkin Pie, the whole euro, but you never see you.

Speaker 11:         00:59:28       Um, I've gone out of my fucking my people, my voice is killing me. Um, I have something to do here in fucking 40 minutes. So this is gonna be a quick podcast. And this time actually mean it because it's going to cost me money if I don't get off the phone here in 40 minutes. Uh, uh, where to start. Why don't we just start with what the hell's bugging me? Um, I almost got into a fistfight yesterday and, uh, I realized that I'm at the awful age of, it's basically any time there's going to be a fist fight, I have these two options. A I lose and get the shit kicked out of me, which really, you know, there's no end to, that shit kicked out of you. Could be, I got a black eye, I lost a twofer, you know, or it could be I'm in a coma and you know, the left side of my body doesn't work anymore. You know what I mean? You never know because you never know who you fucker went. Right. So that's option a and option B is I win and then I get the shit sued out of me.

Speaker 11:         01:00:33       Okay. I see. I'm so fucking still pissed about this. I'm, I have to give you the abbreviated version of this because it's, it's been eating me up inside. Um, I was waiting for my girlfriend to come out of this diner, this one of these places. There's only one way in and one way out. All right, so there's a parking lot, parking spot way down, which is actually closer to the fucking diner in this Douche bag is sitting there cause he sees my reverse lights on. So I'm way of an Adam to tell him to go by me so I can just back out of the fucking light. And he's just sitting there sitting there. He wouldn't do it. It's a fire, you know, pull out real fast. It's like a gravel parking lot, slam on the brakes, slide backwards and then fly forward. Slam on the brakes.

Speaker 11:         01:01:12       So he pulls in, obviously knows I'm pissed and I back up and I put the window down. I'm like, dude, there's a fucking spot right up there. And then he immediately goes, oh, you're so tough with your hybrid. And he really caught me off guard, man. He got me with a great money. Went with the hybrid. My Dick is bigger than yours because I'm, he's driving a fucking lime green four door sedan that he looked like he borrowed from his fucking ant, right? Oh, this guy, you just this, this fucking, you know what this guy looked like? Remember those coming of age movies in the 80s where there was the good looking chick, uh, that the nerd wanted and she was dating this impossible asshole. Like that blonde hair Douche from our back to school who gets all intimidated in the end and fix a leg injury after fucking a 90 year old Rodney Dangerfield does a triple, triple Lindy.

Speaker 11:         01:01:55       That's what this kid look like. All right? And he's gone fucking Blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, Hey, yeah, we'd get fucking tight shirt and your big nose. Go Fuck Yourself. And he's like a, and then he goes, yeah, I go back to Jersey. You piece of shit. That's what he said to me. Right? And I wanted to go like, dude, I'm not from New Jersey, but my girl jumped in and said something fucking, you know, that a civilian would say rather than a comedian. So I started losing the argument a little bit. So then he turns around and then I was just like, where you going? Where you go? And you know, like, like I was actually going to fight him because I was so fucking mad. I

Speaker 13:         01:02:30       okay.

Speaker 11:         01:02:30       But I in the back of my head, the whole fucking time, I'm thinking like, dude, what are you going to do? What? What you, what are you going to do to this guy? When was the last time you had a fight? You're fucking 41 you're a year older than Brett. Farve what are you going to do? It's not even on level ground. It's in a gravel fucking parking lot. You know what I mean? I knew I could've, I, I swear to God, I know I could have fucking killed this guy, but I, well, I can't do it. [inaudible] I already, you know what would've happened? I would've fucking started fighting him. Even if I started winning, his girlfriend would've jumped on my back. And then if you do any sort of, get off my back with the woman, I'm going to jail. You know? I just, it was this fucking stalemate. There was nothing I could fucking do. And then I'm driving home and all I'm thinking about is how much I want to fucking kill this guy. And it got to the point, I literally dropped my girl off and I drove back to the diner and his fucking car were still there. And I'm circling the diner in a hybrid

Speaker 9:          01:03:33       waiting for this guy to come out thinking about what I'm gonna do to him and then also reminding myself that I have not had a fight in about 20 fucking years. Okay. And then also reminded myself legally the ramifications for leaving and then fucking coming back. I am in no danger whatsoever and I am going to get the living shit sued out of me. So fortunately a friend of mine happened to call up and I started telling her the story and she was laughing her ass off and she told the story of solves some girl didn't hold the door, you know, it's one of those really heavy doors and sorta in its sort of slam back in her face. And she said, thank you. You know, sarcastically tour, and then the girl goes a one, I don't have to hold the door for you. Go Fuck Yourself. And how she just wanted to sticker timberland through the back of this fucking chicks.

Speaker 13:         01:04:22       Yeah,

Speaker 9:          01:04:22       back. I guess. Look at me. I'm so fucking mad. I can't even say simple anatomy, so

Speaker 9:          01:04:30       I just, I dunno. I was able to just kind of talk myself out of it and the real thing was I didn't want to go back and fight the guy. I really didn't, you know what I mean? I really didn't. I did, but I didn't. There was just no when it wasn't going to do, you know, I got meetings this week, I'm going to show up with a loose tooth and a fucking, you know, nobody bleeds like a red head. You know what I mean? I'm going to look like fucking ric flair walking in there. There was nothing I could do. I had to sit there and I think I actually lost the back and forth. Verbal thank you know, I'm so fucking shot from being on the road. I just got off a flight. I wanted to go straight home. I girls like I'm hungry, let's get Sunday, you know, and I made a mental note to be extra nice to my girl just because I've been an asshole lately, you know, which is probably why I got into the argument to begin with.

Speaker 9:          01:05:23       But it's, it was, it, I literally that desert desert fucking reservoir or a lake, whatever the fuck you call it, near where I live. This is how mad I was after my friend talked me out of not doing what I didn't even want to do to begin with. Right. Not to mention the, you already had another guy with him. I would've lost. I would've fucking lost. Right. So, um, I had to go drive to the lake, park my car and walk around the lake in the first 90% of the walk around it. I was fantasizing about all the different ways that I was going to murder this guy.

Speaker 9:          01:06:09       I had one where I was body slamming him onto his own fucking car, screaming some shit about hybrids. I completely like, I haven't been that mad in so fucking long. And, uh, it wasn't until the last 10%, you know, I was kind of going like, you know, you really took this walk to try to forget about this shit, so what is wrong with you? You need to calm down. So I started to fucking calm down and uh, then I saw my car again and reminded me I was driving a hybrid in a fucking piss me off again, be told it's been one thing if the guy was driving a corvette, you should have seen this car. It wasn't lime green. It was actually kind of a nice screen. Okay. If I can actually extend an olive branch to this fucking cunt. But I mean it was, it was a four door sedan.

Speaker 9:          01:06:55       You know, there was no excuse at his age, your name, he's like in his twenties there was no fucking excuse for him to be driving that car or certainly talking shit. Right. And also I love that whole go back to Jersey you piece of shit and like how he's the typical La Guy, you know, judging you, you know, you are what you drive out here. Cause I'm in a hybrid, therefore I don't know how to fight in what you hit. You know my car, my car runs a home for an odd guess. Fucking bring Bruce Lee odd, you know, he, what is he going to Rick Shaw, you know, so, so the last 10% I started talking myself down and just so happened there was an open house out here and there happens to be a zillion houses available out here because the state is bankrupt and we live in a city without a water supply and they still want $1 million for a house that is about the size of a decent one bedroom apartment. So a ants, hence there's a lot of open houses. So I actually said, I actually went into the open house and looked at it and was thinking the entire time that if I had gotten out of the car and thrown the first punch, even if I won the fight, whatever downpayment, I woulda had to actually get a fucking house, which is something I'd like to do at some point in my life that would have been out the fucking window.

Speaker 11:         01:08:14       And as much as it calmed me down today, it still hasn't made me feel any better. And, uh, this, this, this should be like some sort of gentleman's agreement of I'm not going to sue you in. My friends aren't going to jump in, maybe even go down to the gym. You just put the gloves on so he can just get it out of you. Because I got to admit it's still fucking in me. And Ah, I've been, ah, the, ah, this is how much of a contents made me and I'm trying to get, I'm trying to get rid of this, this, this little ball of hate that is in me. When I was, I looked at the one house, right? And I've, and I felt better and I'm like, I still need to look at another house because, you know, I'm gonna, I'm still in a bad mood.

Speaker 11:         01:09:00       And, um, I was driving up the street as I'm driving up the street. This white lady is like waving her hands, like telling me to stop. She, she's gives no uniform, no uniform on or nothing. So I kinda, you know, I'm, I'm deliberately driving pastor a little bit before I slowed down cause I'm a fucking control freak and I like people telling me what to do. So she comes up to my window and I go, what? And she's like, I'm a tree fell on the road around the corner. I just didn't want you to hit it. And I was just like, oh my God, I am the biggest asshole ever. I really am. You don't if I'm really going to be honest with myself, the whole fucking reason I had that fight with that guy is because I'm in a grumpy mood because the last seven out of last eight weeks I've been on the road.

Speaker 11:         01:09:42       All right there. All right. I admit my fucking part of it. Oh do you could have seen the weather go is just standing there. They're fucking shark fin of a noses. Hibbs coming out from those awful sunglasses. That's going to hurt me for another couple of days. But, um, thank God I am a little bit older and I actually know how my brain, I'll tell you, that's what I've been older is, is knowing how your brain works. Okay? Because the moment is gone. So now I'm gonna do is just walk around hate in this fucking guy. So what I have to do is every time I think that I just, I just fucking think of something else. Um, and I've been able to do it in my apartment, but when I get in my car, it's like a Vietnam fucking flashback. So I'm just going to give myself a week to get over it. And, uh, and that's it. All right, so there's a story for you that took a nice 12 minutes. My fucking voice is killing me.

Speaker 11:         01:10:36       You know, I actually bought a book on how to fucking use your voice properly on stage. I should really read it. I do drink that throat coat. Fucking a tea with honey. Now that's how old I am. Um, what I really should be doing is giving my voice arrest and shutting the fuck up rather than yelling about some dude who doesn't even matter in my fucking life. Ah. All right, let's get on with the podcast. So this is the Monday morning podcast. Everybody, if you're new to this, you're probably in some sort of a, I don't know what you would, what mindset you would be in this old ceiling fans

Speaker 11:         01:11:14       dry out my throat. That's what's going on. Um, is this something really intimidating about a ceiling fan? You ever not think that it's just going to come flying off the fucking ceiling and decapitate you? It's unreal how it just stays. There are pumpkin seasonal, I didn't even get back to that. I gotta get, I, you know, you know what happened last year is I carved up a couple of them but I carved them up too early and uh, they started to dry out and the thing that I, I had carved in there, this scary looking face and had carved like a whole silhouette in the, in the background, you know what I mean? It's like a carved out, like a big circle, three quarters of the way. And then on the bottom I carved the head into the bottom part of the circle. So then the candle was behind it and fucking lift this thing up and it was awesome.

Speaker 11:         01:12:01       But the weight of the, uh, the face, considering it wasn't connected to any other part of the Pumpkin, it started to fall into the hole. Is it dehydrated? And uh, it really wasn't scary come Halloween. It was just kind of sad. It looked like a defeated demon. Like he's looking up in the air like, God, what do I have to do to scare people? Um, yeah. So anyways, I just came back from the DC Improv, everybody and uh, I want to thank everybody in Washington DC and the surrounding area of Baltimore, Richmond, Richmond, Virginia, Georgetown, whatever the hell you came from West Virginia. I just want to thank all you guys for coming out. That was the greatest turnout I have ever had to any stand up a weekend I've ever had. I actually had to add a show people. I did a second show on a Thursday night and it's sold out. I did six sold out shows and, uh, three days. And, um, had the time of my life ate at this restaurant. Posh, got hooked up there by chef Chris is fucking dude brought us out all his food. Want to thank him.

Speaker 11:         01:13:11       Oh, it was a great time, dude. You know what else I did? I actually, we got a football to long fucking story. This is the Peter Pan Lifestyle. I'm living it, which really gives me no excuse to get mad at some guy in a green four door sedan in the parking lot of a goddamn diner. Right. I played football on a Friday afternoon around two in the afternoon. Like I was still in like the fifth grade, you know, that she's fifth grade, be more around four and it'd be blowing off my homework or whatever, you know, and uh, ended up spraining my finger cause uh, Paul Versey, the comedian who opened up for me. It was, we were so fucking hilarious. Like typical, you know, he's still a younger guy, but you know, I'm 41 so I'm stretching and doing all this shit and uh, we're sitting there lying to ourselves, but we could still play.

Speaker 11:         01:13:58       That was a great pair, dude. You hit me right in stride. Get me right in stride. He's getting all excited that he's hitting a 41 year old and stride, like the defensive back couldn't catch up in fucking run the thing back for six the other way. But uh, Nah man, I was psyched. I was really impressed with how fast I can still run and I'm gonna tell you why. It's because I've kept myself in shape and I stretch on a regular basis for all you guys out there. As you get older, you have a look at older guys and you like, you just look at him and you get to an age at some point where you can't fucking run anymore and it blows your mind when you're young. Like, why can't you run anymore? You just send them that brain signal to your legs to run and is to promise because it hurts.

Speaker 11:         01:14:47       I mean, look, this, this part of it is, yeah, you walked on your legs, your feet, and you use your body, the wear and tear 40 years. But I swear to God, it seems like 80% of it is not stretching. If you don't stretch, you get atrophy and your muscles shrivel up. And that's when you literally, somebody throws you a ball and it's a little out of your reach and you go to reach for it and all of a sudden you fucking your kidneys up by where your fucking shoulder blade is. It's a kidney attached attendance and a fucking knows. You know what I'm trying to say? I went from muscles and tendons to Oregon's, um, I'm telling you, uh, I, I have this power yoga tape that I've been doing forever and forever. My friends had been teasing me do, that's gay. What are you doing yoga for?

Speaker 11:         01:15:32       What are you trying to suck your own Dick? Eh, right. All those fucks continue to eat and they didn't stretch and I was never fast. I could always catch, he always had great hand eye coordination. I could fucking catch anything. I don't give a shit what it is. My thing is that there's just going to be somebody in front of me because I was never fast. So this is hilarious. I was never fast. Okay. But I kept myself in shape. And about seven or eight years ago when I was in my early thirties, I was playing pickup football and we've been playing for about 20 minutes. And for the first time in my life, somebody on the opposing team actually said, they said, hey, watch out for Berger. He's fast. And I almost burst out laughing because I was thinking of what a statement, what that was to the horrific shape that they were in because I was slow when I should have been fast.

Speaker 11:         01:16:23       I ran like a 30 year old when I was 17. So when I'm 33, I got to be running like I'm 45. Um, you know. So anyways, we had a great time and uh, I got to tell you, you know what I realized when I was throwing that football around, and this is one of the sad things about being an adult and getting responsibility and not being able to have a fight because you could get sued, is does a lot of other fun things that you just stopped doing. Like throwing a football dean, how much I love football and how much I loved it when I was a kid. And do you know how long it's been such I threw a football, I can't remember the last, I think the last time I threw a football was that day I was talking about when they said get berries fast, which was like 33.

Speaker 11:         01:17:05       Like, I honestly in the last eight years can not remember ever throwing a football. Do you know, fucking tragic that is, we will out there running post patterns. It's fucking, you know, cutting across the middle. I was having the time of my life until I sprained my finger. But even then it was all right. Just say it looks like when a Elton John's fingers ever see an Elton John Concert and he plays with those little fat little sausage fingers he has. He always talks about it. He doesn't have piano playing fingers cause he can't really reach that far. But he's still the shit cause he's so gifted. That's what I have. I have one Elton John Index finger or Mario Batali. Anybody Watch the food network and you watch when he, after he does the well method making the pasta, which is something I really want to fucking try, always want to try and make my own homemade pasta.

Speaker 11:         01:17:52       I really got into cooking for a minute. I used to watch that show Molto Mario everyday because he seemed like the real deal, you know? Not only did he understand that dish, he had been to the country where it bends it. You know, he'd been to Italy, hung around with the Italians and they taught them how to fucking make this stuff after they gave them a ton of shit for not knowing what he was doing. He can explain the part of Italy that it came from. It's just a tremendous show. And I liked that he does in his own kitchen. He just has like a couple of friends over, you know? And uh, I don't know, I just looked at it and like a comedy kind of way where he just seemed like a comedian who's really a comedian. Like they don't need props. They don't need a catch phrase. He's just standing there doing his shit. Right. As opposed to other shows where you got, you know, like, uh, I was going say, Emilio Estevez what the fuck's that guy's Amro Lugosi

Speaker 11:         01:18:44       you know, this is not about just how much I got into the food network. I could actually tell how much happier Emeril Lagasse was when he was doing essence of Emeril as opposed to being in front of the crowd. You know, who doesn't like working in front of a, of a live audience, but you could see the sadness in his face when the crowd just sits there and then he has to do all that extra shit. All of a sudden you got to turn it into like, you know, I've got some butter and everybody's like start screaming where I essence Amroy you can just sit down and cook the dish and not have to sit there throwing flour over his shoulder and sugar into the eyes of his drummer. He's got a fucking drummer on a goddamn cooking show. Um, so anyways, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker 11:         01:19:26       Like look, if you love football, you haven't played in a while. Stretch out and throw the ball around. I'm telling you, you got to do it. Do it before you fucking team plays on Sunday. That's one of those silent silent competitions I have with with other guys. You know, you're going to a sports bar and you just look at the horror that is a sports bar, a complete artist shape, fat fucks, the bloated alcohol and wings face that you see every time you turn around. You know, I always go, I'm going to have to, every time I go to a sports bar, like I always try to work out before I go there, you know, burn off, whatever the fuck I'm going to eat in there. Cause I don't want to look at like those people that are in there. So that's what I'm saying.

Speaker 11:         01:20:01       There's a fun way. If you hate the fucking gym, go get a God damn football dude. I felt like I was in fifth grade. Like when I was done, I was looking for my book bag. You know, it was ridiculous. Of course, two hours later, I did not feel like a fifth grader. I felt like I was 48, but it was fun nonetheless. All right, so let's get on with the podcast, uh, questions and whatnot. Hey, here's a great thing. If any, anybody else has like a, um, had a confrontation, like what I had. And for whatever reason, you didn't have the fight. And you know, it was funny when I was saying I was so mad and I say, I was telling Nia I have to go back there. When I was dropping her up, dropping her off, she goes, just go back and slash his tires, which really took me back to the whole revenge thing of how damaging somebody's car.

Speaker 11:         01:20:52       I literally said that too. I go, that's the bitch move. I could slash chuck Norris is tires. If he wasn't standing there and ruin his day, now go back and fight the guy or just fucking or, or don't go back and rip his antenna off like a fucking pussy fight or don't fight. Oh, take a walk around a lake and calm yourself down. It admit to yourself that you're 41 years old and you probably had a fucking 50 50 chance of losing the thing to begin with. Oh, and I would have been on the ground with that gravel embedded in the side of my face. You know, just taking a boat shoe to the head.

Speaker 11:         01:21:32       He didn't have on boat shoes. He wasn't that bad. All right. Okay. Here we go. Here's a podcast. All right? Last week I was telling you guys about how I have, I discovered the magic word when complaining, um, to corporations that the word is a unacceptable. All right? And just in case you guys feel that I don't know what I'm talking about, which is exactly what you should feel because I am a moron. Um, I got this great email from somebody who, who the fuck is it? God Damn it. I thought I had it. You know what? I am the worst. Why do you guys listen to this fucking podcast? No, no, no. I know. I put my hand right fucking here in front of me. All right. It's back on though. It's back on track. I actually got, I actually got a, an email from somebody who answers the phones for one of those big corporations.

Speaker 11:         01:22:21       All right? And if you want to learn how to do what I explained it last in last week's podcast, at least my story of how I went about, um, getting my money back. So, so this guy sends me this really nice. Larry says, uh, just want to say your podcasts are fucking hilarious. Keep them coming. Uh, you should do a show in Omaha sometime. Uh, that's a rough one, dude. Omaha's or rough one. I will at some point. All right. I just have to get psyched up for that. The 28 planes I'm going to have to take to get there. That's one of those like fucking states. You have to fly past it to fly into a hub city, you know, to finally get there. You know, I'm flying to Omaha via fucking Tampa. What? All right. Um, here we go, Bill. Um, also I wanted to say when dealing with corporations using the word, the unacceptable line does work.

Speaker 11:         01:23:13       I am a support agent for a well known financial company company. If someone is continually a pain in the ass about something and are persistent about it, eventually they will get their way. You guys hear that? I know it's morning. For some of you, you stir in your coffee. Did you hear that? If someone is continually a pain in the ass about something and are persistent about it, eventually they will get their way. Usually as a customer service representative, we are encouraged to try and steer the conversation away from the, from things like credits and try to offer other suggestions. And that's the part where you get mad because you're not getting what you want. But that's why you have to keep you cool. All right. So anyways, he says, uh, basically we try to bullshit them a little and try and put them at ease.

Speaker 11:         01:23:58       Yeah. Lie to them. Okay. But if a customer is still not happy, we will give a credit or whatever you want. As long as it's reasonable, that's fair. Um, just to get you off the phone. However, if you start using profanity, um, while on the phone call, chances are we will try and find ways not to help you or disconnect the call all together. Regardless of rules and procedures, representatives do have the ability to make judgment calls. Basically, if you call the customer service Rep Account, I will guarantee you they will not help you stick to using the unacceptable line. Don't give up and you eventually will get what you want. You see that people, there you go. Now you have the information you need from a professional rather than some moron comedian who almost got in a fight outside of a pancake house. Um, I actually want another one this week.

Speaker 11:         01:24:53       All right? I ordered the NHL package to center ice package and ask them, hey, now, so I says to the guy, I just sound like I was doing fucking Vaudeville. So I asked the guy, I says, hey buddy, what's with the chicken soup? Um, I asked, I asked, I asked the lady when I ordered it, does it come with the NHL Channel? And she says, hold on, let me check. And she says, why? Yes, yes it does. And I said, Dan, you know what? You got yourself a deal. I will take the center ice package with the NHL channel. So she says, okay, all right. So the boot, the fucking thing up. And the next day, Lo and behold, I don't have the NHL channel. So I call up and what do they say to me? They say, hey, hello sir, what can I do for you? And I tell them I deal.

Speaker 11:         01:25:41       And I said, oh, we actually, she in her notes, she left, she said that you hung up before the call was over. And I was like, no, I didn't. I immediately got pissed who are kind of fucked his phone call up a little bit. In the beginning I went the [inaudible] route, but I didn't say it, but then I, I got it back on track. I was like, no, I didn't. And you guys like, well, according to her notes you did. And I was like, well, according to my memory, uh, I was on the phone call and you weren't okay, so now what? I'm like, so now what? She gets to just say something happened, she writes it down to cover her ass, you know, and you know, so that's when I kinda got mad. But then I was able to bring it back and just say, look, the conversation ended with her going, thank you very much.

Speaker 11:         01:26:24       Is there anything else I can help you with? What do you think? I was halfway through ordering it and she was gone. Hang on a second sir. Hang on. I was like, too late. Goodbye. I didn't do that. All right. And the guy's like, well, I have to charge you $5 a month for this channel. This is, this is like the zero tolerance I have. I am arguing $5 a month, which is going to be 30 bucks over the course of the six month season. And I'm like, no, I'm not paying that. Okay. And the guy goes, why? I can't. I can't give it to you. I don't know what to do. I go, all right, well then cancel the center ice package. And the guy goes, I can't do that. I go, what do you mean you can't do that? And he goes, you can't cancel it once you order it.

Speaker 11:         01:27:00       I go, see you mean to tell me that I ordered something? It's in what you told me it was, it isn't and now I can't cancel it and you can't rectify the situation. Is that any way to buy a business, run a business? And the guy's like, whoa. I go, that's unacceptable. I want to talk to somebody else so I get this next guy on the phone. At this point, I finally calmed down and I was able to use that line, sir, I understand you. You know you don't make the rules. I know this wasn't your call, but this was the scenario. Okay, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. If he can't give me the channel for free, like I told him, you know that it came with the package, I would like to cancel center rice. The guy goes, well, I can't do either one of those, but this is what I can do. Your DVR costs you 10 bucks a month. How about I give you three free months, a DVR that'll be 30 bucks discount and the whole thing will be a wash. And I was like, you know what? You got yourself a deal. Bam. Two one I'll turn it. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:27:56       This franchise around a perennial losing franchise and just like the fucking saints, I am now a factor. I am now a fucking factor. So, and the last two weeks I got 25 buck dollars back and I got $30 back. I am plus 55. I'm like a Dj that the mush and a a Bronx tale and I'm finally winning. Um, plus fee. I say myself. 55 bucks. Do you know how many tube socks you can buy with 55 bucks? It's a lot of fucking socks. How great do your feet feel when you got a new pair of socks? You know I never whistled. The only time I ever whistle. Do you ever see me whistle and you know I've got a brand new pair of fucking dress socks at tube socks on your feet take tingle in that right Cleo? Huh? They tingle.

Speaker 11:         01:28:46       I was hoping she was going to make the noise. Let me see if I can get her mom this week. You guys haven't heard in a while?

Speaker 4:          01:28:51       Yeah,

Speaker 11:         01:28:54       she too busy sniffing the microphone. Um, anyways. All right, so let's get on with the fucking questions here because I got to start wrapping this up. I'm almost done here. Um, say, you know what? I feel great right now. I feel great. I told that fucking story about the guy at the diner. I got to laugh at it. I got to laugh at myself. I got to be honest that chances are he probably would have lost the fucking fight. You know? That's why I stand up is a great thing. It's a great fucking thing. You get to make a complete ass out of yourself. Fill like a Douche, and then laugh about it and then you feel better. All right. Somebody needs advice. All right. Hey Bill. Ah, I've got a couple questions and comments as stories above bar and went out with this girl last year before I went to the prom with her.

Speaker 11:         01:29:34       It wasn't really a date, but it was just a chance to go out with her and get to know, to get to know her before we went to prom. We ended up having a great time that evening in it and at the prom. I proceeded to Facebook her a bottle a week later and asked her if she wanted to go out again. She basically, she said she would like to go out again, but not in a romantic way. Bombbomb, Boehm boom. All right. Tonight he took that emotional kick in the chest. After hearing this, I backed off and didn't pursue her for a month or so. In this time she got a boyfriend, booboo Badu, which honestly pissed me the fuck off as well. It should have. Uh, I had to talk to her. Um, I had talked to her for about a week before she went out with this guy and when they finally were officially dating, I told her I didn't want to cause trouble and then I didn't want to bother.

Speaker 11:         01:30:25       She replied by saying that she, she said she didn't want to go out again with me is because she was confused about how I felt and seen when we first went out before prom that I wasn't interested. Isn't that funny? After she said, let's just go out and be friends, right. Didn't she? Did I already forget the first part of this? We saw each other maybe two or three times again through birthdays, graduation parties until I went off to college and she went back to high school. I am now a freshman in college and have and have made no friends on account of my horrific people skills. I feel like I should go after college girls, but I can't stop thinking about the high school girl and feel like she is light years ahead of these big titted shallow college girls. I also feel like she's the first girl that I ever felt comfortable hanging out with, although she seems like she would be a hard girl too, to woo as she is really intelligent and I am still am unsure if she likes me at all.

Speaker 11:         01:31:16       I was wondering what you think and if you have any tips on how to really impress girls besides the cliche confidence or expensive shit. All right, dude. You said something back here that really just rang a bell way saying we use two or three, two. I am okay. This sentence right here, dude. I am now a freshman in college and have made no friends on account of my horrific people skills. All right, dude, that's right there. That's the money right there. That's what you need to work on. All right. Through this girl, still in fucking high school. You're off at college. You know what I mean? You are college. You are in college. You're living at college. That is the ultimate fucking nightclub for the next four years. It's the greatest nightclub of all fucking time is living at college. There's just women everywhere. That Ron, every fucking floor, they're in every goddamn class.

Speaker 11:         01:32:05       You don't even have to, you know, you don't have to walk into a nightclub like, hey baby, what's you signed? Did somebody steal the lights out of this guy and put them in your eyes? Right? You don't have to come up with stupid shit like that. You have a, you know what I always find it's easy to pick up women when you're both, there's a reason that both of you are there. Like at the gym, you're both there to work out. You're on a train. You're both going home. You know, they don't have their guard up as much as when they go into the fucking Texas chainsaw massacre fucking meat locker. That is a Goddamn nightclub. All right? So this is what you need to do. All right. I think right now you're saying like you just said that all basically all college girls are big titted and shallow.

Speaker 11:         01:32:50       And I think a lot of it has to do with kind of your, your um, your, your hopeless feeling right now that you don't know how to talk to people and you don't know how to get things going. Okay? That's part of being a freshman is supposed to seem like a, a bigger universe than you can handle. But what you need to do is you need to work on your horrific people skills, all right? And it is a skill that you can work on, all right? Just like catching a football. I'm never going to be able to catch a football like Jerry Rice, but if I fucking do it enough times, I can catch the fucking thing, right? Maybe imitate somebody who's end zone dance, but you're going to get in the game. So what you need to do is understand that you kind of putting that girl up on a pedestal, you don't really know her.

Speaker 11:         01:33:32       And I think the, the, the comfort of kind of already having your foot in the door, I bet you are a lot more comfortable. I bet you were real comfortable with the fact that you just kind of being friends and the pressure was, was, was kind of taken off the whole prom and that type of thing. You're, you're, you know, you're shy, so you take like baby steps, you know what I mean? Instead of taking the big step and trying to grab her titty on the first date. I'm joking, but you know what I mean? So this is what I would do if I was you. Seriously, I'm kind of fucking around here, but I know this is like a, a serious subject for you. So this is all seriousness. Just what you gotta do is just you gotta you gotta Force yourself out of your shell, you know, I mean, if you say hello to a girl, she's not going to punch you in the face or whatever.

Speaker 11:         01:34:15       Just really write down on a piece of paper, what's, what the, the humiliation or whatever, the fear you have, what you think's going to happen. I'm telling you, a lot of times when you do that and you actually read it, you realize how ridiculous it is and um, I'm telling you, you, they're never going to be better looking than when they're in college. All you guys, you're at your, you fucking, you write off your right after the assembly line in Detroit, dude, fuck that college girl. I mean, whatever, God bless, I'm sure she's a nice person, but you got to get in the game and you've got to start a crushing ass as they say in fucking old school. That's what you should be doing there. And, uh, you know, go out with as many girls as you can see what you like and mentally becoming up with the list as far as what's the kind of girl you eventually want to stay with.

Speaker 11:         01:35:02       And in the meantime, you bang a couple of big titted shallow girls. You always wear a condom. Unacceptable not to wear one dude had a fucking worth it. And uh, you know, then you got your stories, then you got your fucking stories and when you get married, you know, and he'd go down to the Dunkin donuts and you want to bang the girl behind the counter, you know, the temptation won't be as great because you're fucked. All those big titted whores at college. All right, so psych yourself up, dude. Even tell even like, you know, if you've got some friends there at school, just be open a bottle of God. And I got it. I got no game with girls. Just say it, get it out there. I got no game with girls. Come on, help me out. You know, be a wing man, do something.

Speaker 11:         01:35:46       I got to get fucking laid. Just get it out there. I'll tell you as much as cock block and assholes as guys can be, when someone's open and honest about like that. If I have some guy ever said that to me, there's no fucking way I wouldn't try to help him out. So you'll be all right. Plus it's your first semester, so you're, you're, you're making everything bigger than it is. All right, so there you go. Let's your missing get out of your shell and forget about that girl. Okay. And then, you know what, after this, you know, your first two semesters you're going to come home with a little bit of swagger. You might be able to bang that broad are back, uh, when she's done with her little fucking pottery class. You never know. Might come all full circle. All right, I only got time for a couple more questions then I got to get going here.

Speaker 11:         01:36:24       Um, Oh, before I get going, why don't I just do this? I'll save the questions till next week or maybe I'll read a couple of quick ones. Uh, just to let you know, these are my upcoming gigs for November. Um, November 6th, six [inaudible] 2009. I'm going to be a town hall in New York City. People tickets are going fast. All right.

There's another one where he tells this guy that this fucking dude that his shoes are worth more than his house. Um, and then there's a great interview, you know, where he talks about the movie, the wrestler, and he just seems like the greatest guy ever. Like, you know, his wrestling career is over.
