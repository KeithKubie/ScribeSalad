JOHN: Thank you
guys for joining us.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.410
My name is John [INAUDIBLE],
I'm from the YouTube team.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.940
I'm so excited to be joined
by Alan Masarek who's

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.710
the CEO and co-founder
of Quick Office, which

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.690
got a nice little shout
out today at the keynote.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.937
And we're here to talk about and
answer one question, but really

00:00:16.937 --> 00:00:18.270
just dive into the nitty gritty.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.960
And that is after you've
designed and developed

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.830
a product how do
you distribute it?

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.320
How do you get it out there?

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.330
And hopefully we can
share Alan's journey

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.150
but also help
provide some insights

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.290
in getting your products
and apps out there

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.902
when the time comes.

00:00:31.902 --> 00:00:33.110
So Alan, so good to have you.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.690
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.250
ALAN MASAREK: Thanks for having
me, John, I appreciate it.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.833
JOHN: Awesome.

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:38.270
So why don't you tell us a
little bit about Quick Office.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.770
I know it's definitely
saved me when

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.880
I've been on the road
trying to change an app,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.520
trying to get in on a
last minute deadline.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.020
So you've definitely
helped me there

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.590
but talk about how your
product has helped thousands

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.720
upon millions of
people every day.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.040
ALAN MASAREK: OK, so the
company we pittered a bit from

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.490
our initial founding back in
'02 but by '05 we had settled

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.669
on sort of this
mobile office play.

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:03.710
And for those of you
unfamiliar with the product,

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.490
Quick Office was
architected to be

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.610
compatible with Microsoft
Office but on mobile.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.910
And what that meant is that
if you had a Word, PowerPoint,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.280
or Excel file, and ultimately
in 2003, 2007, 2010 formats,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.160
you could open it into the
Quick Office data model.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.910
We had full editing features and
you could round trip it back.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.780
And when you opened it, you
could render it faithfully

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.260
so that the paragraphs looked
the way they were supposed

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.530
to, the PowerPoint looked
the way it was supposed to,

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.560
et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.500
The market
opportunity for us was

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.620
that Microsoft had
restricted Office

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.610
in mobile just to
the Windows platform.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.720
And so we started way back in
'05 in the Symbian platform.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.420
And back then, we
all forget today,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.050
it had 80% of the
world's smartphones.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.040
And then obviously
it lost its share

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.920
relative to iOS and Android.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.634
But we ported iOS and Android
from Symbian back in the day.

00:01:58.634 --> 00:02:00.050
So as John was
saying, and you got

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.290
to start with a
really good product.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.440
You got to design it and
you got to develop it,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.370
but that's only half the battle.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.960
So at the end of the
day, distribution

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.950
is what set Quick Office apart
and where we really won from.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.860
We ultimately shipped
on a pre-loaded basis

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.300
with the handset manufacturer
on 500 million units,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.430
starting back in
the Symbian days.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.620
So where we sole sourced
Nokia and all of Symbian,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.380
but Symbian was largely
Nokia, we later had about 2/3

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.450
of all Android
volume because we had

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.270
direct relationships with
Samsung, and HTC, and Motorola,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.910
and Amazon, and the Kindle Fire,
and Barnes Noble and the Nook,

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.910
et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.510
In every instance we always
shipped our product branded.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.860
So it was always
branded Quick Office.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.090
And so while we never had an
embed relationship with Apple,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.800
our brand was
extremely well known

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.570
and people needed Office
support in mobile.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.800
And so we did
extraordinarily well

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.066
in Apple, initially
on the iPhone

00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:02.190
and then later on the iPad.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.280
I mean as the smartphone
market was growing and growing,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.350
we were doing very well.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.610
But then enter the
tablet and now you

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.332
had a canvas, which
was large enough

00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:13.290
where you're going to do
real work while mobile

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.530
and we just took off.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.900
So that's kind of the story.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.390
And I can share with you other
things on the distribution,

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.866
but really a key
attribute for us

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.115
was getting in people's hands.

00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:22.900
JOHN: Absolutely.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.257
And I think it's
so interesting, you

00:03:24.257 --> 00:03:26.140
mentioned multiple
different platforms there.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.615
Nokia, the Apple store, Android.

00:03:28.615 --> 00:03:31.445
And I think the amazing thing
about the Quick Office story

00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:34.030
is that you've survived
for so many-- I mean even

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.670
PalmPilot back in and day.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.870
You've been around for so many
ebbs and flows in the industry

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.360
as we've moved from mobile
phones to smartphones.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.080
And so what's been
the key of continuing

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.055
to put the Quick Office
brand and product out there

00:03:47.055 --> 00:03:50.490
though the platform has
shifted so many times?

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.530
ALAN MASAREK: I think that if
I was to advise entrepreneurs

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.070
it's when our
companies are small,

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.260
you've got to kind
of hitch your wagon

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.050
to people that
kicked a-- I always

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.240
like to refer to them as
big brother partners who

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.470
care whether you live
or die as a business.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.330
And so in the earliest days,
we cut a deal with Nokia.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.550
And quite frankly some of
this was a bit of luck,

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.959
we had started in Palm but
then produced a Symbian version

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:19.860
in the early days.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.730
We happened to be
headquartered in Dallas

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.960
and Nokia's US headquarters
were in Dallas.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.020
We created some
relationships there

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.560
and cut this deal where we built

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.290
Quick Office into the
Symbian stack itself.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.970
So if you built
a Symbian device,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.900
we came with automatically.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.330
What was really important
is that what we forget,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.680
back then there was
no frictionless path

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.610
to get to the customer
like there is today

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.160
with the iTunes
store or with Play.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.370
Back then there were
hundreds and hundreds

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.040
of little small app companies
but there was really

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.440
no good aggregation in
order to build a brand

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.280
or build name recognition for
a globally distributed product.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.840
So while the smartphone
market is far larger today

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.600
than it was in
2005, it was still

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.010
a big globally distributed
market back then.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.890
So the deal we cut
with-- and so it

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.057
shipped into the four
corners of the globe.

00:05:14.057 --> 00:05:16.390
We're a little company, we
don't have a marketing budget

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.020
in order to build awareness
all over in multiple languages.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.570
So we built in-- they
were actually languages.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.980
They required us to
localize in 55 languages

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.740
because they shipped
throughout the world.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.323
And we cut a kind
of a sweetheart deal

00:05:28.323 --> 00:05:30.500
with Nokia where we
gave them the viewer--

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.750
you know ours is a viewer
and an editor-- we gave them

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.880
the viewer for a
really cheap price.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.030
But the quid pro
quo of that deal

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.270
was that we could
serve up our editor

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.770
to the device
anywhere in the world.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.210
So all of a sudden
we had sort of

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.190
solved this
distribution conundrum

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.760
which had tripped up all
these other mobile companies.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.067
No one had scale.

00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:52.650
Back then there were hundreds
of little tiny mobile companies.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.550
And we're back
there again-- there

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.070
are hundreds of little tiny
mobile companies, or thousands.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.450
But there are hundreds of
little tiny mobile companies,

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.700
there was like nobody with
more than a million dollars

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.410
in revenue because
you couldn't scale.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.250
There was no way to
get distribution.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.581
So that embed deal changed that.

00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:10.080
And actually we were able to
go finance on the back of that.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.196
Sorry for the long winded
answer but we went to Mayfield

00:06:13.196 --> 00:06:15.070
and when we did our
first institutional round

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.185
in the spring of '05, it's
Mayfield's tier one firm

00:06:18.185 --> 00:06:23.730
and the bet was there were
tens and tens of millions

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:29.170
of smartphones out there,
if we could get 1% of them,

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.480
of the user, to
upgrade to the editor,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.230
we were going to build
a big revenue base.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.630
So that was the bet.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.200
And we scaled with
Symbian, but Symbian just

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.880
had its challenges,
it ultimately

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.790
was more or less replaced.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.530
But then we realized
that quickly we

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.840
better jump on the iOS train
and jump on the Android train.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.300
And we did hard.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.340
And which again had its own
complications and costs to it,

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.910
because for Android we
had to rebuild in effect,

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.225
because it was a Java code
base versus a C++ code base.

00:06:58.225 --> 00:07:01.750
But then we replicated the
exact same distribution model

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.540
and cut the same type
of distribution deals

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.900
with the manufacturers.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.020
Made a big difference.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.090
And you know, when
you're embedded--

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.100
and I go back to this
notion about big brother

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.280
partnerships-- they've got
to ship that smartphone

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.220
with Office support.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.220
What do you do when you
get an email attachment?

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.010
You got to have Office support.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.990
So they cared whether
we lived or died.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.420
So it made a big help
for us as we scaled.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.810
So that's kind of an overview.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:27.210
JOHN: That's awesome.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.900
So, Alan, take me through the
details of the negotiation.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.140
You talk about these
big brother partners

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.280
but when you're sitting
across the table from them

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.960
and they're like
no, Alan, we think

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.680
we want to re-brand Quick Office
to be more of our platform,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.180
Play.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.390
No, we don't like
that rev share,

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.639
we think you should take less.

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:44.680
We have more of a
distribution network.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.520
How do you fight against that
when you're just a startup

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.420
beginning and how do you
push back and get the deals

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.502
that you did to put you in
the place to make the exit?

00:07:53.502 --> 00:07:55.710
ALAN MASAREK: That question
is a really important one

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.700
because when we're early in
our company's development,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.190
there's all these moments
of truth that start early.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.660
Ours was initially with Nokia.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.670
Nokia was like we're not
branding this Quick Office.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.810
We don't know who the
hell Quick Office is.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.130
And we fought back.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:15.500
And what's kind of ironic,
the way we ultimately

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.940
convinced them to
brand it Quick Office

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.870
was to protect their downside.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.840
Basically if our application
wasn't very good,

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.390
people would be their
customer would be blaming us

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.700
as the app company
as opposed to them

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.960
as the device manufacturer.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.900
And once we were branded there,
and again that was a big push

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.190
back, but we really
fought hard to make sure

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.659
that we were branded
Quick Office.

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.750
Once you get the first
big one-- and Nokia was

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.800
the 900-pound gorilla
back in the day-- then

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.960
with each successive deal--
like the Android deal was HTC.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.550
HTC did not have a
lot of market power

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.970
when they were doing the
very first Android phone.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.030
They did the G1 for Google and
then did their own devices.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.270
So this is a very
nascent market,

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.800
it was an easier discussion in
order to get our brand there.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.590
And then you build
momentum and then

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.749
the brand is actually
a high quality

00:09:07.749 --> 00:09:09.290
and they want the
brand on the device

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.180
because then it conveys
high quality for the phone.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.670
The other side in terms of
partnering to your question,

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:21.690
with the handset
manufacturer is when

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.800
we would preload the
viewer, we want the end user

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.749
to upload-- from the end user's
perspective, it's a freemium.

00:09:30.749 --> 00:09:33.040
We're trying to get them to
download the premium, which

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.290
is generally the editor.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.360
How we can get the big
brother partner, the OEM,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.870
to partner with us was
really, really important.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:47.920
Because if you could
get the UI kind

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.910
of a warm and welcome, warm
and welcoming sort of the UI

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:56.100
so that it prompted somebody
to want to buy the editor,

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.310
our conversion rates
were much, much higher.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.910
And so we cut deals
with all these guys

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.680
where we would give them
a percentage of the upside

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.400
of that editor upgrade
in exchange for letting

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.680
us do things like
point of need updating.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.845
Meaning when someone
tried to edit

00:10:15.845 --> 00:10:17.845
and they only had a viewer,
it would prompt them

00:10:17.845 --> 00:10:20.170
and say you don't
have those rights,

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.780
here's the purchase
mechanism to get them.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.120
Those little things made a
huge amount of difference

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.220
for us to continue
to sell the editors.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.700
Ultimately from a
distribution point of view,

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:36.390
we did not want to be an OEM
software company because the VC

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.260
community, no one values an
OEM software company very high

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.700
because you're always
going to get pressure

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.265
on pricing over time.

00:10:43.265 --> 00:10:44.790
And we got some of
that, although it

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.206
was pretty sticky
on the way down.

00:10:46.206 --> 00:10:48.980
We wanted to build
relationships with the end user.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.000
And so over time you're
seeding the market.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.730
And our revenues in OEM were
much higher than our revenues

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.640
with the end user.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.450
But then the end user
far outshipped the OEM.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.230
So it's like planning
that Trojan horse made

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.950
a huge difference.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.530
And so by the time
we sold in 2012,

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.950
our end user revenues were
double our OEM revenues,

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.790
and growing much more quickly.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.766
JOHN: Alan, is there
an example of an OEM

00:11:12.766 --> 00:11:14.390
that you were really
excited to partner

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.056
with to expand your
distribution network

00:11:16.056 --> 00:11:18.270
who maybe it didn't
go so well, maybe

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.230
there was a glitch
in the negotiation.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.780
Is there a story
you could share?

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:26.086
ALAN MASAREK: Well, I guess
one quick story and that is HP.

00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:30.540
You know, when Palm
was still independent,

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.460
Palm had their old
operating system

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.750
and then they
developed the WebOS.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:39.263
And they released some
of their own products.

00:11:39.263 --> 00:11:41.471
This is back in the time
when Motorola was coming out

00:11:41.471 --> 00:11:43.992
with the early Android
products and Palm just

00:11:43.992 --> 00:11:44.825
didn't get traction.

00:11:44.825 --> 00:11:45.880
It's sort of interesting.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.510
It came down to literally
Verizon putting more marketing

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.190
dollars behind
Moto's Droid program

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.240
than Palm's program on WebOS.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.730
So they had to sell
and they sold to HP.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.490
So we cut a phenomenal
deal with HP

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.700
we thought because we were
like believers in WebOS.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.520
And for those of you who have
been around just three, four

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.985
years, HP put a ton of dough
behind it, huge release,

00:12:10.985 --> 00:12:13.360
this thing's going to be the
greatest thing in the world.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.580
It's going to displace iOS.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.990
And six weeks into launch they
killed the entire program.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.810
So we contractually
protect ourselves

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.820
but so we didn't get
too hurt money wise,

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.040
but it was a problem.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.795
You made a wrong bet.

00:12:28.795 --> 00:12:31.920
We bet on the OS
that didn't survive.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.180
And we made a lot of smart bets.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.720
And I always say you just
try to bet or bat-- excuse

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.135
me-- bat, B-A-T, with
a high batting average.

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:42.510
You're not going
to win them all.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:42.990
JOHN: That's right.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.620
That's right.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:48.110
So Alan, you've had so much
experience distributing,

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:51.257
like had your ups and downs,
more ups obviously than downs,

00:12:51.257 --> 00:12:53.090
but is there something
that you see nowadays

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.360
that really frustrates you when
you see a great product that's

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.970
just sitting on the
shelves, that you

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.940
think young entrepreneurs and
product developers should think

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.920
about in trying to
get their product out?

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:10.260
ALAN MASAREK: Yeah, I think that
there's a tightrope we always

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.420
have to walk as
underfunded entrepreneurs

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.180
and that's between building our
community, building our user

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.302
base, and revenue.

00:13:18.302 --> 00:13:24.694
And frequently there's
sort of this bias

00:13:24.694 --> 00:13:26.360
that we got to generate
revenue in order

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.760
to get interest
from the investor

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.430
community but that
sort of cuts both ways.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:35.910
And so it's how you go
through and build distribution

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.970
in as obstacle free
a way as you can.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:43.280
Because those first couple
million dollars of revenue

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.590
are going to look awfully thin
if they don't scale really

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.050
quickly, versus if you've
got 20 million users.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.440
And so the challenge
all the time

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.535
is how you can be as
obstacle free as possible

00:13:56.535 --> 00:13:57.910
in order to build
that community.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.535
I mean you see it in
the social web all

00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:01.830
the time in social networks.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.590
More business oriented apps
that we were-- prosumer

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.640
focused apps, a
little different.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.640
I mean I used to think
back all the time

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.170
when we were developing
some new products about

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:15.054
if we could give the editor
for free we would kill it.

00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:16.470
But I couldn't
figure out where we

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.490
were going to monetize
in the back end.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.414
And I still sometimes
think back about that

00:14:21.414 --> 00:14:23.080
and maybe we should
have done the editor

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.550
for free and just kind of
thrown caution to the wind

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:29.240
because we would've had
mammoth penetration.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.840
Because Microsoft basically
left this market open for us.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.150
There was one example back
when the Kindle Fire came out,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.680
they paid us a one
day-- you know,

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.580
it wasn't that much money--
a one day free sale.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.390
All you can eat.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.950
On Kindle Fire there were I
think 4 or 5 million units

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.630
outstanding at the time.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:53.240
Our app that one day was
downloaded 325,000 items.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.110
And we made peanuts
on a per unit basis.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:59.620
But it helped us in a
whole bunch of other ways.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:04.270
But free and things like
that really move the needle.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.990
We played it all sorts
of alphabet-- you know,

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:11.150
A, B testing on pricing and
ours was a very high price app.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.940
But even if you took
it down to $0.99,

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.700
the difference
between $0.99 and free

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.894
was still stunningly different.

00:15:17.894 --> 00:15:20.310
JOHN: Alan, it seems like you
champion the freemium model.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.400
You talk a lot about
the viewer, the editor,

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.470
and talking about
up-selling the user.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.300
Do you feel like the
freemium model has its place

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.390
in terms of business
and productivity apps?

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.100
Or do you feel you
feel like it should

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.530
be applied with social apps.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.720
This big movement that's coming
out is capture the eyeballs

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.690
and monetize later.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.580
Do you feel more apps
nowadays in trying

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.480
to get their product out there
should be freemium model,

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.390
or what are your
thoughts around that?

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:42.220
ALAN MASAREK: You
know, that's funny.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.130
I'm almost embarrassed
to say that I'm

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.671
a big believer in
the freemium model.

00:15:45.671 --> 00:15:48.460
And the reason I say that is,
you guys are younger than me

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.170
probably for the most part, but
back 14 years ago in the bubble

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.160
when Jeff Bezos was on the
cover of "Time Magazine,"

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.920
it was like revenue
no longer matters,

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.440
it's basically eyeballs.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.202
And that seemed like
heresy at the time

00:16:02.202 --> 00:16:04.410
but you really were getting
rewarded for the eyeballs

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:05.110
not the revenue.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.320
And I'm basically,
unfortunately,

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.860
are inherently saying
the same thing again.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:17.870
Again, the other day we had a
good revenue base as a company,

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.299
but you got to get to that.

00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:22.090
You have to have a
revenue base ultimately.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:26.480
But you've got to
build momentum.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.640
And so clearly it's used
in the consumer side

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.900
but I've seen the freemium
to premium model used,

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.460
I think, more smartly of late.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.660
I mean back just a couple
years ago sometimes

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.650
you'd see people that they'd
give a crippled version

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.490
of their thing, a crippled
version out for free.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.070
And that never made most sense.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.570
And what I mean by
crippled version,

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.700
if you had sort of 10
pieces of functionality,

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.840
you'd only turn on six.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.262
And it made very little sense
to me to give somebody only six

00:16:55.262 --> 00:16:57.220
of ten, basically give
them a rotten experience

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.480
and ask them to pay to
get a good experience.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.480
That never works.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.470
So today you see increasingly
people give the full 10,

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.630
they just limit the number
of times you can use it.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.359
But you want people to
experience your app fully

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:14.255
and love it, be delighted by
it, and then they'll pay for it.

00:17:14.255 --> 00:17:16.380
But obviously there's all
sorts of different models

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.274
how to skin that cat.

00:17:17.274 --> 00:17:17.940
JOHN: Of course.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.420
So before we open it up to
questions from the audience,

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.946
I just want to ask is there
any other piece of advice,

00:17:22.946 --> 00:17:24.820
any negative insight
from all your experience

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:28.302
that you would just offer to
somebody who is building an app

00:17:28.302 --> 00:17:30.510
and just trying to get it
out there, like approaching

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.675
partners and trying to
reach the end consumer.

00:17:33.675 --> 00:17:35.710
What would You tell
them from all your years

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.877
of experience that
could help out?

00:17:37.877 --> 00:17:39.460
ALAN MASAREK: I guess
a couple things,

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.973
quick things come to mind.

00:17:40.973 --> 00:17:42.824
This whole thing on financing.

00:17:42.824 --> 00:17:44.240
I'd rather be
looking at the money

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.935
than looking for the money.

00:17:46.935 --> 00:17:48.560
You're going to burn
through more money

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.850
than you think you are.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:50.600
Every time.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.130
Every time.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.280
The other side is,
I was referring

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.600
to this on those big
brother partnerships,

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.090
that first deal
frequently is going

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.730
to look pretty grim from
the financial terms.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.470
You'd be very
fortunate if it didn't.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.760
And I remember in
that Nokia deal,

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.565
they put a liquidated
damages clause in there,

00:18:12.565 --> 00:18:14.940
because they gave us source
code because we were actually

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.680
putting it into the stack.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.910
If there was an unauthorized
release of source code,

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.040
I think it was a liquidated
damage of 5 million Euros.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.514
It was basically just
the death penalty for us.

00:18:26.514 --> 00:18:28.930
And we looked at it and we
couldn't get them to change it.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:32.020
And [INAUDIBLE]
said, we just said

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.220
we go to do it because
we needed that deal.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.936
And the thing, it would
have been mutually assured

00:18:36.936 --> 00:18:38.560
destruction ultimately
for them as well

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.660
because they needed our stuff
once we were embedded in there.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.920
So there is a tendency to
fight for legitimate terms

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.350
in the first deal, but
you need that first deal.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.440
So sometimes, again, this is
part of this whole velocity

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.490
notion, is dealing with
some grim terms early

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.510
to win the things that
are important late,

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.810
like your brand, I
think in hindsight

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.749
were the correct decisions.

00:19:02.749 --> 00:19:05.290
JOHN: So with that we're going
to open it up to the audience.

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:08.470
We have a microphone in back
and we'll pass it around

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.160
to anybody who has questions.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.148
Raise your hand.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.460
This other guy's got
a ton of questions.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.819
AUDIENCE: You sold in 2012.

00:19:17.819 --> 00:19:18.610
ALAN MASAREK: Yeah.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:25.550
AUDIENCE: So first question
is, why did Microsoft

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.960
choose to be able
to set this model up

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.942
where they weren't in the
game doing it themselves?

00:19:31.942 --> 00:19:33.400
And the other
question is, when you

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.030
sold what was the
reason for selling?

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.184
I mean, what's next and
why do sell now versus?

00:19:38.184 --> 00:19:38.975
ALAN MASAREK: Yeah.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.004
So the first part.

00:19:44.004 --> 00:19:45.670
Why didn't Microsoft
do this themselves?

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.040
When it was just a phone
space the principal use case

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.210
was a viewer.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.625
There was very
little editing done

00:19:56.625 --> 00:20:01.340
on a smartphone in the early
years of smartphone world.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.580
So it probably wasn't worth
Microsoft's time to do it

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.932
because in order for them-- to
move the needle at Microsoft

00:20:09.932 --> 00:20:13.410
you need hundreds of million
dollars of revenue and such.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:17.070
So staying away from
the market made sense.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.970
Now, when Microsoft had
90% of the given computing

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.040
environment, when you'd
only think about it the PC

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.150
perspective, they still had that
almost monopolistic position.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.130
Now when you sort of
factor in phone and tablet

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:35.907
and now their share falls
to like less than 25%,

00:20:35.907 --> 00:20:37.740
it's critical for them
to go cross platform.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.630
So they had this sort of
schizophrenic challenge

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.110
where are they a platform
company with Windows

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.070
or are they a software
company with Office

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.410
and other applications?

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.190
If you're a software
company, you've

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:50.950
got to go cross platform.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.480
But that ongoing
fight inside Microsoft

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.880
tended to reside with
Windows for years,

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.920
up until Satya just
became the new CEO.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.280
And he said we've got to go
to where our customers are.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.840
They sort of held-- when they
came out with Surface they held

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.160
back yet again
thinking it would,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.120
leaving client Office on the
Surface would help Surface

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.400
relative to the iPad,
and it really didn't.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.660
So they had a lot
of decisions to make

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:22.370
that created an opportunity
for companies like ours.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.740
Second question
about why we sold,

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.950
we had already had commercial
relationships with Google.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:34.140
We had done one in 2010,
another one in 2011.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.560
They've come to us
about buying us.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.830
It was very compelling, a
lot of things, financially,

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.782
and all those sorts of things.

00:21:40.782 --> 00:21:43.460
But I hesitated because I was
having a heck of a lot of fun.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.370
Things were really working well.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.940
And we had excellent revenue
base, about 300 people.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.830
We were really kicking it.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.030
And I'm always
proud to say in 2011

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.630
82% of the days of the
year, 82% of the days

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:00.450
in the year we were a top
10 highest grossing app

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:04.280
in all categories in iPad.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.800
So we were really doing well
and I was having a lot of fun.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.890
But ultimately I couldn't
bound the Microsoft risk.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.750
People used to come up to me and
say Alan, you're Quick Office,

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.390
you're Microsoft
Office on an iPad.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.770
And I used to say well,
we're more than that.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.260
But my worry was what happens
when Microsoft Office came

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.640
to the iPad, which it did.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.920
So Google's been a
perfect partner for us

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.250
because now we're
built into Chrome,

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.870
both on the OS and
the browser side.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:29.880
We're built in
Android with KitKat.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.430
And you just saw the release,
they were built into Docs.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.470
So it's been a perfect match.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:38.823
JOHN: Awesome.

00:22:41.963 --> 00:22:42.921
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Alan.

00:22:42.921 --> 00:22:45.760
I had a question on a
quote that you said.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.100
First of all, my name is
Johnny Bashem from Arizona.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.610
And it's nice having
this intimate interview.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.060
It's kind of cool.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.662
You said, who is that said
it's not about monetization,

00:22:55.662 --> 00:22:56.495
it's about eyeballs?

00:22:56.495 --> 00:22:57.966
You said that was
Amazon who said that?

00:22:57.966 --> 00:22:58.640
ALAN MASAREK: It was Bezos.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:58.742
AUDIENCE: It was Bezos.

00:22:58.742 --> 00:23:00.616
ALAN MASAREK: On the
cover of "Time Magazine"

00:23:00.616 --> 00:23:01.796
like in the year 2000.

00:23:01.796 --> 00:23:02.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.270
So it's interesting that
was like a game changer.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.228
Everyone's like what is
this guy talking about?

00:23:06.228 --> 00:23:08.372
And obviously, look
at where he is today,

00:23:08.372 --> 00:23:09.830
look at the success
of the company.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.500
And then immediately I think
of companies like Snapchat who

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.970
are just like rampant
with users and now they're

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:20.430
starting to make innovative
steps towards monetization,

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.770
but I think today
still no monetization.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.810
But they do have stuff
like watch EDC live.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.575
And now they're engaging
huge amounts of users.

00:23:28.575 --> 00:23:29.950
What do you say
towards companies

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.600
like that is the first question.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.159
Second question is what is
that next like unbelievable

00:23:35.159 --> 00:23:35.700
breakthrough?

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.390
Like just as if Bezos
said back in the day,

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.630
it's not about monetization,
it's about users.

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:43.740
What tomorrow, what's going to
be the ridiculous statement we

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.600
see on "Time's" or
TechCrunch or whatever

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.490
that is just as like
unbelievable or just as true

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.419
moving forward?

00:23:51.419 --> 00:23:52.710
ALAN MASAREK: A great question.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:57.320
I don't know if--
let me sort of answer

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.420
with a couple of examples.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:04.670
So if you think of this massive
community Snapchat has built,

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.560
and now they're thinking
about monetization.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.899
Think in the early
days of LinkedIn.

00:24:08.899 --> 00:24:10.440
LinkedIn didn't know
how it was going

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:15.590
to monetize what is it,
like something like 3/4

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.670
of LinkedIn's revenue
comes from the recruiter

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.520
side of the house.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.682
Viber.

00:24:21.682 --> 00:24:24.160
I was just in Europe last
week and I was using Viber.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.080
Viber, you know is
completely free.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.960
But I could-- and all these over
the top solutions are free--

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:36.090
and I could buy some
extra emoticons,

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:37.910
just send crazy smiley faces.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:44.272
And that's like that first
introduction of payment.

00:24:44.272 --> 00:24:47.620
In each of those
instances those companies

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:50.640
have built massive value
based upon the size

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.900
of their footprint and the
number of engaged users.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.240
And you'll find
the revenue model.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:02.520
Now, you can't forget
that at the end of the day

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.485
there has to be a revenue model,
there has to be from someone.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.530
It may not be Snapchat
as an individual company,

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.990
it might be acquired by
someone else who then

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.280
can monetize those
eyeballs somewhere.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.900
I mean even look
what Google does.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.560
Google has lots and
lots of free services

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.810
but it monetized that with
a very unique ad model.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:28.299
So you know what's
the next next?

00:25:28.299 --> 00:25:29.840
If you're only going
to get paid on--

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.923
or if you're only going
to get valued on eyeballs?

00:25:35.512 --> 00:25:36.970
You know, I think
it's interesting.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.140
It's like it could be
even some retrenchment

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:43.630
before we get to the next
because it wasn't long

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.270
after Jeff Bezos was on the
cover of "Time Magazine"

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:51.050
like he was man of the year
or something like that it all

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.100
busted.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.330
And evaluations
came crashing down

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.480
and there was incredible
illiquidity in the market

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.810
and you couldn't raise money.

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.380
And it sort of returned to like
let's build real companies.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.480
And now the pendulum seems to
go the other way yet again.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.840
And people have short
memories and companies

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.915
without revenue models are
getting funded for astronomical

00:26:11.915 --> 00:26:12.415
sums.

00:26:14.997 --> 00:26:16.830
The only thing I know
for sure is not all of

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:19.220
them are going to come out the
other end of that bottleneck

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.220
as successful companies.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.930
AUDIENCE: So when Microsoft
introduced BPOS and eventually

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:31.100
Office 365 and it
opened up SharePoint

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:34.840
to quite a few SMBs that
now have the opportunity

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.570
to access their
documents in the cloud.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.930
Did you guys do anything
to use that to help

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:45.360
grow or did it hinder the
growth of the application

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.807
that you guys offered?

00:26:46.807 --> 00:26:48.390
ALAN MASAREK: That's
a great question.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.120
It didn't hinder
us at all because

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.560
in the early days of
BPOS and then Office 365,

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.650
Microsoft really
had to protect kind

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.610
of the mother ship of
the Office franchise.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.380
So if you remember
in the early days,

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.300
you had an online viewer
but not the editor.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:10.320
Or then the editor
was very rudimentary,

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.280
or the conversion of their own
stuff in the cloud was poor.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.750
The fidelity was poor.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:20.220
So they were sort of dipping
their toe in the water

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.310
and the data was noisy for us.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:25.580
But it concerned us as
they were coming that way.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.050
They were trying to manage, or
they continue to try to manage,

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:36.160
a move from a perpetual use
licenses to a subscription

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.320
world without screwing
up their revenue base

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.410
because they got to
report to the street.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:44.340
So it's really
challenging for them

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.580
to disrupt themselves that way.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:53.460
We went out and we sort of saw
this-- Sundar talks so much

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.810
this morning about the
multi-device world.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.180
We live in a multi-device world.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.610
You're going to begin work
somewhere on one device

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.250
and edit on the
next and it doesn't

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:04.480
matter where you author
and edit and vice versa.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.560
At the end of the day,
you're just moving,

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.980
you're moving around
devices and devices

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.120
across multiple operating
systems as well, generally.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.720
And so we had developed a
product that was a cloud

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.950
version, or cloud
stored version,

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:21.020
that would then push, like
in the old BlackBerry push

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.399
metaphor, down to the devices,
trying to sort of develop

00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:26.940
a new product that we thought
would stay ahead of everything.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.523
But again, what we came out with
right before the acquisition,

00:28:29.523 --> 00:28:33.279
so we'll never know how
well it would have done.

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:35.070
AUDIENCE: So I'd like
to tap your knowledge

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.690
base about startups
and entrepreneurs

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:41.320
and just in general
about the marketplace.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.946
I seem to have a penchant for
finding opportunity and not

00:28:43.946 --> 00:28:45.320
knowing how to
monetize it or not

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:49.290
being able to identify the
threats that I could be exposed

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.980
to by entering that marketplace.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.730
So I'm curious in
your experience,

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.917
if you see an
opportunity if you know

00:28:56.917 --> 00:28:59.000
when it's right for someone
to jump in the market,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.660
how do know where that
threat's going to come from?

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.920
And can you give me any insight
as to how to monetize something

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.640
that you think is maybe a bigger
players and enter the market

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.262
and take that big piece of
the puzzle out for small guys?

00:29:11.262 --> 00:29:12.720
ALAN MASAREK: Yeah,
great question.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.410
I think as one
entrepreneur, and I've

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.114
done three-- I'm kind
of a serial entrepreneur

00:29:20.114 --> 00:29:21.155
guy-- so I've done three.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.441
And I think this applies
to most entrepreneurs.

00:29:27.441 --> 00:29:28.690
The problem is not being late.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:30.647
The problem is being early.

00:29:30.647 --> 00:29:31.980
And Quick Office, we were early.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.600
So that's one sort of big risk.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.577
You're just out
there and you see it

00:29:36.577 --> 00:29:38.410
but the market takes a
long time to develop.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:40.300
So that's a big threat.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:46.450
Clearly you've got-- you know.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.510
When you start
something you rarely

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.260
know how deep the hole is.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.880
The idea seems really
compelling but you

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.140
don't know until
you get into it.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.200
And so you've got
to be really careful

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.430
and really scrub
the idea before you

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:07.730
start spending real dollars
doing it because you want

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.740
to know how deep that
hole's going to be.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.620
I was reminded not long
ago, a guy came up to me

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.150
with this incredible,
crazy idea that he

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:21.480
was going to do,
use drones to do

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.870
aerial photography of farmland
and then algorithmically

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:30.020
or whatever and come back and
diagnose your crops in terms

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.610
of-- and I thought this is the
craziest thing I ever heard of.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.090
It's not a world
we live in at all.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:36.089
Talk to a buddy of mine.

00:30:36.089 --> 00:30:37.800
So my point is talk to experts.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.490
Talked to a buddy of
mine whose venture

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.670
firm focuses on agriculture.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.980
He's like ehh, I saw
three of those last week.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.810
So there's very
few original ideas.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:47.790
That was the point.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:48.800
There's very few.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:49.830
And it blew me away.

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:52.420
I was like I never thought
of something like that.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.980
And just reminded me
that there's very few

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:55.920
original ideas.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.530
So it's how ripe the market
is, how well you execute

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.495
against it, making sure you
got enough money to do it.

00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:05.870
You know, the vast
majority of us

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:07.950
die because we run out of money.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:09.790
And so money is oxygen.

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:11.140
You got to have it.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:15.280
So I don't think about the
monetization immediately.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.860
I think about-- because it's not
to be profitable immediately.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.310
I got to fund it.

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.330
And I'll go through the
angels and the whole bit

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:23.371
to try to fund the thing.

00:31:23.371 --> 00:31:27.650
And also, a lot
of people also-- I

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:29.520
have a big thing about
phases of a business.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.370
This is another
sort of thing I've

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:33.300
lived with for a long time.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.390
I always talk about four
phases of a business.

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:39.540
So you have inception,
commercial viability,

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.580
repeatability of the
model, and then scaling.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.180
I see people all the
time in businesses

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.509
in the inception
phase prototyping.

00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:49.300
They're spending lots
of marketing dollars.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.900
It's a complete waste.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.750
As a matter of fact,
it's counterproductive

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.830
because you can win customers
and then disappoint them

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.621
on the experience
because the product's not

00:31:56.621 --> 00:31:57.900
really commercially viable.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.700
So making sure
that you stage your

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.920
spend with the stage
of your business,

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.600
or perhaps being slightly
ahead of the stage.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.180
But all too often I see
people spending millions

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.737
of millions of
dollars on marketing

00:32:08.737 --> 00:32:10.320
when the business
model or the product

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.360
itself is not even developed.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:24.810
AUDIENCE: Obviously you're aware
of the Uber, Airbnb phenomenon,

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.240
right, that exists.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:30.070
And there's obviously going to
be a lot of other businesses

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:34.550
that take from the group
think and the acceptance

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.480
of peer-to-peer rating.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:41.490
What do you see as
opportunities in that space?

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:44.030
ALAN MASAREK: In sort of a
the shared resource economy

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.040
you're saying?

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah, shared
resource, crowd sourcing,

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:52.150
peer-to-peer evaluation.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:56.840
ALAN MASAREK: I think it's--
crowd sourcing to me is really

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.430
powerful.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:01.010
I mean all these-- this
notion of shared resource.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:03.680
I mean clearly Uber,
Airbnb, I was looking

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.260
at another one a friend of
mine was talking about today

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.980
and something else, but all
the shared resource notion

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.070
is really interesting.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:15.140
I'm actually involved as a
director of a company that

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.380
is involved in crowd
sourcing your contacts.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.180
The idea is that,
again, so just think

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.310
of it sort of conceptually.

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:27.550
We have our contacts and they
sit in a digital database.

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:30.829
But they begin to decay
because people move jobs

00:33:30.829 --> 00:33:32.620
and change phone numbers,
things like that.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.690
So it gets more and
more obsolete over time.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:38.250
And there's no
passive, automatic way

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.880
in order to update
your contacts.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.430
It's as if you have something
in a digital database

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:44.050
that you tend to
treat no different

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:45.970
than an analog
database, like it was

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:49.390
business cards on a Rolodex.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.080
So this crowd sourcing says
well let's put it all together.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.290
And it's not like
I'm going to give you

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:54.290
someone else's contacts.

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:56.230
I'm just going to give
you back your contacts,

00:33:56.230 --> 00:34:00.810
but from a machine learning
algorithmically in the cloud

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:05.110
you go through and have multiple
versions of everyone's contacts

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:07.740
so they know Alan Masarek is
no longer at Quick Office.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.053
Alan Masarek's now at Google.

00:34:09.053 --> 00:34:10.969
We've got the right guy
and his phone number's

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:12.840
changed to such and such.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.840
So it's a way to update
people's information.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.513
So I think crowd sourcing
is huge that way.

00:34:18.513 --> 00:34:20.179
That you got to deal
with privacy issues

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:23.030
but I think you're going to
see more and more of that

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:24.370
because it just makes sense.

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:27.280
And that's just one
example because I just

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.035
think it's clearly a problem,
that one example in context,

00:34:31.035 --> 00:34:32.880
is clearly a problem
that has to be solved.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.314
And crowd sourcing
is the way to do it.

00:34:35.314 --> 00:34:37.869
I don't know if I
answered your question.

00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:38.369
OK.

00:34:38.369 --> 00:34:40.010
Good, thank you.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:41.810
AUDIENCE: It seems
like since you sold,

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.484
Microsoft has made a lot of
advancements in your space.

00:34:44.484 --> 00:34:46.150
In addition to what
was announced today,

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.650
what do you think
Google needs to do

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.679
to remain competitive
and continue

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:53.630
to make an indent
in this market?

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:57.650
ALAN MASAREK: I actually
think Google's in a great spot

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:00.520
right now.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.675
I'm not just waving the pompoms
as a Google cheerleader.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.570
I would constructively
criticize from

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:14.780
before that the sharing model
was better than Microsoft,

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:17.240
in my opinion, before.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.880
The whole notion of the sharing
model, real time collaboration

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.500
or not, just the whole notion
of how you save and interacted

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.150
on documents was better.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:28.290
But for the longest time
the editing functionality--

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:33.000
or first of all, the convert
fidelity wasn't there

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.460
in Docs, Suites and
Slides, and then

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.549
the editing functionality
wasn't there.

00:35:37.549 --> 00:35:39.340
And so you had to kind
of go through-- what

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.350
I mean wasn't there
wasn't kind of up to snuff

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.140
and it wasn't offline and
it wasn't mobile, et cetera.

00:35:47.406 --> 00:35:49.030
And so in a sense
you had to kind of go

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:50.880
through an element
of pain in order

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.560
to get to the better
sharing model.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.770
Now the editing
functionality is there.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:58.680
You saw track changes.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.100
You can stay in office
mode with Quick Office.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.410
It's offline.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:04.650
It's mobile.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:07.920
And it's got more than
adequate editing functionality

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.370
for the 95% of the users.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:15.390
So now you have, in my opinion,
an actually better solution,

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:17.340
the better sharing
model with more

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.400
than adequate functionality
on the editing side,

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.632
you have a one plus one
equals three situation.

00:36:21.632 --> 00:36:24.410
So I think continuing
down that path,

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:26.960
which I've been pushing
like crazy in the two years

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.320
I've been there, they'll
continue to do that

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.150
and I think they will
win a lot of business

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.860
in the enterprise app space.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.188
I really do.

00:36:36.188 --> 00:36:38.990
JOHN: Awesome So with that thank
you so much for your questions.

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:40.380
And thank you again to Alan.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:40.910
This was wonderful.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:42.243
ALAN MASAREK: My pleasure, John.

00:36:42.243 --> 00:36:43.660
Thank you so much.
