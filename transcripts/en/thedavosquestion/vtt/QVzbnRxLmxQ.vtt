[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.900
&gt;&gt; So here I am at Heathrow, and I am -- as
you can see outside, it's

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.570
sort of almost dawn.
I'm just pleased the day is here actually

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.410
because there's been a lot of
prep to get to this point.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.610
I've realized as well this was a year since
I got back from Ethiopia

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.390
almost to the day.
So it seems sort of fitting that, you know,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:39.329
the same day I got back, a
year later I'm flying out to hopefully get

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.770
people to take notice.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.770
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.749
&gt;&gt; We're on our way to Davos which will take
about an hour and half,

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.809
two hours, apparently.

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.519
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.390
&gt;&gt; It's night one in Davos and as you can
see it's absolutely

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.339
beautiful.
It's snowing gently, the air is really crystal

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.580
clear and fresh.
And it's just absolutely amazing.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.780
And actually, what springs to mind for me
is the juxtaposition with my

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.600
Ethiopia experience.
And what I wonder is some of the world leaders

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.060
who are here, they must
spend a lot of their lives talking about poverty,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.399
but they have ever
actually experienced it?

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.920
Have they ever actually gone into slums and
seen how people live?

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.580
And I suppose that's what is on my mind at
the moment is really holding

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.810
those girls' voices and those African experiences
with me here as we go

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.950
forward.
I'm about to do an interview on CNN so that

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.750
hopefully will go global.
So the message is getting out.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.020
&gt;&gt;Female genital mutilation, commonly know
as FGM, is a ancient custom

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.210
often tied to religious and social acceptance.
And now Julia

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.770
Lalla-Maharajh is bringing it to the attention
of world at the World

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.549
Economic Forum in Davos.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.810
&gt;&gt;My belief is that issues like this can't
stay on the margins, that

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.640
they really have to be debated at the highest
levels.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.850
It's the end of day one, it's been a really
long day.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.540
And I'm the proud owner of a white badge,
which is quite phenomenal in

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.170
Davos.
It basically means access to all areas.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.010
But today's been a set up, so it's really
tomorrow morning where

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.390
everything happens.
It will be talking about people.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.390
It will be working out how to say to them
about female genital

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.000
mutilation in a way that makes them want to
listen.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.030
So, yeah.
A good day and looking forward to tomorrow.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.620
It's -- I'll let you know how it goes.
