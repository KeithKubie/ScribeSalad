NARRATOR: New York City, May
4, 2015, at Tech Crunch Disrupt

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.380
New York, an annual new
technologies conference,

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.620
US biotech start-up BioBots
launches a desktop 3D printer

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.080
for biomaterials,
which they use to print

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.000
a replica of van Gogh's ear.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.830
Instead of plastic, special ink
is combined with biomaterials,

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.750
like collagen and
cultured cells,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.170
to build living tissue
and human organs.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.380
So right now, we're just at
the beginning of understanding

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.000
how to 3D print organs.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.540
It's a process called
biofabrication.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.420
So BioBots has created
a biofabrication

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.580
3D printer that can
print artificial tissue

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.210
and small organs.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.460
In the future, what
we're going to see

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.210
are 3D printers that are
biofabricating our bodies

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.790
and our organs.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.040
DAVID WILCOCK: You
could eventually

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.620
have printable noses,
lungs, ears, kidneys.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.880
And in certain ways,
this technology

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.040
is so extreme that it
could make it democratic.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.960
It could make it inexpensive.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.750
So in the hands of skilled,
trained medical professionals,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.790
it could be possible
in the future

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.540
to 3D print organs
for people out

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.710
of their own genetic material.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.500
NARRATOR: Transhumanists
believe we may soon transcend

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.670
our biological limitations
as we embed machines

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.250
directly into our own bodies.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.750
DARPA, the agency of the
US Department of Defense

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.920
responsible for the development
of emerging technologies

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.500
for use by the
military, is currently

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.000
designing neural
implants that will

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.750
improve cognitive speed and
memory retention in soldiers.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.420
And in 2014, scientists at Seoul
National University in South

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.170
Korea unveiled research
on synthetic smart skin,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.170
life-like ultra thin
crystalline silicon,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.960
designed to cover
prosthetic limbs,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.330
giving the user all of the
sensations of a natural limb.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.540
They've now
developed a skin which

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.380
has touch sensors
embedded in it,

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.880
with a very fine matrix, which
can be put around a prosthetic.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.460
So you can actually feel
what that arm is feeling,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.830
or you can touch the floor,
feel whether it's hot or cold

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.670
or applying pressure.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.620
Future artificial limbs
will look just like our skin,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.580
look just like our
hands and our legs.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.420
It's going to affect
the entire world.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.750
We're going to see people
using smart prosthetics that

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.040
are added to the body
that can be controlled

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.920
directly through the brain.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.420
And that really is the
future of prosthetics.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.710
KEVIN WARWICK: I can speak
from experience because I've

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.750
had one myself, are implants
that link either into the brain

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.420
or into the human
nervous system.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.330
And what I had was
100 small electrodes

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.500
fired into my nervous system
to link my nervous system

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.210
with a computer.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.210
It was a bit like plugging a
plug into an electric socket,

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.420
but the socket was
my nervous system.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.290
So I went to Columbia
University in New York.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.880
We plugged my nervous
system into the internet

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.040
and I controlled a robot
hand from my brain signals.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.290
You can extend
your nervous system

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.040
by simply plugging into it.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.080
GRAY SCOTT: If we can use
just the power of our thoughts

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.080
to control artificial limbs,
we can eventually one day

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.540
use the power of our thoughts
to control avatar robots.
