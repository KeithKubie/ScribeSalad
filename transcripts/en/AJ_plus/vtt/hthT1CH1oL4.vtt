00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Paying too much money to see a doctor
getting charged crazy amounts just for

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.740
routine procedures and trying to figure
out exactly what is covered by your

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.870
insurance. Why is the health care system
in the U.S. so broken. Most countries in

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.809
the world have some form of universal
health care sometimes called

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.460
single-payer, because everybody pays into
it everybody benefits from it - sort of

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.090
like public schools or public
transportation. Basically you take away

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.849
private insurers and the government runs
the insurance program and so the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.739
government is the single payer. In the
U.S., the idea of universal healthcare

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.489
has always been a non-starter, especially
on the federal level but it's quickly

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.200
picking up steam among young Americans. A
recent poll showed forty five percent of

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.610
people between 18 and 29 support
single-payer, and 66 percent of young

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.500
Democrats. More and more people are
realizing that that we can't stay on

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.079
this trajectory. Millennial generation is
the highest level of uninsured in the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.650
country. Not only do we not have access
to employer plans on an increasing level,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.869
we also don't have the money that our
parents generation had in terms of real

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.060
wage growth. As enthusiasm around the idea
continues to grow, some states aren't

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.259
waiting for Congress. But when New York
California and Vermont tried to enact

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.400
their own versions of universal health
care in the last few years, their efforts failed.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.000
But there's one state where some
think it just might work: Maryland.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.500
And there's one candidate for
governor who's betting on it: if we want

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.470
to unlock opportunity in our states
we've got to fix the health care system.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.329
There's no state that's ever been in a
better position than us to make

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.240
single-payer happen. Why might Maryland
be different?

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.810
Well most notably, the state tends to be
left-leaning, with twice as many

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.310
registered Democrats as Republicans.
Maryland also has the highest median

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.060
income in the U.S., which means more
people with money who can pay into the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.670
system. Canada started with one province
standing up and saying that we will do it.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.729
Maryland can be that state here. We
have the will, we've already shown that

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.340
if we move in this direction we can
save hundreds of millions of dollars.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.920
Ben Jealous isn't alone in embracing single-payer

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.510
for his election campaign. Gubernatorial
candidates in Iowa, California,

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.810
Massachusetts, and Michigan, among others,
are all running on a medicare-for-all

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.819
type platform. Why is this gaining
traction? Because of the pain in our

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.120
society, and we've hit a place where
health care's become so expensive and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.110
is exerting so much pressure, not
just on working families but on small

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.120
businesses, that something's
gotta give. But single payer advocates

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.630
aren't so sure this could actually
happen in Maryland. Or that trying to

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.230
solve this on the state level is
necessarily even the right approach. You

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.880
can really only do it at the national
level, because there's so many national

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.190
laws and policies that get in
the way. That even if you passed a

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.750
bill that looked something like
single payer, you would then find

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.739
yourself trying to get waivers from the
federal government. Until recently,

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.430
campaigning on a single-payer health
care platform might have been political

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.109
suicide. But things are changing. Bernie
Sanders' "Medicare for All" plan last

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.850
year garnered 15 Senate co-sponsors,
including some potential presidential

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.109
contenders. Just two years earlier he
couldn't even find one. I think it's

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.820
notable that every Democrat who wants to
be president who's in the U.S. Senate has

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.820
signed on to Bernie Sanders bill. There's
a big battle that's gonna be played

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.830
out in the Democratic Party over health
care. The country has been activated,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.840
I mean, we all watched what happened when Trump
tried to get rid of the Affordable Care

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.530
Act and there were thousands of people
down in Washington, some people sitting

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.350
in, you saw disabled people being carried out
of you know the Senate and House buildings. We're

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.889
working just as hard and in some cases
harder for longer hours, but we're

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.720
getting less. We see that money is being
generated in this country, it's just

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.360
going into the pockets of the super
wealthy

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.079
