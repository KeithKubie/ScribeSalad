MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.540
Welcome to another outstanding
Authors at Google Talk.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.050
We have a true innovator
with us today.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.810
How do you sustain innovation,
how do you sell your ideas in

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.800
the marketplace, how do you
really make things succeed?

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.860
We're pleased to host
Stephen Key today to

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.480
give us some answers.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.870
He is a leading innovator.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.550
He was formerly the head
of design for the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.990
World of Wonder Group.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.795
And after delving into the world
of Lazer Tag and Teddy

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:30.310
Ruxpin, he continues to work
with innovative products, such

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.760
as the Spinformation labels,
and also a new drink called

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.860
the Soyu Natural Teas.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.430
His work has garnered him a few
Edison awards, a lot of

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.710
buzz in the industry.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.260
But he's especially well-known
for his recent book, of which

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.160
today's book is the sequel
in some ways.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.610
The current book is titled, "One
Simple Idea for Startups

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.160
and Entrepreneurs." And it
continues the "One Simple

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.180
Idea" series, though this time
focusing on the startup side

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.350
as opposed to the innovation
and product side.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.230
And so, we'll have the mic
available for Q&amp;A. And please

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.730
join me in welcoming
Stephen to Google.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.696
Thanks.

00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:13.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.200
STEPHEN KEY: Well,
good afternoon.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.570
I'm so excited to be here.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.080
In fact, I grew up in
the Bay Area, so

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.820
it's like coming home.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.960
I currently live in Modesto,
which I call the creative

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.410
capital of the world.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.140
And if anybody's ever been
there, hopefully I'll get a

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.160
laugh from that.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.600
But today, I want to talk about
my journey a little bit.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.220
You see, what I do for a living
now, what I've done for

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.910
30 years, is that I come up
with simple ideas and I

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.140
license those ideas
to companies.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.950
And every time they sell one
of those ideas, I get paid.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.960
It's called licensing.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.590
It's basically renting
an idea to a company.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.620
And like I said, every time
they sell one, I get paid.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.170
Now, a lot of people ask me, how
do you do that without a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.140
lot of protection,
like patents?

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.670
How do you do that when
you live in Modesto?

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.390
And how do you work with some
really large companies?

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.580
And how do you license ideas?

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.280
So today, I want to talk about
some of the things that you

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.010
can do because I know everybody
here's creative.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.540
I know that.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.750
I know everybody here
has had an idea

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.330
at one time or another.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.030
And you want to know, hey, what
do I do with these ideas?

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.870
Do I just let them sit?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.230
And if you do let them
sit, you know

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.620
what's going to happen?

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.340
You're going to see them
sooner or later.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.640
I can guarantee it.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.290
If they're not even good ideas,
they can be OK ideas.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.360
But sooner or later, you'll
probably see those on the

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.340
store shelves.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.460
So I want to start at
the very beginning.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.950
I grew up in the Bay
Area, and my father

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.010
worked for General Electric.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.270
And he said, Steve--

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.950
after I graduated from high
school, he says, you need to

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.990
go into business.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.830
And so I went to Santa
Clara University.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.650
And I realized I hated it.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.100
I was a econ major, and
everybody there had a smile on

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.620
their face.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.290
And I couldn't stand it.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.040
So one day I took an art class
by mistake and I realized I

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.390
really loved working
with my hands.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.770
I wanted to create things.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.680
So I went home and I told
my dad, I said, dad, I

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.260
want to be an artist.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.105
And he said, great.

00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:17.250
Do you paint?

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.630
And I said, well, no.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.850
And he said, well,
you must sculpt.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.840
You like to sculpt?

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.890
And I said, well, no.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.130
So my father gave me some
great advice and said,

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.480
whatever you want to
do, just do it.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.150
And if you really love it,
you'll be successful at it.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.010
Successful with it.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.930
So I went over to San Jose State
and it was a big shock

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.970
to the system.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.430
And I joined the
art department.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.070
And I realized very quickly
I wasn't an artist either.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.930
But I wanted to make things.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.510
I wanted to get my ideas out.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.200
So I left San Jose State a
little early without a degree,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.310
and I started to just to
make things and sell

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.960
them at street fairs.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.370
I was one of those guys that you
go to these street fairs,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.010
they have them all over
the Bay Area.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.470
And I'd set up a little table
and I would sell them.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.580
And I realized real quick--

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.800
one of the most important things
that I've learned that

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.260
if it doesn't sell, you got to
kick it to the curb as fast as

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.700
you can and find an idea
that does sell.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.290
Because if you're living off of
your ideas, in order to pay

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.660
the rent, in order to pay the
bills, you better find an idea

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.320
that works.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.400
So I learned very quickly
to test, test, and test.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.880
And if it doesn't work,
get rid of it.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.370
Find something new.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.760
So I was very fortunate because
I'm 27 years old now

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.520
and all my friends think
I'm the biggest

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.550
loser on the planet.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.010
I'm selling things
at street fairs.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.620
And sure enough, I read an
article in the late '80s--

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.970
there was a startup company
called Worlds of Wonder.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.650
And they had this talking
teddy bear, Teddy

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.470
Ruxpin and Lazer Tag.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.700
And I went in for my first
job at 27 years old.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.920
And the engineering department
hired me because they didn't

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.030
really know anything about
stuffed animals, and that's

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.720
what I was making at
the street fairs.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.640
And so they hired me.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.820
And we sold 5 million Teddy
Ruxpins at $89.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.800
We were the fifth largest toy
company in the world with one

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.400
simple idea.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.690
And I was amazed.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.400
My job at Worlds of Wonder was
to go overseas and help them

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.410
start up manufacturing.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.880
Since I was a designer now,
first job, I'd go over there

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.850
and I realized that the creator
of Teddy Ruxpin was

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.490
making a million dollars
a month in royalties.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.020
And I was on a production line
watching this and making sure

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.300
those teddy bears,
they look great.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.220
And I realized right away
I wanted to be that guy.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.390
I wanted to be the guy that was
collecting the royalties.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.810
So I left Worlds of Wonder, came
back, and moved to that

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.300
little town over there in the
central valley, Modesto.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.260
And I met this wonderful
woman there.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.720
And we ended up starting a
family and raising three kids.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.240
So what I started out to do--
and it was really simple.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.470
I thought if I just showed a
company a great idea, if they

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.936
liked it, they would pay me.

00:05:54.936 --> 00:05:57.210
It was as simple as that.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.610
And I remember the first
idea I came up with.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.350
You see, I love playing
basketball and I have this--

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.090
my office.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.720
And just to have some fun, I
would shoot a little Nerf

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.880
basketball game.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.920
I had a little ball there
and I'd shoot it.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.560
And it was boring, I realized
I wanted to

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.800
create something different.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.170
So I went down to the store.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.610
I went to Toys"R"Us and
I looked at all

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.560
the basketball games.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.790
And I realized they were
all just square.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.310
And they were really boring.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.880
And so I put my creative
cap on.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.010
I started coming up crazy ideas
of what could I do to a

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.730
basketball game?

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.420
And I couldn't wait for my wife
to get home because I

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.470
came up with this one idea I
wanted to share with her.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.530
You see, the woman I met at
Worlds of Wonder, Janice

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.130
Kimball, she had gone
to Stanford.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.890
She has her MBA at
Northwestern.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.250
And now she's at Gallo.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.350
She's vice president of
marketing for Gallo, the

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.960
largest wine company
in the world.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.670
She's the highest-ranking
women they've ever had.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.930
And she's excellent
at new products.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.925
So I can't wait for her to get
home because I want to show

00:06:59.925 --> 00:07:02.280
her my new basketball game.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.930
And so we put the kids to bed
and we slip into bed.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.240
And I have this big sketch pad
and I'm here to tell you guys,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.540
the last thing you want to do
is bring home your work.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.960
The second thing you don't want
to do is bring home your

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.160
work to bed.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.760
And we sat there and I went
through my ideas with my wife.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.810
And she said, Steve--
at the very end, it

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.430
was the last idea.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.540
It was a basketball game.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.790
And I took the picture of
Michael Jordan from a poster

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.730
and I just slapped it
on the backboard.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.620
And I called it Hoop
Hoop Hooray.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.790
It was a terrible name.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.540
So I shared it with my wife and
she says, Steve, that's

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.510
the worst idea I've ever seen.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.825
The chances of you licensing
that idea are

00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:41.850
about one in a million.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.840
Come up with another idea.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.730
So the very next day I sent
it off to that company--

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.710
it was called Ohio Art--

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.430
because they had the license
for Michael Jordan now.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.110
And I loved Michael Jordan.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.180
But It was a little picture.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.210
And when I sent my idea
in, they loved it.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.040
And three days later, I had this
contract from Ohio Art.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.850
And they called it the Michael
Jordan wall ball.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.290
And it sold for 10 years.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.470
And every time they sold
one, I got paid.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.870
So it allowed me to basically
do whatever I want.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.040
But for 10 years, I collected
those royalties.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.960
Now, I want you to
imagine this.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.810
It's Saturday morning.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.620
I'm sitting on the couch.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.885
I have my kids there and Janice
is on the end, and I'm

00:08:23.885 --> 00:08:24.320
sitting there.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.457
And Michael Jordan comes up on
this commercial and he shoots

00:08:27.457 --> 00:08:29.810
it and he makes the bucket.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.100
He turns around, looks at the
camera and says, this is the

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.080
best looking backboard
I've ever seen.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.950
And I'm sitting there,
and I look over at my

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.200
wife and I'm going--

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.270
What I realized and what I want
to tell everybody here,

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:47.140
the only opinion that matters
when it comes to ideas is the

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.070
companies you're licensing
it to.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.390
It's not your friends,
it's not your family.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.830
It's those companies.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.900
Now, what's really great about
licensing ideas to companies--

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.120
I call it renting an
idea to a company--

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.970
is that you can do it anywhere
in the world.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.530
And you can do it just by
taking a few steps.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.070
And I want to go through
some of those steps.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.960
These same steps are in my first
book called "One Simple

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.785
Idea." McGraw-Hill contacted
me about two years ago and

00:09:13.785 --> 00:09:15.970
they said, Steve, you've got
this great system of how to

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:16.800
license ideas.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.420
You've licensed ideas in the toy
industry, the novelty gift

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.740
industry, the packaging
industry.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.820
Why don't you share how
you do these 10 steps?

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.240
So I did.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.140
And I've been teaching these 10
steps for many, many years.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.850
And people have been following
the steps and they've been

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.610
licensing ideas.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.270
So I'm here to tell
you that you don't

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.860
have to start a company.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:37.986
I mean, everybody thinks
that I'm going to

00:09:37.986 --> 00:09:39.380
have to raise money.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.960
I need to protect my ideas.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.100
And I'm going to need to start a
company, and all this stuff.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.470
And I'm here to tell you, you
need to look at licensing if

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.690
you're creative.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:50.180
Because companies are
looking for ideas.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.220
In fact, how many people have
heard of open innovation?

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.930
Raise your hand.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.300
OK, a few.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.230
Open innovation, it's
really simple.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.540
Companies have realized,
we don't have

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.800
all the great ideas.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.040
So they realize that if we open
the doors to everybody,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.210
people can submit ideas
to our company.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:11.100
And one company is leading the
charge, it's Procter &amp; Gamble.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.900
You can go to their site
and they list what

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.930
they're looking for.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.870
So what they've decided, and I
think a lot of companies have

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.580
decided is that, look, I might
have the brightest guys in the

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.330
back room, but how can I expand
my reach of ideas?

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:26.890
And it's called open
innovation.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.850
If you're not familiar with it,
please take a look at it.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.950
You'd be amazed at what
companies want your ideas,

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.960
what companies are looking
for ideas.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.850
And it's global.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.290
It's not just here, it's
around the world now.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:39.350
It's called open innovation.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.850
Please look at that.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.820
Now, let's get back to, what
do you really need

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.460
to license an idea?

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.520
Well, it's really
quite simple.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.850
You need to study
the marketplace.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.750
You need to find a hole.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.170
Now, you don't want to
reinvent the wheel.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.350
When you reinvent the wheel,
it takes a lot of money, it

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.190
takes a lot of education, it's
going to take a lot of time.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.050
But if you look at any
marketplace and you find that

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.730
uniqueness that other
people have missed--

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.960
and what's really amazing, if
you look at it close enough,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.110
you can look between the lines
and you will see openings.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.690
I like to look at those as
finding crumbs on the table

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:20.270
that big companies have missed
because they're too busy

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.610
either putting out
fires or running

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:22.850
their day-to-day business.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.890
But there's opportunity for
people like myself and for

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.830
others that want to start
companies, that want to

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.370
license ideas.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.070
So you're looking for sleeping
dinosaurs, is

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.450
what I like to say.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.750
And once you find that
opportunity, you need to

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.800
submit it to a company.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.120
Now, everybody asks, Steve,
aren't you afraid that

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.880
someone's going to
steal your idea?

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.060
I'm not afraid at all.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.510
Because some things have
happened, some things have

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.860
changed in the last 10 years.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.260
Number one, because of open
innovation, a lot of companies

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.900
are looking for ideas--
number one.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.710
And because of the internet, if
someone treats you poorly,

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.730
you can talk about it.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.420
Now, that has changed the
whole game, the profile.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.460
Companies are a little bit
afraid of people posting

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.220
things that are negative
about their company.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.910
So companies are playing fair
for the first time.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.170
And number two, intellectual
property.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.640
Has anybody here
filed patents?

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.890
Anybody know about
patents here?

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:17.470
A few?

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.280
OK.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.730
The United States Patent and
Trademark Office has these

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:23.510
great tools.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.795
They're very, very affordable.

00:12:24.795 --> 00:12:27.260
And the first tool I like to
talk about is called a

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.280
provisional patent
application.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.270
It's a wonderful tool.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.620
You can file it yourself
for $125.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.700
Meaning you can play
the biggest game in

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.290
the world with $125.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.430
Now, that is truly amazing.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.360
It's called a provisional
patent application.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.270
If you're not familiar with it,
go to the USPTO and start

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.310
reading about provisional
patent applications.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.970
It's a wonderful,
wonderful tool.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.450
And there's many other
ones as well.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.010
So look at those tools.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.120
You know what those tools do?

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.320
They give you perceived
ownership.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.900
Because I don't think you
ever own anything.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.470
Everybody wants to
own something.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.230
I don't think you do.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:10.020
Now, I have 13 patents.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.030
One of my patents is on a
technology, like here.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.640
I don't know if you
can see it.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.640
But when you turn the label,
you get additional

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.340
information.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.570
I'm going to pass this around.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.330
This technology, it's called
Spinformation.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.195
It won an Edison Award a
year and a half ago.

00:13:28.195 --> 00:13:33.400
And I remember being back in
New York with my group.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.030
Here's another one.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.670
This one's got animation
when you spin it.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:36.920
You'll see animation.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.960
Now, what was really great
about this idea--

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.920
well, first of all, it won an
Edison Award along with Coke,

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.150
Nike, Apple, Stephen Key
Design, my company .

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:53.200
And I was really amazed at how
powerful a simple idea is.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.140
How powerful an idea is by
finding opportunities, filing

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.150
a provisional patent, and
going down that road.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.210
Now, I'm going to pass
those around.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.870
What you're seeing now, that's
called AccuDial.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.930
That's a correct way of dosing
your child by the weight of

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.370
your child, not by the
age of your child.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:11.690
And you're going to see
this more and more.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.160
We rolled it out up in Canada.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.320
And you're going to see some of
the national pharmaceutical

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.450
companies use this next because
it's the correct way

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.710
of dosing your child.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:25.940
But this gets even better
because I have 13 patents on

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.070
that technology.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.470
13.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.850
I've even--

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:29.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
technology?

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.870
STEPHEN KEY: Yeah, 13 on
this one technology.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.410
Now people ask, wow, 13.

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.450
Why so many?

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:40.460
Well, there's a lot of different
label formats.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.460
And you start thinking about
Pepsis and Cokes, and

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.250
Campbell's Soup.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.860
And so I filed all these patents
on all these different

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.820
technologies.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.530
But I remember--

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.570
is anybody familiar
with prior art

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.490
searching, too, this group?

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:57.210
No?

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:58.680
Well, you can always do--

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.970
this is what I love.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:05.400
Go to Google Patents, which is
like a godsend for someone

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.260
like myself because it's
so easy to do.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.020
The USPTO site is terrible,
but Google

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.030
Patents is really fast.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.420
But you can look at other
people's ideas really quickly

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.910
and see if your idea
is a new one.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:21.940
So this idea that I licensed
and sold over 500 million

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.760
labels with that idea.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.340
And I collected a royalty off
of every time they sold one.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.820
And in fact, I just sold my
company to a pharmaceutical

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.990
company with this technology.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:35.610
But what's really amazing
about it, I don't

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:38.170
own rotating labels.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.120
And I didn't invent the
rotating label.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.520
Someone else did.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.350
But I still have 13
patents on it.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.150
And people are always amazed
because everybody

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.180
wants to own something.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:55.210
So I remember my attorneys are
here, [? Carr &amp; Farrell, ?]

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.140
right down the street.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.070
I remember when I first came
up with this idea and they

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.470
said, Steve, your idea is just
too goofy to come up with

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.810
something that really
could be useful.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.690
And so I showed them the idea
and they said, look, we want

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:07.980
to do a prior art search.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.120
And so sure enough, they did.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.440
And they looked around and they
said, Steve, you're the

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.180
sole inventor of this
rotating label.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.820
They couldn't believe it.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.520
So the next thing you know, I
get this call, because I'm

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.080
making samples, showing
it to people.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.490
I get this call from the
president of Procter &amp; Gamble.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:23.770
And they saw this innovation.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.660
They said, Steve, you need to
come out to Cincinnati and

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.360
give a presentation to our
technical group about this

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.420
great innovation that you
created in Modesto, the

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.370
creative capital of the world.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.050
I said, absolutely.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.290
And I went out to Cincinnati.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.130
But before I went there,
I asked my wife.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.500
You see, my wife's got that
background I told you about.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.260
And I said, I'm going to need
some help here because I'm

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.040
really a fish out of water.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.500
And she said, I'm not going
back with you there.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.630
I said, well, what not?

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:47.820
She said, Steve,
you understand.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.680
That's Procter &amp; Gamble.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.800
They're going to eat you
up and spit you out.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.450
I said, well, no.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:51.840
Come on out.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.820
So I said, look, throw
on that red dress.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.070
Let's go out in Cincinnati
and let's go wow them.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:02.710
So sure enough, we went out
there and the gentleman took

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.599
us out to lunch on
their campus.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.010
And after lunch,
I was so happy.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.210
I thought I finally
hit the big time.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:09.920
I'm going to license my idea
to one of the biggest

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.370
companies in the packaged good
industry in the world and life

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:14.520
is just going to be great.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.160
So after lunch I said
to the gentleman, I

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.240
thanked him for lunch.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.930
And he said something very
interesting to me.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:24.270
He said, Steve, remember one
thing, there is no such thing

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.520
as a free lunch.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.200
And I remember looking at my
wife and she kind of looked

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.880
back and gave me that look
of, I told you so.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.740
And we went to the meeting and
sure enough we walked down

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.430
this long aisle, and
there's patents

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.430
and patents and patents.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.220
They're trying to scare you now,
intimidate you with all

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:42.770
these patents.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.270
So you get in this room.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.820
And sure enough, they
all line up.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.250
They have all their engineering,
their marketing

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.030
people, their engineers.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.600
I mean, there's got to be
50 people in the room.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.620
They all line up on one side
and I'm on the other side.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.450
I do exactly what I do best,
I kind of spin the label.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.700
And my wife gets up there and
talks about how we're going to

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.490
cross promote, all that
marketing stuff that

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.970
she knows so well.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.650
And I had a manufacturing
guy there.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.220
And he said, look. he didn't
know how he was going to do

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.140
it, but he said, hey, since
you've got our equipment in

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.910
your facilities, we'll
figure it out.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.160
That's my team.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.630
And so the gentlemen slides
this piece of

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.450
paper across the table.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.240
He says, Mr. Key, we're not
going to pay you one

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.490
penny for this idea.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.260
And I grabbed that piece of
paper and they all got up and

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.020
they walked out.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.640
Meeting over.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.370
It was that fast.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.840
And I remember I went back
and I was in shock.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.790
And I sent that piece of paper
over to my attorneys.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.610
And they said, Steve, I'm really
sorry, but you're not

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.893
the inventor of the
rotating label.

00:18:39.893 --> 00:18:42.286
We call it Spinformation.

00:18:42.286 --> 00:18:44.060
I said, well, why is that?

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.250
He said, well, someone else
invented it before you.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:48.990
So forget about it.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.680
And life is over in that
particular product.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.770
But it bothered me that here,
the largest packaged goods

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.710
companies, was calling me.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.590
And they were interested
in it.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:05.190
But they were kind of upset
that their people didn't

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.710
invent this.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.010
So in a way, to make a long
story short, I started

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:09.830
thinking about this over and
over and over again.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.250
I realized something's
really wrong.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.800
So I received the two patents.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.400
It was invented 50 years ago.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.760
And I started looking at the
patent and claims, and reading

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.520
and reading.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.080
I'm realizing, there is no
method of manufacturing.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.380
So I started calling up
companies and they let me in

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:27.740
their facilities.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.940
And I started to realize how
to make a label spin.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:36.390
And so today, I have 13 patents
on that technology

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.270
that my company, Patent
Portfolio, was purchased by a

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.710
company called AccuDial.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.720
And now we're rolling out.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.970
So I guess the moral to that
story is when someone tells

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:50.890
you no and you still think
there's a possibility, do your

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.360
own homework.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.930
Always do your own homework.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.390
And always investigate,
investigate, investigate.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.412
Because a lot of people just
have it wrong if you don't see

00:19:59.412 --> 00:20:00.500
it correctly.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.740
So that idea that you see there,
rotating label, I sell

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.030
a lot of those labels.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.830
But I consider that a fairly big
idea because it crosses a

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.810
lot of different categories
in the food

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:10.660
and beverage industry.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:14.765
But most of my ideas have had no
protection on them at all.

00:20:14.765 --> 00:20:19.650
The Michael Jordan wall ball had
no protection whatsoever.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:27.240
And even ideas as simple as
ideas like this, I was able to

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.200
license this to a company with
a one-line description,

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.860
plastic arrow with a suction
cup, I'm stuck on you.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.120
And a company licensed this and
they sold it at all the

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.580
hallmarks for Valentine's.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:42.160
I made $10,000 on one line.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.420
The point I'm trying to make
is simple ideas, no matter

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.800
what industry that you're in,
companies need ideas because

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.790
of open innovation.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:55.580
If it's software, if its new
toasters, tennis shoes, back

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.530
to school, it does not matter.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.590
If you're creative and you see
an opportunity, you should

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.540
look at licensing
that creativity.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.690
Now, this is what
you need to do.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.780
I want to get back to
that real quick.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.850
You need to do a prior
art search.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.740
Go to Google Patents, take a
look around, see if your

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.510
idea's new.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.310
But better yet, this
is what I do.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:17.580
I just do a Google
Product Search.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.600
And that's the greatest
tool on the planet.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.210
It used to be I used to
have to go down to the

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.040
stores to do this.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.990
But now I can sit in my bunny
slippers, get on the computer,

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.910
and I can do all the homework
right from my desk.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.370
And I'm always looking to
see if I find my idea.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.900
But even if I find my idea,
online, but it's not in the

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.020
stores, I still might
go for it.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.330
I still might try to license
some variation.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.050
You see, what I realize is that
all the ideas that are

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:45.770
out there, a lot of them
have been done before.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:47.840
But you need to find
a uniqueness.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.040
You need to find something
that's a little bit different

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.080
no one has done before.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.240
I like to find ideas that--

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.910
I like to make changes
on small ideas

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.530
that already exist.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:02.820
And the reason why, there's a
marketplace for it already.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.640
You see, if you create this
idea where you have to

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.150
educate, takes a lot of money,
maybe a lot of time as well.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.060
But if you find an existing
product, change it up a little

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.780
bit, and file a provisional
patent application, that gives

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.950
you perceived ownership
for one full year.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:22.545
That one full year allows you
to call companies and submit

00:22:22.545 --> 00:22:24.540
your ideas to those companies.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.750
So that's how I play
this game.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:31.000
And what I've found is that when
you call these companies,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.530
most of these companies
welcome your ideas.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.150
That's what's so amazing.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.580
A lot of us think I'm going to
call this company and they're

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.560
going to say, look, we don't
look for outside ideas.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.570
That's not true anymore.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:43.870
Or it's not invented here.

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.270
That's not true anymore.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:46.160
They'll take those calls.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.030
So this is what I do when
I call these companies.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.960
And I've done this for 30 years
and it seems to work

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.680
every time.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.960
It still works today.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.540
I call them up and say, look,
I'm a product developer.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.640
I'm not an inventor because
they have some weird thing

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.750
that you're over in Modesto or
someplace working out of your

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.320
garage and you're coming out
with this crazy ideas.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.030
But call yourself a
product developer.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.190
And just say, look, I
want to submit an

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.200
idea to your company.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.390
Can you help me?

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.570
That's the three magic
words to an operator,

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.120
can you help me?

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.110
Now, what's great about these
operators, they don't really

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.780
know what to do.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.000
So I guide them.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.812
And there's a couple places you
want to go and there's a

00:23:22.812 --> 00:23:24.210
couple places you don't
want to go.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.810
You don't want to go the
legal department

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:26.690
because if it gets--

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:27.470
any attorneys here?

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:28.480
Probably not.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.220
If it gets over to the legal
departments, it's going to

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.040
hang up for a while.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.130
If it gets over in purchasing,
it's going to be

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:35.340
hung up for a while.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.190
So the two departments that you
want to call, you want to

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:42.000
call the marketing or the brand
manager, that person

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.600
doesn't care where a great
idea comes from.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.710
Their job is to go from
point A to point B.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.550
Or someone in sales.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:49.910
If you call someone in sales--

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:50.710
I love these guys.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.830
Number one, they do answer
their phone.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.830
Number two, if they like it,
they'll sell it for you.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:58.940
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:58.940 --> 00:23:59.850
is really great.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.330
And the way to find
the names of

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.220
everybody now, go to LinkedIn.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.050
So calling these companies,
it's really quite easy.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:08.280
And it's fun.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.830
In fact, I teach this one class
where I tell everybody,

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:13.430
call a company you have no
intention of submitting an

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.480
idea to and see what they say.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.925
Tell them you're a product
developer, you want to start

00:24:17.925 --> 00:24:19.220
submitting ideas.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.690
What's the process?

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.420
Who do I need to talk to?

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.300
And see how easy it
is to get in.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.910
But here's the catch.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.320
Your idea has to have wow.

00:24:33.215 --> 00:24:37.210
It doesn't have a little wow,
it needs to have a wow.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.730
If it doesn't have that,
you're going

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.580
to have a hard time.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.730
I like to take my ideas and I
like to be able to condense

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:50.820
them down to one sentence, one
powerful, emotional sentence.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.150
Like for the label it was really
simple, I can add 75%

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.380
more space to your package.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:01.810
Because I knew these companies
need more information--

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.460
for drug facts, for multiple
languages, for weight-based

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.730
dosing, for contests.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.410
I knew they need the
real estate.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.570
So I sell real estate back
to them now with

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:13.090
the rotating label.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:17.330
Find that one-line benefit
statement of why it's great.

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:18.810
You'll use that one-line
benefit

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:20.910
statement when email them.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:22.180
Your subject line might be that

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.450
one-line benefit statement.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:24.700
Find their pain.

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:30.150
And companies all have
a pain point.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:32.480
Find a pain and have
the solution.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.730
Now, sometimes I'll come up with
a solution that I don't

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.690
even know it will work.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:40.420
And people are always
dumbfounded by that.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.640
Say Steve, why would
you do that?

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.950
Well, number one, I want to see
if people are interested

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.640
in it first.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.090
Can you imagine working on a
project for year, can you

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.890
imagine filing patents
and then realize that

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.470
no one wants it?

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.275
All right, so I do it a little
bit differently.

00:25:55.275 --> 00:25:56.790
I study the marketplace.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:00.940
I try to find those sleeping
dinosaurs.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.520
I find those companies that
are looking for ideas.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.580
And the way I find those
companies is I just go down to

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.130
where my product's going to
sell, I find that shelf, I

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.560
call all those companies.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.160
And then when I submit them,
submit those ideas to them, I

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.740
do it two different ways.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.360
I call first to find that
connection, find

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.510
someone on the phone.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.240
I want to submit an
idea to them.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.070
I send them a sell sheet.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.590
And a sell sheet is like a
one-page benefit statement at

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.280
the top, my one-line benefit
statement, a picture, a

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.170
drawing, a prototype, whatever
you have, and contact

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:33.810
information.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.430
I don't tell them a lot.

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:36.870
I don't give them the
nuts and bolts.

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:37.950
I just don't do that.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.400
I give them enough to whet their
appetite for them to

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.690
call me back.

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.010
Because once they call me back,
then the dialogue, then

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.220
they dance starts.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.070
Now, what's really great about
it, I talked a little bit

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.180
about this earlier.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.790
When you file a provisional
patent application, that gives

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.940
you perceived ownership.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.820
Companies don't know if that's
going to issue or not.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:03.300
If you have a really big idea,
file multiple PPAs.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.890
Start building your wall.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.460
Because companies, number
one, they need ideas.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.370
Number two, they don't know if
it's going to issue or not.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:13.960
So the chances of licensing
are very, very good.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.510
In fact, most of the people I
work with, including myself,

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:20.530
have licensed ideas that will
never get a patent.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:21.800
So it's very interesting.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.520
I remember I gave a talk at the
United States Patent and

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:29.460
Trademark Office, David Campos
that runs the USPTO said to

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.620
me, Steve, aren't you happy?

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.300
We're going to fix the
patent system.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.030
We're going to make it so they
issue these patents really,

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:35.115
really fast.

00:27:35.115 --> 00:27:37.000
And I said, no.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.480
I like that it takes forever.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.610
Because it's like playing
the card game.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.860
They don't know if it's
going to issue.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.040
That's the way licensing
works for me.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.220
These 10 steps, if you want to
know more about them, they're

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.700
in the book called "One Simple
Idea." It's been number one on

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.850
Amazon Small Business
for almost 18 years.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:57.160
I think it fluctuates
up and down.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.050
It's being translated in five
different languages.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:04.200
It's a great way to get
your creativity out.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.940
Because I know there's a lot
of people here that are

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:06.900
thinking about ideas.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.450
You have ideas, but
what do you do?

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.720
I guess what I'm saying to you,
it's a global opportunity

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.920
for anybody.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.370
It's the way to be creative.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:18.410
And it's the way to
get your ideas

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.490
without starting a company.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:21.340
Now, real quick.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.150
My second book that's out,
just came out November 5,

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:27.800
great timing with the election
and everything, is about how

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.780
to do startups.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.980
Because I started a company a
couple years ago on a very

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.140
simple idea.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.830
And I'm all about really
simple ideas.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:41.660
Because number one, if it's
simple and small and

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.290
inexpensive, it's
easy to launch.

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:45.430
You can do it yourself.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:46.720
Doesn't require a
lot of capital.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.520
Now, I know I'm here talking to
a really large company, and

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.130
that's not the way this
is done here.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.480
But for a lot of us that want
to start small, little

00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:00.630
companies, if you find a small
idea and you test your idea,

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.750
you can start a company
basically on fumes.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.425
By testing, testing, testing,
getting that feedback, and

00:29:07.425 --> 00:29:08.080
then launching.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.160
And I want to show you something
else that I-- a good

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.250
friend of mine, I'll
show this.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:16.230
He plays guitar.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.410
How many people play
guitar here?

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:18.130
Raise your hands.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.170
A few.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:19.870
And he was a musician.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:20.800
He had a music store.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.940
He came to me a couple years
ago and he said, Steve, why

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.280
don't you do something
to a guitar pick?

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.810
I thought, why would anybody do
anything to a guitar pick?

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:29.890
It's been the same
shape forever.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:30.570
Who cares?

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:32.270
And he said, no, I think
there's something here.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:36.250
So I came up with guitar picks
in the shape of skulls, and

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:39.610
vampires, and even
Mickey Mouse.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:43.910
And what's really interesting
about the story was that I

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:46.410
think anybody else would have
said, wow, why bother with a

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:47.040
guitar pick?

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.670
Well, what was interesting
about that, I

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:50.950
became a Disney licensee.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.140
We sold at Walmart,
7/11, 10,000

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.353
stores around the world.

00:29:55.353 --> 00:29:59.570
At the biggest shows we won
awards for our guitar pick.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.750
It just goes to show you, you
don't have to reinvent the

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:02.420
wheel sometimes.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.480
It can be a small idea
that can have--

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.360
that can be powerful.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.580
I sold that company a
couple years back.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.640
It's still running today's.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.990
It's called Hot Picks.

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:14.670
And you see that they picks
around the world for a lot of

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.490
different famous bands
and things like that.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:21.160
So the second book is about
venturing, startups, how do

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.070
you do it without spending
a lot of money?

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.870
I think you'll really enjoy it
because it talks about staying

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:30.170
small, finding a simple idea,
don't reinvent the wheel, and

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.040
how to start this stuff to where
you're not breaking the

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.870
bank or you have a garage full
of stuff you can't sell.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:37.890
So anyway, just to clarify the
first book, "One Simple Idea,"

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:41.090
is about licensing, how you
can license ideas from any

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.790
place in the world, how to
leverage yourself with the

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:46.660
one-line benefit statement, how
to protect your ideas with

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.240
PPA, and how to contact
companies.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.110
It's absolutely an easy read.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.150
I think you'll enjoy it.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.610
The second company say, hey,
look, I'm going to find those

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:56.240
crumbs that the big companies
are missing.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.580
I'm going to start my own little
business, how do I do

00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.850
it with a little bit of cash?

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:00.950
How do I test it?

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:03.280
And how can I run a business
successfully?

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.460
And when I talk about that, it's
one thing to come up with

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:08.600
an idea one time, it's another
thing to keep that business

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.870
running over and over.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.320
With the guitar picks, we did
over a million dollars a year

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.140
selling guitar picks.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.480
I never thought in a
million years we'd

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.830
do that much business.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.360
And I'm proud to say it still
exists today on a very, very

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.040
simple idea.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.030
So does anybody have
any questions?

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:27.290
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming and talking.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:28.240
Great, interesting ideas.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.200
You mentioned something casually
at the beginning,

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.585
which is and you checked
with your lawyer--

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.930
so that sounds like one of the
missing ingredients in doing

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:42.080
this is you have your sidekick
lawyer somewhere.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.890
Could you talk a little bit more
about engaging lawyers?

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.960
STEPHEN KEY: Yeah,
I love lawyers--

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.850
sometimes.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:52.940
What I try to do myself, I try
to do as much work myself

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.990
before I get lawyers involved.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:56.240
And it's easy to do now.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.945
I can take in the marketplace,
see if my product,

00:31:58.945 --> 00:32:00.590
see if it's out there.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.790
I file my own provisional
patent applications.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:03.490
It's easy to do.

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:06.240
I don't get lawyers involved
in that either because it's

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.160
just simple to do and there's
some great software.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.145
It's basically you have a
problem, here's a solution.

00:32:11.145 --> 00:32:12.900
So I do that myself.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.800
And even the licensing deals, I
negotiate those myself now.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.240
Because I've done them
a few times, I'm very

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.120
comfortable with it.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.560
But let me tell you where you
need your attorneys in.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.130
If you have a big idea, you're
going to have to look at it

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.590
differently.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.940
Like with the spin label, I knew
right away that in the

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.570
packaging industries, that could
be huge volumes in the

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:34.440
packaging industry.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.550
So I knew I needed a wall.

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:39.330
So I met with
[? Carr &amp; Ferrell ?]

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.310
and I said, look, I've
got a big idea here.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.330
How to protect it.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:45.510
How to keep it away from the
smaller guys, or the guys

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:46.680
coming after me.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.440
And so we built a wall of IP,
those 13 patents, of all the

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.490
different ways of
protecting it--

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:55.790
from trademarks, to copyrights,
to patents.

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:58.470
Now, what's great about that,
I was in federal court

00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:59.640
defending my patents.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.820
A lot of people never get
that great opportunity.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:07.290
But a small little toy company,
I showed them my

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.560
idea, they signed NDAs.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.130
And next thing you know, it was
on a number one hit toy.

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:16.470
And I took that toy company
to court in

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.130
federal courts, San Francisco.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.270
And that toy company was LEGO.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:24.170
And I remember seeing my name
when I went to the court.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.650
It was Stephen Key Design
versus LEGO.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:31.600
And I realized right then and
there, how do you fight LEGO

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.820
when I'm one guy?

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:38.140
But I realized because of
patents, you can play the

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.710
biggest game in the world.

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:43.520
And sure enough, three years
before it went to trial.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.590
Or three years after talking
for three years, two weeks

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.490
before it went to trial
we settled.

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:51.040
So patents are important.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.450
But getting back, why do
you use attorneys?

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.390
When you have big ideas,
you need to talk

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:57.280
about long-term strategy.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.190
Simple ideas, maybe
yes, maybe no.

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:03.150
A lot of companies don't care
about patents with simple

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:06.150
ideas because they come
and go so quick.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:08.500
If you waited for a patent
to issue, you might

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.870
be waiting too long.

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:14.980
So for simple ideas, PPA is
a very powerful tool.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:18.150
But if you've got a big
strategy, talk to someone that

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:21.130
understands IP and how to build
your wall going forward

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:22.010
to keep everybody out.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:23.994
Because when you have
a wall, you know

00:34:23.994 --> 00:34:25.679
what it says to everybody?

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:27.650
This guy is serious.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.249
And it sends that message.

00:34:30.249 --> 00:34:32.100
So that's when I use
my attorneys.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.969
And also, every licensing
agreement that I ever sign, I

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:37.080
always have a licensing attorney
look it over to make

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.070
sure I haven't missed something
along the way.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.505
Because they get very technical
at some point.

00:34:42.505 --> 00:34:43.850
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Stephen.

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:44.480
Quick question.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.679
It looks like you've been
successful both routes, with

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:50.370
licensing and then building
companies, and

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:52.489
running those companies.

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:56.239
What would you say is kind of
your litmus test or your

00:34:56.239 --> 00:35:00.270
thought process for knowing when
to license versus when to

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:02.920
create, build, and
run a company?

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.050
STEPHEN KEY: Great,
great question.

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:06.160
How do you know what path
you want to take?

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.470
It's the same path at
the very beginning.

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.430
You want to, first of all,
do your homework.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:13.070
Test the marketplace.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.080
Study the marketplace.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.530
That means go down to
the store, see if

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:16.860
your product's there.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.620
Do a prior art search.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:23.230
Look at the whole environment
to see.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:24.860
And then ask yourself
a couple questions.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.120
Number one, can my
product be made?

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.430
And a lot of inventors don't
ask that, or entrepreneurs.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:33.580
Can it be made at a price where
everybody makes money?

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.660
Number two, does it
have a wow factor?

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.990
Can I describe it in one
sentence that people go, hey,

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:40.540
I want more?

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:45.760
And also, I like to look at
it, how big is the market?

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.760
So I use those things
to kind of test it.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.060
But at the end of the day,
even if I wanted to

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:54.490
manufacture an idea, I might
try to license it first

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.130
because I want to hear what
other people say.

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:58.230
Even if it's negative, I want
to hear why they're

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:59.900
saying no, no, no.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.840
I want to hear it because I can
adjust it, I can turn it,

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.420
I can change it.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.620
So for me, I just look
at it that way.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:09.340
Some ideas cannot be licensed.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.675
And what I liked about the
guitar pick, it was so simple

00:36:11.675 --> 00:36:14.110
it was like, well, I can put
a million guitar picks

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:14.910
underneath the table.

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:17.490
Why don't we do that?

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:20.040
And what was really fun about
it, it was easy to do and it

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:20.940
was a blast.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.000
It was probably the funnest
thing I've ever done.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.670
And it was just with a
simple guitar pick.

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.935
So that's how I do it.

00:36:28.935 --> 00:36:30.440
You keep on learning
along the way.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.424
And soon enough, you'll see
where you want to take it.

00:36:34.424 --> 00:36:36.030
AUDIENCE: So I have a little
more skepticism.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.080
My dad did this for a few
decades and he sold games and

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.780
toys to Mattel and various
other companies--

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:41.930
reasonable at it.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:44.140
But most people don't do
very well at this.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.190
There's a lot of
people who try.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:50.070
There are a lot of studies
showing that more--

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.070
other than in the pharmaceutical
industry,

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.300
patents cost more to the patent
holders than they

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.470
receive from the patent.

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:59.020
That it's definitely an atypical
story that you have.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.380
So--

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.140
STEPHEN KEY: What's
the reality?

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah, what's
the reality?

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.310
I mean, you take a look at
a company like Google.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:06.010
You want to come talk to us.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:08.450
We're going to make you sign a
contract saying that anything

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:10.770
you say to us is fine,
we can use that.

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.300
A lot of companies do that.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.760
That's why you're scared of
the legal department.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.990
If the legal department gets
involved, almost all big

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.820
companies will throw one of
those contracts at you and not

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.280
want to do this.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.626
I think it's great that you've
done what you've done, but I

00:37:23.626 --> 00:37:25.420
think the reality is it's
not nearly as rosy.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.110
STEPHEN KEY: Well, let's
talk about reality.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.020
And I think that's
a great question.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:31.850
97% of all patents never
make the money it

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:33.730
costs to file them.

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:34.950
97%.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:36.530
That's huge.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:38.440
That's like, who's
making the money?

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.214
The attorneys are making
the money, right?

00:37:40.214 --> 00:37:41.830
AUDIENCE: I own one like
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.420
STEPHEN KEY: I don't like
that number either.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.310
And I always ask why that is.

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:48.330
And I think it's for
a couple reasons.

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.110
Number one, I think people file
patents that shouldn't be

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:54.260
filing patents because they
haven't tested the market yet.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.560
They file patents on ideas.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.800
They don't know if they
can be manufactured.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.750
So I think there needs to be a
little bit more education.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:04.934
But let's talk about it's
a numbers game.

00:38:04.934 --> 00:38:09.310
It's like anything else in life,
if you're-- anything you

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:11.990
do, if you do it a few times,
your chances of success are

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:14.800
never going to be that-- never
going to be great.

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.300
If you look at this and say,
look, I'm a creative person.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.030
I'm going to submit a lot
of ideas to companies.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.540
Your chances of hitting one
are much, much better.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.800
So let me give you an idea of
how many ideas I submit, so

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.550
you really know the nuts
and bolts of it.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:27.230
Because that's very fair.

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:29.680
Ohio Art, when I licensed the
one Michael Jordan to them

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:34.420
sold for 10 years, I probably
submitted 100 to them, too.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:37.380
And they all said, no on
every one of them.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.450
Absolutely.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.120
So it is a numbers game.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:45.170
But what I like to do is that
instead of paying for patents,

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:50.100
file that provisional patent
application, very inexpensive.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.250
Build a relationship with the
company once you start

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:53.650
submitting to them.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:56.760
And they'll begin to know that
you're going to come back next

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.460
week with another one.

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.420
And they'll begin to talk to
you, what are you looking for?

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.970
And that's how you really win.

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:06.150
To license repeatedly, that's
how you do that.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.090
But let me get back
to your last

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:11.020
question, too, about patents.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.290
Yes, there are a lot
of companies.

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:17.610
Maybe this one here, I'm
not sure that is--

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:20.410
you're developing a lot
of ideas everywhere.

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:22.710
So why would you look at someone
from the outside

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:23.980
because you don't know
what he's doing,

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.660
he's doing, he's doing.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.240
And that's very confusing
to big companies.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.120
We want to open our doors,
but we've got to

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.470
protect our own IP.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.430
And how do we know if
we haven't invented

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.250
it before you do?

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.670
And I think what happens, the
way I handle that, I look for

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:40.950
companies that do have an open
innovation policy, number one.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:45.360
And number two, I file my IP.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.120
And what I mean by I file mine,
I don't worry about what

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.560
they've done because I've
already done my homework.

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.490
That's how I protect myself.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.780
And if you want to get into a
really big company, I'll give

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.100
you one more tip and I'll
go to somebody else.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.240
Don't go through
the front door.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.540
There's no way I could
go through the

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.090
front door at Google.

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:03.990
There is no way.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.530
I couldn't do the front
door at Coke.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:06.670
There's no way.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.760
So how do I get through
the front door?

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.980
You go through their
ad agency.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.710
You go to someone that's bigger,
that's almost required

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:16.860
to show them innovation.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.110
Ad agencies are almost required
to show their clients

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:20.730
new innovation.

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:24.110
Because if they didn't and
something happened, it

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:25.970
wouldn't look so great.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:29.300
So I think you have to look at
the culture of the company.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.150
Are they looking?

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:31.870
I think you file your own IP.

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:34.420
And sometimes go in
a different door.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.850
AUDIENCE: Did you find
differences between companies

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:40.550
in the US and outside
of the US?

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:41.280
STEPHEN KEY: Are
they different?

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.470
AUDIENCE: On that Interaction,
yeah.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:45.970
STEPHEN KEY: I haven't found
there's a very big difference.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:49.100
I licensed a few of my
technology to a company in

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.900
Japan called [? Celex, ?]

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.710
where they had the rotating
label on NESCAFE Coffee.

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:57.140
And the conversations were a
little bit different, but it

00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.320
was all about innovation.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.990
It's all about, what
do you have--

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:02.530
show us how to make
more money.

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:04.030
That's the universal language.

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:05.940
How can we sell more?

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.650
And I found it was
fairly easy.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:11.730
A lot of other countries
want more IP.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:15.030
But then again, at the end of
the day, you realize that it's

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:18.470
very expensive to file patents
in other countries as well.

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:21.320
But that gives you a leg up if
you do have some type of IP

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:21.780
protection.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.140
But I think any company, ask
them if they embrace open

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.220
innovation, too.

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.410
And just talk it through.

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.500
Hopefully you'll get someone
that can understand what

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.260
you're trying to do.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:34.730
It's getting larger and
larger and larger.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:38.360
But it's happening here in the
United States in a big way.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.500
AUDIENCE: So how do you
approach ideas?

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:45.030
Do you think about the idea from
a licensee perspective or

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:47.870
do you think from the end
user perspective?

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:51.460
When you think about a problem,
do you start finding

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.650
a problem that companies
will have or problems

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:55.680
that users will have?

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.210
STEPHEN KEY: You do both.

00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:59.850
You can license ideas that if
a company has a problem, you

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:02.280
got a better solution,
absolutely you can.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.510
Show them how to save money,
how to be more efficient.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.390
Yes.

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:08.960
You can also-- there's a lot of
industries, like the hotel

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.300
industry, which is huge that
you license ideas in those

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.220
type of service industries,
hospitality industries.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:19.700
But I like to look at my
ideas are not that--

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:20.860
they're not big ideas.

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:21.660
They're simple ideas.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.950
I try to put a smile on
someone's face is

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:25.095
what I try to do.

00:42:25.095 --> 00:42:26.630
Or find something a little
bit different.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:27.870
But find a problem.

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:29.790
Find a pain point.

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:32.300
I don't care if it's in the
kitchen or with your pet,

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.980
those are two industries
that are on fire.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.780
A kitchen gadget.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.670
People are staying home, so
people are looking for those.

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:42.450
But find the problem, either for
the customer, identify it.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:44.560
Or if it's something that can
help a company be more

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.580
efficient, identify that.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:51.230
But really understand who
is it going to help?

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:55.210
And always gear your sell sheet
to that particular pain.

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:56.930
And the other thing I forgot
to mention, you know what's

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:59.030
better than a sell sheet
I talked about?

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:00.970
A sell sheet is basically when
you're driving down the

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:03.130
freeway, you see this
huge sign, and

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:04.830
you get it that fast.

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:06.100
That's what a sell sheet does.

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.540
But you know what else is
working for everybody?

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.970
Are videos.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:11.360
Are little YouTube videos.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.750
Wow.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:16.780
Make it one minute, show a
problem, show a solution.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.926
That is the tool that's been
really knocking it down for

00:43:19.926 --> 00:43:21.460
everybody these days.

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:24.180
AUDIENCE: Since PPA is only
valued for one year, so how do

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.160
you make the decision to go for
the full patent or just

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.040
leave the idea?

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.580
STEPHEN KEY: That's
a great question.

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.610
Your provisional patent
application only

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:33.630
lasts for one year.

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:36.300
So that seems like a
long time, but it's

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.300
really not that long.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.200
And I know a lot of
people run into--

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.955
after that year and I've shown
it to people, I've got to file

00:43:42.955 --> 00:43:44.070
a regular application.

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:45.670
Or if I come up with some
new embodiments,

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:46.560
I could file again.

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.170
Or I'm going to lose
it, right?

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.200
Do this.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.980
Before you're ready to file,
do your homework first.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.190
Get ready to go.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:57.240
Do your sell sheet, maybe your
prototype, know the companies

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:57.860
you're going to call.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:58.720
Get your hit list together.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.070
So when you file it, boom.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.400
You're ready to take action.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.150
And realize, when you try to
license an idea, call a lot of

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:07.880
companies up.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.510
Spend a week just calling
companies up and send them to

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:12.280
all of the companies
right there.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.650
Get all the balls up in the air
all at one time and see

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:15.800
which ones fall.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.610
And if more than one calls you
back, congratulations.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:22.090
AUDIENCE: So you find a problem,
you have to come up

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:23.090
with a solution.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:26.850
What's your creative
process thinking?

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:31.870
I'm sure you get stuck
many times as we do.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:33.490
And how do you solve that?

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:34.520
STEPHEN KEY: OK.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.275
That's a great question.

00:44:35.275 --> 00:44:38.990
And I think everybody has
their own set of ways of

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:40.560
coming up with solutions.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.700
And I have these games
I play for myself.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.830
And I think a lot of people
that are in the arts play

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:48.990
these games all the time.

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:51.520
So it's really, really
easy for them.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.770
And I think that some of us,
that we don't do this every

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:54.620
day-- it's a little
bit harder.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:57.370
But my wife used to say, Steve,
how can you come up

00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:58.860
with all these ideas?

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.810
I used to tell her it's like
going out in the backyard and

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:01.870
pulling an apple off the tree.

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:03.820
They're there every day.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.460
You need to know how to pluck
them off the tree.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.150
And this is what I do.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:11.870
I always look at changing
materials, the first thing.

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:14.030
What materials can to change?

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:16.890
And I always try to get myself
in a frame of mind that there

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:18.250
are no good answers and bad--

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:20.295
it's just going through a
creative process of turning

00:45:20.295 --> 00:45:21.740
over all the rocks.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:22.210
What's underneath?

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:22.930
What's underneath?

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:24.920
And then I start looking
at it differently.

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.330
I turn it upside down.

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:27.580
I look from different views.

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:28.800
I play games.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.890
One of the games I play is
called mix and match, where I

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:33.550
try to look at an idea
and I try to bring

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:34.880
other things to it.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.660
And what does it do?

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:37.860
How to expand upon an idea.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.460
I might do a thing
called what if.

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:41.280
What if it could do this?

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.800
What if it could do that?

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:43.740
Or solve it.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.510
So I play these little
child games that

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:50.150
allow me to open up.

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.110
And then what I like to
do is I go down to

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:53.865
wherever I am inspired.

00:45:53.865 --> 00:45:57.530
If it's to the movies or to the
mall, or wherever, where

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:58.720
you get this--

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.200
there's a point where
your mind kind of

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.370
relaxes a little bit.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:03.250
Sometimes it's before
bed or in the shower

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:05.150
that these ideas pop.

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.910
That's how I do it.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:07.970
And I don't overwork
my creativity.

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:10.780
What I found now today, I don't
come up with a lot of

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.340
ideas, but I'm always solving
problems with manufacturing

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.090
now or marketing other areas.

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:18.090
So if you learn how to
use these tools,

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:20.060
I think it's endless.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:24.430
But you have to find that
way of playing.

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:25.940
And it seems like you do a lot
of playing here, which I

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:26.720
really do love.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.840
I mean, it's the right
environment.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.620
Absolutely.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.760
That's how I do it, anyway.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:35.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.610
STEPHEN KEY: Thank
you very much.
