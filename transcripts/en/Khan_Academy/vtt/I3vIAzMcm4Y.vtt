00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.059
Let's do another example of
solving a nonhomogeneous

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.170
linear differential equation
with a constant coefficient.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.870
And the left-hand side is going
to be the same one that

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.560
we've been doing.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.980
The second derivative of y
minus 3 times the first

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:22.620
derivative minus 4 times y is
equal to-- and now instead of

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.220
having an exponential function
or a trigonometric functional,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.165
we'll just have a simple--
well, it just looks an x

00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:30.000
squared term, but it's
a polynomial.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.590
Right?

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.200
And you know how to solve the
general solution of the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.170
homogeneous equation
if this were 0.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.440
So we're going to focus just
now on the particular

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.560
solution, then we can later
add that to the general

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.710
solution of a nonhomogeneous
equation, to get the solution.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.410
So what's a good guess for
a particular solution?

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.440
Well, when we had exponentials,
we guessed that

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.730
our solution would be
an exponential.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.200
When we had trigonometric
functions, we guessed that our

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.730
solution would be
trigonomretric.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.230
So since we have a polynomial
here that makes this

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.290
differential equation
nonhomogeneous, let's guess

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.690
that a particular solution
is a polynomial.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.940
And that makes sense.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.430
If you take a second-degree
polynomial, take its

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.620
derivatives and add and
subtract, you should hopefully

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.560
get another second-degree
polynomial.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.650
So let's guess that it is Ax
squared plus Bx plus C.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.550
And what would be a
second derivative?

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.095
Well a second derivative
would be 2Ax plus B.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.030
Sorry, this is the
first derivitive.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.880
The second derivative
would be 2A.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.490
And now we can substitute back
into the original equation.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.080
We get the second derivitive,
2A minus 3 times the first

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.190
derivitive.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.270
So minus 3A-- oh no, sorry.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.290
Minus 3 times this.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:09.360
So minus 6Ax minus 3B minus 4
times the function itself.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:20.610
So minus 4Ax squared
minus 4Bx minus 4C.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.350
That's just 4 times
all of that.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.840
That's going to equal
4x squared.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.010
And I'll just group our x
squared, our x and our

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.230
constant terms, and then we
could try to solve for the

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.230
coeficients.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.910
So let's see.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.210
I have one x squared
term here.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.305
So it's minus 4Ax squared.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.040
And then what are my x terms?

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.910
I have minus 6Ax minus 4Bx.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.750
So then say plus minus
6A minus 4B times x.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.210
I just added the coefficients.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.380
And then finally we get
our constant terms. 2A

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.530
minus 3B minus 4C.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.595
And all of that will
equal 4x squared.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.510
Now how do we solve
for A, B, and C?

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.010
Well, whatever the x squared
coefficients add up on this

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.840
side, it should equal 4.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.590
Whatever the x coefficients add
up on this side, it should

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.690
be equal to 0, right?

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.340
Because you can view this
as plus 0x, right?

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.750
And then you could say plus
0 constant as well.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.840
So the constants should
also add up to 0.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.900
So let's do that.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.210
So first let's do the
x squared term.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.555
So minus 4A should
be equal to 4.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.580
And then that tells us that
A is equal to minus 1.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.870
Fair enough.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.980
Now the x terms. Minus
6A, minus 4B, that

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.880
should be equal to 0.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.180
Right?

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.930
So let's write that down.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.279
We know what A is, so
let's substitute.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:24.790
So minus 6 times A, so minus
6 times minus 1.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:35.270
So that's 6 minus 4B
is equal to 0.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.930
So we get 4B-- I'm just putting
4B on this side and

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.520
then switching.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.180
4B is equal to 6.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.170
And B is equal to-- 6
divided by 4 is 3/2.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.640
And then finally the constant
term should also equal 0, so

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.750
let's solve for those.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.910
2 times A, that's minus 2.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.500
Minus 3 times B.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.570
Well, that's minus
3 times this.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:10.390
So minus 9/2 minus
4C is equal to 0.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.580
So let's see.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.960
I don't want to make
a careless mistake.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:21.320
So this is minus 4
minus 9/2, right?

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.070
That's minus 4/2 minus 9/2-- and
we could take the 4C and

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.260
put it on that side--
it's equal to 4C.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.390
What's minus 4 minus 9?

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:39.940
That's minus 13/2.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.460
Minus 13/2 is equal to 4C.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:51.480
4C, divide both sides by 4, and
then you get C is equal to

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.590
minus 13/8.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.090
And I think I haven't made
a careless mistake.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.050
So if I haven't, then
our particular

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.370
solution, we now know.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.340
Well, let me write the
whole solution.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.990
So.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.910
And this is a nice stretch of
horizontal real estate.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.490
So let's write our solution.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.890
Our solution is going to be
equal to the particular

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.100
solution, which is Ax squared,
so that's minus 1x squared.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:35.030
Ax squared plus Bx plus 3/2x
plus C minus 13/8.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.360
So this is the particular
solution.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.670
We solved for A, B, and C.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.520
We determined the undetermined
coefficient.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.280
And now if we want the general
solution, we add to that the

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.400
general solution of the
homogeneous equation.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.940
What was that? y prime
minus 3y prime minus

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.360
4y is equal to 0.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.280
And we've solved this
multiple times.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.430
We know that the general
solution to the homogeneous

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:08.040
equation is C1e to the 4x plus
C2e to the minus x, right?

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.040
You just take the characteristic
equation r

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.400
squared minus 3r minus 4.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.930
What did you get?

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:20.090
You get r minus 4 times r plus
1, and then that's how you get

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.940
minus 1 and 4.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.810
Anyway.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.880
So if this is the general
solution to the homogeneous

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.350
equation, this a particular
solution to the

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.080
nonhomogeneous equation.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.180
The general solution to the
nonhomogeneous equation is

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.150
going to be the sum
of the two.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.500
So let's add that.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:44.200
So plus C1e to the 4x plus
C2e to the minus x.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.230
So there you.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.720
I don't think that
was too painful.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.680
The most painful part was just
making sure that you don't

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.240
make a careless mistake
with the algebra.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.360
But using a fairly
straightforward, really

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.210
algebraic technique, we were
able to get a fairly fancy

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:03.070
solution to this second order
linear nonhomogeneous

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.090
differential equation with
constant coefficients.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.360
See you in the next video.
