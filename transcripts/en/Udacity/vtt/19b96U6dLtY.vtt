00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.950
Why don't you try operating on our Sochi medal count data in a vectorized way?

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.480
Using pandas, numpy, and the dataframe's apply method, create a new dataframe

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.740
called avg_medal_count that indicates the average number of gold, silver and

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.530
bronze medals that were earned amongst countries who earned at

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.480
least one medal at the 2014 Sochi olympics.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.560
Your code should go here.
