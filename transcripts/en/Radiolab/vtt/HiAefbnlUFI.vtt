00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.500
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, and today not an entire more perfect story,

2
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:07.170
just something that you need to know right now.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.190
The supreme court's about to hear a case that apparently could turn the

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.020
country's legislative maps upside down more perfect. Sean rums from,

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.453
he's going to take it from here.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.980
<v 1>Hello Jad Hello America. So let's start with some context.</v>

7
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:27.981
Republicans controlled a lot of legislatures in 2010 and there was also a census

8
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:29.460
that year,

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.780
which meant that a whole lot of Republicans got to redraw a whole lot of

10
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:38.250
legislative maps, and a lot of those maps benefited Republicans.

11
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.400
Democrats do this too, but today's case,

12
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:46.230
Gill v Whitford is about a republican maneuver, a map in Wisconsin where,

13
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:50.340
for example, in 2012 Democrats got 53% of the vote,

14
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.640
but only 39% of the seats and Republicans made that happen by packing Democrats

15
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.540
into Super Democratic districts where their votes were essentially wasted.

16
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.810
And also by cracking Democrats into mostly Republican districts where their

17
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:08.660
votes were essentially wastage

18
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.260
<v 2>in a move that could have a huge bearing on the future of American politics.</v>

19
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:15.920
The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to take up an explosive case.

20
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.070
Whether lawmakers in Wisconsin's Republican led legislature went too far in 2011

21
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.040
when they redrew the state's electoral map to make it harder for Democrats to

22
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:27.890
win legislative races and we'll makes the Supremes

23
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.680
<v 1>court case all the bigger.</v>

24
00:01:29.681 --> 00:01:32.980
A big deal right now is the timing.

25
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.330
This is the first time in more than a decade that it's going to take up the

26
00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:40.570
question of drawing the lines for partisan gains, and this is Justin Levitt.

27
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.540
He teaches law at Loyola in Los Angeles.

28
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.220
It's going to do that right on the eve of everybody redrawing the lines

29
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.860
everywhere. Local districts, state districts,

30
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:55.861
Congressional districts after the census in 2020 all sorts of different bodies

31
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.790
will redraw all sorts of different lines and this case will help decide how and

32
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:03.050
where and if the court can crack this nut,

33
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.110
it'll be solving one of the biggest and baddest and oldest abuses of power in

34
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:12.050
our democracy. It goes back to before there was an America.

35
00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:15.440
So there were problems with rotten boroughs in England,

36
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.860
which were essentially districts with no people in them that nevertheless

37
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.220
collected representatives in this country in America.

38
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.730
The allegations go in these, these are also contested all the way back.

39
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.300
The allegations are that Patrick Henry tried to Gerrymander James Madison out of

40
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.590
the very first Congress from seats in Virginia because he was so upset with the

41
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:37.424
constitution.

42
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.670
The word itself comes from a in 1812 attempt to change the lines in

43
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:49.310
Massachusetts. It is named after governor of Massachusetts Elbridge Gary.

44
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.160
Um, and if you go to northeastern Massachusetts,

45
00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:54.800
they will tell you passionately that it's called the Gary Mandarin,

46
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.190
not a gerrymander. Um,

47
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.960
that's something that people actually argue about get over.

48
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.330
So the allegations were that that Elbridge Gary created a district that snaked

49
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.890
around the Northern Cape and suburbs essentially. Uh,

50
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.410
it was ridiculed in a political cartoon at the time is looking more like a

51
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:15.520
salamander than a district. Okay. And the Portmanteau was born a Gary Mander.

52
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.010
And since that moment,

53
00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:20.850
we've been living with this unfortunate word and this unfortunate problem.

54
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.020
And it turns out it's a really hard problem to solve love.

55
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.040
It says you can't just hit reset, draw some rectangles and call it a day.

56
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.900
That's not the way people live.

57
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.550
Nobody has ever bought a house because it fit the last perfect spot on the last

58
00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:39.660
perfect square grid and the last perfect development in a square city in a

59
00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:41.160
square county, in a square state.

60
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.890
The way we live is sloppy and messy and organic.

61
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.480
See that's, I find that interesting cause one of the,

62
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:52.660
one of the conversations people have about districts a lot of the times is like,

63
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.240
oh look at this district gets so crazy.

64
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.240
Yeah it's got a little tendril and then it's everywhere and it's over a year.

65
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.590
Right. But the truth is like if you look at like voting rights districts,

66
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.880
they'll do that to try and keep exactly populations together. Right. Totally.

67
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:11.650
I think the best example to look at here is Illinois Fourth Congressional

68
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.870
district. It looks like this weird jaw,

69
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.920
the skeletal jaw trying to like eat lake Michigan and she's like, oh no,

70
00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:19.300
people actually call it the earmuffs.

71
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.790
And I ain't think earmuffs because it's a horizontal.

72
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:23.910
So if you flipped it that way, they look like earmuffs,

73
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.730
like two big chunks connected by basically this string [inaudible] it looks

74
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.560
really tacky. It's running up a highway.

75
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.430
But this was drawn by Democrats to unite.

76
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.390
Too similar, but geographically, you know,

77
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:39.670
apart a Latino district, right.

78
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.960
And to create some sort of cohesive block and it's actually,

79
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.880
if you look at it that way, it's a very good helpful district. Yeah, it gives,

80
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:51.100
it gives that community a voice. Right. So in the end,

81
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:55.420
the question is how do you distinguish between what's giving a community a voice

82
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.020
and what's straight up scandalous cheating.

83
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.950
It all starts with designing districts around real communities that have

84
00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:04.360
something in common with each other.

85
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.740
It turns out that's really hard to do when you're a legislator focused intently

86
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.720
on the next election. And that's why time and time again,

87
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.670
gerrymandering has ended up in front of the Supreme Court of the United States.

88
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.590
The nine justices in DC have to do what congress doesn't really care to.

89
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.660
<v 3>The constitution does not require the Fox to guide the Hanover.</v>

90
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.380
<v 1>This is just a Stevens back in 2004</v>

91
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.490
<v 3>partisan gerrymandering like the English rotten borough enables representatives</v>

92
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:41.860
to choose their constituents rather than vice versa.

93
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.410
It is an invidious undemocratic and unconstitutional practice.

94
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.060
<v 1>The case was VIF versus jubilee or is the last time the supreme court dealt with</v>

95
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:56.890
partisan gerrymandering and Justice Kennedy in Veith versus jubilee or basically

96
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.480
you legal community of America need to solve this for us or we are in big

97
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:03.060
trouble.

98
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.060
<v 4>I don't recall legislators talking about what neutral standards ought to be.</v>

99
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.290
Now we have in our own jurists who talk about conflict do contiguity

100
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.750
geographical compactness,

101
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.410
but I just don't think we have a a large source on which to draw.

102
00:06:19.411 --> 00:06:23.130
We knew about numbers when one person, one vote,

103
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.120
but beyond that it seems to me that we're at sea

104
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.260
<v 1>and the justice is objectively looked at, see,</v>

105
00:06:29.261 --> 00:06:33.280
trying to fix this in veith versus Juba Layer. These are people who love rules.

106
00:06:33.281 --> 00:06:34.180
They love tests,

107
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.480
so they came up with a whole bunch and no one could agree on any of them.

108
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.740
They're looking at the big statewide picture versus the local little picture.

109
00:06:41.741 --> 00:06:45.310
They were using racial standards from the voting rights act and not,

110
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.340
it was like a hot mess of social science and Kennedy could see this and what he

111
00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:55.870
said is sitting in the middle as he often is the most powerful man in the

112
00:06:55.871 --> 00:07:00.280
country and by many stretches the courts should be in this business.

113
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.263
Yes,

114
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.130
but I haven't heard a standard that lets us decide how much is too much yet.

115
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.510
So give me some,

116
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:13.170
it was as public a plea to lawyers to bring cases to help him work through the

117
00:07:14.261 --> 00:07:16.870
appropriate test. As I think anybody has ever seen.

118
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.480
It was sort of like this public challenge,

119
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:24.481
like who out there can solve this and now may finally have a solution.

120
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.740
Allow me to introduce the efficiency gap for me,

121
00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:32.520
the efficiency gap gap for me,

122
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.950
the efficiency gap is essentially this relatively simple math equation for

123
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:40.870
measuring partisan gerrymandering.

124
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.260
The idea is if the justices wants to know,

125
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.890
was this district fairly drawn or are some legislators up to no good?

126
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.940
All they have to do is grab a calculator in a few numbers and Bam,

127
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:53.403
they get their answer.

128
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.700
Two political scientists came up with it and then a bunch of mathematicians

129
00:07:57.701 --> 00:08:01.140
weighed in on it and one of them was professor moon. Do Chin,

130
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:05.350
you can call me moon or professor DJ. She works for Tufts University in Boston.

131
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.310
I do geometry topology group theory and dynamics,

132
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.430
so a little bit of everything across the maths spectrum. Just as a heads up,

133
00:08:12.431 --> 00:08:15.640
what follows does acknowledge the existence of a math spectrum.

134
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.940
Moon coauthored a paper titled a formula goes to court,

135
00:08:18.941 --> 00:08:20.440
which is essentially what's happening here.

136
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.460
The Supreme Court's going to consider whether this efficiency gap formula passes

137
00:08:24.461 --> 00:08:25.294
muster.

138
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:30.330
Is this equation a reasonable standard for measuring partisan gerrymandering and

139
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.410
the efficiency gap formula does that in a couple of different ways.

140
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.610
Most importantly,

141
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.650
by measuring what's called wasted votes and wasted votes, by definition,

142
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:46.980
they are the number of votes that you got minus 50% if you won.

143
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.960
In other words, they're the votes that you wasted while winning.

144
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.140
So if Republicans got 60% in a district,

145
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.090
the wastage would be 10 okay. Okay. So, so if I got 10 votes,

146
00:08:57.091 --> 00:09:02.091
but only five I wasted five or there all the votes if you lost.

147
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.650
So in that same district,

148
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:09.510
the Democrats got 40% and so that was 40% wasted because it didn't go towards

149
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:11.070
electing a democrat. Right. Okay.

150
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:16.071
So wastage for the losing side is basically all of the votes in a race where you

151
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:18.600
lost. Yeah. That's how wastage works.

152
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.240
And then the efficiency gap is quite simply,

153
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.230
you take all the wasted votes for a across the entire state,

154
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.120
all the wasted votes for B,

155
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.990
and you take the difference as a proportion of the total turnout. That's it.

156
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.110
That's it. That's the efficiency. Yeah. It's just like subtraction. That's it.

157
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.680
It's party A's, wasted votes minus party B's,

158
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:41.820
wasted votes divided by the total number of people who voted.

159
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.120
That gives you a number that measures gerrymandering.

160
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.990
It's it's addition and subtraction with a smattering of division.

161
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.160
It is so not scary.

162
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:55.710
So Republican wasted votes minus Democrat wasted votes divided by the total

163
00:09:57.191 --> 00:10:00.750
number of overall votes. Yep. That's, that's the efficiency gap.

164
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.650
That's what we're trying to measure here. Yeah.

165
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.710
Why would that work as a measuring of gerrymandering?

166
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.470
So let's take a look at purple state like Wisconsin,

167
00:10:08.471 --> 00:10:12.160
where you know you have Democrats winning and you have Republicans winning and

168
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.120
they're both wasting votes. They're both winning elections, losing elections,

169
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.640
and in each and every one of those races,

170
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.830
they're wasting votes because of a wasted vote.

171
00:10:20.831 --> 00:10:24.220
Is anything over 50 if you won,

172
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.940
if 50% and anything you lost if you lost, right?

173
00:10:27.941 --> 00:10:29.920
So wastage is happening across the board,

174
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.080
but theoretically it's happening on both sides.

175
00:10:32.081 --> 00:10:35.200
So all of the wasted you should be canceling out in Wisconsin,

176
00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:38.740
we have this picture where Democrats won 53% of the vote,

177
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.890
but only one 39% of the seats.

178
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.100
So Democrats were wasting a lot more than Republicans. Tons more.

179
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.340
And that might mean that there's sort of this pattern of wasted votes across the

180
00:10:50.561 --> 00:10:55.180
entire state. The entire map might've been drawn to favor one side. Oh.

181
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.080
So is that like if you plug in the numbers in the equation, you,

182
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.010
if you get a big number that means lots of wasted,

183
00:11:00.011 --> 00:11:01.720
you get a little number that means zero. Is that,

184
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.720
is that essentially it or is it something like that? Nailed it. Really? Yeah.

185
00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:10.110
Oh yeah. That's cool. Yeah. So it literally is like two, two,

186
00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:12.730
two, two, two, two, two poop. Oh, wasted. You know what I mean? It's like,

187
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.070
is it like that? Yeah, but there's actually a way that we don't need the two to,

188
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.240
to the moon's got an even easier way to understand this efficiency.

189
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.520
Get a shortcut or you can tell me what it is.

190
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.200
Do you want to know what is right now? No. After the break, after the break

Dakota live walks Nashville Wyman theater Friday,

194

March 16th and I'm bringing the best windows in the world last Friday,

195
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.000
laugh some more amazing night out. And yes, she's coming.

196

lady forest, Jen POBA rocks a brand new story.

198
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.090
Get tickets at snap judgment. That Org.

199
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.670
I've never gotten applause for it before. If you guys could call my mom,

200
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:17.440
that'd be awesome. She's still passed.

201
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.700
<v 7>This is more perfect. M Jam. And we're out here with Sean Ramez from a,</v>

202
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.880
we're talking about the ancient problem of gerrymandering and how um,

203
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:33.510
a solution may be about to fly into the supreme court on the gleaming wings of

204
00:12:33.511 --> 00:12:36.120
math. You mentioned that there was a, there was a short, short

205
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.150
<v 1>yeah. Yeah. You know,</v>

206
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.610
if you don't like the math that we were doing a little bit deficiencies gap. Um,

207
00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.220
professor do chin gave me this,

208
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.120
this sort of handy work around that'll probably make it a lot easier, um,

209
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.860
to understand the whole wasted vote thing. Cool.

210
00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.610
It just involves comparing how many votes you got in a race to how many seats he

211
00:12:52.611 --> 00:12:54.140
got in that same race.

212
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:59.000
<v 7>All you have to do is take your vote margin and double it.</v>

213
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.970
Efficiency gap tells you that should be your seat margin.

214
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.150
So you got 53% of the votes, let's say.

215
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.380
So that's a margin of 3% over halfway. Double it.

216
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.920
You should get 56% of the seats. Huh? If you get,

217
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.570
try this with me now you get 60% of the votes, so how many seats should you get?

218
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.060
<v 1>Okay, so I got 60% of the vote. I need 50% to win,</v>

219
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.980
so I to subtract that off, I got 10% left and doubled.

220
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:32.130
That's 20% and then I add back the original 50% I won and that

221
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.190
<v 7>70% of the seats, you got it. But why not?</v>

222
00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:41.150
Just why not just 60% why did I double it? So that's an excellent question.

223
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:45.830
And what these guys have a kind of complicated answer to that.

224
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.790
Although it's interesting, they say, well, if you look at elections,

225
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.780
doubling the margin is what actually tends to happen. They claim

226
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.960
<v 1>these guys, professor do Chin Means Stephanopoulos and muggy.</v>

227
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.090
The dudes who came up with the efficiency gap,

228
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.920
what they say is when you look at elections across the country and compare how

229
00:14:04.921 --> 00:14:05.940
many votes the winning right?

230
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.720
<v 7>It gets to how many seats the winning party gets.</v>

231
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:13.640
The winners tend to get some extra seats. This idea is called a seat bonus.

232
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.440
The idea that if you win by a little,

233
00:14:15.441 --> 00:14:19.190
you should get a cushion in your governing majority. So it's like what?

234
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.470
Our system is kind of funky. Let's, let's roll with it.

235
00:14:21.471 --> 00:14:25.460
And here we baked the funk into the, into the formula we baked in the funk.

236
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:30.200
I love it. That should be the subtitle. His genius of branding, right?

237
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.350
So they're taking something descriptive. This is what actually happens.

238
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.260
And then they're turning it around and something normative,

239
00:14:36.261 --> 00:14:39.980
which says this is what should happen. Huh? So, well, let's look at,

240
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:40.910
let's look at Wisconsin.

241
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:45.230
The court said that Jerry Mandarin quote did in fact prevent Wisconsin Democrats

242
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:49.880
from being able to translate their votes into seats as effectively as Wisconsin

243
00:14:49.881 --> 00:14:52.040
Republicans. So it was constant.

244
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.750
In 2008 dems get 57% of the vote.

245
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.050
So what percent of seats should they get?

246
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.110
This is according to the math we just did. Yep, you can do it. Okay. 57 ditch.

247
00:15:04.111 --> 00:15:09.111
The 50 I got seven times two is 14 plus the original 50 a what?

248
00:15:09.981 --> 00:15:12.920
Six 64% of the seats. You got it. Exactly. God,

249
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.880
I'm just so nervous now that I'll get it wrong. I have this effect on people.

250
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.460
Okay,

251
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:23.460
well instead in 2008 they get 52% and so that suggests that viewed through the

252
00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:28.490
lens of efficiency gap, things are stacked against them by quite a bit. Okay?

253
00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.350
Right? And so that's how this works.

254
00:15:30.351 --> 00:15:34.910
It becomes only a way to compare your vote margin to your seat margin.

255
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.450
Now, Moon's feeling about all of this, the efficiency gap, the shortcut,

256
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.470
it's a good start, but it's just the start. I, you know,

257
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:46.640
I really respect the effort to take something so complicated and boil it down

258
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:47.451
into a single number,

259
00:15:47.451 --> 00:15:52.451
but it fundamentally can't be done that simply because people are way more

260
00:15:53.331 --> 00:15:57.560
complicated than just one number. We are, we are geography,

261
00:15:57.561 --> 00:16:00.560
we are history or race. We're so many things.

262
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.440
You're going to need a few different metrics at once.

263
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.400
And the fear is that that's what the court's been allergic to is if you have

264
00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:08.300
several different metrics,

265
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:11.060
how do you combine them and how do you decide when enough is enough?

266
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.530
By good fortune. We're now finally in a position, you know,

267
00:16:15.531 --> 00:16:20.000
it's been a long time that partisan gerrymandering keeps being like the can

268
00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:21.740
keeps being kicked down the road by the court.

269
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:26.600
Good news is they may have sort of postponed and delayed just long enough that

270
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:28.670
now we have some really good alternatives.

271
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.410
So one of the most promising things that's coming down the pike is the use of

272
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:37.160
computers for people dreamed of this for decades,

273
00:16:37.161 --> 00:16:42.161
but computing power just hasn't been nearly ready to contend with the big data

274
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:45.320
of the redistricting problem.

275
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:50.680
That's because we're doing some phenomenally complicated common rhetoric's.

276
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.330
We've got this coming to torics. That's what matters.

277
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.720
That's what mathematicians call the art of counting. Oh,

278
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.830
the supreme court isn't quite at Kombucha torics but if Justice Kennedy likes

279
00:17:03.831 --> 00:17:04.850
the efficiency gap,

280
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:09.620
the court's decision could dramatically change the way states draw lines.

281
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.620
And if the court can embrace this standard moons,

282
00:17:12.621 --> 00:17:14.750
hoping it will go for others down the road,

283
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:20.200
ones that more fully consider all the kinds of connections that make up a

284
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:21.320
community.

285
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:26.320
And there are just phenomenally many ways to break down millions of people into

286
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.310
dozens of districts. If you just enumerate all the possibilities,

287
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.550
that's the biggest data you're going to find bigger than medical problems,

288
00:17:34.551 --> 00:17:35.960
bigger than astronomical problems.

289
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:40.370
So asking a computer to really understand all the possibilities has been out of

290
00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:41.090
reach.

291
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:46.010
But what's happened recently is both computing power and the algorithms used to

292
00:17:46.011 --> 00:17:49.440
study this have been getting better and better. And um,

293
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.410
folks have understood how to constrain that search space more.

294
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.450
So what we're moving towards is a time when we'll be able to cut down the space

295
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:59.940
of possibilities that you have to search. And at the same time,

296
00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:02.610
computers will be getting more powerful until those meet in the middle.

297
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.980
And computers can really see all the possibilities.

298
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.990
So when we're saying these numbers are,

299
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:09.660
are too big for mathematicians to even wrap their heads around,

300
00:18:09.661 --> 00:18:14.490
we need computers. Oh no other way around. Mathematicians are very comfortable.

301
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.170
Why are you even comfortable with infinity?

302
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.900
It's the computers that have had to catch up. Oh, sorry. Okay.

303
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.390
So when we're saying the computers need to catch us, right,

304
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.270
how do we expect nine Supreme Court justices to get it right?

305
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.440
Well now here's the thing, right?

306
00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:30.441
So what happens when computers can really explore the space of possibilities is

307
00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:34.920
that they can build a bell curve of the properties of all the different maps.

308
00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.600
So computers are going to do it for us.

309
00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.390
Create maps upon maps upon maps.

310
00:18:40.391 --> 00:18:44.110
That together will give us an idea of what a district should look like.

311
00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.550
And then you'll look at Wisconsin's actual plans the legislature enacted and

312
00:18:48.551 --> 00:18:50.500
you'll see where it falls on the bell curve.

313
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.640
Is it in the nice meaty part in the middle or is it an outlier that's just out

314
00:18:54.641 --> 00:18:56.230
along the tail of the bell curve?

315
00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:01.450
That's pretty persuasive and that's a kind of outlier analysis that should be

316
00:19:01.451 --> 00:19:05.140
pretty comfortable for courts because they do this all the time for other kinds

317
00:19:05.141 --> 00:19:09.850
of, um, legal standards. What does a perfect district look like?

318
00:19:09.851 --> 00:19:12.430
What is something that is just that anyone,

319
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.480
regardless of political ideology could look at and say, Oh yeah, that's fair.

320
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.190
Yeah, good question. I mean,

321
00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:23.191
so it's fun to do the roar shack blot version of detecting gerrymanders where

322
00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:24.940
you, you know, in fact,

323
00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:29.560
one of the things that my group is working on is like a swipe left swipe right

324
00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.590
app for voting districts. You're going to see a district,

325
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.680
a little bit of information decide if you think it looks hot or not.

326
00:19:35.681 --> 00:19:37.870
That's hilarious. That's great. So you have that,

327
00:19:37.871 --> 00:19:41.890
can I play a coming up coming right here for congressional districts? Exactly.

328
00:19:41.891 --> 00:19:45.430
We're calling it gerrymander without the e. You got it.

329
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.490
Great. So I mean that's always going to be fun, but um,

330
00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.890
just that contour isn't always showing you what's really going on.

331
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.240
It's not just the outline, it's also where the people are and how they're split,

332
00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:58.690
right?

333
00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:02.890
It's the guts of the district and not just as a boundary that's got a lot of

334
00:20:02.891 --> 00:20:05.830
information about its legitimacy. Um, so we're,

335
00:20:05.831 --> 00:20:10.831
we're trying to throw a lot of 20th and even 21st century math at the district

336
00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:14.170
rendered as a graph or a network and we think that's gonna produce some new

337
00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:15.820
insights before that happens.

338
00:20:15.821 --> 00:20:18.820
Does the Supreme Court have to say in this Gilby Whitford case, hey,

339
00:20:18.821 --> 00:20:22.870
partisan gerrymandering is wicked unconstitutional. Well,

340
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.590
the court has already told us that partisan gerrymandering is,

341
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.970
is just equitable that they can,

342
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.600
they can throw out plans as partisan gerrymanders they just don't know how yet.

343
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:32.703
Huh. Right.

344
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:37.920
And so this case came up with efficiency gap as it's centerpiece in the future.

345
00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:43.630
Cases may come up with outlier analysis as their centerpieces that they're going

346
00:20:43.631 --> 00:20:46.090
to be more than one bite at this apple.

347
00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.640
I regard efficiency gap as a great step towards convincing courts not to be

348
00:20:51.641 --> 00:20:55.480
scared of adjudicating partisan gerrymanders. It's a,

349
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.640
it's a really good opening salvo. Great.

350
00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.620
Well thank you so much for all your time.

351
00:20:59.621 --> 00:21:04.621
I can't wait to download gerrymander and meet my next favorite district.

352
00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.690
Right? That's right. Great, great talk
