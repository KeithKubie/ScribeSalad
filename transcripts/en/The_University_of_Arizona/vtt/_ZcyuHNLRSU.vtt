[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.460
Good evening.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.533
Welcome to the second lecture
of the College of Science.

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.497
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:36.920
I'm not sure how many
of you are repeats.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.420
But I got dressed up for you.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.790
I want to thank the underwriters
of this lecture series.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.450
Again, let me just mention their
names because it is important

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.090
that we all recognize
that they're

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.220
supporting all of
us being in here,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.640
watching these great lectures,
the Arizona Center on Aging,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.990
"Arizona Daily Star," Cox
Communications, Galileo Circle,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.540
Godat Design, Bob Davis of
Innovation Park, Raytheon,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.550
Research Corporation, Sanofi
US, The Marshall Foundation,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.920
UniSource Energy, and
Ventana Medical Systems.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.636
Please help me thank them.

00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:18.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.582
And before I introduce
the speaker tonight,

00:01:26.582 --> 00:01:28.710
I was coming down the road.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.200
And they were
interviewing Woody Allen

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.429
because he has a new movie.

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:33.720
And they were interviewing him.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.140
And all of you remember
that all of his movies

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.560
are full of angst, and
death, and worries.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.480
So they asked him what
he thought about death?

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.550
And he says, I'm
still against it.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.120
That's pretty-- But today,
it's not about that at all.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.210
It's not about
against it or not.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.095
It's how to get
there gracefully.

00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:56.220
Now, let me introduce then
our speaker, who's going

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.980
to be telling us about that.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.640
Janko Nikolich-Zugich is a noted
expert on the immune system

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.740
and age-related disorders.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.530
He's a department head of
immunology and co-director

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.039
of the Arizona Center on Aging
at the University of Arizona,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.690
where he leads the biology
of aging research program,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.360
collaborating with others to
address diseases and conditions

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.270
such as obesity,
inflammation, osteoporosis,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.230
infectious diseases, diabetes,
cancer, and dementias.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.400
Originally from Belgrade, Janko
received his medical master's

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.430
and doctoral degrees from
Belgrade University Medical

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.270
School.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.000
He did his post-doctoral
training at the Scripps Clinic

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.520
and Research Foundation
and started his career

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.520
at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center and the Cornell

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.270
University Medical College.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.322
Before joining the
UofA, Janko was

00:02:45.322 --> 00:02:46.780
professor at the
School of Medicine

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.930
at Oregon Health
Sciences University,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.180
where he realized that our
basketball team, as well as

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.929
our medical school, was better.

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:55.336
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.930
And he was a senior scientist
of the OHSU Vaccine and Gene

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.280
Therapy Institute.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.600
Please help me welcome
our distinguished speaker.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.540
So thank you Joaquin for
a wonderful introduction.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.010
And thank you all for coming.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.150
And I would first like
to thank our sponsors who

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.640
make this possible.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.330
And without you, of
course, we couldn't

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.600
do that, and particularly
the Galileo Circle.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.930
So we're going to talk about
some fun things tonight.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.820
And I would first like
to thank more people that

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.180
made my specific
presentation possible.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.690
So in no particular order
here, but with all of them

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.740
being really close to
my heart and really

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.390
being very helpful
in this case, I

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.840
would first like to acknowledge
Mindy Fain, my co-director

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.120
in the Center on Aging
and a great collaborator

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.980
and colleague, who
helped me formulate

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.230
some of the ideas
for the presentation.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.760
Ken and Carl did a wonderful
job at putting some of the ideas

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.060
into wonderful graphics.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.280
Jen Uhrlaub, who's my
laboratory manager,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.990
also provided a bunch of photos.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.760
My entire lab, great
to have you guys.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.320
Many of you are here.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.000
And then very much
major, major thanks

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.610
to Rich Miller, a prominent
gerontologist at the University

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.190
of Michigan, who provided
me with a number of slides,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.160
as well as ideas for
the presentation.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.760
And finally, and
certainly last, but not

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.300
least, my incredible
family, my great wife

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.430
Dragana-- thank you, honey--
and my children, Tijana, Mina,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.230
and Stefan.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.380
And I have to acknowledge
also our funders, the National

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.440
Institute on Aging and
other NIH Institutes,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.170
as well as the SENS Found, the
Bowman Trust, and the Hudson

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.820
Family Trust.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.660
So really, the real
title of today's talk

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.670
is "Why Do Our Bodies Grow Old?"

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.960
But more importantly,
what can we do about it?

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.340
So I would like to start it
with a question to all of you.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.310
You have two choices.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.070
You can pick to have a
slow and gradual decay,

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.230
or decline actually,
in function.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.330
Not decay, we hate that word.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.630
It somehow gets into our
vocabulary from physics.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.960
And we really don't like it.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.680
Decline in function
over time as you age.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.879
Or you could have it be very
sudden and precipitous, meaning

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:41.420
that it's maintained
for a long time.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.640
And then it kind of,
like, just crashes down.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.230
So I'd like to see a
show of hands here.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.425
How many would like the
first part, long and slow?

00:05:51.425 --> 00:05:52.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.574
And how many would like the
maintain and then crash?

00:05:57.574 --> 00:05:59.470
Awesome!

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.020
Because that's really what
we're going to be talking about.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.350
So I would like to
make two points really.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.850
The first one is that I
will give you a promise.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.200
And the promise is not from me.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.050
It's really from the
biology of aging science.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.070
And that is that we can
change the face of aging.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.190
And the idea would be to
get most people to live

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.500
to be about 112 years old.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.950
But more importantly, to be
healthy for the first 111

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.540
years of that.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.935
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.480
And second is that if
we already do that,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.690
we really can't do
business as usual.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.390
We can't think the way that
we have been thinking so far.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.460
We really have to
invest in the prevention

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.110
of age-related disability
in the whole body and mind.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.860
We can't be really attacking
this whole story one disease

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.820
after another.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.810
It doesn't work.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.870
And I'll tell you why.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.010
So what are we trying to do?

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.260
When we say that we want to
change the face of aging,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.770
what are we looking for?

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.770
Well, we're not looking
to abrogate aging.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.250
We're not looking
to erase aging.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.420
We're not looking
to eradicate it.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.280
We're not looking to
prolong the suffering.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.550
If we gain another three
decades of life or more,

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.470
we really don't want
them to be miserable.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.150
We want him to be vibrant.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.060
We want them to be vital
and the quality of life

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.590
is supposed to be high.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.300
So here you're
seeing the projection

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.440
of how currently the
function, the quality of life,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.490
declines over time.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.420
And this is what we're
really looking to do.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.430
So we are really trying to get
to this vigorous and vibrant

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.802
life span and compress
disability as we go along.

00:07:40.802 --> 00:07:42.510
And I'll tell you the
reasons why I think

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.140
this is completely possible.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.900
So when we talk about
quality of life,

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.790
we talk about different things.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.340
And so these are some of
the important components

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.827
of the quality of life.

00:07:53.827 --> 00:07:55.910
This is really the
health-related quality of life.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.480
But it contains components
of social activities,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.450
and interpersonal relationships,
and sexuality, mental health,

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:06.530
and satisfaction with care,
a lot of other things.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.530
But when you think
about aging in terms

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.070
of how it impacts our
tissues, and our bodies,

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.680
and our cells, most
people when they

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.070
think about functional aging,
envision this kind of a line.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.490
So there is a decline over time.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.840
As the years go by,
the functions go down.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.520
And that is, of course,
correct in part.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.810
But the part that gets
lost really too often

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.950
is the other line.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.500
And that other line goes
in the other direction.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.490
And that line talks really about
experience, and about wisdom,

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.100
and about everything
that people accumulate

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.179
as they grow old, which is
very good and very important.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:47.760
And so I would like to ask you
to think about older adults,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.795
first and foremost, as
a societal resource.

00:08:52.489 --> 00:08:54.530
And as we go along, I
would like to tell you more

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.800
about the biology of aging.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.570
So the biology of aging
deals with these fundamental

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.400
processes as they go
along in our bodies.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.510
And so when you think
about how we are conceived,

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.240
we start from
really a tiny cell.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.600
And this process of development
is very highly ordered, very

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.590
highly structured.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:17.300
It basically takes that cell
through an intermediate stage

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.770
of these children, to come to
something that looks like this.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.620
If they're not really a
fully mature adult form,

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.300
they're getting close to that.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.520
And it's a highly
ordered process.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.150
If something goes wrong, there
is a terrible price to pay.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.910
The genes are all
precisely orchestrated.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.920
They do things in concert.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.510
And all of that is
very, very precise.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.940
Unlike that, aging
is really what

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.810
happens when the rules weaken
and sometimes even expire.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:50.270
So the processes are no longer
quite as tightly correlated.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.940
It's not a symphony anymore.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.820
There is a little bit of this
instrument or that instrument,

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.670
kind of like being a
little bit out of tune.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.440
Why do we age at all, in fact?

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.830
So the reason is that
we have some genes that

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.300
do great things early.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.330
But they can do
bad things later.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.220
So genes that are involved in
proliferation and cell division

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.570
are really important
when we grow.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.960
But as we grow older,
they are the ones that

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.860
very often can give us cancer.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.340
There are other genes that
don't do great things.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.630
But we control them very well.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:26.140
And sometimes they get out
of check as we grow older.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.640
So what are then
the basic questions

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.230
about the aging process?

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.050
Well, the first one
is, is there a plan?

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.530
Is there a master
plan for aging?

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.340
And the answer is
probably there isn't.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.500
And guys, I'm going to
give you a sneak preview

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.390
into the answers as we go along.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.160
The second question
is, is there a clock

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.480
that allows this to run and
then start at a given time?

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.890
And I think the answer is
that maybe there is a clock?

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.380
What is the clock,
we can discuss later.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.560
And finally, the question
is how does aging

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.170
produce signs and
symptoms of aging,

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.465
that which we
recognize as being old?

00:11:00.465 --> 00:11:02.090
And so we'll go
through these questions

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.660
and try to understand them.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.450
But I would like
to first give you

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.870
a couple of important
and key facts.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.650
So most organisms age in
a very similar manner.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.630
And if you only look at
mammals, for instance,

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.690
they all age in a
very similar manner.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.130
The difference is that they
take different times to age.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.870
So some take 70 years.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.340
Some take about
two to three years.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.230
And that differential
is about 30-fold.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.070
So it's quite amazing.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.950
So understanding
why that happens

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.140
at certain rates
in certain species

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.960
is quite important in
order to understand aging.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.030
Well, the other and
the more important fact

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.340
here is that there
is this intervention

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:44.520
that you heard Shane Burgess
mention in the last lecture.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.460
It's called caloric restriction.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.510
It's really a 33% reduction
in calorie intake.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.060
You don't stop eating
anything else less,

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.440
other than the calories.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.000
So your vitamins are 100%.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.450
Your minerals are 100%.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.680
It's the net calories that
are reduced by about a third.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.110
And as a consequence,
this intervention

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.950
has been shown more
than 80 years ago now,

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:10.670
to produce a 40% extension
in the lifespan in laboratory

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.889
animals of different kinds.

00:12:13.889 --> 00:12:15.680
What's more important
is that these animals

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.970
are really healthy.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.340
They run a lot, as
you have seen here.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.800
And more importantly, they
run a lot, almost three miles

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.010
a day, at a time where
most of their littermates

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:29.910
that have been kept on an
ordinary diet are long dead.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.760
They are devoid of most
of the signs of aging,

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.170
most of the diseases of aging.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.770
They don't get nearly
as many cancers.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.590
Their cardiovascular
system looks great.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.449
They've got a great heart, great
arteries, and so on, and so on.

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:46.240
And the other important
point is that there

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.560
is at least 10 different
gene mutants that

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.030
also live extended lifespans.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.810
And that are also blessed
with increased quality

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.550
of life at the same time.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.380
And those are all
probably working

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.990
through the same
basic mechanism.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.010
So what does that really mean?

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:04.810
Well, it means pure magic.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.559
I mean in science,
if you're really

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:08.100
trying to discover
something, and you

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.320
discover something like
this-- and, of course,

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.360
I didn't discover this.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.730
I mean there's been people,
many, many generations

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.270
before me.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.450
And my generation of scientists
have gotten the first insight

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:19.080
into this.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.520
This is the wow moment.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.230
This is the intervention that
does universally this fantastic

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.130
thing.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:31.900
And it does it throughout
the animal kingdom.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.310
So one simple intervention
and the same genes that lie

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:37.240
downstream of that.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.060
Particularly, the
insulin genes that

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.040
regulate the insulin pathway.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.500
Which is really the pathway
that kind of, like, tells you,

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.370
did you eat enough?

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.360
Did you not eat enough?

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.130
Are you supposed to
recycle yourself?

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.780
Are you supposed
to go and divide?

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.920
How do you regulate
all of these things?

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.220
So all of these genes, the
insulin growth receptor

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.940
pathway, control the
aging and function

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.360
in the same manner in
some very distant cousins,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.250
starting from the worm,
to the fly, to the mouse,

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.250
and maybe even to us.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.260
We really don't
know about that yet.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.170
But there are ongoing studies
that are quite interesting.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:19.510
So if you think about this
and what does that mean,

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:23.200
it's very important in
terms of our frame of mind.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.469
How do we think about aging?

00:14:24.469 --> 00:14:26.010
And what are those
theories of aging?

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.710
You have heard probably
many theories of aging.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.557
I know that there's more than
30 theories of aging, which

00:14:31.557 --> 00:14:33.390
means that we don't
have any idea what we're

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.484
talking about or close to it.

00:14:35.484 --> 00:14:36.900
Now, it's not
really entirely true

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.570
that we don't know what
we're talking about.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.150
But it is true that there's
many theories of aging.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.100
And in order to assess
them and to understand

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.600
which might be wrong
and which might

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.580
be right or partially
right, you need

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.450
to know what each theory
of aging needs to answer.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.420
And one question like that
is why do organisms get less

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.610
resilient as they get older?

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:58.650
And the question that
I've already asked you,

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:03.630
why some members of one species
take about 70 years to complete

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:06.630
that process, whereas others
from a related species

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.370
take only two or three?

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:13.110
And yet another one is, why do
all tissues and cells kind of

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.930
start to decline
around the same time?

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.750
Why do they start to age
around the same time?

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.680
And finally, why is it that
these unifying interventions

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.730
and gene mutations are all
being able to affect aging

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.680
in very different animals?

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.800
So let's talk about some
of the theories of aging

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.841
that you must have heard.

00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:35.400
I'm going to really
avoid about 25% of them

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.410
and talk maybe
about three or four.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.152
You've heard about the oxidative
stress theory of aging.

00:15:40.152 --> 00:15:42.360
And that one basically says
that if you have too much

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.060
unregulated oxygen in
your cells or tissues,

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.240
that oxygen will start binding
to your molecules at random.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.140
It will disable.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.015
Then they won't be able
to function as well.

00:15:51.015 --> 00:15:53.790
A similar theory
about glycation.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.650
You have too many sugars that
are important in the cell.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.950
They're not regulated
properly metabolically.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:00.820
They can glycate
other molecules.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.142
And again, those molecules
will not function very well.

00:16:04.142 --> 00:16:05.600
Well, there is
another one that was

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.630
formulated in the '60s by this
guy called Leonard Hayflick.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.830
And Hayflick discovered that
if he put some human cells

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.430
in the tissue culture, that
they will divide 30, 40, 50

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.320
times and then they would stop.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.150
And they will not
divide anymore.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.780
And so that is
when he postulated

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.230
that this is just the exhaustion
of the dividing cells.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.450
They just can't
divide any further.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.330
And that theory got
another alternative

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:30.879
when the telomeres
were discovered.

00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:32.420
And you've heard
about the telomeres.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.000
These are those little ends
of the chromosomes that

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.310
ensure that the chromosomes
don't bind to one another

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.477
and cause cancer
and stuff like that.

00:16:39.477 --> 00:16:41.810
And so the problem with the
telomeres is that every time

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.730
that the cell
divides, the telomere

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.180
gets shortened by a little bit.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.100
And so you can imagine that if
you keep dividing and dividing,

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.530
you're going to exhaust your
telomeres, at which point

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.290
the cell is either going to die
or is going to sort of, like,

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.570
freeze and become an old cell.

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.310
And that is what
that theory says.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.650
That because of your
short telomeres,

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.780
you actually end up
with senescent cells.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.440
So let's examine that
particular theory.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.010
We could examine any of
them along the lines.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.900
So this one says that
shorter telomeres

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.609
will make cells stop growing.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:15.079
And they will become senescent.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:17.130
And they will
accumulate in your body.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.490
And when you get to
chock-full of these old cells,

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.140
you will be old.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.339
Pretty simple.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.640
So one problem is that
we have some cells that

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.290
divide like crazy.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.480
And they don't seem to
run out of telomeres.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:34.610
So stem cells in our gut, that
renew the lining of our guts,

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.730
can divide in a mouse more
times than a mouse can live.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.130
So that's obviously
not a limiting factor.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.920
There's another problem that
most short-lived animals,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.360
in fact, have very
long telomeres.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.456
Mice have about three times
longer telomeres than we do.

00:17:48.456 --> 00:17:50.205
So that kind of, like,
tells you something

00:17:50.205 --> 00:17:52.470
is wrong with that picture.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.420
Well, so the other problem is
that cells that don't divide,

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.980
such as our neurons, also age.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.560
And it's obvious you don't need
to divide in order to grow old.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.600
So what's going on there?

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.329
And finally, if you really
were to fill up with old cells,

00:18:07.329 --> 00:18:09.870
you should be able to measure
that sort of, like, filling up.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:12.210
It's sort of like the
gas tank and the pump.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.950
And if you're getting
too many of them,

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.280
you're going to have to stop.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.540
And our efforts to
identify those old cells

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.640
have been really not successful.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.010
We haven't been able
to mark the cells

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.720
and say, well,
obviously this person

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.550
has many more old
cells than that person

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.340
and therefore he
or she is older.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.400
So this is actually really
an interesting theory.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.230
Telomeres are very
important in biology.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.896
They're critically
important for cancer.

00:18:35.896 --> 00:18:38.640
They're probably really not
important for aging at all.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.665
Just an idea how
something that's popular,

00:18:40.665 --> 00:18:43.320
and that you will find
all over the press,

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.670
is really not quite making
sense and not quite cutting

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.170
the mustard for
what we're looking

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.230
for when we talk about
the unifying problems

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.790
and issues of aging.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.330
Well, we've made some progress.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:57.804
And there is one theory
that makes more sense

00:18:57.804 --> 00:18:58.470
than the others.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.902
And it's centered around
metabolism and stress

00:19:00.902 --> 00:19:01.485
in particular.

00:19:01.485 --> 00:19:03.130
And it's reasonably simple.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.810
It says that at some point,
nutrients and energy are not

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.060
being sensed the way
that they should be.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.880
And we think that we have
plenty of everything.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.880
And we don't think
to recycle ourselves.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.920
And, therefore,
we kind of, like,

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.760
do the wrong things
with this energy.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.150
And so when you
take that further,

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.770
it basically says
that this disbalance

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.740
leads to reduced resistance
to different forms of stress

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.930
or damage.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.940
And so to simplify
that further, it's

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.600
basically paraphrased by saying
that if you or your cells

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.240
can deal with damage,
you will age well.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.980
You remember that
Shane Burgess told you

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.230
about this longitudinal
study, where

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.540
they looked at people
that lived long lives,

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.650
into their hundreds.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.480
And the only thing
that correlated

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.000
with their long lives
was their ability

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.550
to set aside stress in a way.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.310
To take the stress
and say, like,

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:57.150
I have lived through something
bad and I'm letting it go now.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.766
And I don't care
about it anymore.

00:19:59.766 --> 00:20:01.140
So in the same
way, you can think

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.590
about the cells being
able to say, OK,

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.300
so I've been hit with
this burst of oxygen.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.780
I have been hit with
these toxic substances.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.120
I have been able now
to neutralize them.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.710
And I'm moving forward.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.350
So if you can deal with
damage, you will age well.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.790
This is really the prediction.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.740
And the revolution
came really when

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.130
people started examining
long-lived animals,

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.810
whether they were
living longer because

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.780
of a nutritional intervention,
or whether they were naturally

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.250
living longer, or whether
they were genetic mutants.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.160
And so here is a
good case of that.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:38.010
So mutations that make
some worms long-lived also

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:42.600
make their cells resistant to
stress, make them hard to kill.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:48.830
So you have in these open
circles, the resistance

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:52.260
of a normal organism to heat.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.870
You can see here now that
mutant worms resist heat

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:56.610
for much longer.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.520
They can withstand being
exposed to heat for longer.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:04.250
Similarly, if you
expose them to UV rays,

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.270
they do the same thing.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.730
If you expose them to heavy
metal, they do the same thing.

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:11.030
If you expose them to oxidative
stress, they do the same thing.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.930
So that's looking
pretty cool so far.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.180
Well, let's see
whether it checks out.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.680
So there are mice that live
40% longer than other mice

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.880
because they have changes in how
they sense energy and glucose.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.500
And, as a consequence, these
mice have flexible tendons,

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.480
and their arthritis
doesn't develop quickly,

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.220
and they have less
kidney disease,

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:35.460
fewer cataracts, less cancer,
maintain the mental capacity.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.450
And again, their cells
are resistant to stress.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:40.430
They're very difficult
to kill if you

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.220
pull them out and do an
experiment in a tissue culture

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.210
dish.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.230
So that now starts
looking pretty cool,

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:50.840
because you can conclude that
long-lived worms, and flies,

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:55.830
and the mice, all are resistant
to different forms of stress.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.560
And the reason why
they're resistant

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.360
is because their
cells are individually

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.080
resistant to different
forms of stress.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.700
So that stress resistance
really might be the cause

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.380
of the successful aging.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.660
And this connection goes
way back in evolution.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.640
It's very conserved.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.090
So this is the illustration.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.360
So the pathways that
lead to this stress

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.630
resistance in the cell.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.120
And so what we're
looking at here

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.620
is really the
surface of the cell.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.990
This would be how the
cells know what's happening

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:23.430
on the outside of them.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:26.430
They have receptors for
different growth factors,

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:29.700
different nutrients, different
hormones, and so forth.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:34.470
So if you look across species,
all the way back to the worm,

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.250
and up to the human, insulin
receptor and insulin growth

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.020
factor receptor-- it's
the same molecule,

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.540
the same receptor--
are very conserved.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.540
They exist in each
one of these species.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.990
And not only that,
but if you mutate them

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.030
or if you make them
less active, you

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.832
will increase lifespan in
the worm, and in the fly,

00:22:53.832 --> 00:22:54.540
and in the mouse.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.490
It hasn't been done in
the human obviously,

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.350
for a variety of reasons.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.260
But what's more important
is that the hard wiring

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.810
of these receptors all the
way down to the cell, the way

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.470
that they talk to the cell, to
tell the cell, look, it's time

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.140
for you to divide or no,
it's time to hunker down,

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.910
there's not enough
nutrients and you

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.210
need to do different things,
is fundamentally the same.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.730
Because these building
blocks that you see here

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.530
are highly conserved.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:23.130
And, not only that, but if you
take individual pieces here,

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:25.890
that are sort of like at
the same level of signaling

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.950
downstream, and you cut them
out, or you disable them,

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.520
or you attenuate them, you
also get increased cell stress

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:37.440
resistance, and increased
lifespan, and health span.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.860
So the challenge for the biology
of aging really at this stage

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.870
is to work out the
pathways by which

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:47.040
these single genes, enzymes,
hormones, hormone receptors,

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.670
and simple interventions
radically improve

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.140
a complex process of aging.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.800
So that's challenge number one.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.800
Challenge number two,
which is no less important,

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.680
is to scientifically
determine and figure

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.160
this out in a conversation
with the society.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.630
Can we do this in humans?

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:08.640
Is this safe enough?

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.560
Can we get the same
effects in humans?

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.460
Is it efficient enough?

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.490
And finally, and
no less important,

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.290
should we do this in humans?

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:17.400
Is this ethical?

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.680
Is this reasonable
socioeconomically, and so

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.370
forth?

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:21.840
All of the important
questions that

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.870
will be addressed, particularly
by the fifth and sixth speaker

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:25.860
in this series.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.230
So they will be
telling you a lot more

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:31.770
about societal resources,
about natural resources,

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.950
about redistribution,
and what one needs to do.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:38.610
And I am very confident
that if we the biologists

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.980
can come up with
interventions like these,

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.850
so can our fellow scientists
come up with ideas about how

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.290
to more efficiently
use the resources,

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:50.250
help to generate more resources,
and how to distribute them

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:51.590
more equitably.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.090
And that is the
question, of course,

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:57.450
that will unify all of our
presentations down the line.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.130
So let's think about
this a little bit

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.800
from the standpoint
of our society

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.930
and of individual human beings.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.270
You have all seen
these pictures.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.030
These are the
demographic projections.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:13.710
They were accurate and
based on data until 2008

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.020
in this particular slide.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.000
And then from that point
on, they were projections.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.730
And they project
that the population

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.480
over 65, and in particular
the population over 85,

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:31.740
will tremendously go up over
the next only 35 to 40 years.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.260
And so what this is saying
is that 65s and older

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.900
will go up at least two-fold.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.000
And those that are 85 and
older will basically quintuple.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.250
They will go up fivefold over
that same period of time.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.000
And so that's, of
course, fine, and dandy,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.670
and cool because
most people really

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.450
live quite nice, active,
independent lives,

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:58.270
with self-reported good
health and satisfaction

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:01.870
for a nice, good
long period of time.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.850
The problem is when
they no longer do that,

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.310
what are we going to do?

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:09.400
So, again, there's this
whole issue of health span.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.710
And so I have an
example of health span

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.840
that I would like to
share with you here.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.610
And it comes directly
from my family.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.180
So this is my father,
Zarko Nikolic,

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.050
who's sitting here in the
audience and who is now 88,

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.680
and his older sister,
Radmia, who's 91.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.330
And I'm convinced
that the reason

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:31.360
that my dad has done
so much in his life

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.910
and has been so successful
is that he was really

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.710
very bad at retiring.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.860
I'm also convinced that my mom
had something to do with it

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.410
because she couldn't
tolerate him at home anymore.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:43.720
She kicked him out repeatedly.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:49.420
So his trajectory here was
that he retired the first time

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:53.860
back in '82, after 28 years as
a doctor, 15 years as a division

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.790
head in the hospital.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.970
Worked for World
Health Organization,

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:00.310
retired after
three years; worked

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.190
as a medical consultant in a
health club, retired again.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:06.790
Came to the US, started working
as a post-doctoral fellow

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:10.380
at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.080
Worked until 2008,
retired again author

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.210
he published his second book.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:19.350
And, of course, it's not
over, which is wonderful.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.808
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.136
So being busy is quite
important, and quite useful,

00:27:30.136 --> 00:27:30.760
and quite good.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.850
And unfortunately, some
people cannot be as busy

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:37.880
because the qualities of their
lives are not at that level.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.060
And so our problem is
that we're spending

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:44.140
an increasingly enormous
amount trying to get

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.060
those people to be better.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:50.410
And 10% of the sickest and
frailest Medicare patients

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.990
account for over 60% of our
total Medicare spending.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:57.970
I don't think that these
figures are entirely new to you.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.890
But these are staggering
numbers when you think about it.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:03.550
What is much worse
than that is that they

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.506
don't receive great care.

00:28:05.506 --> 00:28:06.880
And that I'm sure
you know about,

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.240
that there's 14 different
docs looking at everything

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.760
from your pinky, all
the way to your earlobe,

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.840
nobody talking to one another,
and everybody prescribing

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.780
their own drugs.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.710
You're being admitted, released,
readmitted into the hospital,

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:23.190
and so forth.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:24.690
So that's a problem.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:28.330
And the additional
problem that we face here

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.880
is that if we continue with
this business as usual,

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.020
we really use this irreplaceable
source and resource of wisdom

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.970
and experience and energy.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:41.150
So, in other words, what we want
would be something like this.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.870
And what we get is this.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:47.170
And this is, unfortunately,
an actual sign

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:50.770
from a street somewhere
in the United States

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:54.850
warning you that some elderly
people can run under your car.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:55.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:55.690 --> 00:29:01.180
So go figure.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.670
So there's some immediate
help that's on the way.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:05.680
And I'm proud to say
that our Center on Aging

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.310
is at the forefront of that
research and of the initiatives

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.390
to change this.

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.000
And these are really the
changes to how our health care

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.530
delivery works.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:17.860
It's really now
incumbent upon us

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.639
to accept and to adopt
the team-based home care,

00:29:21.639 --> 00:29:23.680
where there will be high
coordination between all

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.210
of these providers
that are really

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:27.400
in the service of the
person that they're

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.590
trying to help in their home.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:31.630
There is this hugely
important concept

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.090
of telehealth and
telemonitoring,

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:38.170
where a person at home can
take not only blood pressure,

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.990
and heart rate, and simple
things, but certainly

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:45.490
glucose levels, blood sugar,
and advanced biometrics,

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:49.310
like whether this person may
be more prone towards falling

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:51.130
because the gate is unstable.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.320
There's telemonitoring
along those lines.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.170
And so Mindy Fain and
Jane Mohler in our center

00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:01.000
are really national leaders
in this particular effort.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.210
And I'm sure that it will
bear fruit very soon.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.952
But even if this all
works wonderfully well,

00:30:06.952 --> 00:30:09.160
we're still not going to
resolve all of our problems.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.620
The economics are kind of
like against in this case.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.310
And so really it's
the biology of aging

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.290
that will have to
step to the plate

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:18.640
and can step to the plate.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.230
And again, it's this same curve.

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:24.850
We're trying to move from this
disability-free survival that

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.160
is now somewhat
constrained, all the way up,

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.530
by moving these lines
in the upper corner.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:34.380
So what we're looking for
it to happen is wonderful.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.807
But we unfortunately have
an elephant in the room.

00:30:37.807 --> 00:30:39.140
So here there are two elephants.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.130
And one of them is a
geriatric elephant.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:45.280
And the elephant is ageism.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.990
You have heard the word.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.480
It is one of the
unaddressed isms

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.850
that we are currently
confronting.

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.150
So if we are building a world
and a health care system

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:58.090
where we can grow
old, then we shouldn't

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.880
be seeing a sign like this.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.750
I mean this sign is implying
that these people don't know

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.700
what they're doing
really and they're

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.790
a danger to everybody else.

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:11.300
They are not a resource
clearly over here.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.400
If you were to
extrapolate this, you

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.461
would get something like this.

00:31:15.461 --> 00:31:17.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:24.800
So who's to tell you at what
point you should be put down?

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.050
It's a pretty interesting point.

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:29.080
Or something like this?

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.530
You came and you had
an expiration date

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:34.040
on your forehead, where
somebody would basically

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.440
say at this point,
you are irrelevant.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.490
You're invisible.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.770
You're no longer really
considered a productive part

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:41.400
of the society.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.280
And so there are
several answers to that.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.900
One of them would be this.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.982
But the other really
is this-- sorry,

00:31:48.982 --> 00:31:50.690
this-- that we really
need to treat older

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:53.270
adults as a societal resource.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:57.250
And that is the change of
thinking that we need to adopt.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.590
So in the end what
I would like to see

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.690
is the return of
this vast wisdom,

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:04.580
and experience, and
energy to the society.

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.750
Whether it's to the
family, which is wonderful

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.370
and which my children
have certainly

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:13.270
benefited from having my parents
around and growing with them.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.470
Whether it's to the
community, or whether it's

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:16.700
to the society at large.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.642
I think that this is really
an incredibly important point.

00:32:19.642 --> 00:32:21.600
And I would just like to
digress a little of it

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.100
and wish my parents happy
56th anniversary today.

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.560
So we really want to
change the face of aging.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.590
And we really want to harness
how these genes and diets are

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:41.560
working so that we can
change the face of aging.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.840
So what can we really
do realistically?

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.720
Here's a few things that we
really cannot do and don't want

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.830
to do.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:48.910
These things work.

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:50.980
But they work on
mice and on worms.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.440
And they're really not
under consideration.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.650
We're not going to be
genetically altering humans

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:58.030
before birth.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:01.560
And we're not going to do
that to them after birth.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.630
And caloric restriction,
if you think about it,

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:08.100
it would mean either chucking
away or clearly downsizing

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:08.840
your Big Mac.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.690
And so in our society, that's
not very palatable either.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:17.400
So that in its present form
will probably not work.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.920
But it might work if we
can actually distill this

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.220
into specific a treatment
or a specific drug that

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.440
might be working on
the clear pathways

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.540
so as to produce these
positive effects.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.140
So what we can do,
what we could achieve,

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.990
and if you realistically look at
what has been achieved so far--

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:37.560
I told you that caloric
restriction increases lifespan

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:42.060
by about 30% to 40%,
to 45% sometimes;

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.550
other interventions
between 30% and 60%.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:47.460
So let's say that 40%
would be realistically

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:51.650
achievable, defensible
scientifically certainly.

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:53.850
At that point,
really the equivalent

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:58.260
of the human lifespan, the
mean, would be 112 years.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.960
And these are the 111
that would be healthy.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.630
And then with that,
we now achieve

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.645
the title of this series
and we can all go home.

00:34:10.145 --> 00:34:11.520
Well, can't we do
something else?

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.949
Can't we just take care
of all of the diseases?

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:18.000
So these are the nine main
causes of death in the US.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.870
And let's examine what
they mean individually.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:25.320
So an average female
that's roughly around 50

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:30.210
in the US today would be
expected to live to about 81.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:33.836
Well, let's say
that we cure cancer.

00:34:33.836 --> 00:34:37.260
If we cure cancer, that person
would gain roughly about three

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.396
to four years of lifespan.

00:34:39.396 --> 00:34:41.880
If we did the same
with heart disease,

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.070
pretty much about the same.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:47.090
Let's cure cancer
and heart disease.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:49.310
You'd get about
six to seven years.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:50.540
Nice.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.929
You get cancer, heart
disease, stroke, and diabetes,

00:34:54.929 --> 00:35:01.890
and you get about roughly
13 to 15 years of lifespan.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:03.870
But really the promise
of delaying aging

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.857
is something that is
much more substantial.

00:35:05.857 --> 00:35:07.440
And the nice thing
about it is that it

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.760
takes care along the way of
all of these other issues.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.070
And that is really
what's at stake.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.230
And that is really
what we're looking at.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:18.030
So if this is what
we want to do,

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.790
why is it that we
didn't do it before?

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.070
So the first problem
is that aging

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:26.730
is viewed very incorrectly, as
I hope I have convinced you,

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.190
as an unalterable process.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:30.160
It really isn't.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.250
We can do a lot about it.

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:34.280
The second one is that
if you have somebody

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.124
who comes out and tells you
I'm going to delay aging,

00:35:37.124 --> 00:35:38.540
or I'm going to
slow aging, or I'm

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.770
going to do
something with aging,

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:43.880
very often they will
come with a wacko idea.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.519
And even if it's
not a wacko idea,

00:35:45.519 --> 00:35:47.435
it would be like, oh,
I'm not sure about this.

00:35:47.435 --> 00:35:51.710
This guy might be a nut case.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:55.220
If you look at the profits,
you can realize a lot of profit

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:58.460
from alleged
anti-aging medications.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.530
There are tons of products
out there that don't work.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.170
But they turn
millions in profits.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:05.691
You have seen them
all over the place.

00:36:05.691 --> 00:36:06.190
Sorry.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:09.160
This is actually supposed
to be gradually coming up.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.580
But in the end I think the
crowding works just as well.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.250
There are all of the
fountain of youths,

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:19.570
all of the how to live forever
extracts, and so forth.

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:20.913
Please don't buy them.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.170
Well, the other issues
here are, well, it's

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:32.420
not that easy to really find age
changing medications, or drugs,

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.690
or treatments that would be
safe and effective for humans.

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:38.360
But I would like to argue that
the reason why this hasn't been

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.080
easy is that we really have
not invested sufficiently

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:45.290
or not nearly sufficiently
into that field.

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:47.990
It's really the lack of
funding that is the biggest

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:49.550
obstacle in this case.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:50.960
And to back that
up, I would like

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.530
you to consider what are
the funds allocated for that

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:57.020
in the United States
annually through

00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:01.970
the federal organizations
that sponsor research.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:05.480
So the biggest federal sponsor
of this type of research

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.880
are the National
Institutes of Health.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.190
And they dole out to
us, the scientists

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:14.390
around the country,
roughly a huge budget that

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:19.040
gets distributed here, of which
the National Institute on Aging

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.300
gets a mere 3.3%.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.044
That's not very good.

00:37:24.044 --> 00:37:25.835
Well, when you really
examine the situation

00:37:25.835 --> 00:37:28.350
and you look at
what's underneath,

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:31.500
and the biology of aging
program is only one

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:37.700
of the programs of the NIH,
it really gets only 0.5.%.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.300
And what is really
dismal is the next one.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:44.120
I don't know how many of you
can see this dot over here.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:52.580
It is 200th of 1% of the
total budget for research.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.970
And so it's really
impossible to move forward

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:58.620
with that level of funding.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.600
So the conclusion
here is pretty simple.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:04.860
Our investment into poor health
care for older adults is huge.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.110
Our investment into
changing the face of aging

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.670
is really ridiculously small.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:15.100
And so we're very good as
a society at curing crisis,

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.060
reacting to crisis,
a monster disease.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.320
We're lousy at
preventing things.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.600
We really don't like
to think forward.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.000
So when we think
about making sure

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.210
that the disease doesn't
occur in the first place

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.110
and that we're healthy
as we go along,

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.590
there is just not enough
of a motivator for us

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:35.060
for some reason to
say this is the goal

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.240
and this is what we
need to go forward with.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.530
So can we change?

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.620
Obviously, this is neither
smart nor economical.

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:43.450
But the real question
is can we change?

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:44.905
So I would like
to do another quiz

00:38:44.905 --> 00:38:47.660
and get your show of hands.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.620
I'm going to make you
guys the underwriters

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.730
of the federal budget.

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.170
You hold the purse strings.

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.000
You're writing a check.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.750
And if I came to you or anybody
came to you with this point

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:01.780
here, we have an
experimental treatment

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:07.822
that diminishes by 90% the risk
of breast cancer in aged rats.

00:39:07.822 --> 00:39:10.030
How many of you would think
that this is a good thing

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.610
to support, to
give more money to?

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:14.628
I need a show of hands.

00:39:14.628 --> 00:39:15.540
Thank you.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:19.210
Well, if I told you then
that this same treatment has

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:23.420
some side effects and
they're all fantastic.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.050
The side effects here are
that you don't get cataracts,

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.040
and you don't get cancer, and
you don't decline cognitively,

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.200
there's no immune failure,
there's no kidney disease,

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.020
how many of you would
support it then?

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.980
Cool.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.950
And how about if I told you also
that it leads in animal models

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:44.130
to about a tenfold increase
of lifespan over that which

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:46.710
would be predicted only by
curing cancer, how many would

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:49.320
support it then?

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.280
Can you all please register
and go run for Congress?

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.680
I really need you there.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.710
You are much better than our
politicians in this case.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:02.910
Well, this is the
final conclusion here.

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:05.370
We've looked at the
situation and we're

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:08.490
confronted with
insurmountable opportunities.

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:12.641
We've met the enemy
and the enemy is us.

00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:13.140
OK.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:17.220
So a couple of more pieces
of data before we conclude.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.460
Another treatment that really
captured the imagination

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.720
of the scientific community.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.480
This is a drug that
has been approved

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:28.770
in the US for many, many decades
as a drug against transplant

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:29.310
rejection.

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:31.050
It's called rapamycin.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:32.910
And some people, based
on their research,

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:36.406
thought that it would be a good
idea to give rapamycin to mice.

00:40:36.406 --> 00:40:39.180
And not only that, but they
gave this treatment to mice

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:43.480
when the mice were already
2/3 done with their lifespan.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.330
So these are the
mice that really have

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:47.700
only the last third to live.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.940
And miraculously,
rapamycin, in the mice

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:54.120
that are shown here in red,
that were given the drug,

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.290
it made them live longer
than the mice that

00:40:56.290 --> 00:41:00.510
were in blue, that were getting
the regular diet and no drug

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:01.680
at all.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.200
So rapamycin does
something pretty amazing.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.790
It can extend
lifespan, even when

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:12.030
you start taking it when you're
about 60 or so in human years.

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:13.539
So what to do next here?

00:41:13.539 --> 00:41:15.830
There are a lot of questions
coming up with this thing.

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:18.230
So a lot of interest.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:19.950
What is the best
dose of rapamycin?

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:21.480
Does it work on dogs or monkeys?

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.510
How are people in
rapamycin trials doing?

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:27.222
Some people get it
also for cancer.

00:41:27.222 --> 00:41:29.430
Again, this is the question
of whether that dose will

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:31.170
be good for aging or not?

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:34.560
Are some of the targets of
rapamycin good and some bad?

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.520
Do you get real health span
extension with rapamycin?

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.320
Are there other drugs
like rapamycin that

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.900
might be safer, more efficient?

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.900
Does this one produce serious
side effects at the doses

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.850
when it extends the lifespan?

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:50.010
All of the questions that
we need to figure out.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.627
And so the last three here
that you see in orange

00:41:52.627 --> 00:41:54.210
are part of the
project in which we're

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:57.060
working at the Center on
Aging, with collaboration

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.130
of our colleagues from
colleges of medicine,

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:01.440
and agriculture,
and life sciences.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.330
And so many of these
team members are here.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:04.800
I'd like to acknowledge them.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.955
Ted Price, and Gersten Lemison,
and Hedron Brooks, Sirab Gosh,

00:42:07.955 --> 00:42:12.370
and Emily Goldberg are here.

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:16.360
The other project that we're
working on deals with vaccines.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.460
Infectious diseases
are really no longer

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.590
a problem for children
and they're no longer

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:22.950
a problem for adults,
at least in our society.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.600
They are still a problem
for older adults.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.610
And it is appalling
to know and understand

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.690
that there is no single vaccine
that has ever been engineered

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:34.660
or formulated specifically
to be good for older adults

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:38.350
because their immune systems are
very specific and have problems

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:40.370
that the other immune
systems do not.

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.150
And so we're working on these
problems very specifically.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.470
My lab is working on this.

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:47.050
And we have some very
interesting and promising leads

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:50.200
about trying to formulate
new vaccines as we go along.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.960
We also work on
immune rejuvenation.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.940
There are organs that
generate the blood cells.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.750
And in particular there is
a gland called the thymus.

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:01.930
And it's very young, and plump,
and juicy when we're young.

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:03.430
This is how it looks.

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:05.080
But in the old age,
it really shrinks

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.570
to this almost invisible
tiny little mass.

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:11.230
The good news is that this mass
can now be regrown and turned

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:13.540
into something like this,
even in an old mouse.

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:16.120
And we're now studying
how this works

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.210
and does it give you better
immunity, as it's supposed to?

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:20.680
So with all of
this, I would like

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.060
to give my final conclusion.

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:27.092
And the final conclusion is
this is where we stand today.

00:43:27.092 --> 00:43:29.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:30.530
For all the mice
in the audience,

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.090
I have wonderful news.

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:35.390
But unfortunately, I can't
say that for the people.

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:38.540
And the long and the short
of it and the final message

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.471
of the talk here is
please get involved.

00:43:41.471 --> 00:43:41.970
We need you.

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:43.760
We need you as the
friends of the center

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.380
and the friends
of the university.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:46.934
And we need you
as our advocates.

00:43:46.934 --> 00:43:48.350
Thank you very
much for listening.

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:51.282
I'd be glad to
answer any questions.

00:43:51.282 --> 00:43:52.734
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.222
Are there any questions?

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:11.820
And you started with the mice.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:16.700
Did you find any
gender-based differences?

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.320
For example, my relatives live--
the female lives into the teens

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.330
sometimes.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:22.720
The males do not.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:26.650
So in those set of
mice, the gender factor?

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:28.300
So the gender factor exists.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.000
But it's not the one
that's going to abrogate

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.290
what I told you about.

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.900
Caloric restriction,
and these mutants,

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.970
and rapamycin that
I have shown you,

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.610
all extend lifespan
in both sexes.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.700
Are the people who are setting
the budgets for research

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.150
in the National Institutes
of Health politicians

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:46.110
or scientists?

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:46.951
Politicians.

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:52.360
Sometimes they call
us to talk to them.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.697
And they sometimes
pretend to listen.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:02.180
Last session and
now this, you're

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:05.890
talking about severely
reducing-- well, not severely,

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.280
but reducing caloric intake.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.940
So you have the quote, unquote,
"standard 2,000 calories a day

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.610
diet."

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:18.700
So is it realistic that the
standard calorie diet should be

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:21.880
in the 1,400 or
1,500 calorie a day?

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:25.682
People that are currently
parts of the human studies--

00:45:25.682 --> 00:45:27.640
and there are human
studies happening currently

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:28.990
in the three centers.

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:32.110
One is at Washington University
at St. Louis, one is at Tufts,

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:35.230
and one is at the Pennington
Institute in Louisiana

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:39.190
at LSU-- are all
taking approximately

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:41.620
the amount of calories
that you're talking about.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.860
I really don't think-- so that's
sort of like the factual answer

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:46.120
to your question.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.370
What's realistic in terms
of the general public?

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:50.680
I thought that I made it
fairly clear that I don't view

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.350
calorie restriction
in its current form

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:58.720
as a realistic treatment, as a
broadly administered treatment.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:01.450
Our goal really is to
understand how it works and then

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:04.750
potentially find mimetics
of caloric restrictions

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:07.530
that are going to mimic it
and do the same thing, drugs

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:12.730
that act along the pathway
to do the same trick.

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:13.750
Yes?

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:17.950
Care to guess how
rapamycin might work?

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:19.790
Well, so there is a pathway.

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:21.710
There is a signaling
pathway that

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:23.930
rapamycin very
directly hits, that

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:25.850
is exactly along
these same lines

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:27.350
that I have been talking about.

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:31.060
It really senses whether you
have enough nutrients or not.

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:35.470
And so it's measuring how
much amino acids there

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:38.200
are on the outside, how much
glucose there is on the inside.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.340
It intersects with
the insulin pathway.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.710
And at that point it
decides, is the cell

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:47.620
supposed to go into sort of like
this Conan the Barbarian phase?

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:48.590
I can do everything.

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:49.160
I'm strong.

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:49.800
I can divide.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.280
I can go into hypertrophy.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.930
Or whether it's going to go
into the phase, oh, my god,

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:56.430
there isn't anything
on the outside.

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:57.980
I've got to hunker down.

00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.660
The good thing
about hunkering down

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.490
in that situation--
and this is probably

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:04.040
the basis of both rapamycin,
and caloric restriction,

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.810
and a number of
other things-- is

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:09.290
that the cell then kind of
recycles itself to some extent.

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:12.620
And it only devotes its
energy to the most essential

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:13.910
processes.

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:16.400
And in the process,
it gets younger

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.500
because it chomps up a
little bit of itself.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.380
It kind of like, there is a
process called autophagy, which

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.510
really in English would
mean, self-eating.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:26.420
I'm eating a little bit of
myself in order to recycle it.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:29.120
And that is the best guess
that I can give you right now.

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.630
It's a fairly educated guess,
probably likely to be true.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:40.150
What advances are being
made in Alzheimer's?

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:41.660
So I didn't get that.

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.620
What advances are being
made with Alzheimer's?

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:46.330
To my knowledge, nothing.

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:50.800
Well, all of these interventions
actually significantly

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.880
delay and reduce the onset of
Alzheimer's as well, at least

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:55.840
in the animal model.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.270
So you could argue
that the mice never

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:01.420
developed quite the
Alzheimer's that the people do.

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:03.670
But inasmuch as they
have looked in the animal

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:06.940
models that can be generated,
they do the same thing.

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:10.420
Now in terms of the therapy
and the current advances

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.760
against the Alzheimer's
disease by itself,

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.079
I would like to
deflect that question

00:48:15.079 --> 00:48:16.620
and leave it for
Carole Barnes, who's

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.250
going to be talking
about the brain

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:19.840
aging in the next session.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.156
She will be much more
qualified to talk about it.

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:29.400
This is kind of a continuation
of the discussion of reduced

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.120
caloric intake.

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:36.410
If you reduce your
caloric intake

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:40.730
so that you are meeting
this 40%-- or 33% less

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:45.980
and you also increase
your antioxidant input,

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:49.465
does this address the
oxidative stress you refer to?

00:48:49.465 --> 00:48:51.890
I have referred to the
oxidative stress mostly

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:55.100
to illustrate that there is a
theory about aging that talks

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.780
about oxidative stress.

00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:00.620
The oxidative stress theory of
aging is far from being proven.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.140
There were many clinical
trials that we're trying.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.660
One of the gold
criteria for that

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:08.780
would be like, if you put
people on antioxidants,

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:10.610
would they live longer?

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:14.670
And the answer has
never been a yes so far.

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:17.240
If you don't take
enough antioxidants

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.430
through your regular
food, you might be

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:21.650
needing to take antioxidants.

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:24.080
And antioxidants in
certain very carefully

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.330
controlled medical conditions
may be a important part

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:27.520
of the therapy.

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:31.000
They are likely not the
anti-aging medication

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.500
because the point with
oxidation and oxidative

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:37.610
stress inside the cell is
that oxidative metabolites are

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:40.410
very important parts of
normal cellular signaling.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:43.100
So when the cell
is alive and well,

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:46.880
and when it does what
it's supposed to do,

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.460
a cross-talk inside
the cell happens

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:53.180
by having these oxidative
products be produced and moved

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:55.280
from one place in the
cell to the other.

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.170
If you completely
inhibit that, you

00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:59.000
can imagine that you
will be interfering

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.200
with something else.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:04.730
That's really not likely to
improve your health span.

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:09.830
So I think that those are
two quite distinct things.

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:14.060
Again, we have been told that
you need to have antioxidants

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.590
over, and over, and over.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:18.410
And really putting that in
the situation if somebody

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:19.910
has a certain
disease, if somebody

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:22.970
has a deficiency of
certain vitamins,

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:24.830
then you definitely
need to take them.

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:28.040
But it's very questionable as
to whether a healthy person

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.090
absorbing enough normal
nutrients from regular food,

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:34.790
particularly fresh
fruits and vegetables,

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:36.830
really needs a
whole lot of that.

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:39.800
Now, if there is a
problem with absorption

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.260
that might then
come back into play.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:45.380
But I really would
hesitate to say

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:48.386
that that's a universal thing
that every should be doing.

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:56.230
Some while ago I read a book
called Younger Next Year.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:59.650
It talks a lot about exercise
and its effect on aging.

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:03.130
It talked about how exercise can
bring on different enzymes that

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:04.900
help rebuild tissue.

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:09.640
I noticed you barely, if at
all, even mentioned exercise.

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.617
Is it not a part of the
field of research of aging

00:51:12.617 --> 00:51:14.200
or is it just not
something that you--

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:14.700
No.

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.240
It's an important
part of the field.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.864
I think the reason
why I didn't mention

00:51:17.864 --> 00:51:19.780
it is that we really
didn't have exactly 16

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:22.240
hours for the lecture.

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:28.480
But exercise is critically
important for the well-being.

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.700
And it's critically
important for the well-being

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:33.070
of not only the
body as we grow old,

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:35.140
but for the mind even more.

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:38.770
It's probably more important to
do physical exercise in terms

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:42.400
of the well-being of your mind
than to do the Sudoku exercise.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.740
I wouldn't say that you
shouldn't do the other one.

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:47.470
But definitely, the first
one you must be doing.

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:49.240
There are comparative
studies that

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:53.920
were done comparing exercise,
so moderate exercise,

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.590
heavy exercise, sort of
like Olympic level training,

00:51:56.590 --> 00:51:59.380
for instance, and caloric
restriction in terms

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:01.450
of what they do biochemically.

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:05.621
And in animal studies, as well
as in human studies, the long

00:52:05.621 --> 00:52:07.120
and the short comes
to it that there

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:11.020
is a huge beneficial effect
for the quality of life.

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:14.890
Exercise has never been
able to extend longevity

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:16.900
in any of the models.

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.901
So it will probably
make you healthier.

00:52:18.901 --> 00:52:20.650
It will probably not
make you live longer.

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:24.190
So if that is your thing,
that's-- But certainly I would

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:28.060
say that exercise should be part
of everybody's lives as they

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:30.435
grow older, and as
they grow younger.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.870
It's my understanding that
certain nutrients, for example,

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:41.250
resveratrol, which
is found in red wine

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.447
and so on and accounts for the
fact that the French live so

00:52:44.447 --> 00:52:46.530
long, in spite of the fact
that they eat, I think,

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:50.270
56 pounds of butter per
person per year, etc.

00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:52.340
What do you think of
those things that mimic

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.260
caloric restriction, nutrients?

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:58.010
So resveratrol was
a huge thing when

00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:01.145
the molecule-cultured
twins were discovered.

00:53:01.145 --> 00:53:04.730
And so twins are probably
very important in wiring

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:08.270
the cellular signaling.

00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:13.250
And the problem with
resveratrol was in as much

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:16.820
as it was potentially an
attractive pharmacological

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:20.570
substance, it has never
been able to extend lifespan

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:23.780
or health span in any
of the studies so far.

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:28.790
It has only been able to
do some good to obese mice.

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:31.910
So if you have a
highly abnormal diet,

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:37.910
there could be maybe some value
of taking some of the mimetics.

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:41.270
I would certainly not advise
you against having any red wine.

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:44.730
I think that's probably
a very good thing to do.

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:48.800
But resveratrol is probably
not an anti-aging medication.

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.150
And here's the last question.

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:51.728
So it better be a good one.

00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:52.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:53.520
No pressure.

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.019
Yeah.

00:53:54.019 --> 00:53:57.350
No pressure in this one at all.

00:53:57.350 --> 00:54:00.140
I'm just wondering, are people
working on immortalized cell

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:05.180
lines, the HeLa cells and others
that have genetic defects?

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:07.640
Or cancer cell lines
and abnormal cell lines,

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.470
but they are immortalized?

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:13.050
Are those used as
tools to uncover this?

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:15.080
Not that much in aging research.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.790
Because by definition,
these cells

00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:18.830
have growth factor
abnormalities.

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:24.560
They have basic mechanisms
that are supposed to keep them

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.520
in place, profoundly altered.

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:30.650
And so what they can
tell you about aging

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:32.270
is not all that informative.

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:34.680
They can probably tell you
a lot about, for instance,

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.700
things like DNA repair, or
regulation of the cell cycle,

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:38.930
or how the cells divide.

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:41.410
Certainly, a lot to
tell you about cancer.

00:54:41.410 --> 00:54:45.250
But not really about
the process of aging.

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:47.767
Well, let us thank Janko
for a great lecture.

00:54:47.767 --> 00:54:48.600
Thank you very much.

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:49.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.850
