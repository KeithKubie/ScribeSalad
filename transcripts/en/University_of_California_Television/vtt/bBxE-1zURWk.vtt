00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.280
- [Female Voice] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.403
for educational and
non-commercial use only.

00:00:10.585 --> 00:00:13.168
(lively music)

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:38.210
- Welcome to A Conversation
With History, I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.910
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.050
Our guest today is Stephen S. Cohen

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.213
who is professor in the Graduate School,

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.130
the University of California at Berkeley

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.610
and he's also co-director
of the Berkeley Roundtable

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.160
on the International
Economy also at Berkeley.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.020
He's a senior fellow at
the New America Foundation

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.020
in Washington and he's just
written with Brad DeLong,

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.080
The End of Influence, What
Happens When Other Countries

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.403
Have The Money.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.647
Steve, welcome to our program.

00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:17.410
- Good to be here with you, Harry.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.080
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.310
- New York.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.840
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.690
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.150
- Oh my god, that's a hard question,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.673
you told me you guys didn't
play with easy questions.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.373
They kind of applauded if you
were reasonable and realistic,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.750
and didn't think,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.580
or weren't all that
impressed if you could cite

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.903
the great religious authorities.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.030
- And was there a lot of
discussion about politics

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.220
and the economy around the dinner table

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.410
or did that come later?

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.780
- That came later.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.410
- And what got you interested

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:08.373
in pursuing degrees in the
field of politics and economics?

00:02:10.323 --> 00:02:12.710
- I was an undergraduate.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.000
- [Harry] Where did you do your undergrad?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.190
- Williams College.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.023
- [Harry] Aha.

00:02:16.023 --> 00:02:18.820
- For young boys of
good family at the time.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.990
They've subsequently never (mumbles)

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.550
And I was a major in political
science and economics

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.400
and I couldn't tell 'em,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.330
I didn't know where one
ended and the other began.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.400
I've had a lifelong difficulty.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.170
Is this economics? Is this politics?

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.553
So I kind of did both.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.275
- And then from there, you
went on to graduate school and?

00:02:45.275 --> 00:02:47.175
- Oh, there was a little interruption.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.240
I was too early as an undergraduate editor

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.410
of the college magazine.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.543
The Dean called me into
his office, and said,

00:02:59.444 --> 00:03:00.847
"I'm giving you a choice.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.763
"A, you're out of here
today, I'm throwing you out.

00:03:04.804 --> 00:03:06.880
"Or B, you stop editing that thing

00:03:08.237 --> 00:03:10.630
"and go take a junior year abroad."

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.557
And I said Paris, he said, "Done."

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.040
- And what was he objecting
to, a particular article?

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.070
- [Stephen] Oh, yes.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.800
- Or a general tone of...

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.710
- First it was the tone and then there was

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.113
a particular piece.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.933
Looking back it was kind of obnoxious.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.000
It was about some poor guy there

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.410
who taught a course on
religion and sex and love

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.090
in the Bible among other things,

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.010
and was up to be president
of a small college nearby.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.460
So I wrote a little limerick.

00:03:44.463 --> 00:03:46.760
- I see, so it was off to Paris.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.219
- Jointly signed with the daughter

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.250
of the chairman of the board
of trustees of that College

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.993
who's an undergraduate
at Smith at the time.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.730
For that, you should be tossed.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.030
I mean it was just awful.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.900
- I see, so do you get more discipline

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.670
in Paris or was it rather you were exposed

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.840
to the culture and stayed with it--

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.337
- I don't think it was
more about discipline

00:04:13.337 --> 00:04:16.370
and so much as exposure to the world.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.330
And of all places to
think about an economy,

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.820
France, never accepted
the kind of economics

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.740
we mainstream here.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.043
The difference in the
government and the...

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.961
didn't make sense to anybody,

00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:33.080
that the government was the referee.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.050
No, the government is
the partner of everything

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.973
and every one.

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.965
The state not the government.

00:04:38.965 --> 00:04:41.370
- Did that experience give you a focus

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.610
so that you now really
kind of have a sense

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.743
of what you wanted to do--

00:04:45.743 --> 00:04:46.610
- Well, it didn't give me any focus,

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.470
I really had a great time.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.080
So much to see and do and learn,
how to learn about eating,

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.680
how to learn about art,
it was just endless.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.843
And when I got back, this
one professor called me,

00:04:57.843 --> 00:04:59.677
"And what was your project?"

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.520
I thought, (blabbers).

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.080
I started looking at
French economic planning.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.180
- [Harry] I see.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.603
- So he said very good, write
a paper about it so I did.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.253
And then I went off to graduate school.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.853
First I applied to law school a few times.

00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:27.730
And the Harvard Law
School has that catalog,

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.550
the Facebook, the pictures
of the incoming class.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.430
If you look under Cohen,
not only comes Steve Cohen

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.880
'cause a few of it, there's
one photo missing, that was me.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.160
- I see, so you got
accepted but didn't go.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.650
- I actually wrote a stupid letter,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.850
still wise guy kid.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.040
I looked upon entering
the Harvard Law School

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.900
as a symbol of my own
total defeat in life.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.557
- I see, I see.

00:05:51.557 --> 00:05:53.700
And they didn't take
kindly to that, I guess.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.480
- Oh, they care a lot.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.703
I'm sure they were not in
the least bit disturbed.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.080
'Cause I applied the year after
and they admitted me again,

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.028
I didn't go again. (laughs)

00:06:07.028 --> 00:06:09.340
And then I went to the London School.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.033
- And focusing on?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.540
Politics and the--

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.373
- I did it.

00:06:16.646 --> 00:06:18.720
And they had a, you
might call it a program

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.740
where you could do both.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.670
So I did and I ended up doing a thesis on?

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:24.510
- French planning.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.460
- French economic planning, you see?

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.233
The littlest, they stick you.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.850
- What was it, just to
be clear about this,

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.130
what was it that led to this focus?

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.750
You think that experience,
junior year abroad

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.730
and then you found this whole interface

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.400
between the two realms very significant?

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.950
- It sounds so noble.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.380
It was that experience and
the need, that afternoon,

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.850
to have a subject for that professor

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.210
in half an hour.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.863
There I had a, so I kept going.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.710
And that was, in those
days a thesis at LSE was,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.140
the idea was you'd write a book.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.070
Not an article or two articles

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.410
that shows you can play,

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.230
they do all the necessary
tricks, he wrote a book.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.840
So I wrote this book and it
came out at Harvard Press,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.300
called Modern Capitalist
Planning, something like that.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.530
- I actually have it,
Modern Capitalist Planning,

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.793
The French Model, right.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.450
What did you learn in
the writing of that book

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.750
and the research it entail?

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.840
I mean did it raise you to a new level

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.393
in seeing this interface?

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.070
- First it was all about the interface.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.023
The state, business, the economy.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.253
And where it's all seen as one.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.960
And I started looking around the world

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.960
and the country's making
important changes, rapid growth,

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.823
changes where they go, Japan.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.550
And you see the enormous role of policy

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.370
of the actions of the state in steering it

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.403
and enabling it.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.510
And that in a funny way set me up

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.273
for an understanding of Japan.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.860
When, they used to be those big arguments.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.760
There was no argument
Japan was doing well.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.850
- This would be now in the 80s--

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:34.000
- No, the 70s and the 80s, 70s and 80s.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.800
Japan was definitely doing well,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.620
there was no question, fabulously.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.030
And there was a whole, I think a majority

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.690
of American economists saying,

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.060
well, the state is too involved,

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.690
they should get out of everything.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.363
And no one in Japan thought
this made any sense whatsoever.

00:08:55.715 --> 00:08:57.620
Makes no sense.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.920
And it was easier for me to understand

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.200
what the Japanese thought they were doing

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.540
'cause I thought of it in French,

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.340
as opposed to thinking
of it in Anglo-Saxon

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.740
as the French would call it.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.290
That kind of carried through
in most things I have done.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.590
- Now this raises an interesting question

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.610
because what we've learned
here is that you wound up

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.830
going abroad to see this connection,

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:34.830
and that turned you in essence
into a political economist,

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.970
I guess one would say,
which is not something

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:43.684
that grows naturally in
the American environment.

00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:46.234
- And now you find us under
glass in a few museums.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.609
We don't do that.

00:09:48.609 --> 00:09:51.080
- Well, you're brought
out from under the glass

00:09:51.978 --> 00:09:54.380
when there's a crisis in
the system which leads us

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.584
kind of a--

00:09:55.584 --> 00:09:57.790
- And we have crises
rather frequently nowadays.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.520
- Now, so let's say that the students

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.900
want to figure out how to
develop the skills to do this.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.610
How do you prepare?

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:12.610
What is it you have to learn
in the way of a skill set

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.223
to do political economics well?

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.969
- You have to first
learn to be marginalized.

00:10:23.969 --> 00:10:26.970
- (laughs) So live with being an outsider?

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.693
- Normal career paths closed.

00:10:31.065 --> 00:10:35.953
No kidding around, it's a
closed shop in economics really.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:37.743
You don't do it.

00:10:37.743 --> 00:10:40.923
If you can't make an econometric
model, you can't utter it.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.410
And you can make very
powerful econometrics models

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.063
at the expense of what you talk about.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.310
Has to be small and it's
built on a set of assumptions.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.110
- So, and this is something
I wanted to talk about it,

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.460
is in comparing what you
do to what an economist

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.300
and the economics profession,

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.773
you're saying there's a kind
of narrowness of the focus,

00:11:13.378 --> 00:11:15.210
an awe at the elegance of the theory

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.650
which may or may not relate
to what's actually going on

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:18.660
in the real world.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.510
- Oh, definitely.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.230
In fact I don't believe
as a requirement for a PhD

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.970
in most of the top economics departments.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.793
You were asked to know
anything about economic,

00:11:31.704 --> 00:11:34.743
the history of economic thought,
or about economic history.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.050
What had had happened out there and...

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.650
I think that's an egregious loss.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.340
- And also politics, right?

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.230
I mean it isn't there--

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:46.063
- [Stephen] They don't do politics.

00:11:46.063 --> 00:11:46.896
- Yeah, yeah.

00:11:46.896 --> 00:11:47.820
- The assumption...

00:11:50.475 --> 00:11:54.940
- So, in a way, a flaw here is that,

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.340
there is a disconnect which
leads to a lack of understanding

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.680
of kind of the institutional setting,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.970
the politics of the setting

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.823
in which a particular
paradigm is embraced?

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.760
- Yeah, or viewed in another way.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.010
As an economist, there's a trade off.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:21.010
For the power of your analysis,
you sacrifice its relevance

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.183
and its range.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.060
And sometimes that comes
around to bite you badly.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.621
- And I think we've already
learned from you that,

00:12:31.621 --> 00:12:34.800
in your particular case,
your analysis of France

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.800
contributed to the power
of your analysis of Japan

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.150
when that became an important issue,

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.730
that is the rise of the Japanese economy.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.630
So what I'm hearing you
say is comparative studies

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:55.220
become very important that
is comparing case studies.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.940
- It absolutely helps to know something

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.130
about what's going on over there,

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.630
especially when they interact.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.970
- Now, you were a
co-founder and a co-director

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.713
of the Berkeley Roundtable on
the International economy--

00:13:08.713 --> 00:13:10.190
- [Stephen] BRIE, like the cheese.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.040
- BRIE, like the cheese, of course,

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.773
it would have to be because
of that junior year.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.553
That was what--

00:13:16.553 --> 00:13:18.680
- [Stephen] And most of those
years as a grad student also.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:23.650
- Right, so what then,
and talk a little about

00:13:24.577 --> 00:13:28.250
that group here at Berkeley,

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:32.390
because it became important for the campus

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:37.240
and internationally and sort
of understanding the trends

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.410
and the world where political
economy was really important

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.130
as we became less competitive

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.740
and the rest of the world
became or some parts of it

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.680
became more competitive.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.560
- That's another one of these things.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.460
Life's about a certain
nigh of the accidental.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.393
I had spent two years
in New York previously,

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.713
sabbatical and some other I
don't remember what, fellowship.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:06.960
Most of it I spent hanging around

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.903
the Institute for Humanities at NYU.

00:14:10.522 --> 00:14:11.820
Where they gave me this marvelous office

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.900
and there were some interesting people.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.490
- Great, did you read a
lot of novels or what...

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.493
- The novels were the nice part of it.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.560
Just studies of the
studies that criticized

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.223
the studies of the novels were
a little, not my favorite.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.040
But I came back.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.840
When I got back, what am I gonna do?

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.443
And it's seeing, what do we have here?

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.263
The great outdoors.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.280
- [Harry] California and me.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.453
- Yeah, I'm not too good at that.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.750
Then there was strange and
exotic sexual practices

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.583
at the time.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.269
I lucked out with an absolutely
lovely and beautiful wife.

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:58.120
I wasn't gonna be good at it anyway.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.103
So that left technology,
which I knew nothing.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.070
- It was fun to learn a little

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:08.853
and semiconductors go into
everything, everything.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.120
So all of a sudden, if
you follow the chip,

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.763
you get wherever you want to go.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.140
And this was around 1982.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.840
So I met up with John Zysman
in political science here

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.573
and very shortly thereafter
with Laura Tyson in economics,

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.650
said let's work together

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.250
So we didn't found an institute,

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.100
we said let's actually work together.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.960
We get some outside
dough, and we co-run it,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.960
we don't need a great stamp of
approval from the bureaucracy

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.617
we just cooperate which
is unusual on a campus.

00:15:46.617 --> 00:15:48.830
Exceedingly so.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:53.343
And that has held for all these
25 years and change, more.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.540
And we started, what was really going on

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:02.540
was the Japanese challenge
to the United States

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:08.630
in advanced technology as
well as in manufacturing.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.540
So out of that came an early
book, I did with John Zysman

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.303
called Manufacturing Matters,

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.940
where we argued it is a poor idea

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.660
for a great big nation, not for

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:27.660
a little specialized place,
Luxembourg, London, for a big,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.700
to lose its advantages in manufacturing.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.200
- And that was kind of the
beginning of this cycle

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.270
where we were doing less
and less manufacturing,

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.330
which actually becomes
an important element

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.060
in your new book.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.840
- Yeah, and we, one of the keys was

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.845
the Japanese firms were terrific.

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:55.337
(mumbles) it was a heavy role

00:16:55.337 --> 00:16:57.690
for Japanese government pushing this.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.720
And our argument was, this
is the way it's being played

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.470
so maybe we oughta play it
intelligently in these terms.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:07.970
We didn't.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.770
- The United States, you mean? Yeah.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.890
Let's now move to your book
because a lot of these themes

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.930
we've been talking about
come together here.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.660
Let me show it one more time.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.640
The End of Influence, What
Happens When Other Countries

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.830
Have The Money?

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:29.830
So why did you and Brad
DeLong write this book?

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.203
- Well, again it started less delivery.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.893
I find much of my life is,

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.510
lacking in a certain amount
of strategic planning,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:45.073
that we were going to do a
piece on sovereign wealth funds.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.583
The rise of these enormous tills.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:52.760
- [Harry] Pots of money.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.773
- Huge.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:57.380
- That are controlled, which you explain--

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.580
- [Stephen] By the government.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.120
- Right.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.350
- Directly or indirectly,
but government controlled

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.880
large amounts of money.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.580
It's a little different than what had

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.540
been previously the case.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.440
And the model for all of these has always

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.943
been multi-exemplary Norway.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.750
Norway good.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.490
Norway is Kuwait done right.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.224
- Because Norway had oil--

00:18:24.224 --> 00:18:28.270
- Oil money piling up, and
they learned something.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.520
If you just dished it out
to everyone in Norway.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.870
you're gonna have an inflation,

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.810
you were gonna make all your,

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.383
your currency would go way up,

00:18:37.499 --> 00:18:41.180
all your normal business
would be destroyed

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.560
in terms of competitive,
and you have a mess.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.750
This used to be called the Dutch disease.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.490
- Because the Dutch had
gone through this experience

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.000
in the '60, they had some oil,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.950
they generated a lot of money
and they blew it all away.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.993
- It did them no good, the opposite.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.109
So the Norwegians simply
said, we're putting it all

00:19:01.109 --> 00:19:04.230
in a bank account offshore.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:05.940
Because you bring it onshore, it raises it

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.490
and we'll live on the interest.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.720
- And the money is in another currency,

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.940
the dollar in this case?

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.590
- It's invested abroad,
in other currencies.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.970
Overwhelmingly, large portion
in dollars and all over.

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.640
And they invested the way

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.973
the California retirement system does.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:30.060
They don't own more than
1% of what they invest in.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.200
They have some political things.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.050
No bomb makers, I think
no cigarette maker,

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.803
they're good, good.

00:19:37.656 --> 00:19:38.489
- [Harry] Good Scandinavian--

00:19:38.489 --> 00:19:39.580
- Good, good, good Norway.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.950
Now if all the investment
funds were like this,

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.930
it'd be not at all,
certainly not even a problem,

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.993
not even a question, they're not.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.563
You have a very large Russian,

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.033
sovereign wealth fund.

00:19:57.836 --> 00:19:58.960
- [Harry] From oil also?

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.679
- Yeah, yeah, from oil.

00:20:00.679 --> 00:20:03.120
Well, there are two sources of these.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.040
There's the mineral, the
oil which are a bunch

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.220
of the Persian Gulf and oil countries,

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.590
and Russia in a big way.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.890
And then there are the
Chinese manufacturers,

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:18.243
the Asian manufacturers, exemplary China.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:25.900
Which has north of $2,000 billion dollars.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.120
- [Harry] In dollars?

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:35.120
- Yeah, say about that, north
of two trillion in dollars

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.000
sitting there in various tills.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.250
It's not necessarily
a sovereign world fund

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.423
but under direct and
indirect government control.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.040
How do you use it?

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.090
Well, if you were the Chinese government,

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.820
you'd try and use it strategically.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.130
I mean one thing is you
just put it out there

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.113
and earn a return and
people line for index funds.

00:21:01.791 --> 00:21:04.241
In others you say, well
our mission here on earth

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.793
is to advance the Chinese economy.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.493
Well, we got this enormous tool here,

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:14.290
what do we do with it?

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:18.480
Well, what we need, we
could use some technology.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.980
Well, this may help us get it.

00:21:22.069 --> 00:21:24.370
And so we were raising
some of these questions.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.770
Ooh, come to think of it,
it might be political,

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.460
if that President of the United
States, whatever his name is

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:35.680
makes no difference, starts doing things

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.543
that we don't like, that
hurt us, that irk us.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.670
What if the limousine that
brings the Chinese bankers

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:50.160
to New York to buy the US
debt every Thursday morning,

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.163
has a flat tire?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.770
In fact, what if we announced in advance

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.343
we're going to have a
flat tire and not show?

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.893
That might send the market
town a thousand points.

00:22:05.077 --> 00:22:10.030
That president, maybe
he has to think about us

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.643
before opening his big mouth.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.930
This is a change, is this not a change?

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:21.930
- So in essence, what came about

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.950
as the sovereign funds
developed especially

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:28.750
in the case of the Chinese,

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:33.750
was really a change in the power balance

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:37.273
between the two countries
beginning in the economic realm.

00:22:38.257 --> 00:22:43.010
And this is a major
unexpected disturbance,

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:47.620
if you buy into what you
call the neoliberal view

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.720
of the world, which was the doctrine,

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.770
the policy that the
United States had embraced

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.833
several decades ago.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:04.210
So the book moves toward a look,

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:08.560
essentially it's the epitaph
of the neoliberal paradigm

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.980
for domestic policy in the United States,

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:15.980
because that policy produced
this very great disturbance

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.280
which we'll talk about again in a minute,

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.030
the sovereign funds.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:22.700
- Several other big disturbances.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.700
Yes, I think it has been
pretty unfortunate for America.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.760
- So what is the neoliberal paradigm?

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.630
- That's really simple.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.650
Leave it to the market.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:42.110
Get the fat, stupid bureaucratic
hands of the state out.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.963
Deregulate.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.923
And play this out.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.383
And everything will spin
around and work out fine.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.566
Now, there are a lot
of problems with this,

00:23:53.566 --> 00:23:57.300
sometimes it doesn't, that's
called macroeconomics gains.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.803
But also, what if the other
guys are not doing it?

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.410
They may even make-believe,
which I don't believe

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.310
for a minute that this
is the best way to do it

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.283
for a country.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:08.983
But what about the other countries?

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.360
So if you were playing touch football,

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.623
and the other guy's got a
helmet and shoulder pads,

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:18.690
maybe this is not a good idea.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.350
There is a strategic element
and that's sometimes absent

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.393
in such thinking.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.823
A whole bunch of things came together.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:40.040
One was I start a long
argument in this book

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.490
that way income distribution.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.190
The period I don't know 1947,

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.060
when the dust settled from the war

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:53.060
up into the mid 70s, the
American economy was doubled.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.520
GDP per capita.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.210
And the guy, the 50-yard line,

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.340
the guy in the exact
median income district,

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.180
he doubled also.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.950
And the guy in the top
10%, he doubled also.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.720
So we went with an
unchanging income district,

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:17.780
the ranks didn't change
for the great generation.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:22.090
- So we maintain
prosperity, we move forward

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.930
from say the 30 years after World War II

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.130
and everybody was gaining together.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.170
- Equally.
- Equally, yeah.

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:33.570
And that was the great American dream,

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:36.250
and we were gaining even bigger
than the numbers indicated

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.589
because you got television
and washing machines,

00:25:39.589 --> 00:25:44.230
pricing deflators don't
explain what really,

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.520
like penicillin, I mean.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.725
And that lowers the cost.

00:25:48.725 --> 00:25:50.775
So this doesn't tell you how good it was.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.620
So the next 25, 30 years--

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.220
- [Harry] Beginning say in about '74.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.580
- By the mid 70s 'cause
I don't have the numbers

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.583
in front of me, I don't
want to get hung in that.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.893
We grew a bit slower, but we grew.

00:26:11.322 --> 00:26:14.140
I don't know, about
three-quarters increase

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.950
over the period till now-ish.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:21.950
And roughly speaking, all
the gang went to the top 10%.

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:29.010
The middle gained way under 1% per year,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.670
and the counting is not so clear.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.980
These are not precise,
they pretend to be precise,

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.210
they try to be precise but it's hard.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.433
So we had a real shift.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:47.820
Then we also changed the
shape of the economy.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.010
- So and now let me just
remind our audience,

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:54.200
we're walking you through the consequences

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.140
of the neoliberal paradigm

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.640
which dominated both political parties

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:05.200
and which was embraced by
both Reagan and Clinton

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.520
and the Bushes.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.577
- Yeah, and another thing
that sort of happened

00:27:09.577 --> 00:27:12.233
since say 1980-ish,

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.730
manufacturing as a
percentage of GDP looked

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.033
at what we produce.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:23.083
Declined by about 6% of GDP.

00:27:24.847 --> 00:27:27.160
6% of GDP is a big number.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.913
It gets you one Pentagon,
the whole darn thing.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:37.430
That's about, it gives you a
sense of size, one Pentagon.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:43.790
And we offset it by increasing
the proportion of GDP

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:47.750
by exactly the same amount of finance,

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:52.303
insurance and real estate
transactions, the paperwork.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.603
Complete reshaping of our economy.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:03.050
We've reshaped our economy
many times in the past.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:06.570
It was always led by government policy,

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.849
as is typically the case.

00:28:08.849 --> 00:28:12.733
The great example was
the opening of the West,

00:28:12.733 --> 00:28:16.410
the transcontinental railways
led by government policy

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:18.293
which was easy policy 'cause first,

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.783
big and good government
policy is always easy.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.540
Because everyone kinda of agrees,

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:28.457
how you do it is where the
nastiness comes in, okay.

00:28:28.457 --> 00:28:30.730
And it was easy because they
didn't have to vote any money,

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.640
had all that unlimited amounts of land

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.690
so we'll give you a checkerboard pattern.

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:38.447
This shaped the economy, the--

00:28:39.427 --> 00:28:42.660
- In the 19th century and
into the 20th century.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.010
- Big shaping, growth of railway, steel,

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:49.700
all the mass market tiers, Sears,

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.800
it sort of followed.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.200
We get another round of this

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.363
after world war II, the suburbanization.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:03.290
Made possible, enabled planned,
perhaps without knowing it

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.099
but doesn't matter.

00:29:05.099 --> 00:29:09.850
Morgan insurance, the GI bill, the FHA,

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:13.570
the government guaranteed
loans and the highways.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:16.640
The National Defense Highway Act

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.110
which ringed the cities
with suburban highways.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.810
We used to have to call it,
in case the Russians wanted

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.178
to go from shopping
center to shopping center.

00:29:24.178 --> 00:29:27.807
- And then finally, the big
defense budget, that is the--

00:29:27.807 --> 00:29:29.920
- The great permanent defense budget,

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.757
and more recently, the
shift to allow finance

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:39.983
to really get out of the box and it did.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:48.100
- So what you're suggesting is that,

00:29:48.628 --> 00:29:53.628
as a political economist, you can see

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:58.610
that the embrace of a
paradigm was in a way

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:03.610
a kind of a statement of planning
which wasn't put out there

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:08.160
for everybody to see,
but the consequences were

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.300
it shaped our economy in the future.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.660
- If you think about things this way,

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.290
you'll do things that way.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:15.130
Well, if you're gonna
go do things that way,

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:16.980
we have someone here
that say, if you do this,

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.770
you're gonna get this kind of thing.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:20.480
If you do that, you're gonna get that.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.820
So we borrow all this money from China

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.870
the average American family goes deeper

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:25.933
and deeper into debt,

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:28.610
because this income is going nowhere

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:31.423
and we're consuming more and more.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.320
All this goes through the banking system.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:41.320
- So the banks are making a lot
of money on everybody's debt

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.360
as they go into debt?

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.193
- Sure.

00:30:47.939 --> 00:30:49.530
One side, it's pretty straightforward.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:52.710
The Chinese factory makes some stuff.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:56.003
Walmart gets it, puts
it on their shelf, done.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.320
- We are not making
that product presumably,

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.662
in theory, yeah.

00:31:01.662 --> 00:31:03.540
- Or anymore.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.170
Or less and less, or it's being squeezed.

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.520
And you're see it.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.430
That is that 6% because
the manufacturing declined

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:15.290
by 6% of GDP on this
side of what we produce,

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:17.523
not on the side of what we consume.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.830
That didn't change very much.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:25.410
We still get the grotesque
number of T-shirts,

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.773
and the cars, the fuel.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.660
It's just coming in,
so that didn't change.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:36.310
It's not like manufacturing
went away out of the earth,

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.013
it went away geographically.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:42.980
Now what we did with this borrowed money,

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.510
what we put in place of
the manufactured jobs

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:48.403
was our doing.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.723
We didn't have to do that.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.530
We could have put it into any number

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.083
of worthwhile endeavors.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.183
Health, for--

00:32:00.625 --> 00:32:02.220
- Or to energy technology.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.553
- Yes for example.

00:32:05.856 --> 00:32:07.063
We didn't.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.520
- So, in looking at this,

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.313
what we embrace in a bipartisan way,

00:32:17.973 --> 00:32:20.830
a view of what our policy should be

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:24.550
that decrees an unfettered market,

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:28.300
and I think you say in the
book a fettered government.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.120
The government ties its hands

00:32:31.128 --> 00:32:33.890
and Greenspan brings out the punchbowl,

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:38.650
and by that we mean, it's a free market

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:40.470
both globally and nationally.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:44.870
And you're telling us in this book and now

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:49.713
that the consequences were
over time greater inequality,

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.543
if not a consequence it
followed along with this,

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:58.930
a bloating of the financial sector

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:03.710
without our sort of consciously
doing this and it being--

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.370
- Nobody took control and
said we're gonna have such--

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:07.020
- Yeah, right, but it,

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:11.370
and then the third thing was the helping,

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:16.370
pushing along, furthering
the Chinese emergence

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.980
as an economic superpower

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:24.440
because they became the place
where products were made

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.350
and to protect their own economy,

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:33.330
they save the money and
began loaning it to us

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:36.130
as we spent more than we made.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:39.100
- In a way, it's more
of an intimate embrace

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.670
that nobody wants.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:41.953
Let's take US and China.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.483
We owe them two trillion box,

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.130
maybe even more.

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:51.780
Okay, they call up, they want it.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.787
We say, "No problem, do you
want in $100 bills or 20s?

00:33:56.787 --> 00:34:00.890
"We'll fill an aircraft carrier
with it and send it out."

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.290
So there's no way they
can get their money back.

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:07.315
There's no way we can pay it,

00:34:07.315 --> 00:34:09.165
it's like 20,000 bucks per household.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.533
So there we are, we're
stuck with each other.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:18.040
They need us because
they built their economy

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.453
to be export-led.

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:22.980
Were they crazy to do this?

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.930
And they get this money they can't use?

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.353
Now, they could use it,

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.383
they could buy all their cars here,

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.920
but this would wreak hell on
their auto and steel industries

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.290
and so forth, they don't want to do that.

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:41.580
This was a little the way Keynes explained

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.263
the economic consequences
of the Versailles Treaty.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.790
The French and British said the Germans

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.343
are going to pay us
back, and he said, how?

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.954
Do you want steel, you want cars?

00:34:51.954 --> 00:34:53.290
No, no, no, no, no, no,

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:54.240
we want (blabbers).

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:02.500
Doesn't work, but were they crazy?

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.450
And I don't think so, I don't think so.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:09.633
Their intention, their goal,

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.680
and I think they realize their goal

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.990
beyond their wildest dreams,

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:18.300
was to learn how to make things.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:23.300
You had a nation of peasants,
really poor peasants.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.220
I don't think Americans understand

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.303
how poor a poor peasant is.

00:35:32.215 --> 00:35:36.150
Pull the rice, do you have electricity?

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:38.680
Probably not and so forth.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:43.680
- So by exporting and protecting yourself

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.810
from a situation where
you're forced to devalue

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:52.790
your currency, you
continue to industrialize,

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:54.570
you're converting more and more

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:58.070
of these peasants into
workers working in the city,

00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.850
you're producing more and more goods,

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.910
you're learning how to manufacture--

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:06.910
- You get to learn how to do it.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.710
Learning in university, it's expensive.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.750
Learning is expensive.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:14.010
This was the machine, they
had a nation of peasants,

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:17.640
they couldn't produce large
amounts of consumer goods

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:21.160
for their own country, because
there was no one to buy it,

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.763
there was no buying power there.

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:25.320
And you know these dollars are probably,

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.633
they could be useful, they're
not altogether wasted.

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:32.970
So they got to get good

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:35.193
and therefore powerful at production.

00:36:38.649 --> 00:36:40.240
- And under this formula,

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:44.860
they need to sell these
products and there,

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.560
and then we get the result
you already described,

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.480
namely they make all these dollars

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.810
but they want to keep
them far away so to speak,

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:57.890
and hence the development
of the enormous power

00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:59.440
of their sovereign fund.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.960
- That sort of thing, yeah.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.160
So they have all this money and balances

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.690
and they got to do something with it.

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:07.933
And some of the things are obvious.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.820
They'll buy a lot of,
what do you do with it?

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:14.470
Okay, they keep buying American
government Treasury bills,

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:17.620
Fannie Mae's, that's one of the
reason the government ran in

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.370
and said okay, we're covering Fannie Mae

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:21.373
because of China.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:27.330
Another thing they will
necessarily do is buy American,

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:30.210
and companies around the world because,

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.210
did you get something for it?

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:34.690
Doubly, maybe you get
more than you just bought

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.600
that company for.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.803
You may be able to bring
home what it does best,

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:46.070
and root that at home and
move up the technology

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.170
and competence ladder.

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:50.863
And you get power or viewed the other way,

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:55.430
America has had the money

00:37:57.194 --> 00:37:58.194
for about 100 years.

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.600
And after the war certainly
we had all the money,

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:06.510
everybody owed us money.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.240
Now we are the world's biggest debtor,

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.690
and there is no number two,
and there's no number three

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:14.310
and there's no number
four and no number six

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:18.206
and then you get Argentina,
and a few other basket cases.

00:38:18.206 --> 00:38:20.810
We owe everybody tons, and some people

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:23.730
a really great tonnage.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.580
Now we used to use the money.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:28.210
- When we were making
in and had the money.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:29.663
- We still think we do.

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:33.133
We haven't realized much of this.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:38.100
We always used it for
the good of the world,

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.900
but it was we who defined
what was good for the world.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.890
So when the French and
British, I think it was in 1956

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:50.800
sent some troops into Suez
to tell that fellow, Nasser,

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.530
straighten him out about the
Suez Canal and that properly,

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:59.110
Ickes, who no one never accused
of being a pinko, right?

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:04.110
Ickes' okay, said (clears throat)

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:09.180
he kind of hinted that
he might cough to hint

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:13.400
that they might hint to dink
the Sterling and the Franc

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.963
and on the spot out they came.

00:39:17.629 --> 00:39:20.793
We had the money, we used it as a lever,

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:25.500
we used it to support
the electoral prospects

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:30.100
of various parties in Italy, let's say

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.890
against other parties in Italy

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:37.890
who we thought would be
less good for the maturation

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.580
of democracy and which I
think we were quite right.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:43.483
We used it.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.210
- And it also gave us soft
power, your suggesting--

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:49.670
- It was the basis of our soft power,

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:53.220
and we were the example to the world.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.960
So we had this very
wonderful kind of soft power,

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:01.223
where people do like we do.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.810
They kind of imitate our ways,

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:07.880
our institutions, our mannerisms

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:12.170
and you don't have to tell
them to, they want to.

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:15.423
And this is something
the English enjoy truly.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:21.580
They came up with this
great story of the gentleman

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:27.110
who is a mixture of a medieval
knight, a Scottish miser,

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.380
this and that and okay.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.710
And they invented these activities.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:35.640
Sports, organized sports.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:39.723
All of them, tennis, soccer,

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.239
all of them.

00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:45.070
the whole idea of organizing
came out of England.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.113
The whole way of being
and doing, dressing,

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.993
if you look at a photo
of the late 18th century,

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:56.230
the Court of Louisville.

00:40:58.194 --> 00:41:01.270
They were dressed in glorious blue and red

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:04.690
and green silks, wigs and everybody was.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:08.060
Then you got the shift where
England became unquestionably

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.710
the power and it was commercial England.

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:13.970
The whole world is suddenly
dressed in drab gray,

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:15.413
the same suit we still wear.

00:41:16.541 --> 00:41:18.660
The collar goes up and down a
little, in and out a little,

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.410
we took some of the starch out but,

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:26.580
in every domain you see the power of this,

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:30.080
the ascendant, the dominant, the society.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.500
Now the economy is the big engine of that

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.403
but this other stuff lasts.

00:41:36.067 --> 00:41:40.690
Even after the reason
for it, you carry on.

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:45.690
So we have had an enormous
influence all around the world,

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.090
God save us all.

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:52.400
Young people have the body
language of American teenagers,

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.703
they listen to the...

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:58.710
- So, let's take this
analysis another step

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:02.890
as you do in the book, because
what you're really saying

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:06.890
is that our paradigm,
the neoliberal paradigm

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:11.840
led us to really change who we were

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.320
in an important respect.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.340
But it also led to a change
in the balance of power

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:23.920
between states, and the creation

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.270
of the sovereign funds.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:29.700
And I think the next step
in your analysis is to say,

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:33.570
well, wait a minute,
this is all coming about

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:37.620
and what is emerging is a different view

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.930
of the relation of the
state to the economy,

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.090
especially in these places
which are the holder

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.070
of the sovereign funds.

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:49.070
And you're raising a question about,

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:54.070
will they be able to
capture the innovation

00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:01.580
and the ability to innovate
which comes with having money

00:43:02.332 --> 00:43:07.130
and being able to buy companies,
to have foreign facilities

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:08.370
in your own country?

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:10.610
The next big question is,

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:12.963
how far will they be able to take that?

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.470
- I think you've got it,

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:18.490
I think that's an essential question.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:22.950
Certainly, having the money helps.

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:24.910
You and I formed this clever startup

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:28.980
or investor comes from
some Chinese company,

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:33.230
maybe partnered with an
American private equity thing

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.870
but the Chinese company is borrowing

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:37.750
unbelievable amounts
of money from the bank

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:40.290
which itself is borrowing
unbelievable amounts of money

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:41.710
from the Chinese government.

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:46.000
So that same fund coming
through a few stops comes here,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.040
they invest in our technology
and our investor says,

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.863
hey, we're going, go, go,
go, go, you need more money.

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:56.250
We could really do this well
if we move, keep you guys here,

00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:59.290
if forward-thinking we
move some of the stuff back

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:02.240
to Shanghai where we can get a
cheaper, better, blah blah...

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:08.393
That's one very likely sort of thing.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.000
Also what the next round
of innovation is gonna be,

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.563
nobody knows, but yes people do know.

00:44:19.649 --> 00:44:24.590
There's no specific thing
but energy, technology,

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:25.590
everyone knows that.

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.090
Well, we're not doing very well.

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:31.410
I mean every one of our
politicians explains

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.810
that we are a world leader,

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:35.143
we are always a world leader, we're not.

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:37.713
We're a pathetic follower.

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:43.713
We certainly don't have
much of an installed base,

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:46.560
we're not leaders in making this stuff,

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.023
we have a lot of very
promising laboratory work.

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:52.823
So do other people.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.080
And the disconnect between laboratory work

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.480
and then you got to make it.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:02.123
Whereas in internet technology,
there's no making it.

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:06.373
You can sell one product
or a hundred million,

00:45:06.373 --> 00:45:09.313
it's the same, the costs are the same.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.943
To produce one more copy of our software,

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:15.680
and you can automate the click,

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.333
you don't have to actually click.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.910
Whereas to make solar
panels, you got to make them

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:22.933
and so forth.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:28.590
Windmills, titles, whatever, (mumbles).

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:33.510
So no, we could be

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.703
but thus far we're not.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:39.053
Will we be?

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:45.930
We could, I think it's
entirely a political question.

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:49.210
After that, I see every reason for

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:53.773
a certain amount of choking
heartbreaking pessimism.

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.910
- And this takes us full circle

00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:00.770
back to your career in a
way and where you started,

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:04.520
because you told us well, I got interested

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.810
in political economy,

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:09.930
the interface between
politics and economics.

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:14.930
And what you're now telling
us through the analysis

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:20.510
in this book is that we
have to think differently

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:24.870
about the relation of
the state to the economy

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:29.264
in this new global context,
which we have partly created.

00:46:29.264 --> 00:46:33.360
And if we don't, we're
going to be up a creek

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.620
because for example in energy technology,

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:41.280
the state is going to have to
do something along the lines

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:45.890
of what the Pentagon
did during the Cold War

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:50.490
in terms of setting the
stage for us moving forward.

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:51.450
- Yeah.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:53.990
- And my sense is that
well, you just said it

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:55.693
but let's explore this.

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.400
What do you think will make us adapt

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:06.400
to this very different
view of the relationship

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.593
of the state to the economy?

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.963
'Cause the state has to be,

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.750
you say we can't do
planning and we won't do it

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:22.960
because it's a concept that
goes against our culture

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.093
and our institute, then what do we do,

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:29.000
to prepare us for this
world which we've created

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.793
and which we're now losing in?

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:34.582
- Do you have an easier question?

00:47:34.582 --> 00:47:35.415
(Harry laughs)

00:47:35.415 --> 00:47:39.470
We did a little bit of
planning, maybe enough.

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:42.360
As you said, we had this
thing called the Pentagon

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.310
and the nice thing about the Pentagon

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:50.010
was it was like brackets
in economic thinking.

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:52.550
You could think up to
the bracket and after,

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:55.200
but you're not allowed to think
about what's going on there.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.623
It's off the table for economic thinking.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.840
And a lot of it was just a huge waste,

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.210
I mean a colossal waste.

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:07.150
Some of it was vital to save
ourselves and the world,

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.530
and some of it, a small part

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:11.980
was America's industrial policy.

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:16.243
We didn't call it industrial
policy, picking winners.

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:18.900
We called it military--

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:19.980
- And this would be through--

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:23.286
- Jet planes for instance.

00:48:23.286 --> 00:48:25.433
Commercial jet planes.

00:48:27.954 --> 00:48:30.080
I remember the Boeing 707 was the...

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.780
Well, some of the Europeans used to argue

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.250
that the Boeing 707

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:38.913
was the K-135 military
tanker with windows.

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:43.950
And it really was, and it came
down the same assembly line

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:47.830
using the same fantastic machine tools

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:50.180
that could scope the Brancusi statue

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.500
in 12 dimensional space,

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:56.450
with the big jet engines
that had been developed

00:48:56.450 --> 00:49:00.650
at huge cost in technology
and needed special metallurgy.

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:03.750
That gave us the
undisputed lead in the sky.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:06.980
Satellite technology, do you
know a guy in Silicon Valley

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.360
who could put that up?

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:11.393
No, you can't do those in a garage.

00:49:12.458 --> 00:49:16.250
A whole raft, the internet,

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:19.780
its maiden name as you will
remember was the DARPA net.

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:21.747
The good folks at DARPA said,

00:49:21.747 --> 00:49:24.647
"What happened if the
Russkies nuke Chicago?

00:49:24.647 --> 00:49:26.187
"We have to communicate."

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:31.500
They created a communication
system with no central node

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:34.863
or nodes and then it grew.

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:39.930
Computing, everyone
remembers the first computers

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:43.130
filled a room 10 times the size
of this and needed 50 people

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:45.031
to change the bulbs.

00:49:45.031 --> 00:49:47.481
Who on God's earth would
buy one of these babies?

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:53.980
And that is the seed corn
of the round of innovation

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:57.150
that propelled our
economy for a long time.

00:49:57.150 --> 00:50:00.133
It was the government picking winners.

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.463
It's not so hard to pick winners if you...

00:50:03.463 --> 00:50:05.730
Some of these things, it's in that

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:08.730
which particular model
is a different story,

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:12.633
but getting things going
in that direction, yeah.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:18.390
- Now, let's talk a little
about the Obama administration

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:22.060
in its first year, because he was elected

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:25.870
with a lot of hope about the
way he could change things.

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:30.870
And if we look at, his policy--

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:31.903
- [Stephen] I disagree with you.

00:50:31.903 --> 00:50:33.055
- Oh, okay.

00:50:33.055 --> 00:50:35.933
- He was elected less with
hope than with desperation.

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:42.680
What W. Bush and company
had done to smash,

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:47.680
to destroy this great country
and they did a hell of a job.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:54.440
I mean you name the
dimension from the big one,

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.373
our role as the leader of the world,

00:50:58.997 --> 00:51:01.147
we became somehow the
bad guy of the world.

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:06.173
Our role as rich, we ended
up with a beggar's bowl.

00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:12.340
Our role is let them see
us, they saw new audience,

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:14.053
they saw epigraph.

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:17.950
Even the small things like
environment so to speak,

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:21.183
whatever it was, they destroyed it.

00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:26.723
Through a combination of
ideology and pure cynicism.

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:31.700
So yeah, people turned
to this guy, please,

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:35.073
they gave him a Nobel
Prize for being alive.

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:37.420
- And being elected.

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.463
- For replacing that.

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:44.050
Please, please bring us
back the United States

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:45.850
we've known and loved.

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:48.653
The world needs the United States.

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.510
Not sure it's gonna get it.

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:54.260
- So if he, let's accept
what you're saying,

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:57.960
if he was elected out of desperation,

00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:02.890
are we seeing evidence that he can move us

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:07.380
in the area of recognizing
some of the problems

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:08.790
that you've identified?

00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:13.790
And in particular, the
changing role of the state

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:18.165
as it deals with this series of problems.

00:52:18.165 --> 00:52:21.580
And this seems to be very
much related to the way

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:25.050
the banks are treated basically,

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:29.380
in light of the disaster that came about

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:34.380
in last year's financial crisis.

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:38.200
Because in a way, what
you're telling us is

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:43.200
that the banking sector
grew from 14% to 21%

00:52:45.077 --> 00:52:50.060
and with that came a lot of
power to influence elections

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.060
and campaigns and so on.

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:56.410
Is that gonna change and what
will it take to change that?

00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:58.550
It would seem that there
are two problems here.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:03.550
One is preparing for this
future that is upon us

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.470
with the development
of the sovereign funds

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:07.360
where the state has to
play a greater role.

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:12.360
But the other is to putting the
banking sector in its place.

00:53:13.847 --> 00:53:16.110
- I think you've got it right.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:17.653
So why ask me? I don't know.

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:23.670
Look, we did this health care reform.

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:26.773
I cannot explain it to myself,
let alone to a student.

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:29.270
It's ju-jitsu a bit, it's a...

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:30.870
Why is it so complicated?

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:33.760
Remember there are other
countries on earth.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.760
All the others have health care systems

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.910
that work better than ours,
all the rich countries, okay?

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:41.560
I'm not talking about Bangladesh.

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.820
Switzerland, that has private guys.

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.551
France that has both

00:53:47.551 --> 00:53:51.100
and they all have better
numbers at much less cost,

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.203
much less cost.

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.570
We are doing this health
reform in order to preserve

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:01.920
the health insurance
companies and a few other.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.740
We are doing this banking
reform, maybe bailout reform

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.320
in order to preserve...

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.153
Why preserve it?

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:16.050
I'm perhaps too foolish
and I don't understand.

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:20.260
It's my ignorance, why I have to preserve

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:22.330
the health insurers that
gobble up everything,

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:24.640
make everybody's life a misery.

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:28.140
If you've ever had, it's a
medical, it's a nightmare.

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.890
While you're crying your heart out,

00:54:31.244 --> 00:54:34.070
you have to deal with these
refusal and change of service

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:37.213
and your doctor is not in this
group and he's not in that.

00:54:38.176 --> 00:54:42.640
It is ridiculous, it is
painful, it is wasteful.

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:45.250
Well gee, everybody in
the country knows that,

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:46.763
so why don't we change it?

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:52.920
Well, maybe we're, when
you watch countries

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.603
who get into trouble,
it's always political.

00:54:57.110 --> 00:55:00.523
The cause of the bad economy is political.

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:06.180
- And that I guess is what the economists

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:08.050
are afraid to admit

00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:13.373
or don't have the analytic
skills to admit it?

00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:16.283
- It's outside of their domain,

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:19.483
that's the next office over there.

00:55:21.164 --> 00:55:23.164
We don't do that, we don't do political.

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:26.960
But if we got the political house in order

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.640
then the economic stuff could,

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.550
there's a lot of really good work.

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:36.550
But right now, the problem is
rooted in the political side.

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:40.390
- And I think you're
suggesting that the paradigm,

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:43.640
the neoliberal paradigm

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:48.640
has collapsed but that
may not be recognized.

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:51.370
'Cause one of the refreshing
things about your book,

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:57.560
I thought was that it linked this collapse

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:01.030
to choices that were
made several decades ago

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:02.100
by both parties.

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:05.900
And we're really not ready to admit that.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.070
- I think you're quite correct.

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:09.130
I think we're gonna...

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.113
The patient is not dead.

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:15.500
We've got him out of intensive care,

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.857
he's still in the room,
they're running us (mumbles).

00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:23.483
We're gonna have a, it seems to me,

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.343
another go at it.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.799
- At the neoliberal--

00:56:27.799 --> 00:56:32.799
- Look what's going in the
finance sector, back to go,

00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:37.800
what's going on in the
health sector, back to go.

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:40.483
Well, that's two big hunks of everything.

00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:49.193
So we seem unable.

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.573
Now, you think what can
change is it's a crisis?

00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:57.290
And they're not gonna
change it because you or I

00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:58.920
or even the president
says hey, we really have

00:56:58.920 --> 00:56:59.753
to change this.

00:57:01.674 --> 00:57:04.030
So a crisis and...

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:08.460
Maybe they rate, what
we may come to think of

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:12.443
the tragedy of Obama is he
was elected a year too early.

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:18.530
Remember Roosevelt was elected
in '32 election, November.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.123
He took office, was it March?

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:29.100
The crisis starts in '29.

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:33.110
By the time the election came
around, it was a disaster

00:57:34.165 --> 00:57:36.107
and by the time he kept,
and even Hoover said,

00:57:36.107 --> 00:57:38.020
"You want to work with me?"

00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:39.460
No, no.

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:41.280
It really was a disaster.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.920
So Mr. Roosevelt,

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.230
do whatever you want, please do something.

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:50.230
Obama came in, it hadn't
gotten bad enough.

00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:54.530
- And the other thing
to further your point

00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:59.530
is that enough was done
to make it not bad enough

00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:03.683
for the world that Roosevelt inherited.

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:08.270
- So I'm not sure we're
gonna make any real changes.

00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:11.760
And if we don't of course,
we're even worse trouble,

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.170
I think goes without saying.

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:14.250
- On that pes--

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:15.397
- Yes, there we go.

00:58:15.397 --> 00:58:17.610
No, it's economics, they're dismal.

00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:18.780
- No, dismal sign.

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:23.550
So I want to thank you
for being our guest, Steve

00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:27.930
and I want to recommend
very strongly your new book

00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:31.290
which you wrote with Brad
DeLong, The End of Influence

00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:34.830
because it is well written,

00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:39.830
it's not a long book
but it really lays out

00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:43.570
the crisis we're in.

00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:46.370
But looking at it in
such a way that we see

00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:50.130
the broad picture, so thank
you very much for the book.

00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:52.590
And thank you very much
for being on our program.

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:53.570
- It was a pleasure.

00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:56.910
- Thank you and thank you
very much for joining us

00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:59.283
for this conversation with history.

00:59:01.282 --> 00:59:03.865
(lively music)
