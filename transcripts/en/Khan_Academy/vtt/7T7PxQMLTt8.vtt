00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:01.067
- [Voiceover] Hey, Kim!

00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:01.900
- [Voiceover] Hi, David!

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.852
- [Voiceover] So, with the
Republican National Convention

00:00:04.852 --> 00:00:07.471
coming up in just a couple of
weeks as we're recording this,

00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:09.206
you thought it would be
like a really good idea

00:00:09.206 --> 00:00:13.148
to sit down and examine the
history of the Republican Party.

00:00:13.148 --> 00:00:15.936
So what's, what's going
on in the country in 1854

00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:18.648
that leads to this party forming?

00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:20.244
- [Voiceover] Well,
there're growing discussions

00:00:20.244 --> 00:00:21.478
over slavery,

00:00:21.478 --> 00:00:23.981
and why the slavery
should expand to the West.

00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:26.497
Now, all throughout the 19th century

00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:28.701
the citizens of the United States had been

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:30.924
kind of compromising on
the issue of slavery.

00:00:30.924 --> 00:00:33.146
First, they had a line
between North and South,

00:00:33.146 --> 00:00:35.709
said only slave states
could be below this line.

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:40.151
Now the Kansas-Nebraska Act
overturns that compromise.

00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:43.424
The Kansas-Nebraska Act,
which says that the citizens

00:00:43.424 --> 00:00:46.749
of a territory when applying for statehood

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.237
can themselves decide
whether or not that state

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:51.702
should have slavery.

00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:54.016
- [Voiceover] So, even
though Kansas and Nebraska

00:00:54.016 --> 00:00:57.713
are north of this parallel in Missouri

00:00:57.713 --> 00:01:00.329
above which slavery couldn't exist,

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.686
this new law kind of overturns
that, that agreement?

00:01:03.686 --> 00:01:04.519
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.848
So a number of US citizens,
who are anti-slavery,

00:01:08.848 --> 00:01:11.447
which means that they don't want slavery

00:01:11.447 --> 00:01:13.961
to spread into western territories,

00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:15.978
mainly because they want those territories

00:01:15.978 --> 00:01:18.288
free from white farmers

00:01:18.288 --> 00:01:22.098
to not have to compete
with wealthy slaveholders

00:01:22.098 --> 00:01:25.662
who have free labor to
farm and ship their goods

00:01:25.662 --> 00:01:27.238
and sell their crops.

00:01:27.238 --> 00:01:29.250
- [Voiceover] What about
people that hate slavery

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.457
and think it's immoral
and want to abolish it?

00:01:32.457 --> 00:01:34.443
- [Voiceover] Those people
are called abolitionists.

00:01:34.443 --> 00:01:35.580
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
that's a convenient name.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.413
- [Voiceover] Yes.

00:01:36.413 --> 00:01:40.007
And the abolitionists,
really before the 1850s

00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:42.175
they were kind of considered
the lunatic fringe,

00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:45.416
only those sorts of people would imagine

00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:49.149
that you would want to end
slavery right now everywhere

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.885
that exists in the United States.

00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:52.933
So, they don't want to
just not have slavery

00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:53.864
out in the West,

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:55.881
they want slavery to be
ended where it exists

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:57.339
already in the South.
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:59.419
- [Voiceover] So, those
who believed in abolition,

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.268
those who believed in anti-slavery

00:02:01.268 --> 00:02:04.017
went to a new party, the Republican Party.

00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:07.575
- [Voiceover] So even
within the Republican Party

00:02:07.575 --> 00:02:10.533
abolitionism was still on the fringe

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:12.474
of the party plank?

00:02:12.474 --> 00:02:13.531
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I would say so.

00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:17.234
So, the new Republican
Party which really comes out

00:02:17.234 --> 00:02:18.908
to an extremely strong start,

00:02:18.908 --> 00:02:21.156
they run their first candidate in 1856,

00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:23.849
he gets second place in national election,

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.654
which is amazing.
- [Voiceover] Not bad.

00:02:25.654 --> 00:02:27.921
- [Voiceover] But their
second candidate for President

00:02:27.921 --> 00:02:29.399
is Abraham Lincoln.

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.980
And Lincoln himself is
actually kind of considered

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.230
a moderate, because he is anti-slavery,

00:02:36.237 --> 00:02:38.600
he is not an abolitionist.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.514
But nonetheless, the
South perceives Lincoln

00:02:41.514 --> 00:02:45.549
to be an abolitionist and
white Southerners revolt

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.334
and start the Civil War.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:48.788
- [Voiceover] So, because he is perceived

00:02:48.788 --> 00:02:51.096
as an abolitionist,
because he is a Republican,

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:52.832
that's why South Carolina secedes?

00:02:52.832 --> 00:02:53.665
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:02:53.665 --> 00:02:55.305
So, the Civil War ensues.

00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:57.355
This is a four year long battle.

00:02:57.355 --> 00:02:59.188
620,000 Americans die.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.479
And at the end of the day, the North,

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:06.239
the United States of America
led by the Republican Party

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.930
is victorious.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.228
- [Voiceover] So the
victory of the United States

00:03:09.228 --> 00:03:11.442
in the Civil War kind of assures

00:03:11.442 --> 00:03:14.757
dominion of the Republican
Party for a generation.

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:16.854
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I would
say even more than that.

00:03:16.854 --> 00:03:19.016
So, for the rest of the 19th century

00:03:19.016 --> 00:03:21.695
and really into the early 20th century

00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:24.553
the Republican Party is the
stronger political party

00:03:24.553 --> 00:03:26.595
in the United States.

00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:28.911
- [Voiceover] So, from
the end of the Civil War,

00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:32.212
from 1865, until about when would you say?

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.635
- [Voiceover] I would
say the Great Depression.

00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:36.189
- [Voiceover] So, it's
an almost unbroken string

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.673
of republican presidencies.

00:03:37.673 --> 00:03:38.715
- [Voiceover] Yeah, there are only three

00:03:38.715 --> 00:03:40.678
Democratic presidents in this time period.

00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:44.862
So it's 72 years of
pretty much uninterrupted

00:03:44.862 --> 00:03:46.436
Republican rule.

00:03:46.436 --> 00:03:50.259
And the Republican Party is
the party of anti-slavery.

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.761
During the Civil War they were the party

00:03:52.761 --> 00:03:55.414
of the emancipation
proclamation under Lincoln.

00:03:55.414 --> 00:03:59.960
So, it's during their rule
that the 13th Amendment,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.353
abolishing slavery, is passed.

00:04:02.353 --> 00:04:05.740
The 14th Amendment, which
guarantees equal citizenship

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.861
to African Americans, is passed.

00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:10.670
And the 15th Amendment,
guaranteeing the right to vote

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.600
for African Americans, is passed.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.516
- [Voiceover] So in the period

00:04:13.516 --> 00:04:16.254
immediately following the Civil
War called Reconstruction,

00:04:16.254 --> 00:04:18.363
when we see the election
of some of the first

00:04:18.363 --> 00:04:20.919
African American senators
and representatives

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.019
to the Congress.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:22.852
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:26.517
So, during this time period
quite a few African American men

00:04:26.517 --> 00:04:30.343
were elected to US Congress,
and many more served

00:04:30.343 --> 00:04:33.235
in appointed roles, like postmaster.

00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:35.048
- [Voiceover] So this is
when we get the election

00:04:35.048 --> 00:04:38.063
of Senator Hiram Revels from Mississippi.

00:04:38.063 --> 00:04:39.654
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:43.171
So Hiram Revels was one of the first two

00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:45.551
African American senators.

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:48.568
So after the Civil War the
Republican Party was really

00:04:48.568 --> 00:04:50.999
kind of this party of the Gilded Age.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.863
They believed in modernizing
the infrastructure

00:04:54.863 --> 00:04:56.121
of the United States.

00:04:56.121 --> 00:04:57.839
They built lots of railroads.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.582
They enacted policies

00:04:59.582 --> 00:05:01.654
that would protect American business.

00:05:01.654 --> 00:05:04.387
And it's really in this early period

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.092
of the turn of the century
that the Republican Party

00:05:07.092 --> 00:05:10.362
becomes associated with
protections of business there.

00:05:10.362 --> 00:05:12.410
- [Voiceover] Is that
what the elephant's about?

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.378
- [Voiceover] Kind of, yes.

00:05:13.378 --> 00:05:16.045
So, the elephant was popularized

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:19.952
in an 1870 cartoon by Thomas Nast.

00:05:20.968 --> 00:05:22.415
- [Voiceover] Oh, the
same guy that gave us

00:05:22.415 --> 00:05:23.608
Santa Claus, right?

00:05:23.608 --> 00:05:24.758
- [Voiceover] Yes.

00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:29.351
And Nast depicted the
Republican Party as an elephant

00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:31.445
because it was a party of strength,

00:05:31.445 --> 00:05:34.109
a really big consequential party.

00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:35.502
- [Voiceover] That's so
fascinating to have gone

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:37.860
from this, like, insurgency party to this,

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.109
like, to being perceived as the elephant

00:05:40.109 --> 00:05:42.554
of electoral politics in 30 years.

00:05:42.554 --> 00:05:43.563
- [Voiceover] Yeah, it's amazing.

00:05:43.563 --> 00:05:46.044
Unfortunately, it kinda
all comes crashing down

00:05:46.044 --> 00:05:47.233
with the Great Depression.

00:05:47.233 --> 00:05:48.066
- [Voiceover] Sure.

00:05:48.066 --> 00:05:49.569
- [Voiceover] So, the
pro-business policies,

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:51.885
the lack of regulation in the 1920s

00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:55.218
leads to the stock market crash of 1929.

00:05:56.614 --> 00:06:00.053
And it was a Republican
president, Herbert Hoover,

00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:04.038
who was in the presidency
at the time of the crash.

00:06:04.038 --> 00:06:08.454
And so, in 1932, Democrat
Franklin Roosevelt

00:06:08.454 --> 00:06:09.993
is elected president.

00:06:09.993 --> 00:06:14.009
And the following 40 years, more or less,

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.176
are going to be the time
of Democratic ascendancy.

00:06:19.163 --> 00:06:22.252
But, in the meantime, there is one notable

00:06:22.252 --> 00:06:24.074
Republican president.

00:06:24.074 --> 00:06:26.124
- [Voiceover] Ike for
President, Ike for President.

00:06:26.124 --> 00:06:28.444
- [Voiceover] I like Ike, you like Ike,

00:06:28.444 --> 00:06:29.304
Everybody likes Ike.

00:06:29.304 --> 00:06:30.307
- [Voiceover] For President.

00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:32.485
- [Voiceover] (laughs) So, we were quoting

00:06:32.485 --> 00:06:35.324
one of Ike's campaign commercials.

00:06:35.324 --> 00:06:37.015
- [Voiceover] Who is Ike, Kim?

00:06:37.015 --> 00:06:40.070
- [Voiceover] Ike was
General Dwight Eisenhower

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.049
who was a World War II hero.

00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:46.252
He was so popular he
would have been elected

00:06:46.252 --> 00:06:47.381
had his...

00:06:47.381 --> 00:06:50.115
- [Voiceover] Could have been
from the Martian party, right?

00:06:50.115 --> 00:06:52.540
- [Voiceover] Yes (laughs).

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.643
- [Voiceover] Like any party
expect the Communist Party

00:06:54.643 --> 00:06:57.112
would have propelled
Eisenhower to the presidency.

00:06:57.112 --> 00:06:57.985
- [Voiceover] Yes. Exactly.

00:06:57.985 --> 00:07:01.435
And you're right that one
of the, you know, key themes

00:07:01.435 --> 00:07:03.861
of this time period was anti-Communism,

00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:06.138
and both Republicans and Democrats

00:07:06.138 --> 00:07:08.242
had an anti-Communist bent.

00:07:08.242 --> 00:07:11.602
But Eisenhower was elected in 1952,

00:07:11.602 --> 00:07:13.988
and he was really the first president

00:07:13.988 --> 00:07:17.174
to use commercial spots to get elected.

00:07:17.174 --> 00:07:19.262
He had these cute little jingles

00:07:19.262 --> 00:07:20.401
that were very memorable.

00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:21.339
- [Voiceover] So catchy.

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:23.089
- [Voiceover] And he
really used the medium

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:24.201
of television well.

00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:27.782
So he's kind of the father of TV ads.

00:07:27.782 --> 00:07:28.615
- [Voiceover] Yeah, it's interesting,

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:29.866
because I think we think of Kennedy

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.595
as being the first television president.

00:07:31.595 --> 00:07:33.419
But I would, I think we
could both make the claim

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:35.015
that it's, it's really Eisenhower.

00:07:35.015 --> 00:07:36.140
- [Voiceover] That is a great point.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.732
So, Eisenhower is kind
of a Republican moment

00:07:39.732 --> 00:07:42.438
in a much larger Democratic era.

00:07:42.438 --> 00:07:43.271
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:44.487
- [Voiceover] And this is the era

00:07:44.487 --> 00:07:46.521
when the Civil Rights Movement happens.

00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:49.243
This is the era of the
Great Society programs,

00:07:49.243 --> 00:07:51.442
which were Lyndon Johnson's programs

00:07:51.442 --> 00:07:54.484
to try to attack poverty,
and New Deal programs.

00:07:54.484 --> 00:07:57.260
So this is really the
birth of the welfare state.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.245
So in this time period
the Republicans begin

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:01.353
to experience a demographic shift.

00:08:01.353 --> 00:08:04.360
So first, they had been the
party that was most known

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.326
for representing African Americans,

00:08:06.326 --> 00:08:08.243
because they were the party of Lincoln.

00:08:08.243 --> 00:08:10.186
But during the New Deal,

00:08:10.186 --> 00:08:13.912
when most people really
needed economic help,

00:08:13.912 --> 00:08:15.425
the African American constituency

00:08:15.425 --> 00:08:16.968
moved over to the Democrats.

00:08:16.968 --> 00:08:20.524
They actually had a campaign
saying to African Americans

00:08:20.524 --> 00:08:24.041
"turn your picture of
Abraham Lincoln to the wall"

00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:26.590
so that he can't see you changed parties.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.500
But this is really the time period

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.281
when the Democratic Party

00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:32.788
begins to pick up the
votes of African Americans.

00:08:32.788 --> 00:08:37.372
And so, over the course of
the 1930s through the 1960s,

00:08:37.372 --> 00:08:40.846
as the Democratic Party begins to advocate

00:08:40.846 --> 00:08:43.759
bigger and bigger government,
a larger welfare state,

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:46.304
and more and more social progress,

00:08:46.304 --> 00:08:50.402
the Republicans develop a
conservative response to that.

00:08:50.402 --> 00:08:52.652
And in the 1970s and 1980s,

00:08:53.521 --> 00:08:55.641
in the aftermath of the
Civil Rights Movement,

00:08:55.641 --> 00:08:59.558
many whites in the South
felt that the social chaos

00:08:59.558 --> 00:09:02.198
of the Civil Rights
Movement had gone too far.

00:09:02.198 --> 00:09:05.198
And so, they left the Democratic Party,

00:09:05.198 --> 00:09:08.131
which had been traditionally
a party in the South,

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.129
and joined the Republican Party,

00:09:10.129 --> 00:09:13.185
which was presenting a
more conservative face

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:14.592
towards social change.

00:09:14.592 --> 00:09:18.549
And so, in the 1980s this
new conservative movement

00:09:18.549 --> 00:09:21.644
really came together in the
person of Ronald Reagan.

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:23.255
And Ronald Reagan brought together

00:09:23.255 --> 00:09:25.121
a number of constituencies.

00:09:25.121 --> 00:09:28.747
He brought together business interests,

00:09:28.747 --> 00:09:32.090
who wanted less government
regulation of business.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.090
He also brought together
Christian evangelicals,

00:09:37.017 --> 00:09:39.517
who wanted a more conservative

00:09:40.717 --> 00:09:43.634
social value program in government.

00:09:45.563 --> 00:09:48.165
And he also brought
together anti-Communists,

00:09:48.165 --> 00:09:50.138
who felt that the Democratic presidents

00:09:50.138 --> 00:09:53.592
had been too soft on
Communism during their tenure.

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:54.500
- [Voiceover] So this
is interesting to me,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.778
because it seems to be
around the era of Reagan

00:09:57.778 --> 00:09:58.957
that we started to see the beginnings

00:09:58.957 --> 00:10:03.257
of ideological polarization
within the parties.

00:10:03.257 --> 00:10:06.509
- [Voiceover] I would say
that's kind of been around

00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:08.791
since the beginning, more or less.

00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:11.791
You know, the two
original political parties

00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:13.034
in the United States,

00:10:13.034 --> 00:10:15.787
the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists,

00:10:15.787 --> 00:10:17.711
or the Democratic-Republicans.

00:10:17.711 --> 00:10:19.761
This is the party led by Thomas Jefferson

00:10:19.761 --> 00:10:22.406
versus the party led
by Alexander Hamilton.

00:10:22.406 --> 00:10:26.259
You know, they had the
same idea of the sort

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:27.724
of large central government

00:10:27.724 --> 00:10:29.614
versus the small central government.

00:10:29.614 --> 00:10:33.449
In many ways we're still
debating the same issues

00:10:33.449 --> 00:10:37.599
that Hamilton and Jefferson
were debating in 1800.

00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:39.467
- [Voiceover] So, okay, so we're seeing

00:10:39.467 --> 00:10:41.857
this conservative coalition

00:10:41.857 --> 00:10:45.429
coalesce around the election of Reagan,

00:10:45.429 --> 00:10:47.429
and his election was like a sweep, right?

00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:48.262
- [Voiceover] Yes.

00:10:48.262 --> 00:10:51.991
Yeah, he deregulates a lot of industries.

00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:56.074
He defends conservative
social family values,

00:10:56.074 --> 00:10:58.344
like prayer in school, for example.

00:10:58.344 --> 00:11:03.054
And he takes a very hard
line against Communism.

00:11:03.054 --> 00:11:04.471
And George W. Bush,

00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:07.006
who was the most recent
Republican president,

00:11:07.006 --> 00:11:08.689
had a fairly similar agenda,

00:11:08.689 --> 00:11:11.554
although less emphasis on anti-Communism

00:11:11.554 --> 00:11:14.237
and instead an emphasis on anti-terrorism.

00:11:14.237 --> 00:11:16.760
- [Voiceover] So we're seeing
this shift over last 150 years

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.997
of party priorities for the Republicans

00:11:18.997 --> 00:11:21.713
as the country changes and
as its demographics change.

00:11:21.713 --> 00:11:22.546
- [Voiceover] And we'll find out

00:11:22.546 --> 00:11:24.773
how the story of the
Republican Party continues

00:11:24.773 --> 00:11:26.190
in this election.
