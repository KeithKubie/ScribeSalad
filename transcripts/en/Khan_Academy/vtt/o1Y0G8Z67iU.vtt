00:00:01.027 --> 00:00:03.601
Voiceover: When we learned about
Social Security, we saw that the people

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:06.207
who are currently working
are paying their FICA taxes.

00:00:06.207 --> 00:00:11.535
Essentially those revenues are
being used directly to provide the

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:15.010
Social Security benefits for existing
retirees and other beneficiaries.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.771
Any surplus goes to the
Social Security Trust.

00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:21.937
When you had this baby boomer
generation, on the left hand side

00:00:21.937 --> 00:00:24.362
of this system right here.

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:28.536
The baby boomer generation is this huge
population boom that happened after

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:33.336
World War II after the country was happy
and all the soldiers had come back.

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:34.354
They produced a lot of babies.

00:00:34.354 --> 00:00:37.066
You get this population boom.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.000
When this population boom was on
the left hand side of the system,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.409
they were able to generate a lot of
revenue to supply for the benefits

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.279
for essentially their parents' generation.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.775
That did help build the surplus.

00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:52.869
The problem is is that they didn't
produce; the population did not grow

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:54.274
as much in the next generation.

00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:56.204
You could view that as a
problem or a good thing.

00:00:56.204 --> 00:01:00.520
It's a problem in the context of Social
Security because starting recently,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.606
and over the next few decades,
this baby boom generation is going

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:07.937
to move onto the right
hand side of this equation.

00:01:07.937 --> 00:01:15.140
We saw that they will start to draw
down even this surplus fairly soon.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.536
Because of this demographic
change, the Social Security surplus

00:01:19.536 --> 00:01:23.535
will be completey depleted
between 2030 and 2040.

00:01:23.535 --> 00:01:25.691
Medicare is very similar.

00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:29.278
You have some portion of the
FICA tax is for Medicare.

00:01:29.278 --> 00:01:33.685
That revenue is used to pay for the
health benefits of the retirees.

00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:36.482
Any surplus goes into a Medicare trust.

00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:40.772
That Medicare trust, the formal name
is the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.

00:01:40.772 --> 00:01:44.867
The problem with Medicare is
that the situation is even worse.

00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:50.540
The Medicare trust, or we could
say the Medicare system is
already running at a deficit

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.139
meaning that they're spending
more money on the right than
they're getting in on the left.

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:00.022
They're already starting to draw down,

00:02:00.022 --> 00:02:03.022
already starting to draw down their trust.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:07.358
Social Security, at least the trust
is continuing to grow until 2023.

00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:10.808
That's our best estimate right
now; then it'll start drawing down.

00:02:10.808 --> 00:02:13.939
It'll get depleted between 2030 and 2040.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.872
In Medicare, the situation's a lot worse.

00:02:16.872 --> 00:02:20.949
In Medicare, we are already
starting to draw down the trust.

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:24.191
We are already spending more on
beneficiaries than we are taking down;

00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:26.775
than we were taking in FICA revenues.

00:02:26.775 --> 00:02:32.188
The entire trust, based on our
current assumptions, will probably

00:02:32.188 --> 00:02:41.278
be depleted in the next ten
years; depleted in next ten years.

00:02:41.278 --> 00:02:44.920
What makes Medicare especially
troubling, despite the fact that it's in

00:02:45.028 --> 00:02:48.935
a worse financial position, is that
these costs are growing even faster.

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:49.435
I want to be clear.

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:51.670
A lot of people think that the ....

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.862
For Social Security, the main
problem with this system over here is

00:02:54.862 --> 00:02:56.069
the demographic changes.

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.023
You have this huge population
that's retiring, the baby boomers,

00:02:59.023 --> 00:03:01.197
which makes this not sustainable.

00:03:01.197 --> 00:03:03.617
With Medicare, that's also going on.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:07.328
What makes Medicare even a bigger
problem than Social Security

00:03:07.328 --> 00:03:09.731
is above and beyond those
demographic changes, above and beyond

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.069
these ... this baby boomer
generation retiring,

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.277
instead of paying into Medicare,
taking benefits from Medicare,

00:03:15.277 --> 00:03:22.810
the big problem is that you actually
have medical health care costs

00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:26.313
For Social Security, these people's
benefits could just go up with inflation.

00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:26.313
For Social Security, these people's
benefits could just go up with inflation.
For Social Security, these people's
benefits could just go up with inflation.

00:03:27.097 --> 00:03:29.767
For Medicare, the benefits go up
with the cost of medical care.

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:32.342
That's going well above
the cost of inflation.

00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:38.656
You have the situation where, based on
current benefits, and our best assumptions

00:03:38.656 --> 00:03:43.681
about the economy and the FICA taxes
coming in, you have a reality where if you

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:47.425
had to give the current benefits,
and if you expect medical costs,

00:03:47.425 --> 00:03:50.044
health care costs to continue to
increase at the rate they're doing,

00:03:50.044 --> 00:03:53.347
and there's no sign frankly that
it is stopping, then you have

00:03:53.347 --> 00:03:58.188
this reality that Medicare left
unchecked could; right now it's roughly

00:03:58.188 --> 00:04:01.186
about 23 percent of our budget,
23-24 percent of our budget,

00:04:01.186 --> 00:04:03.451
or about four percent of our GDP.

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:05.519
Here we are in 2011.

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.719
It's about four percent of our GDP
we're spending on Medicare and Medicaid.

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.597
Medicaid is essentially health
benefits for mainly the poor.

00:04:13.597 --> 00:04:16.652
It's run by the states, but
it gets federal funding.

00:04:16.652 --> 00:04:18.853
Right now, that's four percent of GDP.

00:04:18.853 --> 00:04:23.983
Because of the cost growth in health
care costs, if we leave it completely

00:04:23.983 --> 00:04:30.266
unchecked over the next 50-60 years, it
could grow to 15-16-17 percent of GDP.

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:33.119
Just to be clear, that's
the percentage of GDP

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:36.513
that's roughly our entire federal budget.

00:04:36.513 --> 00:04:40.454
This has a potential, if we don't
grow our budget any, to acutally

00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:42.126
crowd out a lot of other things.

00:04:42.126 --> 00:04:47.595
Just to understand this graph a
little bit, they show the part and the

00:04:47.595 --> 00:04:50.522
cost of Medicare, the part of the
growth due to different things.

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:51.853
This is the effect of aging population.

00:04:51.853 --> 00:04:54.428
This is the effect of excess cost growth.

00:04:54.428 --> 00:04:57.186
This is the interaction of the two.

00:04:57.186 --> 00:05:00.523
To understand why that makes
sense, you just have to think

00:05:00.523 --> 00:05:05.053
about the total cost being
the product of the number.

00:05:05.053 --> 00:05:07.523
Maybe you could say the
net number of recipients.

00:05:07.523 --> 00:05:09.015
Some people are paying in as well.

00:05:09.015 --> 00:05:11.094
This will hopefully help you
understand what I'm talking about.

00:05:11.094 --> 00:05:19.318
Number of recipients, times
the cost per recipient.

00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:22.119
Let's say that this is
the cost per recipient.

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:27.092
Cost per recipient, cost per recipient.

00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:29.854
If you take the number of recipients
times the cost per recipient,

00:05:29.854 --> 00:05:31.432
you're going to get the total cost.

00:05:31.432 --> 00:05:33.393
Let's say that's the total cost today.

00:05:33.393 --> 00:05:36.520
That would be the area of that square.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.840
We're just multiplying the base
times the height, current costs.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.391
Current annual cost, current cost.

00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:47.763
Because of demographic changes,
you're going to have some increase

00:05:47.763 --> 00:05:49.262
in the net number of recipients.

00:05:49.262 --> 00:05:51.597
You're going to have some increase there.

00:05:51.597 --> 00:05:56.189
Because of medical cost growth,
you're going to have a big increase

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.455
in the cost per recipient.

00:05:57.455 --> 00:06:00.431
This thing is going to increase much more.

00:06:00.431 --> 00:06:03.853
If you go to some future point,
and you can pick your future point.

00:06:03.853 --> 00:06:05.792
I'm really just trying to
make you understand why

00:06:05.792 --> 00:06:06.797
we have these three categories.

00:06:06.797 --> 00:06:09.724
The total cost is going to be
the total cost per recipient ,

00:06:09.724 --> 00:06:12.589
that has grown dramatically, times
the total number of recipients.

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.508
Now you're talking about this area.

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:18.517
This area is going to be the total cost.

00:06:18.517 --> 00:06:23.390
If you think about how much of
this total cost is due purely
to the increased cost growth,

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.123
it would be this part right over here.

00:06:26.123 --> 00:06:30.521
This part would be the amount,
the cost, the increase in the area

00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:33.186
purely due to the increased cost growth.

00:06:33.186 --> 00:06:36.722
That would be this part of
the graph right over here.

00:06:36.722 --> 00:06:39.262
What part of this increased
area is due purely

00:06:39.262 --> 00:06:41.675
to the increased number of recipients?

00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:47.059
That would be this part of the graph right
over here purely due to the increased

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:47.786
number of recipients.

00:06:47.786 --> 00:06:50.597
That is right over here,
effect of aging population.

00:06:50.597 --> 00:06:54.518
You have some part of this
area that's created by both the

00:06:54.518 --> 00:06:57.599
increase in the number of
recipients and the increase in cost.

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:02.430
That's going to be this area
right over here, which is

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.758
this part of the graph.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:09.720
When people talk about the unsustainable
... one we have an unsustainable debt

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.597
to begin with.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:13.847
The second thing is is that the
liabilities, the obligations that we have

00:07:13.847 --> 00:07:17.017
aren't even counted in
the government deficit.

00:07:17.017 --> 00:07:19.432
These are the things that
are really, really scary.

00:07:19.432 --> 00:07:20.852
Something has to give.

00:07:20.852 --> 00:07:24.676
In all of this, the single
factor that's driving

00:07:24.676 --> 00:07:28.344
most of the scariness is
Medicare in particular.

00:07:28.344 --> 00:07:32.012
Not just Medicare, but it's not
just the demographic changes,

00:07:32.012 --> 00:07:35.650
but specific to Medicare it's
the increased cost of healthcare.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.987
If somehow that nut can be cracked, if
healthcare can all of a sudden grow maybe

00:07:39.987 --> 00:07:42.388
just with inflation, or maybe even
slightly faster than inflation,

00:07:42.388 --> 00:07:43.597
but not at the rate
it's growing right now.

00:07:43.597 --> 00:07:48.720
Then you could, to a large degree,
mitigate the scariness of what's going on

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.517
with our obligations.
