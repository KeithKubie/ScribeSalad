00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.598
We've really added 32 to this equation. Good work if you found the number 32.

00:00:05.598 --> 00:00:09.918
We take 16 and we multiple it by the coefficient of the factor in the front

00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:18.110
which is 2 so we know we have 2x squared here. Negative 18 x here and positive

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.512
32 here. We need to be careful when we complete the square when there is a

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:27.137
factor that is not 1 in front of our expression. We didn't just add 16 to

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:34.280
complete the square, we really added two times that amount or 32. If you think

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.420
about distributing the positive 2 it should make a lot of sense.
