I wrote it, I sent it, I'm ****d

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.377
- So about 10 years ago,
my writing partner and I

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:14.346
got our first taste of
success and we found out

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:16.449
we were having our movie made.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.118
It was very exciting and the
day after the news came out,

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:23.088 align:start size:97% position:3%
I got an email from a
musician friend, lovely guy.

00:00:23.088 --> 00:00:25.791 align:start size:88% position:13%
So this guy had had a
song out, I don't think,

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:28.194
it wasn't like on the
charts, certainly,

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.463 align:start size:97% position:3%
but it was being passed
around from our friend group.

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.431 align:start size:97% position:3%
When I'd seen him at a
party, I had raved about him,

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:33.899
I love that song.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.969 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he just offered
very generously

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.871 align:start size:97% position:3%
to give us the song if we
wanted to put it in the movie.

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.639
So instead of just writing
back, thank you so much,

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:43.309
very nice, I was feeling myself.

00:00:44.476 --> 00:00:47.146 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I forwarded his email
to my writing partner

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:49.381
and proceeded to make
a lot of fun of him.

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.550 align:start size:97% position:3%
This guy's like stalking
us, it's like so disgusting,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.253
give us a minute to enjoy our
success before you're trying

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:56.990 align:start size:84% position:16%
to cram your song
down our throats, man.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.891
Ugh, ugh.
(sigh)

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:01.127
And then I look up and I see
that I have not forwarded it

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:05.097
to my writing partner but in
fact, simply replied to him.

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:06.399
(screaming)

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.267
And I pushed back from
my desk and screamed,

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.303
"Help me, somebody, help me!"

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:11.437
No one could help me.

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:12.839 align:start size:88% position:13%
I called this gentleman
and I got to him

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.340 align:start size:97% position:3%
before he had read the
email and I have to come up

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.909
with a cockamamie lie.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.344
Look, I know this is
gonna sound crazy,

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:20.012 align:start size:88% position:13%
but you have to believe
me when I tell you

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:21.981
my writing partner is a monster.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.349 align:start size:88% position:13%
She hates when I discuss
business without her

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:26.786
so I had to make you look bad

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.523 align:start size:88% position:13%
in order for her to feel
like it was her idea

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:33.459
to use this song and I
hope you understand that.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.127
I told him, please read
the email, call me back,

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:37.763
you know, as soon as you do.

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:39.199
And I have not heard from him.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.701 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
Pro tip, if you wanna talk
(bleep) about an email

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:45.037
you've just received, why
not start a new thread,

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:46.139
start fresh.
