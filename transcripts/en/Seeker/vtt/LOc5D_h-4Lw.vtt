00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.330
Sometimes science is hands on.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.290
Really hands on.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.670
Hey everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.660
Rule 35 is: if it exists, there is a scientist
studying it.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.660
Rocks?

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.660
Got it.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.660
Space?

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.660
You bet.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.660
Rocks in space?

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.660
Oh yeah, someone is all over that.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.330
But sometimes, in the quest to seek out knowledge
wherever it may be hiding, scientists have

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.050
to get their hands dirty.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.110
And sticky.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.529
Sometimes they have to spank the monkey...literally.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.070
It’s not just done for enjoyment, although
I’m sure the monkey doesn’t mind.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.379
How orgasms fit into our evolution is still
a bit of a question mark.

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.059
What purpose do they serve?

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.679
Males orgasms are usually tied to a release
of sperm, so if ejaculating feels good in

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.199
the short term then it’s more likely to
breed more offspring long term.

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:49.249
That makes sense.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.829
But females can have offspring with or without
a climax, so why do they happen?

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:54.890
Explanations vary.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.719
Maybe the sensation is enjoyable enough that
seeking it out is worth the risk of copulating,

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.559
which leaves you a bit exposed to predators
in the wild.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.869
Or since humans start out developing the same
in the womb, the same structure that becomes

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.130
the penis in men is the clitoris in women,
so maybe it’s just vestigial.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.030
If that’s the case, is it only other primates
that have male and female orgasms?

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.039
Did it start with mammals 65 million years
ago or are there other animals that can experience

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:18.039
it too?

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.650
These are the questions scientists aim to
answer with their hands on experiments.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.670
Like in a 1981 Institute of Primate Studies
study where psychologist William Lemmon had

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.689
his grad student bring female chimps to orgasm
by hand.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.630
Or at least what they think was an orgasm,
based on the muscle contractions and facial

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.630
expressions.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.579
Of course they couldn’t ask the chimp directly
if it orgasmed, so it is possible it faked

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.280
it so it wouldn’t hurt his feelings.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.049
Either way I think we can all agree no one
has done more to earn a master's degree than

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.240
those students.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.499
They even reported one chimp climaxed on ten
separate occasions, which, ok, now you’re

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:52.700
just showing off.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.810
But even though it may sound silly, these
experiments demonstrated that yes, other female

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.770
primates can orgasm too, and the female orgasm
might be an evolutionary advantage we picked

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.790
up from a distant relative.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.840
Other times scientists *ahem* stimulate animals
because they just want to know what’s up

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.840
with animal sex.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.110
Like Patricia Brennan of Yale University who
wanted to know how ducks get down.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.260
Most birds mate by pressing rear ends together
and exchanging fluids.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.390
Not ducks.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.550
Ducks have crazy corkscrew penises that they
shoot out of their body.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.020
Female ducks have vaginas that can corkscrew
in the opposite direction.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.670
To see how that affected mating, Brennan waited
until a male was just about to mount a female,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.090
then quack jacked them, swapping the female
for one of 4 oddly shaped tubes.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.140
She found that certain shapes were much harder
for males to enter.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.290
She noted that a female that actually wants
to mate with a male can relax and position

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.620
itself to be more receptive, but otherwise
she can make it more difficult to copulate,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.680
avoiding unwanted fertilization.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.020
Ducks are among the 3% of bird species that
have penises, and one species, the red-billed

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.120
buffalo weaver, actually has a false penis
that serves no reproductive purpose.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.590
It has no sperm duct and doesn’t become
erect.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.650
Yet females seem to prefer males with larger
fake phalluses.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.570
And when it’s stimulated the males do seem
to achieve orgasm.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.260
How do scientists know this?

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.650
Because they did it themselves.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.650
Why it works?

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.650
They don’t know.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.650
More research is needed.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.380
Science isn’t all microscopes and behavior
observations.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.650
Sometimes to further scientific studies we
have to look closely at what we may see as

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.650
taboo.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.780
But remember, sex, orgasms and semen are part
of life.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.780
And understanding them will help us understand
us.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.980
Scientists aren’t just interested in the
orgasms, they also study sperm.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.690
And they’ve found some little swimmers that
went freestyle.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:48.940
Laci and Alex break it down here.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.030
Will it be you who boldly goes where no human
man has gone before?

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.490
Or would you rather not watch how they do
it on the Discovery Channel?
