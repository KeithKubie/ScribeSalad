00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.520
Now we're almost home free.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.500
So the first thing I want to point
out is that we can reintroduce these

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.090
absolute value signs without
killing anything, because we can.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.960
This was a positive quantity and so

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.740
taking the absolute
value doesn't change it.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.840
So the last little thing to point out
is it if we take the max of this same

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.820
quantities substituting in different
values of a, this can only get larger or

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.150
no smaller because this a that
we're maxing over includes a1.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.990
So we can definitely achieve
at least this value, but it's

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.240
possible that some other action will
let us achieve an even larger value.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.555
But by maxing, we can't have
it achieve a smaller value.

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:36.995
I mean it can achieve a smaller value.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:40.885
But it will at least the max will be
at least as big as what we get from a1.

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:41.405
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:44.755
with that in place that actually
completes the chain of inequalities from

00:00:44.755 --> 00:00:49.115
here to here so we get this non
expansion property for the max operator.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.810
Here the max operator is being used here

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.030
as sort of a way of summarizing
these functions F and G.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.020
&gt;&gt; Okay so let me just say that
last thing back to you to make

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.830
certain I've got it.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.060
So, I'm with you all the way
to F of A 1 minus G of A 1.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.840
You went to the absolute values sign,
that's pretty easy because you already

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.270
knew that value was positive, that
difference was positive by construction.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.530
And then that last step you noticed
that the difference between A1,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.140
F of A1 and G of A1- 1 is some number.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.740
You're maximizing all, over all possible
a's you could stick into f and g.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.200
It has to include a1 by definition,
which means the max might be bigger.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.505
But it couldn't be smaller than the a1,
and so

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.275
therefore, you're bounded from above.

00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:30.855
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

00:01:30.855 --> 00:01:31.405
Good, good, good.

00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:32.175
Yeah, well said.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:32.705
&gt;&gt; That's really cool.

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:34.950
Now I've forgotten why we did this.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.455
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I find that's often true for
me as well.

00:01:37.455 --> 00:01:40.965
This requires enough of my
attention that I lose context.

00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:44.245
But the context was
that we had this step

00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:46.795
in our proof that the Bellman
operator is a contraction.

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:53.550
We needed it to be true that summarizing
the Q values at a given state

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.610
using a max, was going to leave us with
something that is no farther apart

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.740
than the maximum difference between
the two functions that we started with.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.660
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Yeah, I remember that.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.030
Maybe you can show me
the equation again.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.690
&gt;&gt; And in particular, it was this
step right here where, essentially,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.470
we had to, one way to think about it is
move this max out of the absolute value.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.530
So if we compare that to what we just
proved, that that's what we did.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.260
We kind of moved the max
out of the absolute value.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.040
&gt;&gt; Right, that's awesome.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.650
Good.
Okay.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.184
So I get it.
So

00:02:24.184 --> 00:02:28.560
the Bellman operator is a contraction
operator value iteration works.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.950
&gt;&gt; Yes indeed.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.869
Now I went through a phase of my
life where I got really fixated on

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:39.080
non-expansion, and identified
a whole bunch of other operators

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.690
other than max that
are also non-expansions.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.050
And that actually gives us a way of
analyzing a whole bunch of other kinds

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.260
of decision processes.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.850
So not just these standard mark-off
decision properties where we're trying

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.210
to maximize expected reward, but
we can do a lot of other things and

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.590
this same kind of proof is
going to end up holding.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.010
So we're going to get back to that in
a moment, but first I want to talk about

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.750
how we use this property now that we've
established it to prove the convergence

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.110
of Q learning, to prove that
this interesting way of updating

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.850
the Q values over and over again In
the face of experience actually does,

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.840
in the limit, lead you to getting
the solution to the Bellman equation.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.340
&gt;&gt; Okay.
