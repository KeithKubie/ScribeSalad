00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.880
Being a teen can be an amazing time of discovery,
learning, and friendship, but it’s also

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.220
a time of rapid change, and emotional highs
and lows where things can feel really ‘tough’.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.190
So, what’s going on in our brains and bodies
that makes us feel this way? Why is being

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.740
a teen so hard?

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.160
We’re often told that the most important
years of brain development are between 0-5,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.820
although recent research has found adolescent
development to be equally important. During

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.640
childhood, our brains continually grow, generating
grey matter until they reach their maximum

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.780
size, which for girls is around age 12 and
boys around age 14. But even after this, the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.070
brain works to become more efficient by cutting
away unused grey matter that isn’t ‘exercised’

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.559
by experience, and at the same time increasing
myelin - fatty tissue that insulates brain

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:47.760
pathways.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.000
Puberty begins in the hypothalamus, where
a protein called kisspeptin is produced, triggering

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.180
the pituitary gland to unleash the hormones
testosterone, estrogen and progesterone. These

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.450
activate the ovaries and testes, but also
cause you to seek emotionally charged experiences

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.939
- whether it’s a movie to make you sob,
or driving 180 km/h down the freeway. It causes

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.409
your response to emotionally loaded images
or sounds to be more intense, which is why

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.359
listening to One Direction may produce large
bouts of the feels.

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:23.229
The area of the brain responsible for planning
ahead and assessing risk is still immature

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.240
in teenagers. Which is why teens are more
likely to participate in high risk behaviour

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.069
like unprotected sex and drinking and driving.
Interestingly, in a simulated driving experience,

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.340
adults and teens took the same amount of driving
risks while alone; however, when surrounded

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.539
by an audience of friends, teens took significantly
more risks while adults were unaffected. What’s

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.999
the benefit of this behaviour? Peer acceptance.

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:51.119
In a study where teens were asked to rank
music clips with and without knowing what

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.819
their peers picked, their choices changed.
Unlike small children and adults, feeling

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.509
socially isolated as a teen creates feelings
of intense unworthiness. This along with our

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.340
biology can contribute to teens prioritizing
friends over even family. As social animals,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.930
stepping outside the safety of our family
creates genetically diverse populations, diminishing

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.319
the likliness of inbreeding. In fact, teens
have heightened social abilities like processing

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.459
and evaluating facial expressions better than
other age groups, allowing teens to be extremely

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.689
cognisant of friends joy, sadness, or stress.

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.060
Speaking of stress, the hormone released in
stressful situations to help sooth the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.650
brain cells of children and adults has the
opposite impact on teens, causing an increase

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.750
in anxiety. Pair that with a change in circadian
rhythms making you to want to wake three to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.569
four hours later than adults, it’s no wonder
some people describe teens as emotionally

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.599
‘moody’.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.769
On the other hand, teens are very physically
healthy. The immune system is highly functioning,

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.700
teens have increased tolerance to temperature
changes and a high resistance to cancer. But

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.670
despite physical fitness, records show that
death rates increase by 200-300% after childhood

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.579
due to motor vehicle accidents, homicide and
suicide. Several mental illnesses emerge,

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.379
during adolescence such as anxiety, depression
and eating disorders. Scientists believe that

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.420
the many changes in white matter, grey matter,
and connections in the brain may be to blame,

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.920
with an increased risk of errors during this
time.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.019
But with a greater number of synaptic connections,
and increased plasticity, the teenage brain

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.180
is primed to learn quickly and memorize content
fast. Unlike an older brain, rooted in what

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.420
it knows, teens can respond easily to their
environment and make incredible strides in

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.749
communication and socialization. Not to mention
being passionate is incredibly valuable and

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:39.750
taking risks is often what is needed to make
changes in your life and the lives of others

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.569
- being a teen can be tough, but it can also
be amazing.

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.930

super fans and become obsessed with their
