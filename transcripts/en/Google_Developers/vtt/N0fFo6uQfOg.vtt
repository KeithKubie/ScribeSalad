BEN MORRIS: Hey, I'm Ben
Morris from the AMP Team.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.030
We're live here at AMP
Conference 2018 right

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.157
here in Amsterdam.

00:00:06.157 --> 00:00:08.490
It's been a big day full of
some exciting announcements,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.695
some major news.

00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:11.070
Let's see some of
the highlights.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.268
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.430
SPEAKER 1: Today we're launching
both a developer preview

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.150
on AMP site, and
there's going to be

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.349
surfacing of these
stories in Google Search.

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.640
SPEAKER 2: So I'm also really
excited to announce today

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.280
that we're releasing the
AMP-Toolbox-Optimizer which

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.960
is basically a tool
kit that developers

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.180
can use to optimize
AMP documents served

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.169
from their origin.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:38.210
SPEAKER 1: I'm super
excited to announce that AMP

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.675
is, in fact, coming to email.

00:00:39.675 --> 00:00:41.800
SPEAKER 3: So imagine that
you could complete tasks

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.750
directly inside of your email.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.460
So with AMP for email,
users can quickly

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.980
take actions on things
like RSVPing to an event.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.425
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:55.865 --> 00:00:58.365
SPEAKER 4: Now, as we do with
many new experimental features

00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:00.600
in AMP, we have
collaborated with publishers

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.690
to help innovate in this space
with the goal of building

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.330
a storage format for
rich storytelling.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.830
SPEAKER 3: By
bringing AMP to email,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.704
we open up a whole new
world of possibilities

00:01:09.704 --> 00:01:11.460
for what can happen
inside of email

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.680
and a whole world of
possibilities for users

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.087
to engage with your content.

00:01:15.087 --> 00:01:16.920
SPEAKER 2: So one of
the biggest initiatives

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.290
has been to expand AMP
experiences from just

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.180
organic to paid as well.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.650
And last year, the
[INAUDIBLE] team

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.210
launched their AMP experience
where clicking on ads

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.800
will now lead you to AMP pages.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.760
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.720
SPEAKER 5: Overall development
time and workflow was just way

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.630
easier having the full
AMP site and just the one

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.890
source of truth for the site.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.530
So for example,
bringing it back again

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.040
to my time working on
Buzzfeed, the article pages,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.690
comparing it to Tasty, the
bill time we see 85% faster

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.880
build time, the webpack build.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.770
SPEAKER 6: Well, we
want to allow all of you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.990
to write JavaScript
in AMP documents.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.540
So, all this JavaScript will
run in a web world grid.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.290
BEN MORRIS: And those
were some highlights

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.809
from day one of AMP Conf.

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:06.475
To see more of the
talks in more detail,

00:02:06.475 --> 00:02:09.229
just to subscribe to
the AMP Channel and tune

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.610
in tomorrow for live
coverage of day two.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.430
Thanks a lot.
