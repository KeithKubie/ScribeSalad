time so the intuition behind the blue

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730
time so the intuition behind the blue
 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.880
time so the intuition behind the blue
score is we're going to look at the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890
score is we're going to look at the
 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.580
score is we're going to look at the
machine generated output and see if the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590
machine generated output and see if the
 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.580
machine generated output and see if the
types of words it generates appear in at

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590
types of words it generates appear in at
 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.640
types of words it generates appear in at
least one of the human generated

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650
least one of the human generated
 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.599
least one of the human generated
references and so these human generative

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609
references and so these human generative
 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.550
references and so these human generative
references would be provided as part of

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560
references would be provided as part of
 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.400
references would be provided as part of
the deaf set or as part of the test sent

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410
the deaf set or as part of the test sent
 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.650

now let's look at a somewhat extreme

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660
now let's look at a somewhat extreme
 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.599
now let's look at a somewhat extreme
example let's say that the machine

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609
example let's say that the machine
 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.620
example let's say that the machine
translation system abbreviating machine

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630
translation system abbreviating machine
 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.539
translation system abbreviating machine
translation is empty so the machine

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549
translation is empty so the machine
 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.539
translation is empty so the machine
translation of the MT outputs is dddd

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549
translation of the MT outputs is dddd
 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.699
translation of the MT outputs is dddd
dddd so this is a clearly pretty

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709
dddd so this is a clearly pretty
 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.809
dddd so this is a clearly pretty
terrible translation so one way to

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819
terrible translation so one way to
 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.229
terrible translation so one way to
measure how good the machine translation

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239
measure how good the machine translation
 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.140
measure how good the machine translation
output is is to look at each the words

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150
output is is to look at each the words
 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.440
output is is to look at each the words
in the output and see if it appears in

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450
in the output and see if it appears in
 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.610
in the output and see if it appears in
the references and so this would be

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620
the references and so this would be
 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.099
the references and so this would be
called a precision of the machine

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109
called a precision of the machine
 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.319
called a precision of the machine
translation output and in this case

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329
translation output and in this case
 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.310
translation output and in this case
there are seven words in the machine

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320
there are seven words in the machine
 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.890
there are seven words in the machine
translation output and every one of

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900
translation output and every one of
 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.650
translation output and every one of
these seven

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660
these seven
 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.990
these seven
appears in either reference 1 or

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000
appears in either reference 1 or
 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.280
appears in either reference 1 or
reference to right so the were--they

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290
reference to right so the were--they
 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.350
reference to right so the were--they
appears in both references so each of

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360
appears in both references so each of
 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.850
appears in both references so each of
these words looks like a pretty good

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860
these words looks like a pretty good
 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.380
these words looks like a pretty good
word to include so this will have a

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390
word to include so this will have a
 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.100
word to include so this will have a
precision of 7 over 7 it looks like

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110
precision of 7 over 7 it looks like
 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.110
precision of 7 over 7 it looks like
there's a great position so this is why

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120
there's a great position so this is why
 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.740
there's a great position so this is why
the basic precision measure of what

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750
the basic precision measure of what
 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.330
the basic precision measure of what
fraction of the words in the empty

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340
fraction of the words in the empty
 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.640
fraction of the words in the empty
output also appear in the references

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650
output also appear in the references
 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.900
output also appear in the references
this is not a particularly useful

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910
this is not a particularly useful
 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.760
this is not a particularly useful
measure because it seems to imply that

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770
measure because it seems to imply that
 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.949
measure because it seems to imply that
this empty output has very high

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959
this empty output has very high
 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.410
this empty output has very high
precision so instead what we're going to

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420
precision so instead what we're going to
 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.040
precision so instead what we're going to
use is a modified precision measure in

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050
use is a modified precision measure in
 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.910
use is a modified precision measure in
which we will give each word credit only

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920
which we will give each word credit only
 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.670
which we will give each word credit only
up to the maximum number of times it

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680
up to the maximum number of times it
 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.600
up to the maximum number of times it
appears in the reference sentences so in

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610
appears in the reference sentences so in
 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.060
appears in the reference sentences so in
reference 1 the were--they appears twice

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070
reference 1 the were--they appears twice
 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.820
reference 1 the were--they appears twice
in reference to that where the appears

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830
in reference to that where the appears
 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.380
in reference to that where the appears
just once so 2 is bigger than 1 and so

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390
just once so 2 is bigger than 1 and so
 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.110
just once so 2 is bigger than 1 and so
we're going to say that the word D gets

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120
we're going to say that the word D gets
 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.010
we're going to say that the word D gets
credit up to twice so with a modified

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020
credit up to twice so with a modified
 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.420
credit up to twice so with a modified
precision we will say that it gets a

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430
precision we will say that it gets a
 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.570
precision we will say that it gets a
school of two out of seven because out

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580
school of two out of seven because out
 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.380
school of two out of seven because out
of seven words will give it a two credit

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390
of seven words will give it a two credit
 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.960
of seven words will give it a two credit
or four appearing so here the

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970
or four appearing so here the
 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.050
or four appearing so here the
denominator is the count of the number

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060
denominator is the count of the number
 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.310
denominator is the count of the number
of times the word

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320
of times the word
 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.800
of times the word
D appears the seven words in total and

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810
D appears the seven words in total and
 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.130
D appears the seven words in total and
the numerator is the count of the number

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140
the numerator is the count of the number
 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.460
the numerator is the count of the number
of times the word D appears but we clip

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470
of times the word D appears but we clip
 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.500
of times the word D appears but we clip
discount and we take a max or a clip

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510
discount and we take a max or a clip
 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.610
discount and we take a max or a clip
discount at two so this gives us the

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620
discount at two so this gives us the
 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.940
discount at two so this gives us the
modified precision measure now so far

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950
modified precision measure now so far
 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.590
modified precision measure now so far
we've been looking at words in isolation

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600
we've been looking at words in isolation
 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.990
we've been looking at words in isolation
in the blue school you don't want to

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000
in the blue school you don't want to
 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.120
in the blue school you don't want to
just look at isolated worse you maybe

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130
just look at isolated worse you maybe
 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.130
just look at isolated worse you maybe
want to look at pairs of words as well

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140
want to look at pairs of words as well
 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.190
want to look at pairs of words as well
let's define a portion of the blue

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200
let's define a portion of the blue
 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.860
let's define a portion of the blue
school on by grams and by Grim's just

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870
school on by grams and by Grim's just
 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.870
school on by grams and by Grim's just
means pairs of words appearing next to

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880
means pairs of words appearing next to
 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.980
means pairs of words appearing next to
each other so now let's see how we could

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990
each other so now let's see how we could
 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.250
each other so now let's see how we could
use diagrams to define the blues

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260
use diagrams to define the blues
 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.070
use diagrams to define the blues
and this would just be a portion of the

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080
and this would just be a portion of the
 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.380
and this would just be a portion of the
final blue school and would take uni

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390
final blue school and would take uni
 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.060
final blue school and would take uni
grams or single words as well as by

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070
grams or single words as well as by
 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.310
grams or single words as well as by
grams which means pairs of words in to

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320
grams which means pairs of words in to
 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.640
grams which means pairs of words in to
count as was maybe even longer sequences

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650
count as was maybe even longer sequences
 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.160
count as was maybe even longer sequences
worse such as trigrams which means three

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.170
worse such as trigrams which means three
 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.170
worse such as trigrams which means three
words appearing together so um let's

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180
words appearing together so um let's
 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.510
words appearing together so um let's
continue our example from before we have

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520
continue our example from before we have
 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.910
continue our example from before we have
the same reference 1 in reference to but

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920
the same reference 1 in reference to but
 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.800
the same reference 1 in reference to but
now let's say the machine translation of

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810
now let's say the machine translation of
 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.560
now let's say the machine translation of
the MT system has a slightly better

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570
the MT system has a slightly better
 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.870
the MT system has a slightly better
output the Catholic hat on the man still

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880
output the Catholic hat on the man still
 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.310
output the Catholic hat on the man still
no the great translation but maybe

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320
no the great translation but maybe
 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.400
no the great translation but maybe
better than the last one

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410
better than the last one
 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.440
better than the last one
so here the possible Barry Grahams are

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450
so here the possible Barry Grahams are
 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.860
so here the possible Barry Grahams are
well there's the cat gonna ignore case

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870
well there's the cat gonna ignore case
 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.500
well there's the cat gonna ignore case
and then there's caddy there's another

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510
and then there's caddy there's another
 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.040
and then there's caddy there's another
diagram and then there's D cats again

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050
diagram and then there's D cats again
 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.260
diagram and then there's D cats again
but I've already had that so let's skip

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270
but I've already had that so let's skip
 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.710
but I've already had that so let's skip
that and then cat on the next one and

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720
that and then cat on the next one and
 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.380
that and then cat on the next one and
then on the andaman so these are the

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390
then on the andaman so these are the
 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.640
then on the andaman so these are the
diagrams in the machine translation

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650
diagrams in the machine translation
 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:08.020
diagrams in the machine translation
output and so let's count up how many

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030
output and so let's count up how many
 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.810
output and so let's count up how many
times each of these diagrams appear the

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:10.820
times each of these diagrams appear the
 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.870
times each of these diagrams appear the
cat appears twice caddy appears once and

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:13.880
cat appears twice caddy appears once and
 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.100
cat appears twice caddy appears once and
the others or peer just once and then

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110
the others or peer just once and then
 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.670
the others or peer just once and then
finally let's define the clip count so

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680
finally let's define the clip count so
 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.320
finally let's define the clip count so
count and then subscript clip and to

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.330
count and then subscript clip and to
 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.150
count and then subscript clip and to
define that let's take this column of

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160
define that let's take this column of
 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.670
define that let's take this column of
numbers but give our algorithm credit

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680
numbers but give our algorithm credit
 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.010
numbers but give our algorithm credit
only up to the maximum number of times

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.020
only up to the maximum number of times
 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.190
only up to the maximum number of times
that that diagram appears in either

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:35.200
that that diagram appears in either
 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.870
that that diagram appears in either
reference 1 or reference to so the cat

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880
reference 1 or reference to so the cat
 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.680
reference 1 or reference to so the cat
appears a maximum of once in either of

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:44.690
appears a maximum of once in either of
 

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.510
appears a maximum of once in either of
the references so with a clip that

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520
the references so with a clip that
 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.630
the references so with a clip that
counts of one cat V well it doesn't

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:49.640
counts of one cat V well it doesn't
 

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.910
counts of one cat V well it doesn't
appear in reference 1 or reference to so

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:51.920
appear in reference 1 or reference to so
 

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.080
appear in reference 1 or reference to so
clip that to zero cats on yep that

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.090
clip that to zero cats on yep that
 

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.880
clip that to zero cats on yep that
appears once we give it credit for once

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:57.890
appears once we give it credit for once
 

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.730
appears once we give it credit for once
on D appears once give that credit for

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:00.740
on D appears once give that credit for
 

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.400
on D appears once give that credit for
once and d-mat appears once so these are

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:03.410
once and d-mat appears once so these are
 

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.110
once and d-mat appears once so these are
the clipped accounts which taking all

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120
the clipped accounts which taking all
 

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.460
the clipped accounts which taking all
the counts and clipping them video

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:08.470
the counts and clipping them video
 

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.590
the counts and clipping them video
reducing them to be no more than the

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:11.600
reducing them to be no more than the
 

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.710
reducing them to be no more than the
number of times that

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720
number of times that
 

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.930
number of times that
appears in at least one of the

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:14.940
appears in at least one of the
 

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:21.290
appears in at least one of the
references and then finally our modified

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:21.300
references and then finally our modified
 

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.980
references and then finally our modified
by Graham precision will be the sum of

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:24.990
by Graham precision will be the sum of
 

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.260
by Graham precision will be the sum of
the count clips so that's one two three

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:27.270
the count clips so that's one two three
 

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.460
the count clips so that's one two three
four divided by the total number by

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:31.470
four divided by the total number by
 

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.940
four divided by the total number by
runners that's two three four five six

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:34.950
runners that's two three four five six
 

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.529
runners that's two three four five six
so for the six or two-thirds is the

00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:38.539
so for the six or two-thirds is the
 

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:44.630
so for the six or two-thirds is the
modified precision on diagrams so let's

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640
modified precision on diagrams so let's
 

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.770
modified precision on diagrams so let's
just formalize this a little bit further

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:47.780
just formalize this a little bit further
 

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.860
just formalize this a little bit further
with what we had developed with on uni

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:51.870
with what we had developed with on uni
 

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.060
with what we had developed with on uni
grams we define this modified precision

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.070
grams we define this modified precision
 

00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.230
grams we define this modified precision
computed on uni grams as P subscript 1

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240
computed on uni grams as P subscript 1
 

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.600
computed on uni grams as P subscript 1
so P sensor precision and the subscript

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:02.610
so P sensor precision and the subscript
 

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.880
so P sensor precision and the subscript
1 here means we're referring to uni

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:04.890
1 here means we're referring to uni
 

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.700
1 here means we're referring to uni
grams but that is defined as sum over

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:07.710
grams but that is defined as sum over

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.530
good the blue score gives you a way to
evaluate that automatically and

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540
evaluate that automatically and
 

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.480
evaluate that automatically and
therefore speed up your alfred big

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:20.490
therefore speed up your alfred big
 

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.970
therefore speed up your alfred big
development so with that I hope you have

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980
development so with that I hope you have
 

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.200
development so with that I hope you have
a sense of how the blue score works
