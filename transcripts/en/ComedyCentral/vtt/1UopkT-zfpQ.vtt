00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.280
- Our weapons are,

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.830
he has decided to use a bo staff.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:04.960
- That's good, but like,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.483
what are you really
gonna do with a bo staff?

00:00:06.483 --> 00:00:07.890
- I mean, I can't believe you're gonna be

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.331
challenged on your own
radio show like this.

00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:10.820
- I start twirling that thing around,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.588
it is gonna disturb people.

00:00:12.588 --> 00:00:13.421
- It's a baton, like a--
- It's a deterrent.

00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:15.781
- It's like a cheer squad
in a parade or something.

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:18.708
(heavy guitar riff)

00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:19.541
(cracking)

00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:20.374
- Hey, it's The Bonfire,

00:00:20.374 --> 00:00:23.000
Comedy Central Radio, Sirius XM 95.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.100
Start doing some shoulder punches,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.933
just shut up.

00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:26.766
I'm Dan Soder,

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.160
and that stupid hunk of man

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.110
is Big Jay Oakerson, ugh.
- So sticky.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.410
- We are women reborn,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.490
on the dawn of seeing
Florence and the Machine.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.530
It was a real awakening for us, Lou.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.810
I have to say, you missed out.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.320
- What did I miss?

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.623
- Oh, crazy times.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.048
I, it should have been
called Period the Musical.

00:00:47.048 --> 00:00:48.049
- Yeah.

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.882
(laughing)

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:49.715
- It felt like,

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.580
the way that Florence
ran around the stage,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.300
it felt like when one
of your little cousins

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.280
makes the whole family
watch her sing a song,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.950
and they just like, jump around,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.160
and you're like, yay!

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.137
And she's like, ahh!

00:01:00.137 --> 00:01:01.310
And it's like, you know, kind of,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.920
but she also can sing like a motherfucker.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.200
- For everything in the world,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.350
as you need now a nice hot disclaimer,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.640
her voice is amazing.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.941
- Yeah.

00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:11.941
- She's a great frontwoman, frontperson.

00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:14.258
- Stage design was cool as shit.

00:01:14.258 --> 00:01:15.466
- Stage design's cool,

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.890
her voice is next level,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.017
and her performance is,

00:01:18.017 --> 00:01:19.800
and what she gives for the fans,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.880
- Yeah, fantastic.
- fantastic.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.310
- The music's not my cup of tea.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.440
- Yeah, music's not your,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.160
it was fun to watch you at certain points.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.860
I knew which moments, I
think I know you well enough

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.720
that I know which moments
were the eye rolling

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.920
back in the head where she's like,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.500
I want you to look at everyone,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.920
and everyone, we are all loved,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.102
and I could just feel Jay's eyes--

00:01:40.102 --> 00:01:41.139
I tell you where she's
coming from the intro,

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:42.820
the opening after her first song she goes,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.190
we are Florence and the Machine.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.046
She goes, you all please
dance with us tonight.

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:51.424
- Ugh, yeah, that's not--
- Ick.

00:01:51.424 --> 00:01:53.210
- Yeah, I knew that--

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.990
- Would you guys like to dance with us?

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.670
- Then I said--
- We were all very excited

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.420
that we were about to be at a sit concert

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.660
and then she instructed
everyone to stand up

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.730
and then 99.8% women that were there,

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.730
- Yeah.
- all obliged.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.440
- I was gonna say, I leaned over to Ari

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.964
when she said, "we are
Florence and the Machine."

00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:11.548
Listen, how cool would it
be if a bird just ran out.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:12.498
(laughing)

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:13.700
Everybody's like, yeah.
- Yeah.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.310
- Sober October.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.230
Just not gettin' drunk.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.733
You're like birds!

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:19.470
Birds on tour with Florence!

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.714
That was the machine the whole time!

00:02:21.714 --> 00:02:22.770
(high pitched mimicking)

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.834
Is that a bird?

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:25.423
- Is that a bird, who?

00:02:28.576 --> 00:02:30.850
She's like, she would
hate me, the human being.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.780
She shouldn't, but she would.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.940
That's the overwhelming
feeling I got at that concert

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.150
when she talked to the crowd.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.939
- The part that made us really laugh is

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:37.980
there was a part, she was doing a song

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.550
off of her new album called, "Patricia,"

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.390
which is dedicated to Patty Smith

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.897
and she said, "it's about Patty Smith.

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:44.957
"Well the beginning and the ending are.

00:02:44.957 --> 00:02:48.340
"The middle's about toxic masculinity."

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.700
And so we were like,
me and Ari were joking.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.080
We just kicked Jay down the stairs.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.210
We were like, sacrifice him!

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.068
(laughing)

00:02:54.068 --> 00:02:55.193
We run!

00:02:55.193 --> 00:02:56.310
You feed on him!

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.850
Feed on him, he's a man!

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.810
A bad man!

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.643
- Did you hear I do it to you?

00:02:59.643 --> 00:03:02.377
I always do it to Christie
when she goes, "I like

00:03:02.377 --> 00:03:05.591
"being in a place where
there's not toxic masculinity."

00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:06.967
- I was like, "suck my dick you bitch.

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:08.657
"Make me a sandwich you dumb whore.

00:03:08.657 --> 00:03:09.980
"Suck my dick."

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.630
- That's right, wearing no shoes.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.930
You shouldn't be out of the kitchen.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.097
Just bring a 1950s dad in to a Florence

00:03:15.097 --> 00:03:16.380
and the Machine concert.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.690
- So, to bring up that
moment, what I think

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.550
the, my grand scheme
problem with the world

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.630
as it is, stands today,
- Yeah.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.050
- is so many people at that concert,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.310
including, I believe, Florence herself,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.880
would absolutely call
me toxic masculinity,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.750
but they're just aiming their, they put

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.500
the wrong people in their crosshairs

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.337
for stuff like that.

00:03:37.337 --> 00:03:38.600
I'm not in their crosshairs.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.850
I'm not popular enough, but--

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.550
- You're also at a Florence
and the Machine concert.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.420
- Absolutely, but I'm just saying the idea

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.080
that it's a room full of people.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.240
One of my biggest gripes,
I'll use this example a lot,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.460
is I'm a person that goes, again, dude, we

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.497
should try having a
broad in the White House.

00:03:53.497 --> 00:03:54.863
Get a chick in the
fucking White House, man.

00:03:54.863 --> 00:03:57.370
See how it goes and they go, a chick!

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.300
A broad!

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.070
And you're like, I'm just trying to say

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.950
the funniest word, man.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.652
I'm with you, I'm on your team.

00:04:02.652 --> 00:04:03.690
- Yeah, yeah.
- But it's like you

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.080
have to fight through all that.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.990
- It's like you're upset at the present

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.659
even though the present is what you want

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:10.492
because you don't like the wrapping paper.

00:04:10.492 --> 00:04:12.020
- Absolutely, I want to get into it more.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.988
Maybe we can get into
it with our guest, even,

00:04:13.988 --> 00:04:15.030
- Yeah.
- But our first guest is here.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.630
First of two guests we
have today coming in.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.530
- Yeah.
- He's coming into

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.085
the studio now, very excited to see him.

00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:22.640
- How are ya'?

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.810
- People smoking in here?

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.383
- No.
- No, not on camera.

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:27.510
- Not on camera.
- It's camera day.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.650
- When the camera's cut, you can.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.583
- Okay, well I know the camera cut

00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:32.227
'cuz it smells wonderful in here.

00:04:32.227 --> 00:04:33.060
- Oh yeah.
- Oh, that's probably us

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.710
as people.
- Yeah.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.140
- Everybody, from Blues Traveler

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.550
and more notably, ZRock where he played

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.930
the character of John Popper,

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.763
(laughing)

00:04:42.763 --> 00:04:44.089
here's my buddy John Popper, everyone!

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:45.428
(applauding)

00:04:45.428 --> 00:04:47.248
- Yeah, welcome to The
Bonfire, John Popper.

00:04:47.248 --> 00:04:48.081
- Good to be here at The Bonfire.

00:04:48.081 --> 00:04:48.914
- Yeah.
- Just getting warm.

00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:50.610
- Just warm on up, dude.
- Ah.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.357
- You're on the radio tour today, huh?

00:04:52.357 --> 00:04:54.250
- Yes, yes, doing the whole, you know--

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.800
- Is it like you're running for Senate?

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.216
- It's a little like a gang bang.

00:04:58.216 --> 00:04:59.049
(laughing)

00:04:59.049 --> 00:04:59.980
- Like a Houston one?

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.813
- Sort of.

00:05:00.813 --> 00:05:01.820
- The old school one where
they like put ice packs

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.653
on her and stuff?

00:05:02.653 --> 00:05:06.060
- Yeah, will no lube at all, just dry.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.210
- A guy in a fucking gas station shirt

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.877
coming in pantsless.

00:05:09.877 --> 00:05:12.190
- Somebody who looks a little like guilty

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.030
but also like gleefully, like dazed.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.210
- Yeah, I think that's who we are

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.417
in this radio gang bang, 'cuz we're

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:19.370
the guy that comes in
with his t-shirt still on.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.770
We're like, oh, big fan of your work.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.000
- Smell of skin and friction and salt.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.680
- Oh yeah, my t-shirt's on and my dick's

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.011
just coming through the pee hole.

00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:28.490
- Yeah.
- I'm not gonna show you

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.052
a gunt at a gang bang
with all those abs there.

00:05:31.052 --> 00:05:32.966
- Oh, let your gunt fly free, come on.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:33.799
(laughing)

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:35.210
- I'm gonna old.
- It could be a new sex organ.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.850
- I'm starting therapy on Friday,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.420
so we're gonna see if I
can get there actually.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.253
- I like that.
- Wait a minute.

00:05:39.253 --> 00:05:40.600
You're starting therapy on Friday?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.960
- Can you believe it, I know.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.314
Yeah, about 15 years late.

00:05:43.314 --> 00:05:44.410
(laughing)

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.240
- I would say.
- Most definitely.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.140
- Easily 15 years.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.720
- Easily 15 years late, absolutely.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.760
Dan's been pushing me for awhile.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.990
- I've been pushing a lot.
- Finally.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.260
- Yeah, I always tell
him go talk to someone.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.093
- Yeah.
- He had to take me

00:05:56.093 --> 00:05:56.926
to see Florence and the Machine last night

00:05:56.926 --> 00:05:57.955
'til I realized it was necessary.

00:05:57.955 --> 00:05:59.430
- I got, you got a lot of stuff there.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.980
I got, what's floating around in you, Jay?

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.750
He goes, "anger."

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.960
- Florence and the Machine will do that

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.380
to people, though.
- Boy, it sure will.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.680
- Yeah.
- I walked out of there,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.870
went home and immediately shaved

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.550
a Hitler mustache into my pubes.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.710
It was such a, it was such a celebration

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.550
of woman in that place.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.550
- And her band of therapists, actually.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.330
- Yes, at about the seventh song in,

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.170
there was a, just a procession of dudes

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.820
just running out of the general admission

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.770
and it was like seven to one, guys leaving

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.237
and like a girl behind going,
"but I just wanna watch

00:06:29.237 --> 00:06:30.284
"one more song."

00:06:30.284 --> 00:06:31.314
(laughing)

00:06:31.314 --> 00:06:32.170
- Ah, there you go.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.130
- I hung in there the whole time

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.094
while Christine danced like a gypsy queen.

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:36.084
- Nice!

00:06:36.084 --> 00:06:36.917
(laughing)

00:06:36.917 --> 00:06:37.750
- By the way, Jay called something--

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.600
- That's why you hung in there.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.160
- Jay called something
on the show yesterday.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.220
He said whenever Christine
gets into a song--

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.053
- I didn't say that.

00:06:43.053 --> 00:06:44.070
I said how long do you think,

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.190
what's the over or under

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.880
before you look over and
see Christine like this?

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.590
Hands clasps, not clasped,
like in a praying motion

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.672
in front of her, just with her mouth open,

00:06:52.672 --> 00:06:54.450
like half mimicking the songs.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.280
- And he just, he nudged, like song two,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.340
he just nudges me.
- Like doing

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.930
a faux Indian dance?

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:59.763
Is that what it is?

00:06:59.763 --> 00:07:00.806
- No.
- I don't know what to do

00:07:00.806 --> 00:07:02.514
with my hands, so I hold them there.

00:07:02.514 --> 00:07:04.424
- Just like the I Dream of Jeanie thing?

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.582
- Yeah.
- No, it's more of

00:07:05.582 --> 00:07:06.754
a pointing you forward
just like she's trying

00:07:06.754 --> 00:07:10.743
to shoot her heart beams to the stage.

00:07:10.743 --> 00:07:11.677
- Ah.
- I'm just trying

00:07:11.677 --> 00:07:12.510
to accept love.
- Yes.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.870
- I was a wiccan ceremony.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.090
- When you look out,
when you're performing

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.390
and you look out, do you
ever see people dancing

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.223
in the audience, like
what the fuck is that?

00:07:18.223 --> 00:07:20.285
- Yes and that's why I
try never to look out.

00:07:20.285 --> 00:07:21.314
(laughing)

00:07:21.314 --> 00:07:22.200
- You have to look over their heads?

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.408
- Yes.
- That's what I do

00:07:23.408 --> 00:07:24.358
when I'm on stage.
- Keep 'em shut.

00:07:24.358 --> 00:07:25.340
Just keep 'em shut.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.812
Just wish 'em into the corn field.

00:07:26.812 --> 00:07:27.645
(laughs)

00:07:27.645 --> 00:07:28.478
- Oh yeah, Blue Traveler's show.

00:07:28.478 --> 00:07:30.570
I bet you get a nice, weird, just

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.220
a ginger girl, just rippin' loose

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.210
in the middle of a
circle that no one, she's

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.340
not really dancin' to the song itself.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.760
- It's all off rhythm.
- My favorite is from

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.800
a long time ago, back when people

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.256
would play, you'd dance at our level.

00:07:42.256 --> 00:07:43.089
- Yeah.
- We didn't have

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:46.531
a stage yet and there's
this hip hop guy poppin'

00:07:46.531 --> 00:07:48.014
and lockin' and then

00:07:48.014 --> 00:07:48.950
(laughing)

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.730
there's this hippy chick doin' her weird

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.880
ever expanding angles thing

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.070
and they'd bump into each other.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.120
They've got their eyes closed

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.260
and they're all into their thing

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.343
and they bump into each
other, oh excuse me,

00:07:58.343 --> 00:07:59.176
and they're like so polite.

00:07:59.176 --> 00:08:00.410
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.980
- Pardon me, no pardon me.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.140
- Exactly, it was awesome.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.790
- Oh, let me forgive you as I robot.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.145
- They both broke
character, it was wonderful.

00:08:07.145 --> 00:08:08.314
(laughing)

00:08:08.314 --> 00:08:09.500
It was a beautiful moment.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.333
- Have you ever seen someone dance

00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:11.166
and be like, that guy's in trouble.

00:08:11.166 --> 00:08:12.370
We need to stop, like he's fucked up.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.810
We need to--
- yeah, I think once

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.500
or twice I said stop, and
said wait, dude, stop it.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.704
Dude, just stop that.

00:08:17.704 --> 00:08:18.537
(laughing)

00:08:18.537 --> 00:08:19.370
(claps)

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.588
- Do you have a spritz bottle, like a cat?

00:08:20.588 --> 00:08:22.213
- Stop it, stop it!

00:08:22.213 --> 00:08:23.803
- Do you have ear buds in?

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:25.130
What the fuck are you listening to?

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.260
- The worst is throwin' harmonicas

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.610
in the crowd because you
always invariably throw

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.650
to the tiny little girl--
- Yeah.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.210
- The little hippy chick
who already created

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.954
this idea that she's like, oh, she's

00:08:33.954 --> 00:08:35.360
a little, beautiful hippy chick

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.219
and two frat guys--

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:38.420
(laughing drowns out speaking)

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.593
her head on each side
with an elbow to get it

00:08:40.593 --> 00:08:43.410
and you see her go blank
and there's nothing

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:44.660
in that brain going on anymore

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.140
and she goes down and
dissolves into the crowd

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.010
and here's the scary part,
you never see her again.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.670
- Oh no.
- Not even a stain

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.610
on the floor, like where did she go.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:53.922
What happened to her?

00:08:53.922 --> 00:08:54.890
- That bitch got fuckin' blood

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.480
on my co-ed naked LaCrosse shirt.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.487
- Ah, dude, that sucks.

00:08:58.487 --> 00:09:02.140
- Dude, my Jordans are ruined.
- Oh, bro.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.700
Dude, I love hooks, so
I fuckin' elbowed her.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.030
I smashed her for the harmonica.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.120
- That harmonica, it's gonna be on

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.990
the mantle of Phi Beta Kappa.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.991
- Right.
- Dude, I killed

00:09:10.991 --> 00:09:12.296
a woman to get that.

00:09:12.296 --> 00:09:14.270
(laughing)

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.300
- It's from the he-man himself.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.840
- Dude man, Whopper threw
it out there, I fuckin'

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.690
went elbows to head, run our test.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.230
- He goes, you can see that's
her teeth marks still in it

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.370
from when I jarred her
when I started playing it.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.230
- I swear to God, I've had people with

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.360
a bloody impression of a
harmonica on their forehead

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.540
and go, dude, I totally
caught one of your harps.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.200
- Yeah.
- What a fun instrument

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.100
that can turn so violent
when you're just trying

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.090
to give it away.
- Yes, it's

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.240
the throwing star of the performing world.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.868
Yeah, it's The Bonfire,
Comedy Central radio series.

00:09:40.868 --> 00:09:43.987
XM95, Big Jay Oakerson and Dan Soder.

00:09:43.987 --> 00:09:46.380
Big John Popper's gonna
join us back again.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.420
- Dan says rippin' a butt.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.253
- He's rippin' a butt.

00:09:48.253 --> 00:09:50.410
He left us, he left the
harmonica in his place

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.600
though, which is really bad ass.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.034
- It's weird listening to this song

00:09:53.034 --> 00:09:54.530
and looking at the
harmonica and you're like,

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:55.584
is it gonna wake up?

00:09:55.584 --> 00:09:56.460
(laughing)

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.980
Is this thing haunted?

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.370
- Also joining us in the
studio, his new film Eight Grade

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.120
is out now that he directed.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.930
So cool to watch all these
things happening for him.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.510
It's Bo Burnam joins us in the studio.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.000
- Oh.
- Thanks for having me, guys.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.380
- We've been wanting to
have you on for awhile.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.213
- Yeah.
- So, it's awesome.

00:10:10.213 --> 00:10:11.046
I'm glad to be here.

00:10:11.046 --> 00:10:11.960
- Yeah, dude, thanks for coming on, man.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.130
You've known Jay a long time.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.400
- Yeah, since I was seven, 17, right?

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.370
- 16 or 17.
- 'Cuz it was before

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.240
Just For Laughs that year.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.120
So many June or May or April.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.610
I was there with my, we went to London.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:25.443
- Yeah, we went to London, did

00:10:25.443 --> 00:10:27.020
the World Stands Up.
- World Stands Up.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.704
It was at a festival, what was it?

00:10:28.704 --> 00:10:30.227
- No, it was a weird, like--
- TV show.

00:10:30.227 --> 00:10:32.950
- Like a British premium
blend or something.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.361
- Okay.
- We get everyone

00:10:34.361 --> 00:10:37.560
from the world and
they're mostly Americans.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.540
- It was one of those cool things where

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.110
they send like a camp
out of American comics.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.605
- Oh, cool.
- It was weird mishmash.

00:10:42.605 --> 00:10:43.797
- Yeah.
- Super strange.

00:10:43.797 --> 00:10:44.630
(laughing)

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.116
- Did they give you Olympic track suits?

00:10:47.116 --> 00:10:47.949
'Cuz that would have been awesome.

00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:48.782
- Yeah, just like best of the best.

00:10:48.782 --> 00:10:51.133
- Yeah, yeah, like the Rider
Cup or something like that.

00:10:51.133 --> 00:10:51.966
- That would have been awesome.

00:10:51.966 --> 00:10:53.910
You guys got announced as the team.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.050
- But it was us, it
was me, you, Tom Wilson

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.290
who plays Biff in Back To The Future

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.270
and actually--
- Hell yeah.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.950
- was on a show that I
made a few years later.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.840
Jamie Kilstein, Joe Koy who
was just like destruction

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.230
at that point, probably
still is, but like,

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.750
- Oh yeah.
- 2007's show, Koy

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.423
was just lighting the shit--
- Just murdering.

00:11:11.423 --> 00:11:12.500
- He was murdering--
- He was knocking all

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.890
those gross teeth out of
their face with laughter.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.410
- One of the funniest moments, Tom Wilson

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.730
who plays Biff--
- Yeah.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.000
- most of his set's about being Biff

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.370
and then back in the green room of

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:24.590
the show, Joe Koy goes, I've
got a pretty fair question.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.610
- Oh, incredibly, yeah.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.840
- He goes, what's your
favorite incarnation

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.740
of Biff that you played?

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.140
He goes, the west one or
whatever, great question.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.337
- Great question.
- And man, he just went

00:11:33.337 --> 00:11:34.590
ah, come on, man.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.686
He closed his thing and
he huffed out of the room.

00:11:36.686 --> 00:11:37.930
It was like, what did I say?

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.450
I go, I guess he doesn't like talking

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.986
about being Biff offstage.

00:11:40.986 --> 00:11:41.819
(laughing)

00:11:41.819 --> 00:11:44.540
- I remember the British tour guy

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.277
that brought us around, going, "you know

00:11:46.277 --> 00:11:47.270
"who you look like?"

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.307
He goes, "you look like a combination

00:11:49.307 --> 00:11:52.612
"of Biff and like an older actor."

00:11:52.612 --> 00:11:53.548
(groans)

00:11:53.548 --> 00:11:54.692
He was like so, like--

00:11:54.692 --> 00:11:57.658
(laughing)

00:11:57.658 --> 00:11:58.890
and I think that came
out on the heels of that.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.984
- The dash of desperation.

00:12:00.984 --> 00:12:04.020
- You look like if you
were another incarnation

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.880
of Biff but if he was worn down and sad.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.757
And he's like, oh, I was
Biff and he's like, whoa.

00:12:08.757 --> 00:12:11.090
- So, I think Joe was coming
off the heels of that.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.238
- Yeah.
- Tom's a good man.

00:12:12.238 --> 00:12:15.569
- Do you recall, no, he's a great guy.

00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:16.700
We got along very well.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.533
Did you--

00:12:17.533 --> 00:12:18.883
- Did you call him butt head at all?

00:12:18.883 --> 00:12:19.716
- Do you recall my father?

00:12:19.716 --> 00:12:20.549
- I do recall your father, yeah.

00:12:20.549 --> 00:12:21.874
- So, you're 17 when you're over there.

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:23.434
- Yeah, you had to be 17
- He had to be to, yes,

00:12:23.434 --> 00:12:24.267
he was escorted.
- and I had to have my dad.

00:12:24.267 --> 00:12:25.650
- So, your dad, what's that like

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:26.483
when you're getting into the car

00:12:26.483 --> 00:12:27.890
when you're going to
tape a show in England

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.450
and you're like, dad has to come with you.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:31.190
'Cuz I remember like getting
dropped off at school.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:32.450
You're like, mom, fucking leave me alone.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.310
- Yeah, yeah, it's pretty rough

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.640
and like, that was the
third or fourth time I'd

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.897
ever performed live.
- Yeah.

00:12:37.897 --> 00:12:40.020
- 'Cuz I'd come from the internet,

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.810
so there's some awful, like,

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.890
it literally, my third or fourth set ever

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.107
is tapped and on it.

00:12:45.107 --> 00:12:47.428
It's like horrifying.
- Yeah.

00:12:47.428 --> 00:12:49.550
- And you're 17, fuck, dude.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.850
- The way that everyone was pulling

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.710
for each other, though, it really became

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.510
like a weird team.
- Yeah.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.540
- I remember the songs
that, the Tater Tot.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.880
Little Hitler.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.551
Aged Beautifully.
- And it was--

00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:01.539
(laughing)

00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:02.870
- Aged perfectly.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.748
- Really, really coincides
with the cultural moment.

00:13:04.748 --> 00:13:06.220
- Very smart, I thought,
but we, it was like

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.053
so cheering for everyone.

00:13:07.053 --> 00:13:08.817
- Yeah, yeah.
- I guess Mitchell

00:13:08.817 --> 00:13:09.920
did a fuckin' Prince impression

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.846
and I stood up like I was
fuckin' at the Apollo.

00:13:11.846 --> 00:13:12.847
- Right, yes.

00:13:12.847 --> 00:13:13.680
- Yeah!

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.513
- See, that's what we need more.

00:13:14.513 --> 00:13:18.100
We need more international
comedic competition.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.237
- Yeah, yeah.
- You did really well, though.

00:13:20.237 --> 00:13:22.060
Do you remember, you completely riffed

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.660
on the night, it was like beautiful.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:24.627
- Oh, thank you.

00:13:24.627 --> 00:13:25.840
That was--
- You were like last, I felt,

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.460
from all of us.
- Yeah.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.010
- So you went of final for the Americans?

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.890
- Yeah.
- Final from the Americans.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.190
Big Jay Oakerson.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.581
- Do you recall the warmup show?

00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:34.414
- Yeah.
- This is one of

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:35.247
my favorite stories.
- Yes.

00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:36.440
- The warmup show we
did at the country club?

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.260
- Yes.
- I told the story

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.093
on this show before.

00:13:39.093 --> 00:13:40.607
- I don't think you have.

00:13:40.607 --> 00:13:42.456
- But as, I don't wanna say her name,

00:13:42.456 --> 00:13:43.470
but there's a comedian,
we haven't said her yet

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.140
so I'm okay with that.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.120
This brings up, there's a female comic

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.838
- Yeah.
- who in her jokes,

00:13:48.838 --> 00:13:51.927
she just does a lot of, "what, hmm."

00:13:51.927 --> 00:13:53.580
"I said it, who said, what."

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.413
I know you know.

00:13:54.413 --> 00:13:58.800
I go, she, with this warmup
set, like a country club.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.990
It was a decent show, though.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.510
I remember I wound up
having a pretty good time.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.330
She was on, but she didn't catch 'em.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.440
Happens, you know what I mean.
- Yeah.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.918
- She didn't catch the crowd.

00:14:05.918 --> 00:14:06.751
- Yeah, it happens when you're

00:14:06.751 --> 00:14:07.818
in Milton Keynes.

00:14:07.818 --> 00:14:09.318
(laughing)

00:14:09.318 --> 00:14:11.130
- Apparently, she doesn't do a--

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.953
(laughter drowns out speaker)

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:14.928
Welcome to the country club.

00:14:14.928 --> 00:14:16.800
- It was just a funniest
heckle I've ever done

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.410
with all that, I think when she started

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.048
getting nervous, there's
was a bunch of like,

00:14:20.048 --> 00:14:21.047
it was just an over the top amount of

00:14:21.047 --> 00:14:24.800
the "huh, what, who said it, I said it."

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.570
A guy in the audience, there's like

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.700
a hubbub in the audience and one guy

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.710
gets up, with like,
starts like a quarterback.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:31.543
He's calming everybody.

00:14:31.543 --> 00:14:33.572
He's like, "I'll say, I got it."

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:36.700
He goes, "excuse me, miss,
who are you talking to?"

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.732
(laughing)

00:14:37.732 --> 00:14:39.040
And it was just the most
deflating thing I've

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.202
ever seen, like yaoch.

00:14:41.202 --> 00:14:43.440
- I mean, the British just cut bone deep.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.230
- It's a long tube ride home rubbing

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.457
the back of a person, going,
"hey, fuck these, fuck him.

00:14:48.457 --> 00:14:49.390
"Stupid England."

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.782
They don't even get comedy.

00:14:50.782 --> 00:14:51.730
- That's why we revolted.
- Yeah.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.600
- Comedy's an American thing, dude.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.410
Where American state of com, America.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.570
- Why do you think they
brought us all out here?

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:57.770
'Cuz they don't know
how to do it themselves.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.230
- Right and she goes, "I
was asking her a question."

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.017
- Yeah.
- That's gotta be so,

00:15:02.017 --> 00:15:05.161
excuse me, pardon me, who in
the fuck are you talking to?

00:15:05.161 --> 00:15:06.383
And he goes

00:15:06.383 --> 00:15:07.910
(sobbing)

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.510
- Who said what, miss?

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.170
- I don't really believe you're speaking

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.570
to anyone in general, are you babbling?

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.403
Are you a crazy person?

00:15:14.403 --> 00:15:16.700
- I think she's babbling, she is, she is.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.690
- Oh, she's a crazy.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.390
How they do it like fucking Manchester.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.230
Just hardware and you're like, oh,

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.250
then she went nuts.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.821
Dude, that's gotta be
tough because that's,

00:15:24.821 --> 00:15:27.350
there's some heckles, the worst heckle I

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.810
ever got was at The Cellar this,

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.470
it was like probably,
I wanna say, two months

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:31.800
after I got past The Cellar.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.910
It was Friday night.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.033
I was so excited and this girl got up

00:15:35.033 --> 00:15:36.730
and she saying something to her boyfriend.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:37.940
I go, "oh miss, is there a problem?"

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.437
She goes, "I saw you two weeks ago.

00:15:39.437 --> 00:15:40.780
"You're doing the same jokes."

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.613
I went,

00:15:41.613 --> 00:15:42.810
(hacking)

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.810
- Oh, my God.
- Fucking stuck me

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:45.643
right in the saw blades.

00:15:45.643 --> 00:15:47.285
- Playing the record backward.

00:15:47.285 --> 00:15:48.179
- Yeah, I was so

00:15:48.179 --> 00:15:50.013
(imitates record in rewind)

00:15:50.013 --> 00:15:52.400
- People got tattoos, fuck.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.770
And then S.D. walked in with Bill Maher

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.257
and they sat and I was just like doing, he

00:15:58.257 --> 00:16:00.170
was just at The Cellar for some reason.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.090
Me and you smoked a
joint right after my set

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.070
in the stairwell and Bill Maher walked out

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.340
and he went, "hey, great stuff,"

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.707
and he walked out and you go,

00:16:06.707 --> 00:16:08.190
"oh, nothing on mine?"

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.467
'Cuz you hadn't gone up yet.

00:16:09.467 --> 00:16:11.130
But that was that night
and I remember that

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.480
'cuz it was such an accurate heckle

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.070
'cuz she was basically, no, the house,

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:14.903
she finished it.

00:16:14.903 --> 00:16:15.923
She goes, "I heard those joke when I

00:16:15.923 --> 00:16:18.100
"was here two weeks ago,
but go ahead, do 'em."

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.647
And I was like, ugh.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.300
- You bitch.
- And in front of Bill Maher.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.720
The king of turnover.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.790
(laughing)

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:25.765
It's like brutal.

00:16:25.765 --> 00:16:27.620
- He's got new rules every week.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.740
This guy is just coming up with rules.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.300
- When was the last
time you performed, Bo,

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.510
for not your audience, like at all?

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.740
- Oh, that's a great question.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.430
I mean, I don't like,

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.740
- Do you do pop ins?

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.573
- I do a little bit.

00:16:39.573 --> 00:16:40.760
I mean, I haven't really done it

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.950
in a few years, but I'll do like Largo

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:44.700
and stuff in Los Angeles
but I wouldn't call

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.140
that not my audience.
- Right.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.260
- John Popper back in the room.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.060
Got up and smoked a butt, feeling good.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.240
John, Bo Burnahm, Bo Burnahm, John Popper.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.073
- Hi, John.

00:16:52.073 --> 00:16:54.430
John, you were in my
girlfriend's move, The Meddler.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.753
- Yes, that's right.

00:16:55.753 --> 00:16:56.586
- The movie, she wrote and directed that.

00:16:56.586 --> 00:16:57.914
- Oh, that was so awesome.

00:16:57.914 --> 00:16:58.771
- You were wonderful in it.

00:16:58.771 --> 00:16:59.604
She really appreciated you being in it.

00:16:59.604 --> 00:17:00.437
- Thanks a lot, it was really cool.

00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:01.370
- Yeah.
- That was so fun

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.309
to get to do.
- He did a set

00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:05.600
in a ferry.
- Yup, yup.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.610
We were in the boat
and it was really cool.

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.890
Our dog basically intimidated
Susan Sarandon's dog.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.000
- Yes.
- Hell, yeah.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.930
That'll teach that bitch.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.140
- Yeah, her dog was really nice

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:15.973
and well behaved and our dog

00:17:15.973 --> 00:17:17.183
was scruffy, little homeless dog.

00:17:17.183 --> 00:17:20.611
- Yeah and that was a
proper term, Jay, finally.

00:17:20.611 --> 00:17:21.490
(laughing)

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:22.450
Finally, you nailed it.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.570
- Okay.
- Two female dogs fighting

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:26.345
at each other, you go
and call her a bitch.

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:27.178
- Challenge me, feminazis.

00:17:27.178 --> 00:17:28.750
- Bring it, isolate the audio.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:29.980
Take a run at us.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.630
Jay finally had it in context.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:32.820
- Yeah, bring it people.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.960
- Take a run at us.
- We were talking

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.230
about hecklers, like ones that hurt

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.870
because I was saying a woman got up

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:39.813
during one of my sets at the Comedy Cellar

00:17:39.813 --> 00:17:41.497
and was like, "oh, I heard
these jokes two weeks

00:17:41.497 --> 00:17:42.670
"ago, but go ahead and tell 'em,"

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:43.850
and I just froze up.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:44.683
- Oh, how nice, yeah.

00:17:44.683 --> 00:17:46.120
- Have you ever been heckled?

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.480
- I'm starting to do like a solo show

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.077
where I actually start to get
my little stand up rocks off

00:17:50.077 --> 00:17:52.880
and the cool part is if
I start to suck, I got

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.346
a song I can go to, so.
- Yes.

00:17:54.346 --> 00:17:55.399
(laughing)

00:17:55.399 --> 00:17:56.519
- Ah, it's always her.
- Andy and yeah,

00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:58.970
the thing I get run into is that

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.450
it's such a personal little
show that people feel

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.487
that they can talk.

00:18:01.487 --> 00:18:03.757
"I loved you since forever."

00:18:03.757 --> 00:18:05.620
"And there's this time, I gotta tell you."

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.680
And like, you don't understand.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.430
There's a bunch of people
standing around waiting

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.640
for you to tell the story and so it's hard

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.630
to shut somebody down who's
telling you nice thing.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.756
- Yes, positive things
are difficult, yeah.

00:18:15.756 --> 00:18:18.450
- I mentioned something about how like

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.040
a Quaalude, I talk about this song we

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.880
do called Champipple which
is a Fred Samford's drink

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.140
of ginger ale and ripple and how we wrote

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.500
a song about it and we were trying

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.110
to recreate it but the ripple was banned

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.860
along with Quaalude in
the fuck you act of 1978.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.390
- Oh yeah, you learn
something new every day.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.210
I learned that.
- Fucking Jimmy Carter

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:38.220
and somebody in the audience goes--

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.737
- Fucking peanut farmer motherfucker.

00:18:39.737 --> 00:18:41.590
- And somebody goes off about Jimmy Carter

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.010
for like five minutes, like,
"yeah, he ruined our economy."

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:47.160
And I'm like, Jimmy Carter's
ex-lover is in the audience

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.570
and is really upset about
this and you know, I mean, I'm

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.610
sure he was busy and he would have called.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.160
He would have called you back, I'm sure

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.140
and like, you start going off on that guy

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.380
and it's free material.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.200
- I do wish, we went to
see that Florence and

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.070
the Machine show last night.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.520
I wish I would have seen her getting

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.640
a real heckling, it would
have been hilarious.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.990
'Cuz she's saying such unhecklable things.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.020
- Yeah.
- Unless you're just

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:09.480
an asshole, I wouldn't
actually do the heckles.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.230
I could write them for somebody.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:12.090
- Well, what things was she saying?

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.100
I bet I could heckle it.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.500
- Well, there was a loud technical issue.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.210
The microphones went crazy.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.520
- Be Florence and Machines
and I'll heckle you.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.353
- This is good.

00:19:20.353 --> 00:19:22.017
So it went, mmmmmmmmm,

00:19:22.017 --> 00:19:24.497
and she goes, "does everybody hear that?

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:27.949
"I'm always told that's
just the sound of angels."

00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:28.830
- You're fat!

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:29.860
- Yeah!

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.380
(laughing)

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.955
You know, it works any time.

00:19:32.955 --> 00:19:34.020
(laughing)

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.410
- I'm gonna guess that's
just a good fast ball.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.110
- Yeah.
- It's just fucking heat

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.630
down to play.
- It's right there.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.740
- Any girl performer, watch
I'll do a different heckle

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.641
for a--
- Pick someone.

00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:45.619
Christina Aguilera.

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:47.647
I'm a genie in a bottle.
- You're fat.

00:19:47.647 --> 00:19:48.930
(laughing)

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.030
- I mean I feel like this is just six.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.001
Are you saying it's the
duct tape from insoles?

00:19:53.001 --> 00:19:54.181
(laughing)

00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:56.190
It's the duct tape, is it.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:57.940
- You've aged.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.330
You're showing your age in your face.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.430
- Your skin is loose.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.120
Loose skin.
- You caused 9/11.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.020
- Oh, that's a tough--
- Total shift.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.203
- I guess the question.

00:20:08.203 --> 00:20:10.100
- Thinking it out.
- Nice job.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.420
- I think I gotta go.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.230
I'm going to go wash my junk because I'm

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.180
gonna see you later tonight.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.350
- Hell yeah.
- Sick.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:16.610
- John Popper, thank you for coming on.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:17.443
Bringing a new album.

00:20:17.443 --> 00:20:18.847
- Thanks again.
- Don't walk out

00:20:18.847 --> 00:20:19.680
'cuz I gotta tell you where to go tonight.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.170
- Yeah, Blue, yeah, you
gotta listen to him.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.930
Blues Traveler has a new album out.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:23.840
Hurry Up and Hang Around.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.180
It's actually out Friday,
October 12th, so--

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.298
- Absolutely, check them out.
- Download.

00:20:28.298 --> 00:20:29.131
- You on tour?

00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:30.420
- Yes, start out on Friday and keep going

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.253
until Thanksgiving.

00:20:31.253 --> 00:20:32.280
- Friday where?

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.850
- Montclair, New Jersey at the Wilmont.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.260
- Yeah.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.420
- What time, buddy, I might go.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.735
- Oh please, I think we hit
around eight, eight o'clock.

00:20:39.735 --> 00:20:40.568
- I don't know if you recall.

00:20:40.568 --> 00:20:41.810
I always tell the story
of what I've learned

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.810
now as someone who has people asking them

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:44.970
for tickets.
- Yeah.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.570
- Poor John goes, you wanna
come to my show tonight

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:47.480
at the Highline Ballroom?

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.980
I call him like two hours later, like,

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.430
yes, I'm bringing 13 people.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.857
He's like, "I'll do it, man, but that's

00:20:52.857 --> 00:20:54.000
"not really a cool request."

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.020
I go, "isn't it?"

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.188
I'm like boy isn't it.

00:20:57.188 --> 00:20:58.280
(laughing)

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.068
We'll be right back, it's The Bonfire.

00:21:00.068 --> 00:21:00.901
(crackling)

00:21:00.901 --> 00:21:03.510
- That harmonica was right next to me.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.560
Suck my dick, Mr. Wilson.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.578
- [Jay] Take it home.

00:21:06.578 --> 00:21:08.560
(shouting)

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.610
I have the power!

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:10.443
- By the way, take it home.

00:21:10.443 --> 00:21:12.597
I promise you he's got 40 on him.

00:21:12.597 --> 00:21:14.366
(harmonic music)

00:21:14.366 --> 00:21:15.199
- Boy.
- Man, I didn't look

00:21:15.199 --> 00:21:16.363
at his lips.

00:21:16.363 --> 00:21:17.196
(laughing)

00:21:17.196 --> 00:21:18.612
- He goes, no, no, no,
there's coke in it, though.

00:21:18.612 --> 00:21:21.010
(laughing)

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.750
- John Popper's fucking harmonica.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:23.583
What a win!

00:21:23.583 --> 00:21:24.416
- Take that home, buddy.

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:26.981
- It's The Bonfire, Comedy
Central Radio Series XM95.

00:21:26.981 --> 00:21:27.814
(crackling)

00:21:27.814 --> 00:21:28.714
- Give me a little harp on your plugs.

00:21:28.714 --> 00:21:30.520
(harmonica music)

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.620
Turn off that, let the amp player her up

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.199
and I'll do John Popper.

(blows harmonica)

00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:10.534
