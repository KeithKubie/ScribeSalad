00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:09.834
Before the sun never 
set on the British Empire,

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:12.696
before Genghis Khan swept the steppe,

00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:17.363
before Rome extended its influence
to encircle the Mediterranean Sea,

00:00:17.363 --> 00:00:20.362
there was ancient Assyria.

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:24.003
Considered by historians 
to be the first true empire,

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:29.054
Assyria’s innovations laid the groundwork 
for every superpower that’s followed.

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:31.954
At its height, in the 7th century BCE,

00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:35.334
the Assyrian Empire stretched 
across modern Iraq,

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:36.265
Syria,

00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:37.257
Lebanon,

00:00:37.257 --> 00:00:38.195
Israel,

00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:40.063
and parts of Turkey,

00:00:40.063 --> 00:00:40.793
Iran,

00:00:40.793 --> 00:00:42.160
and Egypt.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.817
Its wonders included a vast library 
and large botanical and zoological park.

00:00:47.817 --> 00:00:51.957
But the story of Assyria’s rise 
to dominance began many centuries earlier,

00:00:51.957 --> 00:00:55.745
in the Late Bronze Age, 
in a city called Ashur.

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:59.174
Ashur was a tin and textiles 
trading center

00:00:59.174 --> 00:01:02.705
located along the Tigris River 
in northern Iraq.

00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:06.094
It shared its name with a god thought 
to be an embodiment of the city

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:08.484
and later of the entire empire.

00:01:08.484 --> 00:01:14.374
For the administration-minded Assyrians,
politics and religion were closely linked.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:21.485
Around 1300 BCE, a high priest named
Ashur-uballit I took the title of king

00:01:21.485 --> 00:01:24.971
and initiated a tradition 
of military campaigns,

00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:30.304
effectively transforming Assyria
from a city-state to a territorial state.

00:01:30.304 --> 00:01:33.309
This meant that a single 
administrative entity

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:36.793
oversaw many places, cultures, 
and peoples.

00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:44.015
For the next 150 years,
Assyria extended its reach and thrived.

00:01:44.015 --> 00:01:46.459
In the 12th century BCE,

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.991
a mysterious catastrophe 
that still bewilders archaeologists

00:01:49.991 --> 00:01:53.662
caused the Assyrians 
to lose much of their territory.

00:01:53.662 --> 00:01:55.641
A few hundred years later, however,

00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:59.302
Assyrian kings began 
a new round of conquests.

00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:02.173
This time, they honed 
their administrative system

00:02:02.173 --> 00:02:05.783
into an empire 
that would last generations.

00:02:05.783 --> 00:02:09.661
Assyrians were military innovators 
and merciless conquerors.

00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:11.259
During their conquests,

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:15.782
they used siege tactics and cruel 
punishments for those who opposed them,

00:02:15.782 --> 00:02:19.223
including impalement and flaying.

00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:22.043
The growth of their empire 
was due, in part,

00:02:22.043 --> 00:02:25.218
to their strategy 
of deporting local populations,

00:02:25.218 --> 00:02:29.079
then shifting them around the
empire to fulfill different needs.

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.575
This broke peoples’ bonds 
with their homelands

00:02:31.575 --> 00:02:34.219
and severed loyalties among local groups.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.322
Once the Assyrians conquered an area,

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:40.763
they built cities connected 
by well-maintained royal roads.

00:02:40.763 --> 00:02:44.244
Often, when a new king came to power,
he would build a new capital.

00:02:44.244 --> 00:02:49.573
With each move, new palaces and temples 
were erected and lavishly decorated.

00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:51.840
Although kings claimed absolute power,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.253
we know that an extensive system 
of courtiers,

00:02:54.253 --> 00:02:55.680
provincial officials,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.352
and scholars influenced affairs.

00:02:58.352 --> 00:03:02.539
At least one woman, Sammuramat, 
ruled the kingdom.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.618
Assyrian rulers celebrated 
their military excursions

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:07.741
by having representations 
of their exploits

00:03:07.741 --> 00:03:11.213
carved into the walls 
of their newly built palaces.

00:03:11.213 --> 00:03:15.702
But despite the picture of a ruthless 
war state projected by these records,

00:03:15.702 --> 00:03:20.616
the Assyrian kings were also interested 
in the cultural traditions of the region,

00:03:20.616 --> 00:03:24.074
especially those of Babylonia, 
a separate state to the south.

00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:27.152
Babylonia had been 
a cultural leader for millennia,

00:03:27.152 --> 00:03:29.313
stretching back 
to the beginning of writing

00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:32.222
at the end of the 4th millennium BCE.

00:03:32.222 --> 00:03:37.331
Assyria saw itself as the inheritor 
and protector of this tradition.

00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:39.532
Assyrian rulers supported scholars

00:03:39.532 --> 00:03:42.522
in specialties ranging 
from medicine to magic,

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:44.972
and the capital cities, like Ninevah,

00:03:44.972 --> 00:03:47.301
were home to elaborate parks and gardens

00:03:47.301 --> 00:03:51.123
that housed plants 
and animals from around the empire.

00:03:51.123 --> 00:03:55.070
One of Assyria’s final rulers, 
Ashurbanipal,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.883
sent scholars throughout Babylonia to
gather up and copy ancient literary works.

00:04:00.883 --> 00:04:05.012
Ashurbanipal’s library took the form 
of clay tablets

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:09.962
inscribed with cuneiform in the languages 
of Akkadian and Sumerian.

00:04:09.962 --> 00:04:15.392
The library was lost during the final sack
of Ninevah in 612 BCE.

00:04:15.392 --> 00:04:19.002
But thanks to a 19th century 
archaeological excavation,

00:04:19.002 --> 00:04:21.572
many masterpieces of ancient literature,

00:04:21.572 --> 00:04:25.902
including the Epic of Gilgamesh 
and the Babylonian Creation Epic,

00:04:25.902 --> 00:04:27.952
survive today.

00:04:27.952 --> 00:04:30.040
After centuries of rule,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.071
the Assyrian Empire fell to 
the Babylonians and Medes

00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:37.114
between 612 and 609 BCE.

00:04:37.114 --> 00:04:41.142
Yet the innovations that the&nbsp;Assyrians&nbsp;
pioneered live on.

00:04:41.142 --> 00:04:43.442
Their emphasis on constant innovation,

00:04:43.442 --> 00:04:45.063
efficient administration,

00:04:45.063 --> 00:04:47.263
and excellent infrastructure

00:04:47.263 --> 00:04:50.883
set the standard for every empire
that’s followed them in the region

00:04:50.883 --> 00:04:52.480
and across the globe.
