00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.550
We're on problem 190.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.810
If the operation star with a
circle around it is defined

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.850
for all a and b by the equation,
a star with a circle

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:24.120
around it b is equal to a
squared times b over 3, then

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.800
what does 2 star with a circle
around it 3 star with the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.000
circle around it
minus 1 equal?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.270
So 3 star minus 1.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.800
That's equal to-- let's see,
I'll do this in magenta-- 3

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.460
star minus 1.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.730
That's equal to 3 squared times
minus 1 which is minus 3

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.670
squared, or minus 9.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.220
3 squared, 9.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.940
Times minus 1.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.750
That's minus 9 divided by 3
which is equal to minus 3.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.980
So this reduces to 2 star minus
3 which is equal to 2

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.630
squared, which is 4,
times minus 3.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.050
All of that over 3.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.530
Minus 3 divided by 3.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.510
That's just minus 1.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.350
So you have minus 1 times
4 is equal to minus 4.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.280
And that's choice E.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.920
Problem 192.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.180
No, 191!

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.870
Don't want to skip problems.
The inside dimensions of a

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:44.990
rectangular wooden box
are 6 by 8 by 10.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.270
A cylindrical canister is to be
placed inside the box so it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.120
stands upright when the
closed box rests on

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.480
one of its 6 bases.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.040
Of all such canisters that could
be used, what is the

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.990
radius in inches of the one
that has maximum volume?

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.865
OK, so they're going to put
one canister in this box.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.270
And how do you maximize
its volume?

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.790
So let's think about
it this way.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.100
Let's think about what a volume
of a cylinder is.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.730
If this is my cylinder, its
volume is the area of the side

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.980
times the height.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.480
If the area of the side is
equal to-- if this is the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:58.090
radius-- it would be pi r
squared times the height.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.960
Height times pi r squared.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.210
Now what's r going
to be equal to?

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.185
r has to go all the
way around.

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:09.090
So, r is going to be equal to
half-- well, it obviously

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.975
equals half the diameter
of this circle.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.520
But if we look at the base
that's 6 and 8, if we use that

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.890
as the base, and the 10 comes
out of the page, the radius

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.670
can only be what?

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.220
The radius can only be 3 because
the diameter of the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.470
circle can only be 6.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.415
We don't get to use the 8.

00:03:32.415 --> 00:03:36.600
So, this is the case if we
use the 6 and the 8 side.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.050
And so we'll kind of be-- I
guess the best way to think

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.070
about it is we'll be wasting
this base over here.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:50.170
The other possibility, if we had
the 8 and the 10 side, if

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.955
this was our base then we could
have a radius of 4.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.330
Let me think about it.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.040
Yeah, radius would be a 4.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.580
Because we would have
the height 8, we'd

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.880
have a radius of 4.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.540
Now when we look at this
equation, if we had to

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.330
maximize either the-- this is
going to be the volume of the

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.209
cylinder-- if we had to maximize
either the height or

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.570
the radius, because those are
the two things that we can

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.560
deal with, which one, at least
to you, seems more important?

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.190
Well, to me, the radius seems
more important because I'm

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.770
squaring it.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.330
So, these, in my mind, are
the two contenders.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.270
The worst contender is where
we use the 6 and the

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.140
10 side as a base.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.370
Because then we use
a lot of space.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.840
But we can figure that
one out, too.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.840
Because then we waste a lot of
space and we have a height of

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.920
8 and the radius is still--.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.060
So, first of all, this one is
clearly better than this one.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.990
And why is that?

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.240
They have the same area
of their base because

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.980
the radius is 6.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.300
Sorry, the radius is 3,
the diameter is 6.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.080
But in here the height gets to
be 10, and here the height

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.590
only gets to be 8.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.690
So this one is a non-option.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.590
So, really, we have to
compare these two.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.780
And I've drawn their bases.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.130
So, if you think about this one,
we have an area of the

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.270
base of the radius is 4.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.450
So, 10 pi times the
height of six.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.010
That's the volume of
this cylinder.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.760
Here we have a radius--
we have a radius of 3.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.750
Half of the 6 diameter.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.200
So, the area is 9 pi.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.650
And we're going to multiply
that times the

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.480
height, which is 10.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.580
So, here we have 90 pi.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.430
And here we have 6 times
16, which is 96 pi.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.570
So, this is the best
of our cases.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.100
And that was the correct
intuition.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.040
We're maximizing the radius.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.850
And when you maximize the
radius, we get a radius of 4.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.760
So what did they ask us
in the question again?

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.630
What is the radius in inches
of the one that has the

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.120
maximum volume?

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.740
And so that radius is 4.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.910
Where one side is 8 and
one side is 10.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.390
And that's choice B.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.180
Next question.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.090
192.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.910
Square root.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.060
OK, they have all sorts
of interesting things.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.330
They essentially want
us to simplify.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.460
The square root of 2 plus 1
times the square root of 2

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.490
minus 1 times the square root
of 3 plus 1 times the square

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.010
root of 3 minus 1.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.890
So, this seems to be just an
application of-- I'm sure

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.700
you've learned this in algebra--
that a plus b times

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.930
a minus b is equal to a squared
minus b squared.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:44.870
You don't have to
memorize this.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.010
You could actually multiply it
all out and you'll get this.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.055
But it's a good thing
to know if you want

00:06:50.055 --> 00:06:51.480
to do things quickly.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.180
So, square root of 2 plus 1,
times square root of 2 minus

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:03.710
one, is equal to square root of
2 squared, minus 1 squared.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.980
We're going to multiply that
times-- using the same

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:12.380
principle-- square root of 3
squared minus one squared.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.110
Square root of 2 squared.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:20.030
That's 2 minus 1 times
3 minus 1.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.330
That's equal to 1 times 2.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.430
Which is equal to 2.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.650
And that is choice A.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.680
Problem 193.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.890
In a certain Calculus class,
the ratio of the number of

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.060
math majors to the number of
students who are not math

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.500
majors is 2:5.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:47.100
So, math to not math
is equal to 2:5.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.790
If 2 more math majors were to
enter the class the ratio

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.670
would be 1:2.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.440
So if I have 2 more math majors,
then the ratio of them

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.080
to the non-math majors
is equal to 1:2.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.920
How many students are
in the class?

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.430
They want to know what m plus
nm, non-math majors, is.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.780
Let's see.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.390
Let's see if we can solve
for anything.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.520
We actually have two linear
equations and two unknowns.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.470
You might not see it yet,
but if we cross

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.540
multiply we get 5m.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.560
I'll just call these
n, non-math majors.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.160
I don't want to keep
saying nm.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.110
5m is equal to 2n.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:29.050
And here you get 2 times
m plus 2 is 2m plus

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.500
4 is equal to n.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.100
We could substitute that.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.030
If n is equal to that, then that
means that 5m is equal to

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.890
2 times n. n is equal
to 2m plus 4.

00:08:44.932 --> 00:08:50.620
So, you get 5m is equal
to 4m plus 8.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.700
Subtract 4m from both sides,
you get m is equal to 8.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.070
If m is equal to 8, we could
say 5m is equal to 2n.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.280
So, 5 times 8 is 40.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.960
And so n is equal to 20.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.540
Let's see, are they asking for
the-- if 2 more students were

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.280
to enter the class?

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:11.460
OK.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.070
So they want to know how many
are in the class right now.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.430
So they want to know m plus n.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.230
Well, that's equal to
8 plus 20 which

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.730
is equal to 28 students.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.600
And that is choice D.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.470
Next question.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.160
I think I have time to
fit this one in.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.150
I'll continue in the
next if I don't.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.850
194.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:43.080
What is the units digit of 13 to
the fourth times 17 squared

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.020
times 29 to the third?

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.110
So, here you just have to
realize that the units digit

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.140
in any of these numbers, are
just the units digit of each

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.790
of these numbers times
each other.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.540
And then you take the
units digit of that.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.100
So, we really just have to worry
about the units digits.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.210
The answer to this question
would be the exact same thing

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.920
as if I said the units digit
of 3 to the fourth.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.700
We just have to worry about
the units digits.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:11.480
3 to the fourth times 7 squared
times 9 to the third.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.640
It would be the exact
same thing.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.560
So, 3 to the fourth, what's
the units digit?

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.840
3 to the one is equal to 3.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.720
3 squared is equal to 9.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.730
3 to the third is 27, but
the units digit is 7.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:29.520
And then 3 to the fourth is 81
and the units digit is 1.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.980
And just so you can see this
principle that I just talked

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.550
about-- and we could prove it if
I had more time-- is that I

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.280
could just multiply 3 times 7
and the units digit is just 1.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.230
Or I could just multiply
3 times 9 and the

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.600
units digit is 7.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.980
We could just ignore
everything else.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.860
So here the units digit is 1.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.510
7 squared, what's
the units digit?

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.820
Well, 7 squared, the units
digit is-- well,

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.110
7 squared is 49.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.720
The units digit is 9.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.670
And then 9 to the third,
what's the units digit?

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.260
9 to the 1 is 9.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.510
9 squared.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.130
The units digit is 1.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.270
It's 81.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.090
And then 9 to the third, we
don't have to worry about

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.660
anything else.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.350
When you multiply 81 times 9,
the units digit is going to be

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.640
9 times that 1 in 81.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.770
So, that equals 9.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.980
So, it's 1 times 9 times 9.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.290
And then 9 times 9 is 81.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.170
We want the units digit,
which is 1.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.720
So the answer is E.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.470
And I'll let you think about
that a little bit.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.860
Maybe you want to play around
and see why we only have to

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.540
worry about the units digit
and why I was able to make

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.480
this statement right here
to avoid doing a

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.840
lot of harder math.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.110
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
