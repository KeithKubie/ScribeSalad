00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.479
We're desperate to avoid it of course, but
we won't, for a lot of very good reasons:

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:07.700
We don’t understand ourselves

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.839
We're all crazy in very particular ways: neurotic,
unbalanced and immature...

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.289
But we don’t know the details,

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.670
because no one encourages us too hard to find out.
Our friends just want to be kind and have

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.510
fun with us. Our enemies don't want to waste
the trouble.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.240
So we end up with such a poor level of self-understanding,
we have no clue who we'd be compatible with.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.730
A standard question on any early dinner date
should simply be: ‘how are you mad?’

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.750
But it's so hard to know...

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.840
Secondly, we don’t understand other people

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.340
It's as hard to work out the craziness of
other people as it is our own, they put on such a good show

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.910
- at first.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.280
What we'd ideally need is to send them and
us through a battery of psychological questionnaires

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.450
and have four years of intensive psychotherapy,
individual and couples' based - before reaching

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.590
a decision.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.620
By 2100, this will no longer sound like a
joke - people will merely wonder why

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.340
took humanity so long to get us here.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.940
We aren’t used to being happy

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.320
We think we want happiness, but what we really
want is what we're used to – and that usually

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.920
doesn't involve too much happiness at all.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.399
Growing up, most of us had our love mixed
in with other, darker stuff: being controlled,

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.340
feeling humiliated, being abandonned or abused.
In short, suffering. And now, whatever we

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.729
may say, that's what we're mostly still on
the look out for.

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.729
It explains why we rejected all those candidates,
the well-balanced, mature reliable ones,

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.409
as somehow a bit 'boring'.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.399
- and why we head instead with secret energy
to those characters we unconsciously know

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.270
will mess us up in such cosily familiar ways.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.999
Being single is so awful

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:43.340
You have to be very at peace with empty Saturday
evenings, constant alienation and sexlessness

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.359
in order to be choosy in the right way.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:50.749
No wonder most of us half shut our eyes and
grab what's there.

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.450
Instinct has too much prestige

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.219
Marriage used to be a rational business; all
to do with your parents matching their bit

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.619
of land with the neighbours'. It was horribly
cold and calculating.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.109
So now we have romantic marriages. It's meant
to be all about how you feel. You should never

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:09.080
think too much. To analyse the decision immediately
feels ‘un-Romantic’.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.800
Indeed, the most Romantic thing to do may
just be to propose really suddenly, perhaps

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.910
after only a few weeks - in a chapel in Vegas at 3am...

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.220
The madness seems a paradoxical sign that the marriage itself will be a sensible idea.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.240
It won't be.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.940
We don’t go to Schools of Love

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.660
We don't have any information.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.360
We don't take classes, we don't talk to married
couples and steer very clear of divorced ones.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.810
So we go into it without knowing why marriages
really fail – beyond what we take to be

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.420
just the simple stupidity of all those other
couples we're not like at all.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.420
Freezing happiness

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.020
You want to make nice things permanent: you're
in Venice, on the lagoon, with no responsibilities,

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.720
the evening sun throwing gold flakes across
the sea, the prospect of dinner in a little

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.530
fish restaurant and your beloved in a cashmere
jumper in your arms…

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.940
You get married to make that feeling permanent.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.820
But it all goes and what is really permanent
is the partner - but now in a very different mood.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.740
You want to stop thinking about Love

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.850
It's such a pain: the heartache, the dating,
the one night stands...

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.480
You want shot of it all. You marry to stop
having to think about love all the time.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.140
All of which is why you'll marry the wrong
person - or perhaps have done so already.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.040
But it's not really your fault. No one ever
teaches us how to do this thing, and so of

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.860
course we crash.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.900
We will, as a species, eventually learn. The
careless madness can't go on. Too many people

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.220
get hurt.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.540
In a few centuries at least, we'll be getting
the hang of it - for sure.
