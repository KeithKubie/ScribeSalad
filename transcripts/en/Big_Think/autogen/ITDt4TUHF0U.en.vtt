repeating a theme that I've raised
 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.939
repeating a theme that I've raised
already but it seems to me that that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
already but it seems to me that that
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.060

standard of living i guess that's that's
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980
standard of living i guess that's that's
what that's how I kind of measure in

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
what that's how I kind of measure in
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.730
what that's how I kind of measure in
some sense the the underlying values now

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
some sense the the underlying values now
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.440
some sense the the underlying values now
there's some people that would say that

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
there's some people that would say that
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.810
there's some people that would say that
that would make a kind of a crisper

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
that would make a kind of a crisper
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.520
that would make a kind of a crisper
formulation of that they would say that

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
formulation of that they would say that
 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.140
formulation of that they would say that
that you know the way to measure your

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
that you know the way to measure your
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.969

have the least least money or the least
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.649
have the least least money or the least
power the least of anything and can you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659
power the least of anything and can you
 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.810
power the least of anything and can you
create a society that works for for the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820
create a society that works for for the
 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.170
create a society that works for for the
least fortunate not not not others and I

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
least fortunate not not not others and I
 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.749
least fortunate not not not others and I
again I subscribe to that as well I've

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759
again I subscribe to that as well I've
 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.670
again I subscribe to that as well I've
been very very interested in the in the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
been very very interested in the in the
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.200
been very very interested in the in the
question of of of really creating

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
question of of of really creating
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.609
question of of of really creating
opportunity and I've been struck with

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619
opportunity and I've been struck with
 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.889
opportunity and I've been struck with
how that often happens at a very

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
how that often happens at a very
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.590
how that often happens at a very
grassroots level and some of the stuff

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600
grassroots level and some of the stuff
 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.690
grassroots level and some of the stuff
I'm working on and thinking about now is

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700
I'm working on and thinking about now is
 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.300
I'm working on and thinking about now is
is really its complementary to all the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310
is really its complementary to all the
 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.949
is really its complementary to all the
other work but it's really some of the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959
other work but it's really some of the
 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.820
other work but it's really some of the
most exciting

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
most exciting
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.850
most exciting
and memorable and powerful examples one

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860
and memorable and powerful examples one
 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.460
and memorable and powerful examples one
sees of economic development or not

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470

grand government policies but but stuff

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
grand government policies but but stuff
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.270
grand government policies but but stuff
that it's at the very very grassroots

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280
that it's at the very very grassroots
 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.460
that it's at the very very grassroots
level where some people in the community

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470
level where some people in the community
 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.230
level where some people in the community
can find a way to work together to

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240
can find a way to work together to
 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.220

create something value you know almost

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
create something value you know almost
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.030
create something value you know almost
against all odds and I think we need to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040
against all odds and I think we need to
 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.700
against all odds and I think we need to
think and understand more about about

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710
think and understand more about about
 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.550
think and understand more about about
how how communities can can work

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560
how how communities can can work
 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.470
