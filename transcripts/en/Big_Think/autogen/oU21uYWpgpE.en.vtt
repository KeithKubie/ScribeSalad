when I would prefer is as a process that
 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.550
when I would prefer is as a process that
transforms you so the tips take place

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560
transforms you so the tips take place
 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.080
transforms you so the tips take place
automatically I mean for instance very

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090
automatically I mean for instance very
 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.480
automatically I mean for instance very
often the tip is given when you're

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490
often the tip is given when you're

if they happen mechanically it gets to

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579
if they happen mechanically it gets to
 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.000
if they happen mechanically it gets to
be kind of boring

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010

some people are encouraged when they're

some people are encouraged when they're
coached at this point leave where you're

coached at this point leave where you're
 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.619
coached at this point leave where you're
standing and walk over there and take a

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629
standing and walk over there and take a

standing and walk over there and take a
pause well maybe that makes sense in

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539
pause well maybe that makes sense in
 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.799
pause well maybe that makes sense in
terms of how it's written at the end of

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809
terms of how it's written at the end of
 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.630
terms of how it's written at the end of
that paragraph you want to make a space

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640
that paragraph you want to make a space
 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.880
that paragraph you want to make a space
before the next paragraph but it doesn't

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890
before the next paragraph but it doesn't
 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.610
before the next paragraph but it doesn't
necessarily make sense in terms of how

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620
necessarily make sense in terms of how
 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.439
necessarily make sense in terms of how
you're talking and relating to the

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449
you're talking and relating to the
 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.130
you're talking and relating to the
people you're talking with that relating

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140
people you're talking with that relating
 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.370
people you're talking with that relating
to them should be the source of a pause

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
to them should be the source of a pause
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.730
to them should be the source of a pause
the source of moving because it comes

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740
the source of moving because it comes
 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.740
the source of moving because it comes
out of the thought press that process

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750
out of the thought press that process
 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.330
out of the thought press that process
I'm going through and it comes out of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340
I'm going through and it comes out of
 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.580
I'm going through and it comes out of
the thought process I sense you're going

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590
the thought process I sense you're going
 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.529
the thought process I sense you're going
through have you understood that last

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539
through have you understood that last
 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.039
through have you understood that last
part so I'm now I'm thinking if you have

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049
part so I'm now I'm thinking if you have
 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.380
part so I'm now I'm thinking if you have
what's the next thing that I can tack on

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390
what's the next thing that I can tack on
 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.569
what's the next thing that I can tack on
to that that'll mean something to you

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579
to that that'll mean something to you
 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.270
to that that'll mean something to you
and if you haven't should I clarify it a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280
and if you haven't should I clarify it a
 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.550
and if you haven't should I clarify it a
little more so there's a dynamic

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560
little more so there's a dynamic
 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.999
little more so there's a dynamic
relationship between us that leads to a

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009
relationship between us that leads to a
 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.370
relationship between us that leads to a
change in pace to a change in volume and

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380
change in pace to a change in volume and
 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.529
change in pace to a change in volume and
that kind of thing a tip is just an

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539
that kind of thing a tip is just an
 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.800
that kind of thing a tip is just an
intellectual ization of that which might

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810
intellectual ization of that which might
 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.440
intellectual ization of that which might
be okay to give somebody once they've

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450
be okay to give somebody once they've
 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.980
be okay to give somebody once they've
got the the grounding in the the ability

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990
got the the grounding in the the ability
 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.669
got the the grounding in the the ability
to connect you know it but it ought to

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679
to connect you know it but it ought to
 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.770
to connect you know it but it ought to
come out of the connection it shouldn't

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780
come out of the connection it shouldn't
 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.489
come out of the connection it shouldn't
be a checkbox that you tick off so I

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499
be a checkbox that you tick off so I
 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:03.090
be a checkbox that you tick off so I
really don't like tips if I'm pressed

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100
really don't like tips if I'm pressed
 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.580
really don't like tips if I'm pressed
really hard there are three tips that I

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590
really hard there are three tips that I
 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.749
really hard there are three tips that I
do kind of follow probably it's a good

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759
do kind of follow probably it's a good
 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.699
do kind of follow probably it's a good
idea to follow these tips after you get

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709
idea to follow these tips after you get
 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.320
idea to follow these tips after you get
used to being connected to somebody but

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330
used to being connected to somebody but
 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.130
used to being connected to somebody but
there are three things

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140
there are three things
 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.230
there are three things
I like to do that I call it the three

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240
I like to do that I call it the three
 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.640
I like to do that I call it the three
rules of three so the first rule is I

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650
rules of three so the first rule is I
 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.949
rules of three so the first rule is I
try only to say three important things

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959
try only to say three important things
 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.199
try only to say three important things
when I talk to people no more than three

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209
when I talk to people no more than three
 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.390
when I talk to people no more than three
if you can see if it's one thing that's

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400
if you can see if it's one thing that's
 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.220
if you can see if it's one thing that's
maybe even better but usually there's a

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230
maybe even better but usually there's a
 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.640
maybe even better but usually there's a
lot to say but I I'm when I make notes

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650
lot to say but I I'm when I make notes
 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.040
lot to say but I I'm when I make notes
on what I want to talk about if I say

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050
on what I want to talk about if I say
 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.199
on what I want to talk about if I say
I'm going on past three to four and five

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209
I'm going on past three to four and five
 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.780
I'm going on past three to four and five
I start eliminating and we're seeing if

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790
I start eliminating and we're seeing if
 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.340
I start eliminating and we're seeing if
I fold them into the other things

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350
I fold them into the other things
 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.220
I fold them into the other things
because three things are really all I

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230
because three things are really all I
 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.770
because three things are really all I
can remember and I don't work from notes

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780
can remember and I don't work from notes
 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.870
can remember and I don't work from notes
when I talk to people and I advise other

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880
when I talk to people and I advise other
 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.790
when I talk to people and I advise other
people not to I don't never read it

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800
people not to I don't never read it
 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.270
people not to I don't never read it
because reading just excommunicates you

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280
because reading just excommunicates you
 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.640
because reading just excommunicates you
it's not communication its

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650
it's not communication its
 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.570
it's not communication its
excommunication in my view so I can't

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580
excommunication in my view so I can't
 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.430
excommunication in my view so I can't
remember more than three things and I

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440
remember more than three things and I
 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.870
remember more than three things and I
don't think they can remember more than

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880
don't think they can remember more than
 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.340
don't think they can remember more than
three things so what's the point of

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350
three things so what's the point of
 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.509
three things so what's the point of
telling them stuff they're not going to

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519
telling them stuff they're not going to
 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.460
telling them stuff they're not going to
remember so I stick to through that's

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470
remember so I stick to through that's
 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.490
remember so I stick to through that's
rule number one of through three three

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500
rule number one of through three three
 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.810
rule number one of through three three
things the second rule is if I have a

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820
things the second rule is if I have a
 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.340
things the second rule is if I have a
difficult thing to understand there's

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350
difficult thing to understand there's
 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.630
difficult thing to understand there's
something I think it's not going to be

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640
something I think it's not going to be
 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.090
something I think it's not going to be
that easy to get I try to say it in

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100
that easy to get I try to say it in
 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.860
that easy to get I try to say it in
three different ways because I think if

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870
three different ways because I think if
 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.870
three different ways because I think if
you come in from different angles you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880
you come in from different angles you
 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.479
you come in from different angles you
have a better chance of making a getting

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489
have a better chance of making a getting
 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.699
have a better chance of making a getting
a three-dimensional view of this

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709
a three-dimensional view of this
 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.190
a three-dimensional view of this
difficult idea so I try to say it three

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200
difficult idea so I try to say it three
 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.810
difficult idea so I try to say it three
different ways and the third tip which I

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820
different ways and the third tip which I
 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.310
different ways and the third tip which I
always forget is that if if I have a

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320
always forget is that if if I have a
 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.800
always forget is that if if I have a
difficult thing that that's hard to get

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810
difficult thing that that's hard to get
 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.670
difficult thing that that's hard to get
I try to say it three times through the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680
I try to say it three times through the
 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.180
I try to say it three times through the
talk so that the first time you hear it

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190
talk so that the first time you hear it
 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.009
talk so that the first time you hear it
you start to get used to it the second

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019
you start to get used to it the second
 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.569
you start to get used to it the second
time it's familiar in the third time you

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579
time it's familiar in the third time you
 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.539
time it's familiar in the third time you
say oh yeah yeah right okay

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549
say oh yeah yeah right okay
 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.270
