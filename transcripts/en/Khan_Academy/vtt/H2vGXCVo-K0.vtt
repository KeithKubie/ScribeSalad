00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:02.622
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy

00:00:02.622 --> 00:00:06.978
and today I'm investigating
Article Two of the Constitution

00:00:06.978 --> 00:00:11.308
which establishes the
executive branch of government.

00:00:11.308 --> 00:00:13.271
It's Article Two that establishes

00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:16.604
the office of president
of the United States,

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:21.141
tells us who's eligible for
that role, how they get elected,

00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:23.077
and what powers they have.

00:00:23.077 --> 00:00:26.185
Now today, it seems very natural to us

00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:29.712
that the executive branch
of the US government

00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:33.584
should be led by a president
but at the time of the founding

00:00:33.584 --> 00:00:36.457
it wasn't at all certain
that that would be the case.

00:00:36.457 --> 00:00:39.910
After all, the Founders had just rebelled

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.432
against a monarchy where power

00:00:42.432 --> 00:00:45.180
was placed in the hands of one individual.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.255
They'd been so nervous
about executive power

00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:52.070
that the first governmental
system of the United States,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.022
the Articles of Confederation,

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:56.406
didn't have an executive branch at all.

00:00:56.406 --> 00:00:58.468
So to learn more about Article Two

00:00:58.468 --> 00:01:00.448
I sought out the help of some experts.

00:01:00.448 --> 00:01:02.513
Professor Sai Prakash is an expert

00:01:02.513 --> 00:01:06.238
in the separation of powers,
particularly executive powers

00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:08.018
and teaches constitutional law,

00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:10.946
foreign relations law,
and presidential powers

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:13.494
at the University of
Virginia School of Law.

00:01:13.494 --> 00:01:16.933
For more on the debate about
what an executive branch

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:20.410
should look like, I talked to
Professor Michael Gerhardt.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.519
He's a leading constitutional scholar

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:26.006
whose specialties include
civil rights, civil liberties,

00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:28.018
and separation of powers.

00:01:28.018 --> 00:01:30.106
So Professor Prakash, why did the framers

00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:32.861
choose to invest power in a president?

00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:35.516
Were there any other options
for an executive branch?

00:01:35.516 --> 00:01:37.094
- [Professor Prakash] They
thought about creating

00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:39.261
an executive council, which
would have been composed

00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:41.511
of three or more executives

00:01:42.527 --> 00:01:43.887
that would have jointly exercised

00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:47.330
whatever executive power
they vested in the executive.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.978
And so you might have had a triumvirate

00:01:48.978 --> 00:01:51.977
like they had in Rome,
or an executive council

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:53.773
like they had in some states.

00:01:53.773 --> 00:01:55.792
And they also thought
about doing something

00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:59.455
slightly different, which is
to have a single president,

00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:02.980
but then require the
president to go to a separate

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.845
executive council before he
made several important decisions

00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:11.687
but in the end they decided
we like to concentrate

00:02:11.687 --> 00:02:15.458
executive authority in
the hands of one person

00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:19.780
thinking that that would be
better for law execution,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.396
better for assigning responsibility,

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:25.057
would bring energy to the executive branch

00:02:25.057 --> 00:02:27.921
and the executive branch wouldn't be riven

00:02:27.921 --> 00:02:30.294
with dissent and dissension.

00:02:30.294 --> 00:02:31.352
- [Kim] I asked Professor Gerhardt

00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:32.884
how long it took the framers

00:02:32.884 --> 00:02:36.471
to decide on the form the
executive branch would take.

00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:38.913
- [Professor Gerhardt] It was
something on which the framers

00:02:38.913 --> 00:02:41.419
came to an agreement pretty quickly.

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:45.634
They came into Philadelphia
and almost at the very outset

00:02:45.634 --> 00:02:49.425
there was a proposal that
came forward from Virginia,

00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:52.183
part of the Virginia Plan,
and the Virginia Plan

00:02:52.183 --> 00:02:56.620
proposed a single executive
who would serve for seven years

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.642
and not be eligible for reelection.

00:02:59.642 --> 00:03:02.724
The delegates would eventually
agree on certain features

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:07.265
which are now encapsulated or
can be found in Article Two.

00:03:07.265 --> 00:03:08.876
- [Kim] I think one of the tensions we see

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:11.195
in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights

00:03:11.195 --> 00:03:14.345
is trying to create a
structure for government

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:17.919
that's strong enough to
do what it needs to do,

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.046
but also one that doesn't
have too much power

00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:21.881
so that it doesn't become a tyranny

00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:25.071
as the framers had seen in Europe.

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:28.149
So were they nervous about
having an executive branch

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:29.156
in the first place?

00:03:29.156 --> 00:03:31.395
- [Professor Prakash] That's
a great question, Kim.

00:03:31.395 --> 00:03:35.477
You know, we had a confederation
before the Constitution.

00:03:35.477 --> 00:03:38.223
It was called the Articles
of Confederation and

00:03:38.223 --> 00:03:43.036
in that system we had Congress
acting as a plural executive.

00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:46.512
And Congress and the observers of Congress

00:03:46.512 --> 00:03:49.111
thought that Congress
wasn't really well suited

00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:51.283
to playing the role of executive,

00:03:51.283 --> 00:03:52.837
to supervising foreign affairs,

00:03:52.837 --> 00:03:55.851
and to supervising executive officers

00:03:55.851 --> 00:03:57.916
both military and civilian.

00:03:57.916 --> 00:04:00.775
And so by the eve of the
Philadelphia Convention

00:04:00.775 --> 00:04:02.370
where they wrote the Constitution

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.124
there were quite a few people saying

00:04:04.124 --> 00:04:06.744
we need to have a separate executive.

00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:09.196
We need to invigorate it with authority

00:04:09.196 --> 00:04:11.435
because if we do that we will then have

00:04:11.435 --> 00:04:15.225
a successful new government
under the new Constitution.

00:04:15.225 --> 00:04:17.094
- [Professor Gerhardt]
Alexander Hamilton, for example,

00:04:17.094 --> 00:04:20.754
wanted an executive who would
basically serve for life.

00:04:20.754 --> 00:04:22.298
He didn't get it.

00:04:22.298 --> 00:04:24.879
You can imagine that for many delegates

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.024
an executive who could serve for life

00:04:27.024 --> 00:04:29.674
would sound an awful lot like a king,

00:04:29.674 --> 00:04:31.950
and that's exactly what they
had just rebelled against.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.696
- [Professor Prakash] Other people said

00:04:33.696 --> 00:04:36.558
if you create a unitary executive,

00:04:36.558 --> 00:04:39.987
if you create this single
executive, chief executive

00:04:39.987 --> 00:04:41.377
you're gonna have a monarchy.

00:04:41.377 --> 00:04:45.559
You're gonna have someone who
is intent upon seizing powers

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:48.850
of various sorts, who's
going to want to install

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.185
maybe a hereditary monarchy
somehow and that was the tension

00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:56.379
between those who wanted to
have a stronger executive,

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.398
a stronger single executive thinking that

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:00.758
that would be the best
thing for the government

00:05:00.758 --> 00:05:05.142
and those who thought
that a single executive

00:05:05.142 --> 00:05:08.025
would descend into a monarchy.

00:05:08.025 --> 00:05:10.000
- [Kim] So I imagine it was pretty tricky

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.015
for the Framers to think
how they could have

00:05:13.015 --> 00:05:15.509
an executive branch
that was powerful enough

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.571
to get things done, but not so powerful

00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:20.994
that it took on that tyrannical cast

00:05:20.994 --> 00:05:24.432
that they were really eager to avoid.

00:05:24.432 --> 00:05:28.014
So what powers did the president
eventually end up having?

00:05:28.014 --> 00:05:28.847
- [Professor Prakash]
You know, the president

00:05:28.847 --> 00:05:32.380
is made commander in chief
of the army and the navy.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.314
He has the power to pardon.

00:05:34.314 --> 00:05:35.628
- [Professor Gerhardt] The
president has the authority

00:05:35.628 --> 00:05:39.303
to nominate people to
certain high-ranking offices

00:05:39.303 --> 00:05:42.257
subject to the advice and
consent of the Senate.

00:05:42.257 --> 00:05:46.839
Among those offices are
included Supreme Court justices.

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:48.217
The president has the authority

00:05:48.217 --> 00:05:50.024
to be able to negotiate treaties.

00:05:50.024 --> 00:05:51.716
- [Professor Prakash] So he's
got a host of authorities,

00:05:51.716 --> 00:05:54.560
and then there's the central
question that's disputed, Kim,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.839
which is does the first
sentence of Article Two,

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.766
which says the executive
power shall be vested

00:05:59.766 --> 00:06:01.129
in a President of the United States,

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.105
does that also give the
president any authority

00:06:04.105 --> 00:06:09.104
beyond what's listed in Article
Two sections two and three?

00:06:09.104 --> 00:06:12.055
So for instance, does the
Vesting Clause of Article Two

00:06:12.055 --> 00:06:15.123
give the president authority
over law execution?

00:06:15.123 --> 00:06:17.856
Is he able to direct the
execution of federal laws

00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:20.344
by subordinate executive officers?

00:06:20.344 --> 00:06:22.428
Does the president have
the power to remove

00:06:22.428 --> 00:06:25.424
executive officers by virtue
of the Vesting Clause?

00:06:25.424 --> 00:06:27.052
And then significantly, does he have

00:06:27.052 --> 00:06:31.024
foreign affairs authorities by
virtue of the Vesting Clause

00:06:31.024 --> 00:06:35.031
to speak to other nations to
direct US ambassadors, etc?

00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:39.869
And that's a dispute that's
been ongoing for 200 years

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:42.395
whether the Vesting Clause really grants

00:06:42.395 --> 00:06:44.434
additional authorities to the president.

00:06:44.434 --> 00:06:46.530
- [Professor Gerhardt] So
all those different powers

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.190
we now more or less take for granted

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.433
that are common to US
presidents are all set forth,

00:06:51.433 --> 00:06:54.496
for the most part, expressed
in the Constitution.

00:06:54.496 --> 00:06:55.700
There are a few implicit powers

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.913
the president will take on over time.

00:06:57.913 --> 00:06:59.883
- [Kim] As I understand
it, the president's powers

00:06:59.883 --> 00:07:02.596
have grown fairly significantly over time.

00:07:02.596 --> 00:07:04.793
Do you think the Framers
would be surprised

00:07:04.793 --> 00:07:07.962
by how much power the president has today?

00:07:07.962 --> 00:07:11.242
- [Professor Gerhardt] Yes,
it's grown, I think to be

00:07:11.242 --> 00:07:15.445
perhaps more powerful
than many of the Framers

00:07:15.445 --> 00:07:18.134
initially thought it might be.

00:07:18.134 --> 00:07:20.911
There were some authorities, for example,

00:07:20.911 --> 00:07:23.775
the power to remove people
in the executive branch

00:07:23.775 --> 00:07:26.621
that are not spelled out
explicitly in the Constitution.

00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:30.875
Over time, the presidency
would acquire that power

00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:32.722
and ultimately the Supreme
Court of the United States

00:07:32.722 --> 00:07:35.439
would ratify that, or
affirm that authority.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:38.244
That's one big area, removal power,

00:07:38.244 --> 00:07:39.773
over executive branch officials

00:07:39.773 --> 00:07:43.557
that gets clarified and
sharpened over time.

00:07:43.557 --> 00:07:46.756
- [Professor Prakash] Over
time the president has cited,

00:07:46.756 --> 00:07:49.509
president and his assistants
have cited the Vesting Clause

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:52.935
as a source of a great amount of authority

00:07:52.935 --> 00:07:56.085
and some of those claims you might think

00:07:56.085 --> 00:07:58.241
are consistent with the Constitution

00:07:58.241 --> 00:07:59.911
and others you might
think are inconsistent.

00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:01.825
So what are the things that
presidents have claimed?

00:08:01.825 --> 00:08:04.086
They've claimed the authority to direct

00:08:04.086 --> 00:08:06.161
the execution of federal statutes.

00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:08.976
I think that's consistent
with the original design.

00:08:08.976 --> 00:08:12.232
They've claimed some limited
authority over foreign affairs.

00:08:12.232 --> 00:08:15.284
I think that, too, is consistent
with the original design.

00:08:15.284 --> 00:08:20.187
They've also claimed authority
to exercise certain powers

00:08:20.187 --> 00:08:23.718
in emergencies, that's more
contested and more debatable

00:08:23.718 --> 00:08:26.142
whether they have some
sort of emergency power

00:08:26.142 --> 00:08:28.254
either temporary or otherwise.

00:08:28.254 --> 00:08:29.795
- [Professor Gerhardt] When
Abraham Lincoln comes into power

00:08:29.795 --> 00:08:32.463
Congress is not in session
and Lincoln's gotta respond

00:08:32.463 --> 00:08:35.756
in real time to an invasion
on federal territory

00:08:35.756 --> 00:08:39.261
and to try to begin the
protection of the United States

00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:42.074
and he does that
initially without Congress

00:08:42.074 --> 00:08:44.925
being a part of it because
he has to move very quickly.

00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:46.436
- [Professor Prakash] They've
also claimed the authority

00:08:46.436 --> 00:08:49.519
to wage war and that's also contested

00:08:50.699 --> 00:08:54.229
because of course Congress
has the power to declare war

00:08:54.229 --> 00:08:57.102
and many people believe that that text

00:08:57.102 --> 00:08:59.816
means that Congress gets to
decide whether to wage war.

00:08:59.816 --> 00:09:02.023
Modern presidents take the position,

00:09:02.023 --> 00:09:05.699
or often take the position that
they can use military force

00:09:05.699 --> 00:09:09.733
overseas without getting
a declaration of war

00:09:09.733 --> 00:09:12.947
or more precisely, without
getting congressional approval

00:09:12.947 --> 00:09:15.043
for the use of force overseas.

00:09:15.043 --> 00:09:18.746
So yes, the president's
powers have changed over time

00:09:18.746 --> 00:09:20.989
and that's a source of deep controversy.

00:09:20.989 --> 00:09:24.552
- [Kim] So what checks can
the executive branch use

00:09:24.552 --> 00:09:28.365
on the legislative or judicial
branches of government?

00:09:28.365 --> 00:09:30.913
- [Professor Prakash] Kim,
the executive has a veto.

00:09:30.913 --> 00:09:32.896
And the veto permits the president

00:09:32.896 --> 00:09:37.557
to reject legislation sent
to his desk by Congress.

00:09:37.557 --> 00:09:39.596
So under the Constitution,
congress has to present

00:09:39.596 --> 00:09:41.526
all legislation to the president

00:09:41.526 --> 00:09:45.438
and he can either sign it
and thereby make it law,

00:09:45.438 --> 00:09:48.079
or he can veto it, and if he vetoes it

00:09:48.079 --> 00:09:50.777
and he sends back his
objections to Congress

00:09:50.777 --> 00:09:53.884
they then have the option
of overriding the veto

00:09:53.884 --> 00:09:56.773
by a two-thirds vote in both chambers.

00:09:56.773 --> 00:10:00.940
And so the veto gives the
president great leverage

00:10:02.119 --> 00:10:06.496
over Congress 'cause they know
that if he vehemently opposes

00:10:06.496 --> 00:10:09.672
a particular piece of legislation
they can only pass it if

00:10:09.672 --> 00:10:13.780
there are rather sizable
supermajorities in both chambers.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.805
- [Professor Gerhardt] He has a power

00:10:14.805 --> 00:10:17.119
to be able to pardon people
for federal offenses.

00:10:17.119 --> 00:10:19.844
So again, that's a unique
presidential authority.

00:10:19.844 --> 00:10:22.279
The presidency, in a sense, is
taking more of the limelight

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:26.097
away from Congress, which
might be making the law,

00:10:26.097 --> 00:10:30.607
but administering the law is
gonna require a lot more time

00:10:30.607 --> 00:10:32.501
and put the president in the position

00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:36.327
of also exercising discretion
over how to enforce the law.

00:10:36.327 --> 00:10:38.453
So that becomes another
important authority

00:10:38.453 --> 00:10:41.379
of the presidency, how do
you go about enforcing it?

00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:43.723
What kind of discretion do you
have when you do enforce it?

00:10:43.723 --> 00:10:44.671
- [Professor Prakash]
He also has the power

00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:48.844
to recommend measures to
them under the Constitution.

00:10:48.844 --> 00:10:52.083
That is to say he can suggest
that they pass legislation

00:10:52.083 --> 00:10:54.405
on a particular subject thereby making

00:10:54.405 --> 00:10:56.737
sort of a vague suggestion, or
he can actually present them

00:10:56.737 --> 00:10:59.030
a bill and say I'd like
you to consider this.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.748
They don't have to act on the bill,

00:11:00.748 --> 00:11:02.710
but he has that authority.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.490
And you know, he can also tell them

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.219
about the state of the union, right?

00:11:06.219 --> 00:11:07.651
That's the State of the Union Clause.

00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:11.602
So those are the checks
he sort of has on Congress

00:11:11.602 --> 00:11:13.517
and those are significant checks.

00:11:13.517 --> 00:11:15.617
The members of Congress don't get paid

00:11:15.617 --> 00:11:17.787
unless the president signs the bill

00:11:17.787 --> 00:11:19.665
that passes the appropriation for them

00:11:19.665 --> 00:11:22.592
or they override his veto.

00:11:22.592 --> 00:11:24.182
So those are significant checks.

00:11:24.182 --> 00:11:26.361
And then with respect
to the judiciary, Kim,

00:11:26.361 --> 00:11:31.011
there aren't as many
checks in the Constitution.

00:11:31.011 --> 00:11:34.522
The Constitution never
says the executive branch

00:11:34.522 --> 00:11:38.520
has to execute judgements
issued by the courts,

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.700
but that's been our practice,

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.628
and I think it's an implicit
feature of the Constitution

00:11:43.628 --> 00:11:45.693
that when courts issue judgements

00:11:45.693 --> 00:11:48.720
the executive will honor
them and enforce them.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.094
Because that's an implicit
feature of the Constitution

00:11:51.094 --> 00:11:53.638
presidents don't really have
much leverage over the courts,

00:11:53.638 --> 00:11:58.450
right, because the president
does get to nominate then

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.096
and goes get to appoint
them and that gives him

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:04.596
some sort of say over who becomes a judge,

00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:08.445
but once they're judges
he doesn't have any say

00:12:08.445 --> 00:12:12.620
over what they decide and
he typically, as I said,

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:13.957
enforces their judgment.

00:12:13.957 --> 00:12:16.176
So the check on the judiciary is,

00:12:16.176 --> 00:12:19.452
who gets into the federal courts,

00:12:19.452 --> 00:12:21.853
who gets to serve as a federal judge.

00:12:21.853 --> 00:12:24.396
Once they're judges the
president doesn't have

00:12:24.396 --> 00:12:27.067
the same kind of check
that he has on Congress.

00:12:27.067 --> 00:12:29.714
There's no veto on judicial
decisions, for instance.

00:12:29.714 --> 00:12:31.368
- [Professor Gerhardt] The
president can unilaterally

00:12:31.368 --> 00:12:34.369
or on his own issue what
are called executive orders,

00:12:34.369 --> 00:12:37.156
which are essentially mandates that govern

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:39.339
the operations within
the executive branch.

00:12:39.339 --> 00:12:42.794
One president can set
the priorities one way,

00:12:42.794 --> 00:12:46.618
but another president can
reshape them a different way.

00:12:46.618 --> 00:12:47.901
- [Kim] Interesting,
'cause executive orders

00:12:47.901 --> 00:12:51.591
can do very positive things
like Truman's executive order

00:12:51.591 --> 00:12:54.124
that the armed services be integrated,

00:12:54.124 --> 00:12:57.028
but they can also do very
negative things, for example,

00:12:57.028 --> 00:12:59.866
interning Japanese Americans
during World War Two.

00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:01.063
- [Professor Gerhardt] That is correct.

00:13:01.063 --> 00:13:04.230
And so the executive orders oftentimes

00:13:06.098 --> 00:13:08.931
might reflect a particular
president's values,

00:13:08.931 --> 00:13:12.152
but it can also particular
president's priorities.

00:13:12.152 --> 00:13:14.129
The challenge with an executive order

00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:15.876
is that it only lasts longer

00:13:15.876 --> 00:13:17.378
than a particular president's term

00:13:17.378 --> 00:13:20.405
if other presidents are willing
to sign off on them as well.

00:13:20.405 --> 00:13:23.551
And so for example, you
can see how President Trump

00:13:23.551 --> 00:13:27.183
has decided not to continue
certain executive orders

00:13:27.183 --> 00:13:29.108
that President Obama put into place

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:31.755
just as President Obama
chose not to extend

00:13:31.755 --> 00:13:34.042
certain executive orders
President George W. Bush

00:13:34.042 --> 00:13:36.019
put into place.

00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:38.549
- [Professor Prakash]
Lots of rules and laws

00:13:38.549 --> 00:13:41.962
are not made by Congress
in the modern era.

00:13:41.962 --> 00:13:44.965
They're made by executive
and independent agencies

00:13:44.965 --> 00:13:47.711
and so a lot of the rules
that we have to follow

00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:52.547
about the environment or about
labor or about securities,

00:13:52.547 --> 00:13:55.746
they come from agencies and
not directly from Congress.

00:13:55.746 --> 00:13:58.171
And when the agency is
an executive agency,

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.734
the president not only appoints the people

00:14:00.734 --> 00:14:05.499
that run that agency, the
president or his assistants

00:14:05.499 --> 00:14:07.197
in the White House are often involved

00:14:07.197 --> 00:14:11.521
in crafting the rules and shaping
the rules in various ways.

00:14:11.521 --> 00:14:16.033
And so if we think the mass
of rules and legislation

00:14:16.033 --> 00:14:18.688
comes from the government, the executive

00:14:18.688 --> 00:14:20.303
and not the Congress, then the president

00:14:20.303 --> 00:14:21.630
has a great role in that.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.770
- [Kim] So our first president
was George Washington.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.658
In what ways did Washington
set important precedents

00:14:28.658 --> 00:14:30.570
that are still with us today?

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.010
- [Professor Gerhardt]
There are a lot of people,

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.285
a lot of scholars who think that things

00:14:34.285 --> 00:14:36.904
would've been quite different
had it not been Washington.

00:14:36.904 --> 00:14:39.579
And the fact that George Washington

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:41.474
would become the first president

00:14:41.474 --> 00:14:43.388
helped put a lot of people at ease

00:14:43.388 --> 00:14:47.036
because he was widely
viewed as trustworthy

00:14:47.036 --> 00:14:49.597
and somebody who wouldn't
be naturally disposed

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.388
to become tyrannical.

00:14:51.388 --> 00:14:53.644
And Washington himself understood

00:14:53.644 --> 00:14:55.710
from the very outset of his administration

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.398
that nearly everything he
did would create a precedent

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:01.559
for other presidents to
follow, and so Washington

00:15:01.559 --> 00:15:04.410
ends up becoming quite influential,

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.250
not just in helping to define things,

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.378
but also in reassuring
people that this system

00:15:09.378 --> 00:15:11.423
can get off the ground and the presidency

00:15:11.423 --> 00:15:13.964
wouldn't necessarily
be a tyrannical office

00:15:13.964 --> 00:15:15.848
and that the president, in fact,

00:15:15.848 --> 00:15:20.240
could be an effective
part of a new government.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.060
- [Professor Prakash] If
Washington's not there

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:26.812
and they can't see an honest
man taking over as president,

00:15:26.812 --> 00:15:29.562
you might very well have
had an executive council.

00:15:29.562 --> 00:15:31.401
You know, they might have been wary

00:15:31.401 --> 00:15:33.916
of who would be a unitary executive

00:15:33.916 --> 00:15:35.432
and wanted to have a plural executive

00:15:35.432 --> 00:15:38.069
in order to make sure that no one person

00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:42.230
became too powerful, and another
way of thinking about this

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.251
is if you create a new Constitution

00:15:45.251 --> 00:15:47.252
in the wake of President Nixon,

00:15:47.252 --> 00:15:49.044
you're gonna have a different Constitution

00:15:49.044 --> 00:15:52.531
because people are more
distrustful of executive authority.

00:15:52.531 --> 00:15:54.142
If you have a new Constitution

00:15:54.142 --> 00:15:58.309
after a really honest and noble
and successful presidency,

00:15:59.514 --> 00:16:02.989
people are gonna write
an executive article

00:16:02.989 --> 00:16:05.271
that's more favorable to the president.

00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:07.115
And the situation for Washington

00:16:07.115 --> 00:16:08.545
couldn't have been more favorable.

00:16:08.545 --> 00:16:11.819
They had seen the problems
with weak execution

00:16:11.819 --> 00:16:14.034
under the articles and in the states.

00:16:14.034 --> 00:16:16.820
They thought that weak
executives were a problem.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.596
They saw this person who
could be a strong executive

00:16:20.596 --> 00:16:23.372
and be a responsible and wise executive

00:16:23.372 --> 00:16:26.161
and those two things conspired to create

00:16:26.161 --> 00:16:29.444
an executive that was one of
the most powerful in the world.

00:16:29.444 --> 00:16:31.241
- [Professor Gerhardt] So
Washington is trying to signal,

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:34.703
look, we don't want to
create tyrants here.

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:37.818
We're not kings, we're
not presidents for life.

00:16:37.818 --> 00:16:40.079
We'll serve at most for a couple terms

00:16:40.079 --> 00:16:43.279
and then we will willingly
lay down our authority

00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:44.971
and let other people follow us.

00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:48.795
That's actually a critical
precedent, but again,

00:16:48.795 --> 00:16:51.871
every president until
Franklin Roosevelt follows

00:16:51.871 --> 00:16:55.703
and it's one that reflects
Washington's special values

00:16:55.703 --> 00:16:58.544
that the most important
office, ultimately,

00:16:58.544 --> 00:17:00.494
is not the office of the presidency,

00:17:00.494 --> 00:17:02.896
it's actually the office, so to speak,

00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:06.347
the position of being a
citizen of this country.

00:17:06.347 --> 00:17:08.668
- [Kim] So we've learned
that thanks to the example

00:17:08.668 --> 00:17:11.340
set by George Washington, the
Framers of the Constitution

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.730
felt confident that
they could invest power

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:17.600
in a president to have an
energetic executive branch.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.663
But as Sai Prakash noted, the
Framers might be surprised

00:17:20.663 --> 00:17:23.637
at the way the president's
powers have grown over time

00:17:23.637 --> 00:17:26.859
through executive orders and
the use of military force.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.301
However, Michael Gerhardt
brings up an important point

00:17:29.301 --> 00:17:30.865
that in the United States

00:17:30.865 --> 00:17:35.100
the president is first and
foremost a citizen, not a ruler.
