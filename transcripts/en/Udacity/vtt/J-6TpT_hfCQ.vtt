00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.330
Thinking back to our example,
the pizza cut into eight slices,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.689
we remember that Bob and
I are sharing the pizza.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.900
We know that if I eat two slices,
so these are my two slices,

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.940
that's me, and Bob, and this is Bob,
eats one slice of pizza,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.600
that means we've eaten one,
two, three slices of pizza.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.680
We remember from our
previous example that I

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.509
ate two-eighths of the pizza because two
slices out of the eight total slices.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.104
And Bob ate one-eighth of the pizza,

00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:40.710
that's his one slice out
of eight total slices,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.110
and together we ate
three-eighths of pizza.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.100
How can we find out how many
pieces of pizza are left?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.080
Well, we could just count them and
see that we have one, two, three, four,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.910
five pieces of pizza left but
I'd like to show this in a fraction.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.685
To show what's going on with
the fraction, we should start with

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:06.600
eight-eights because that represents the
whole pizza, eight slices out of eight.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.215
Then we should subtract the amount
that we've eaten already which is

00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:13.740
three-eights.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.710
This problem is in a convenient form for

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.580
us because we can see that
the denominators are the same.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.730
They are common denominators.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.850
When we have fractions like
this with common denominators,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.410
all we have to do is
look at the numerators.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.910
We know that no matter what

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.020
the fraction that results will
have an eight in the denominator.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.460
So what's 8 minus 3?

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.800
5.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.760
And when fractions have
common denominators,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.350
we know that the denominator here will
be the same thing as what we have here.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.553
So it's 8, five-eighths.

00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:51.420
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.710
Just like when we counted.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.640
So remember, when you have common
denominators in your fractions,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.720
all you have to do is keep
the denominator the same.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.330
And then add or
subtract what's in the numerator.
