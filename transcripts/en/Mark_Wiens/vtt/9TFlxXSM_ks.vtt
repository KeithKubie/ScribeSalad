00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:02.350
(tapping)

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.530
- When I was in the Quintana
Roo state of Mexico,

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.390
one of the things I was most excited to do

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.440
was experience and eat ancient Mayan food,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.220
so we rented a van and drove to Chunhuhub,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.690
a small Mayan village deep
in the Yucatan Peninsula

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.080
known for preserving
Mayan cultural traditions.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.950
If you love chocolate, corn
tortillas, or guacamole,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.280
you, well actually we
have the Mayans to thank.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.440
In this video I'm taking
you on a culinary experience

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.510
where we'll cook and eat
traditional Mayan food,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.588
and wow, is it fascinating.

00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:39.171
(mellow music)

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.320
Okay, we're all loaded up in the car,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.170
and by the way, meet my
friend, my buddy Carlos.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.850
We're traveling with Carlos
and his wife and Armando.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.140
Ying and Micah are all in the back.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.120
So we're driving to a place,
it's called Chunhuhub.

00:00:59.847 --> 00:01:02.420
I think that's how you, it's fully Mayan,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.180
but it's about a two and a half hour drive

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.870
from Playa Del Carmen, so we're gonna

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.910
just follow the map into the jungle.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.680
We're on our way.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.513
Carlos, listo?

00:01:11.513 --> 00:01:12.505
- Do it.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:13.338
Listo, vamanos.

00:01:13.338 --> 00:01:14.171
- Vamanos.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.820
Just stopping quickly to
get some gas to fill up.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.550
Been driving for about an hour and a half.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.540
We have reached a place it's
called Felipe Carrillo Puerto.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.990
Wow, it's been gorgeous so far.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.680
We're really getting off the beaten path.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.965
Oh yeah, what is that?

00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:49.632
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.180
There's a very nice lady who
is serving, como se llama?

00:01:56.213 --> 00:01:57.395
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:57.395 --> 00:01:58.228
- Panuchos.

00:01:58.228 --> 00:01:59.061
- [Mark] Panuchos.

00:01:59.061 --> 00:01:59.894
- [Carlos] Panuchos.

00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:00.980
- Ah, panuchos, they look like a little,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.710
almost like a tostada
wrapper on the bottom

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.050
and then topped with, it looks like topped

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.990
with chicken and avocado, lettuce,

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.370
and there might be some
beans on the inside, yeah?

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.550
Thanks, man.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.610
- [Carlos] Todo buenas, man.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.990
- Here it is, my panucho,
it's a little breakfast snack.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.076
Que paso?

00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:20.909
- Panucho.

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:21.742
- Panucho.

00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:26.514
(panucho crunching)

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.963
Mm.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.150
Yeah.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.650
It's really good.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.310
A little bit cold, but
it's kinda cold outside.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.510
Possibly on the inside, maybe it's beans,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.780
but it's just a very thin
layer on the inside there.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.770
But that kind of gives it a
nice kind of different texture

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.658
and flavor to the whole
little handheld treat.

00:02:50.658 --> 00:02:53.658
(panucho crunching)

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.718
- [Wife] Did you want another, Carlos?

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:57.551
- [Carlos] Hmm?

00:02:57.551 --> 00:02:59.370
- This was a much needed
little road snack.

00:03:01.255 --> 00:03:03.870
(mellow music)

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.620
And we have about 40 minutes to go.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.450
We made it to Chunhuhub.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.970
The place that we're going
to do the Mayan cooking

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.320
and to eat is just down the road.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.140
I think it's about a 10
minute ride from this town

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.750
but this is a very off the
beaten path destination.

00:03:28.136 --> 00:03:30.719
(mellow music)

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.050
Oh, I need to stretch.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.770
That was almost a three hour drive

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.150
from Playa Del Carmen,
but we have arrived.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.760
This is actually a whole eco lodge,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.370
but they also preserve Mayan culture here,

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.480
so we're gonna see it, have a chance

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.530
to watch traditional Mayan
cooking and to eat Mayan food

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.500
coming up very soon.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.390
We're literally like
somewhere in the center

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.620
of the Yucatan Peninsula.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.630
We're right on the border, kind of close

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.830
between Quintana Roo the
state and Yucatan state.

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.080
Gracias.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.360
It's some kind of a citrus,
I think orange juice.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.280
A type of, mm, but it has like a,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.270
almost like a bitter smell to it.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.103
Slightly.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.530
Oh!

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.644
Oh, that is wonderful.

00:04:26.644 --> 00:04:30.060
It's like a cross between,
tastes like lime-y

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.210
yet orange-y at the same time.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.548
It's delicious.

00:04:36.548 --> 00:04:39.081
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:39.081 --> 00:04:39.914
Naranja agria.

00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:41.348
It was a sour orange.

00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:45.015
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.570
Okay, so we're just walking
back into the garden

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.190
and into the compound.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.330
It's beautiful back here,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.003
it's just a fruit and vegetable paradise.

00:05:02.003 --> 00:05:04.586
(upbeat music)

00:05:12.548 --> 00:05:16.030
(speaking foreign language)

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.820
Oh like a tamales pib, ah.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.340
This is the traditional Mayan milpa,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.090
which is a, it's like
a whole garden complex,

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.140
self-sufficient, vegetables and fruit

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.770
and cooking and I think you,

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.360
anyway, this is the milpa,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.910
and they just started the fire,

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.040
you can see the logs are burning

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.460
and then there's a bunch of
rocks on top that we're gonna,

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.640
I think we're gonna cook
some things underground,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.640
and it's called a pib.

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:49.232
Hola.

00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:50.554
- Hola.

00:05:50.554 --> 00:05:51.387
Buen dia.

00:05:51.387 --> 00:05:52.876
- [Mark] Buenas dias.

00:05:52.876 --> 00:05:56.543
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:00.543 --> 00:06:01.620
- [Man] Okay.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.287
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.095
- [Man] It's very traditional.

00:06:29.095 --> 00:06:29.928
- [Mark] Okay.

00:06:29.928 --> 00:06:30.761
- [Man] She was saying when she was a kid,

00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:31.594
she didn't like it because it was like

00:06:31.594 --> 00:06:32.520
so traditional back then.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.320
- This is absolutely beautiful

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.920
to see the Mayan food culture like this.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.920
Right now they are working on preparing

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.310
a few different types of tamales,

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.930
which are traditional
in the Mayan culture.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.800
After they finished
wrapping all of the tamales

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.660
in, there's both banana leaf packets,

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.570
and another type of leaf.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.410
This is the, oh, this is the,
it's called the Hoja Santa,

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.740
and this is another leaf
that they're wrapping

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.880
some of the tamales in,

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.390
but then right outside is where the pib,

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.520
it's like an underground
oven, where they dig a hole

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.270
and then they burn wood, and
then they put hot rocks on top,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.100
that's outside, that's
being lit right now,

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.780
that's getting ready for the preparation.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.230
I'm just getting hungrier by the second.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.205
But I am so excited.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:21.532
(speaking foreign language)

00:07:21.532 --> 00:07:24.115
(upbeat music)

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.440
- Another dish that they're making

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.820
is called cochinita pibil,

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.990
and it's a pork dish which is marinated

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.910
in a bunch of spices,
they just showed it to me.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.680
They have already pre-marinated it

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.801
because they say it
takes a very long time.

00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:54.825
But you'll find that dish across Mexico,

00:07:54.825 --> 00:07:57.170
but they are telling
us that a lot of times

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.870
it's not made the traditional way anymore.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.090
It's originally from the
Yucatan Peninsula area,

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.410
it's a Mayan dish, and they're going

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:08.990
to be cooking it underground in that oven,

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.750
the traditional way, so
we're gonna have a chance

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.480
to try the authentic version.

00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:24.830
Wow that feels, it's so hot,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.870
the immense heat coming off of it.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.300
Something I have to share with you

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.630
that's really, really cool, though,

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.380
is you can't really see it right now

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.100
but I might have gotten a shot earlier

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.530
where the sticks, the wood,

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.150
was covering this entire ground pit,

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.320
and then the rocks were on top

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.800
and then they lit the wood on fire

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.360
and they say that they
know that the fire is ready

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.720
to start cooking when
the rocks break the wood

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.550
because the wood has burned enough,

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.340
and then the rocks fall
down to the ground,

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.920
and so they have just fallen.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.230
We were actually in the hut,
we could hear like crack,

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.540
and the sticks broke,
and in traditional Mayan

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.850
they called in wood in fire,

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.260
and this is a very authentic way

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.407
to cook traditional Mayan food.

00:09:10.407 --> 00:09:14.074
(speaking foreign language)

00:09:33.416 --> 00:09:35.999
(upbeat music)

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.020
There's another version that she's making

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.990
that's unlike anything I've ever seen.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:07.990
It almost looks like a pot
pie or like a giant muffin,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.880
but she takes some of the masa,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.660
she makes it into a little cup,

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.930
then she adds in some of
this, kind of orange-y,

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.230
I'm not totally sure what it is yet,

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.020
sauce and then she adds in
some chicken, and then tops it,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:26.020
and then pats down some
more masa, corn meal mixture

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.650
and then tops it with a lid

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.550
and then wraps it up
into a banana leaf packet

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.950
and that's another type of Mayan tamale

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.405
that we're going to try today.

00:10:35.405 --> 00:10:39.072
(speaking foreign language)

00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:51.811
(spoon scraping and food sizzling)

00:11:12.562 --> 00:11:14.075
- [Man] This one is Tox-sel.

00:11:14.075 --> 00:11:14.908
- Tox-sel.

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:16.296
- [Man] Tox-sel.

00:11:16.296 --> 00:11:18.610
(speaking foreign language)

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.860
- And it's the white beans,
but so cool how she made it.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.530
They took a rock directly out of the pib,

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.950
stuck it into the pot with the beans,

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.650
and you could immediately hear it

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.460
just hissing as it cooked.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.510
You can smell the, you can see
the smoke pouring off of it,

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.670
it smelled so good, probably
because it's burning

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.450
with the spices as well.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.810
That's really cool to watch.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.620
Awesome method of cooking.

00:11:43.439 --> 00:11:47.106
(speaking foreign language)

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.693
(fire popping)

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.720
They took out all the wood which
is burning right over here.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.440
You do not want to fall into this pit

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.440
or you would be roasted.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.130
Oh and now some giant,
looks like some type of palm

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.520
are being covered, covering the pit.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.187
(speaking foreign language)

00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:32.729
(palms rustling)

00:12:37.318 --> 00:12:40.068
(metal creaking)

00:12:44.191 --> 00:12:47.858
(speaking foreign language)

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.120
Every now and then, you
can hear like a little,

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.600
a little explosion under there maybe some,

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.760
a rock exploding, maybe
some food exploding.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.570
That is gonna bake for
about an hour and a half.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.194
That is a Mayan feast cooking underground.

00:13:07.194 --> 00:13:08.560
I can't wait!

00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:18.116
(speaking foreign language)

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.360
As we're waiting for the
pib to finish cooking

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.510
we're actually gonna have a snack

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:35.290
and so she's making fresh
tortillas and that's just masa,

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.620
I asked her what's in it,
it's just pure, raw corn

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.250
pounded with water, that's it,

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.110
and then she makes it
into a tortilla shape.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.600
She puts in onto the
hot griddle over fire,

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.140
and we're gonna eat these fresh tortillas

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.530
along with that Tox-sel,
which is what she cooked

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.930
with that lava rock, that hot stone

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.910
which she mixed in with those beans.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.460
This is gonna be our appetizer.

00:13:56.566 --> 00:14:00.233
(speaking foreign language)

00:14:12.224 --> 00:14:14.220
It has this unbelievable,
I'm getting the steam,

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.140
I'm bathing in the steam because I want to

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.070
because it smells so good.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.410
It's like this really unique,

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:23.100
almost, I guess roasted garlic,

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.030
but it's like a really umami smell

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.030
coming off of those beans.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.542
It's really, really unique.

00:14:30.542 --> 00:14:33.125
(upbeat music)

00:14:41.033 --> 00:14:42.822
(speaking foreign language)

00:14:42.822 --> 00:14:44.072
Muchas gracias.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.310
These are ultra fresh tortillas

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.200
right of the griddle.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.180
When you take one out of that little gourd

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.810
they're steaming hot, and
then you put some of the,

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.150
I remembered the name,
it's called tok-sel,

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.960
and you put some of those beans,

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.550
oh, by the way, that unique aroma

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.370
and ingredient in those beans,
they said is pumpkin seed

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.940
which is ground up and
put inside those beans,

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.980
and then a little bit of salsa on top,

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.310
you wrap this up, a
little taco, and, okay.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.120
Mm.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:16.953
Oh.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.310
Oh, those beans are amazing!

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.310
It's so smoky, like, intense
smokiness from that rock,

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.520
but then you do taste
that variation of flavor

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.460
from those pumpkin seeds
which has a little bit of a,

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.140
kind of earthy, kind of,

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.990
almost like smoky meat

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.580
kind of flavor to those beans.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.660
That is incredible.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:44.643
Mm.

00:15:46.492 --> 00:15:47.870
That's a two biter.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.736
- [Man] What is it?

00:15:52.736 --> 00:15:53.569
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:55.069
- [Woman] Achiote.

00:15:56.046 --> 00:15:58.670
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.752
- [Mark] Can I see that?

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:04.419
(speaking foreign language)

00:16:08.832 --> 00:16:09.665
- [Man] It takes a while.

00:16:09.665 --> 00:16:12.380
(speaking foreign language)

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.050
- Oh, they wanted to show us the plant,

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:17.250
kind of red-orange color and they use that

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.210
in a lot of dishes.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.910
Oh yeah, it has a little
bit of a taste, like a...

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.000
A little floral-y, floral
taste, maybe a little,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.220
but very light though.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.080
So we've got about an hour and a half

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.890
to wait for the food to cook.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.220
So we are just gonna take it easy.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.860
Micah is loving it here.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:46.090
The breeze, the shade,
the natural fresh air.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.530
And yeah, this is great.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.790
We're just going to relax
until the food is ready,

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.555
until the Mayan feast is ready.

00:16:51.555 --> 00:16:52.388
Oh!

00:16:52.388 --> 00:16:57.388
Oh, Micah, look at these
giant lemons, or limes?

00:16:57.435 --> 00:16:58.640
- [Woman] No, it's orange.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.831
- No, I don't think it's orange.

00:17:00.831 --> 00:17:04.281
(speaking foreign language)

00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:06.864
(upbeat music)

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.545
That was a long wait, but it's time.

00:17:39.545 --> 00:17:42.378
(shovel scraping)

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.820
Look at that steam just coming out now.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.970
(palms rustling)

00:18:09.117 --> 00:18:12.784
(speaking foreign language)

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.370
You can still feel the heat of those rocks

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:29.610
coming out even after two hours of baking,

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.360
but as soon as he took
off those palm leaves

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.360
you get this eruption of
like roasted leaf aroma,

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:39.930
baked and steamed all in there.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.050
I am so excited right now,

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.410
and they have a whole
really nice dining room

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.620
but the light is a
little bit dark in there,

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.590
so I thought it would be
perfect to sit outside,

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.140
sit within the milpa,
sit within the garden

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.230
that we've been cooking in

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.290
and that we have just been hanging out in.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.980
The food looks absolutely incredible.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.576
I gotta start eating immediately.

00:19:03.576 --> 00:19:05.960
I absolutely have to begin
with the cochinita pibil.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.320
It's a piece of pork,
with all that spice on it.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.730
You can see all that red-orange color

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.380
which came from that spice that we,

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.250
that flower thing that we checked out,

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.710
and you can see all the juices
at the bottom of that plate.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.120
This is just, I bet it's tender,

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.470
and just loaded with flavor.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.020
Oh, look at how tender that is!

00:19:28.633 --> 00:19:30.522
(laughs)

00:19:30.522 --> 00:19:31.740
Oh.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.910
Oh, wow.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.210
I think there's some red
dried chile in there.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.940
But you can taste that little fruit.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.040
Kind of almost has a, a citrus-y,
peppery component to it.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.060
Okay and she said it would be best

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.050
to eat it with tortillas
and some of the onions.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.950
That sauce will absolutely blow your mind.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.220
And the tenderness of that pork

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.180
and that just caked on spice.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.940
Oh wow, it's unbelievably good.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.490
Put this into a tortilla.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.490
I'm gonna add on some of the
cebollas, some of the onions,

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.260
which they look very purple,

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.320
and maybe they're marinated in something?

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.450
And then finally I will
add on some of the roasted

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:16.360
hot chile sauce, she
said it's muy picante,

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.510
which is very spicy.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.820
Which I need.

00:20:26.681 --> 00:20:29.931
(slurping and chewing)

00:20:30.924 --> 00:20:33.174
(laughing)

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:37.790
Unbelievable.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:43.660
That pork, the sour vinegared
onions, pickled onions,

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.950
it tastes like burnt chiles.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.540
Yeah, they do have a kick to them.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.373
Excellent.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.880
Insane, with those freshly made tortillas.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.930
Absolutely amazing.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.570
It's absolutely stunning.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.820
So incredibly good.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.200
Okay, so we've got all
three different types

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.390
of tamales on this plate.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:12.360
This is that giant like
cupcake, wow, that's heavy!

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.650
This is that giant one, and this one

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.820
is a variation with the beans.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.120
I think those same white
beans on the inside,

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.570
and then this one is quite
an amazing looking one,

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.130
and something like I've never seen before

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.560
wrapped up in multiple leaves.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.880
There's beans in the middle
with masa around it as well.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.600
Okay, I'm just going to
reach in with my hands here

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.800
and try a piece of this,

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.570
wow, that's a, that looks very hearty.

00:21:37.945 --> 00:21:39.530
Oh, it's still so hot.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.010
And then it's wrapped in that leaf,

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.780
which is called Hoja Santa.

00:21:46.583 --> 00:21:48.180
(bird calling)

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.020
Mm, mm.

00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:53.300
So it's, I mean it's a
little bit on the dry side

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:58.180
because it's so starchy and so
many beans and corn in there,

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.570
but the flavor, I love the flavor.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.780
I think the unique thing
that I can immediately taste

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.410
is that one leaf, Hoja Santa, which has a,

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.420
not really bitter, well, slightly bitter,

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.570
very green tasting, and very unique.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.710
But then you've got the creamy beans,

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:22.150
you've got the very fine corn paste.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.250
Mm, and that leaf just
keeps on giving flavor.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.630
Okay, I'm gonna add
some of the tomato salsa

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:30.375
onto this for next, this is the
one she says goes with this.

00:22:30.375 --> 00:22:33.213
(birds chirping)

00:22:33.213 --> 00:22:35.370
It's a little bit dry,
but I really like it.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.660
I'm gonna revolve the
plate and I'm gonna try

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.260
the giant one too which
is filled with meat.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.320
So I gotta unravel this,

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.820
and this also has that orange coloring,

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.950
seasoning to it as well.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.140
That jungle seasoning.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.860
Let's break into this.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.480
Oh, yeah, it's just full of meat.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.990
Oh, and all that orange sauce,
take a look inside of that.

00:23:02.524 --> 00:23:05.110
And all of that masa, that thick masa.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.440
Okay I'm gonna take a center bite

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.670
so I get a lot of that orange sauce

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:09.720
and some of that chicken as well.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.354
I got a little bit of all
the components on this bite.

00:23:12.354 --> 00:23:14.937
(upbeat music)

00:23:17.168 --> 00:23:18.812
Mm, again you can taste

00:23:18.812 --> 00:23:22.630
that little orange-red fruit in there.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.060
It has a little bit of a peppery taste.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.220
I mean, it's mild in flavor,
but you can just taste

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.210
the naturalness of it.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:34.210
The chicken, the corn,
that fruit in there.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.970
It's like warming, it's
hearty, it's filling,

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.320
it's nutritious.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.620
It's awesome food.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.820
Okay, and now I have
the final tamale to try

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.530
which is this other one,

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.790
and yeah, just, I love
how everything is natural,

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:55.840
all the ingredients are natural,

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.928
all the ingredients are from right here.

00:23:57.928 --> 00:24:01.410
It's eco-friendly, it's traditional,

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:05.300
this is ancient cooking,
and this is cooking

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.541
using the land, ancient Mayan food,

00:24:07.541 --> 00:24:09.630
and it's absolutely superb.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.210
Mm, mm.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:20.559
Oh, so the same type of
beans with the pumpkin seeds

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:22.220
except this time it's
been cooked underground

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.250
and wrapped in that masa.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.755
Mm, the flavor is awesome.

00:24:26.755 --> 00:24:30.040
Again, I do like it with
a little bit of sauce

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.290
because it's kind of dry.

00:24:32.707 --> 00:24:36.450
But that's just hearty, filling, Mayan,

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:38.180
delicious natural food.

00:24:39.361 --> 00:24:41.944
(upbeat music)

00:25:02.645 --> 00:25:04.728
(laughs)

00:25:06.882 --> 00:25:08.190
That's outstanding.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:09.580
That is so incredibly good.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.770
Oh wow, that masa is extremely heavy.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.160
I'm very full after that meal,

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.910
but it was, yeah it was delicious.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.890
I loved learning about Mayan culture

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.210
and learning about the food,

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:39.270
how some of the traditional
Mayan dishes are cooked

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.970
and then trying them.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.700
The pork, the cochinita
pibil, was insanely good.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.280
The tamales were all very
unique and also very good

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.170
but very, very filling, and everyone here,

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:51.860
they've been so nice to us,

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.920
they're so warm, they're so generous.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.440
Yeah, they're very, very nice people,

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.070
and this is just, it's such a cool place.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.250
You can come here, it's right,

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.610
I mean it's a little, it's quite
a ways off the beaten path,

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.270
and that's what makes it
so amazing here as well.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.260
You can come here, you can learn

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.520
about traditional Mayan culture,

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.510
you can eat, you can cook.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.540
This place is an entire
eco lodge, and it's called

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.420
Kiichipam K'aax, and I
will have all the details

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.610

It's been a fantastic time here.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:26.840
I've thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.054
I've learned so much about
the Yucatan Peninsula

00:26:29.054 --> 00:26:32.332
and Mayan culture, just
from one day spending here

00:26:32.332 --> 00:26:34.020
and learning about the food.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.980
I want to say a huge
thank you to everyone here

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:40.980
for their extreme generosity
and yeah, it's been a privilege

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.370
to have a chance to hang
out here and eat Mayan food.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:45.890
