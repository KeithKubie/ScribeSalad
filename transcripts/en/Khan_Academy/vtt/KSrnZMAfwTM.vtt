00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.440
So let's say I have tables where
I can fit one person at either

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.390
of the short ends of the table.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.892
So I could fit one person there.

00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:10.100
I could fit one person there.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.350
You could view this as we're
looking from above the table

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.850
here.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.410
So we could put one
person at either

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.050
of the short ends of the table.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.980
And then on these longer
ends right over here,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.260
we can fit two people.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.810
We can fit two people
at the longer end.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.830
So when you have one table,
you could fit one, two, three,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.810
four, five, six people.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.704
You could fit six people.

00:00:31.704 --> 00:00:33.120
Now let's think
about what happens

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.490
as we add tables end to end
to this table right over here.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.720
So let's imagine now two tables.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.980
So here we have
one table, and it's

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.855
going to touch ends with
this table right over here.

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:47.730
And because it touches
ends right over here--

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.180
we're making it one
big continuous table--

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.210
you can't fit
someone here anymore.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.190
So now how many
people can we fit?

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.690
Let's see.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.259
We can fit one, two,
three, four, five.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.050
And then on this table,
which is identical,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.805
you could fit six,
seven, eight, nine.

00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:06.180
And then you could
put one person

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.390
at the end right over here.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.730
So when you have two
tables end to end,

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.840
you can fit a
total of 10 people.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.240
Let's keep going and see if we
can think of a pattern here.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.630
So let's put three
tables here-- so

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.740
one table, two tables,
and three tables.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.460
So just as before, we
could put one at each end.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.600
So that's two people.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.140
Then we have 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.750
14 folks-- 14 folks.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.089
So what does it look
like is happening here.

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:47.630
Well if you just
look at the numbers,

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.240
we went from 6 to 10 to 14.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.400
It looks like we're adding four
people every time we actually

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.440
add a table.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.841
Now does that
actually makes sense?

00:01:58.841 --> 00:02:00.590
So let's think about
this first situation.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.090
Let's imagine these
are real people,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.320
and I'll make this person
in blue right over here.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.780
If you were to bring
over this new table,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.000
if you bring over table
two-- so this is table one--

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.882
this blue person has to move.

00:02:13.882 --> 00:02:15.090
And so where could they move?

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.465
Let's say that
they always insist

00:02:16.465 --> 00:02:17.950
on sitting at the
end of a table.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.800
So the blue person moves to
the new end of the table.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.290
They move right over here.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.480
So how many new people could
move to this combined table

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.650
now that you brought
this second table in?

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.310
Well the new people I will
do in this purple color.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.840
The new people are
that person-- let

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.510
me do it in a more unique
color-- this person,

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.820
this person, this
person, and this person.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.580
So you were able to add four
new people with the new table.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.250
One way to think about
it is a new table

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.580
is going to have
one usable end here.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.830
That usable end is going to
be taken by the person who

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.380
was already at the usable end
of when you had less tables.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.530
And so the real addition
is the two sides here.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.630
So you're adding four people
every time you add a table.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.890
So it makes complete sense.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.760
So based on this, you
could think about,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.080
without even having to draw
these diagrams, how many people

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.650
you would be able to fit
if you had four or five

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.670
or six or however many tables.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.590
So you could imagine,
if you have four tables,

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.060
we just have to
add four, and you

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.700
should be able to sit 18 people.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.420
If you have five
tables, you should

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.960
be able to fit 22 people
and on and on and on.
