00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:04.338
- OOH, OUR NEXT REVIEW CAME
TO US IN AN EMAIL...

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:06.340
- MM-HMM.
- FROM "TOOMUCHTANYA2000,"

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:08.442
OH, IN MADISON, WISCONSIN.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:21.855
- RACISM--A DISLIKE OF OTHERS
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT.

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:23.457
WELL, I GUESS
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.394
MY OUTLOOK AND BECOME...
A RACIST.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.831
FOR YOU, MY BLACK FRIEND.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.934
BEFORE I EMBARKED ON MY JOURNEY
OF RACE-BASED HATRED,

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.036
I PAID A VISIT
TO MY BLACK NEIGHBOR, GENE,

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:39.273
TO BANK SOME GOODWILL
FOR THE DIFFICULT TIMES AHEAD.

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:42.209
I HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT OF
BLACK PEOPLE SIMPLY AS PEOPLE

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:43.777
AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.879
DIDN'T THINK MUCH WAS SPECIAL
ABOUT THEM.

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:47.848
BUT NOW I WOULD NEED
TO DISCOVER WHAT IT WAS

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.550
THAT MADE THEM DIFFERENT

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:54.121
AND HOW I COULD TURN THAT
INTO FEELINGS OF RED-HOT RACISM.

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:56.356
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,
I STUMBLED UPON A FAMILY REUNION

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.860
OF BLACK PEOPLE, WHICH WAS BEING
HELD IN A PUBLIC PARK

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.495
WHERE ANYONE COULD JOIN THEM.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.897
HI, THERE.
[chuckles]

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.899
- YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO'S RUDE?
CAMERON.

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:09.570
SHE SAYS TO ME, "OH, YOU NEED
TO DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR HAIR."

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:11.839
- [scoffs]
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:14.875
OVER THE COURSE OF A PRODUCTIVE
AND ENJOYABLE AFTERNOON

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.677
OF INTERRACIAL EAVESDROPPING,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.145
I LEARNED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:20.314
OF UNFLATTERING THINGS
ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE.

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:22.149
- WHO INVITED YOU, AGAIN?

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:24.918
- THEY INSULT YOUR HAIR
WHEN THEIR WEAVE LOOKS TERRIBLE,

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:26.320
THEY SHOOT OFF THEIR MOUTHS
TO DERRICK

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.088
ABOUT THINGS
THAT DON'T CONCERN THEM,

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.090
AND, MOST INFURIATINGLY,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.426
THEY WON'T STOP TALKING
ABOUT THEIR CATERING BUSINESS.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.561
WAS IT DIFFICULT
TO EARN THEIR TRUST?

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:37.998
SO LONG, EVERYBODY!

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:41.869
I NOW HAD THE AMMUNITION
TO GET SERIOUSLY RACIST.

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:45.239
HEY, SHUT UP ABOUT
YOUR CATERING BUSINESS!

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.341
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:48.542
ACTUALLY, CAN YOU MAKE THAT
A DIET COKE, PLEASE?

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.677
I AM WATCHING MY CALORIES,

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:53.780
AND I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA RUN
ALONG AND TELL THAT TO DERRICK.

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:55.716
- DERRICK?

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.451
- I KNOW A FEW THINGS.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:58.785
OH, GOOD.
YES, THANK YOU.

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.254
RIGHT NEXT
TO THE OTHER ONE, PLEASE.

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:01.588
IT WAS NECESSARY
FOR MY NEW RACIST ATTITUDE

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:03.457
TO PERVADE MY ENTIRE LIFE,

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.725
INCLUDING AT THE WORKPLACE.

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:07.861
ATTENTION, EVERYONE!
NEW POLICY.

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:11.765
THIS WILL BE STRICTLY,
HARSHLY, ENFORCED.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.734
[toilet flushes]
BUT THESE NEW SYSTEMS

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:16.203
WERE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN
IN THE MODERN WORLD.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:19.373
I WAS, FOR INSTANCE, NOT ABLE
TO EXPLAIN WHERE WHITE WOMEN

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:21.542
WERE SUPPOSED TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:23.243
- [sighs]

00:02:23.277 --> 00:02:26.480
- MY EFFORTS WERE CAUSING
MORE CONFUSION THAN OPPRESSION.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:27.581
- WAIT. THIS ONE IS
THE COLOR COPIER?

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:28.749
ISN'T IT THAT ONE?

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:30.651
- THIS IS THE COLORED COPIER.

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:33.954
THAT ONE IS THE COLOR COPIER.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.822
- SO THIS IS
THE BLACK-AND-WHITE COPIER?

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:37.291
- THAT'S THE WHITE COPIER.

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:38.759
- LOOK, I JUST NEED TO MAKE
A COLOR COPY.

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:40.160
- WELL, GO AHEAD AND DO IT.

00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:41.461
JUST DON'T USE
THE COLORED COPIER.

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:43.163
THE WHITE COPIER
IS BETTER ANYWAY.

00:02:43.197 --> 00:02:46.099
IT MAKES COLORED COPIES.

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:49.436
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN POSSIBLY
DO TO MAKE THIS MORE CLEAR.

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.105
- YOU COULD WRITE "PEOPLE"
UNDER THEM.

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.775
- HOWEVER, A VISIT FROM OUR HEAD
OF HUMAN RESOURCES

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:56.944
LET ME KNOW I WAS ON
THE RIGHT TRACK.

00:02:56.977 --> 00:02:58.011
HELLO.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:59.613
- YOU'VE PUT THE ENTIRE COMPANY

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:02.115
IN AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
SITUATION.

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.151
YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:07.754
- SHARON, WHAT RACE ARE YOU?

00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:10.123
- YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO ASK PEOPLE THAT.

00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:15.095
- WELL, IF YOU DON'T TELL ME,
I'LL JUST ASSUME THE WORST.

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:17.931
I WAS FORCED TO ATTEND
A SENSITIVITY TRAINING CLASS,

00:03:17.965 --> 00:03:20.467
WHERE I WAS SUBJECTED
TO A GLORIOUS GOLD MINE

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.603
OR RACIALLY CHARGED
HATE LANGUAGE.

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:24.071
- YES?

00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:27.074
- HOW WOULD YOU USE [bleep]
IN A SENTENCE?

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:29.610
- THE POINT IS, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
USE IT IN A SENTENCE.

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:31.545
IF YOU'RE UNCERTAIN
AS TO ANYTHING YOU'RE SAYING,

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:33.347
WHETHER IT'S GONNA
BE OFFENSIVE OR NOT...

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.984
- HEY, HOW MANY [bleep] DOES IT
TAKE TO SCREW IN A LIGHTBULB?

00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:38.485
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.087
- I DON'T KNOW EITHER.

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:42.823
THEY'RE ALL TOO BUSY [bleep]
THEIR COUSINS.

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:44.691
- NO ONE HERE SHOULD BE MADE
TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE...

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:46.360
- [chuckles]
- [whispering] THANK YOU.

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.095
- EH.
- [normal voice] I'M FORREST.

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:50.664
I TOO AM INTOLERANT OF THOSE
WHO DON'T SHARE MY RACE.

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:53.333
MY NEW FRIEND WAS CALLED JIM,
AND HE WAS A TRUE CONNOISSEUR

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:55.135
OF RACE-BASED HATRED,

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.205
AS I LEARNED WHEN HE INVITED ME
BACK TO HIS LAIR.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.841
- EVER NOTICE THE LOWER
THAT THEY WEAR THEIR PANTS,

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:02.476
THE LOWER
OUR PROPERTY VALUES GO.

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.211
- HMM.
- YOU GOT A PRESIDENT

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.580
THAT WANTS TO TAKE AWAY
OUR GUNS?

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.348
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WANTED
TO TAKE AWAY THE GUNS?

00:04:08.382 --> 00:04:10.350
- WHO'S THAT?
- HITLER!

00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:12.085
- YEAH.
WELL, YOU LIKE HITLER.

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:14.421
- YEAH, YEAH, I-I LIKE THE WAY
HE STARTED OUT.

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:15.589
- OKAY.
- BUT WHEN HE STARTED WITH

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:17.324
THE OBAMA STUFF, THAT'S WHEN IT

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:19.092
ALL WENT DOWNHILL.
- YEP.

00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:20.327
- YOU'RE LIKE ME.
- MM-HMM.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.762
- WHAT DO WE HAVE IN COMMON?

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:23.764
WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON, SEE?
- WE ARE WHITE.

00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:25.098
- WHY DO THEY SAY BLACK PEOPLE

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:26.533
ARE BETTER DANCERS
THAN WHITE PEOPLE?

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.735
- I'M A GREAT DANCER!

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:31.104
AFTER MEETING JIM,
I REALIZED I HAD TO TAKE

00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:34.074
MY RACISM UP A NOTCH.
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.876
[indistinct chatter]
- AT LAST, I WAS PREPARED

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.679
TO INFECT EVERYONE AROUND ME
WITH A VIRULENT STRAIN

00:04:38.712 --> 00:04:41.515
OF THE SOCIAL DISEASE
THAT IS RACISM.

00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:47.087
WHY IS THERE A BLACK MAN
AND HIS BABY MAMA IN MY HOME?

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.790
HMM?
- SOMEBODY CALL THE COPS.

00:04:49.823 --> 00:04:52.426
[laughter]

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.127
- WELL, NO, I DON'T THINK
THAT WILL BE NECESSARY,

00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:55.729
BUT I AM GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO LEAVE.

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:58.365
[laughter]
- YEAH, RIGHT.

00:04:58.398 --> 00:04:59.633
- BUT BEING A CONVINCING RACIST

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.702
WAS HARDER
THAN I'D EVER IMAGINED.

00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:04.471
I'M SORRY. I'M AFRAID
I'M QUITE SERIOUS, OKAY?

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:06.874
WE CANNOT HAVE YOU HERE MIXING
WITH OUR WHITE WOMEN!

00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:09.276
[laughter]

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.944
EXCUSE ME!
THERE IS NOTHING FUNNY

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:14.147
ABOUT WHAT THE BLACK MAN
IS DOING TO OUR COUNTRY!

00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:17.150
I DON'T KNOW WHAT EVERYBODY
IS LAUGHING ABOUT,

00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:20.153
BUT I AM TIRED OF YOU BLACK
PEOPLE BRINGING DOWN

00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:22.956
OUR PROPERTY VALUES
AND OUR SCHOOLS

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:25.492
AND NEVER SHUTTING UP
ABOUT YOUR CATERING BUSINESS!

00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:27.961
TO HAVE THE DESIRED EFFECT,
I WOULD NEED TO CROSS

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.063
A BOUNDARY
WHICH MUST NEVER BE CROSSED

00:05:30.097 --> 00:05:33.066
AND SAY
WHAT MUST NEVER BE SAID.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.103
LAUGH IT UP, YOU [bleep]!

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:39.840
[woman laughing]

00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:44.778
[woman stops laughing]

00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:47.915
I AM A RACIST NOW.
DEAL WITH IT.

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:49.950
- [sighs]
- OKAY, SO YOU'VE BECOME

00:05:49.983 --> 00:05:53.187
AN OVERT RACIST
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.255
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "OVERT RACIST"?

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.091
- I MEAN, THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN
SOME RACISM IN YOU,

00:05:58.125 --> 00:05:59.826
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
PROUD OF IT.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.795
- HOW HAS THERE BEEN RACISM IN--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:04.131
- OKAY, DO YOU REMEMBER
LAST YEAR,

00:06:04.164 --> 00:06:07.034
YOU ASKED EVERYONE
ON THE BLOCK BUT ME

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:09.036
TO KEEP YOUR KEY
WHILE YOU WENT ON VACATION?

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:10.304
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU WERE NOT HOME.

00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:12.706
- WE--WE WERE HOME.
- YOU WERE HOME?

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:14.308
- WE WERE HOME.

00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:16.210
- AND YOU'VE ASKED ME
THREE DIFFERENT TIMES

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:18.278
IF I WENT TO COLLEGE
ON A BASKETBALL SCHOLARSHIP.

00:06:18.312 --> 00:06:19.513
- YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.348
- NO.
- OH, MY GOD.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.050
- YOU DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE
ON A BASKETBALL SCHOLARSHIP?

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.053
- I'M 5'7", FORREST.
- LOOK AT HIM. NO.

00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:28.388
- AND WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA
WAS ELECTED,

00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:31.225
YOU CONGRATULATED ME.

00:06:31.258 --> 00:06:33.360
- WELL, YOU VOTED
FOR HIM, RIGHT?

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.729
- [scoffs]
- I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT,

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:38.065
LIKE BRUCE WILLIS
IN <i>THE SIXTH SENSE--</i>

00:06:38.098 --> 00:06:39.566
SPOILER ALERT--

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.835
I HAD BEEN A RACIST ALL ALONG.

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:45.138
GENE, IT SEEMS, HAD LEARNED
TO LIVE WITH THAT FACT LONG AGO,

00:06:45.172 --> 00:06:48.175
BUT HE DID GIVE ME ONE
VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF ADVICE.

00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:51.545
- NEVER, EVER--
AND I DO RECOMMEND THIS--

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:54.147
GO AROUND
CALLING ANYBODY THAT.

00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:55.582
- OH, THAT--YEAH, I'LL GET RID
OF THAT ONE,

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:57.384
'CAUSE THAT SEEMED
TO UPSET EVERYONE.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.086
- YEAH.

00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:01.355
- UP TILL NOW, IT'S BEEN
A BLESSING TO BE IN DENIAL

00:07:01.388 --> 00:07:03.190
ABOUT MY RACIST FEELINGS.

00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:06.493
ACKNOWLEDGING THEM HAS MADE ME
FEEL AS STUPID AND DISGUSTING

00:07:06.527 --> 00:07:08.662
AS THAT MORON
WITH THE NAZI FLAG.

00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:11.532
BEING A RACIST--
HALF A STAR.

00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:13.200
- UGH, FORREST.
- YES?

00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:15.569
- NO, IT SHOULD GET NO STARS.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.237
- WELL, WE DON'T DO ZERO STARS.

00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:18.772
- BUT IT'S RACISM.

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.908
- YES, BUT HALF A STAR
IS OUR LOWEST RATING.

00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:22.376
WE HAD A LONG MEETING ABOUT IT.

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:25.045
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST.
- WHO KNEW? [laughs]

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:29.283
