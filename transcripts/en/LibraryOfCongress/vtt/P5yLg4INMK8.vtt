&gt;&gt; Announcer: From the Library
of Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:23.330
[ Silence ]

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.190
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Well, we're
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.480
And we'll be talking with Yvette
Landry and Richard Comeaux

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.670 position:56%
and Beau Thomas who are Cajun and
honky tonk musicians from Louisiana.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.970
My name is Steve Winick,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.440
and I'm with the American
Folklife Center here

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.040
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.000
So, let's start out by
talking about a little bit

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.300
of what's been in the news lately.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.380
You guy guys are from
Breaux Bridge I understand.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.810
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: We are.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.200
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: How's it
doing after the floods?

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: It's
been three and a half weeks

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.270
and we still have some water there.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.950
It's gone down a little
bit but it was pretty bad.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.510
I have to say it was pretty bad.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.990
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Are people,
are people managing to cope

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.040
or has there been a lot
of evacuations there or?

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.340
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: No.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.640
People are managing to cope.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.640
We, it kind of speaks
to our culture.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.090
We don't, we don't really wait for
anybody to come in and help us.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.410
We just sort of do for ourselves.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.710
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.010
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: And where
we live everybody has a boat,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.310
everybody has an SUV.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.580
I mean everybody has
got, you know, something.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.240
So, when the rain started and
the water started coming up,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.640
people evacuated immediately.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.010
You know, we had neighbor
helping neighbor kind of thing.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.590
And the cleanup has
been taking a while.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.800
Some areas still have some
water and they can't get in yet.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.100
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.700
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: But slowly
getting back to normal, but, yeah.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.000
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: All right.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.300
Well, the rest of the
country is pulling for you.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.600
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yes.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And wishing for a
speedy recovery [multiple speakers].

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.730
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
Talking about boats, I mean,

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.370
I've never seen this ever.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.730
We have a drawbridge that
crosses the Bayou Teche.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.020
The water was so high that
a guy got in his canoe

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.540
and paddled across the drawbridge.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.840
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Over the bridge.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Over the bridge.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.440
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Over the bridge.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.740
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
Never seen that ever.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.040
Ever.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.340
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: It was about
two feet [multiple speakers].

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.640
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: May never
see that again, you know?

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.940
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Wow,
that's amazing.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.240
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yeah.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.540
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick:

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.840
Yeah. So, all right.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.140
So, in that area, is it
mostly French culture?

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.440
Were you growing up
essentially bilingual?

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.380
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
I'd say bilingual.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.970
I mean, the roots are Cajun.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.270
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Cajun, you know,
Acadians is what we're labeled as.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.260
You know, exiled years ago from
Nova Scotia down to south Louisiana

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.480
and yes we are Acadians and Cajuns
is what we call ourselves short.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.040
But we are bilingual.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.070
I mean, we've all been
educated and whatever.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.370
We can speak English too.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.670
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.500
Right. Well, I mean my question
was more along the lines

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.400 position:56%
of whether all you also spoke French

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.840
because not everybody
in Louisiana does.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.140
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Well.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.950
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: And I'll speak
to that because Richard grew up,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.730
he speaks French fluently.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.820
I do not.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.120
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: OK.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.420
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: I was
the first in my family

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.770
and my brother to not speak French.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.150
And part of that comes from
when my parents were growing up,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.250
it was frowned upon to speak French
in school, so they got punished

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.610
for speaking French in school.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.870
So, they would only speak French
at home and they didn't teach us.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.730
And we were not taught
French in school.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.900
So, some of my generation,
like Richard and others,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.420
did pick up the language.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.740
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: But it
was not until after school.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.040
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Right
[multiple speakers].

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.340
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: You know,
after high school is when I learned

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.600
in a little community, Henderson,
right out of Breaux Bridge.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.900
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.210
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Most
people, that's all they spoke.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.670
So, I had to kind of
just pick it up.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.970
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Right.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.270
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And so
was it true for all of you

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.700
that in school French
was kind of discouraged?

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.000
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: It was
not taught in school at all.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.300
It was not.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I learned it in the university
and through traveling and learned it

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.200
through the music of my culture.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.620
That's how I learned to speak and
to write a little bit of French,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.120 position:56%
but it was not encouraged in school.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.660
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: My
grandparents spoke French fluently

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.360
and my parents spoke
French fluently.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.410
And they would speak to each other
in French when they didn't want us

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.710
to know what was going on.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.010
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Us
to now what was going on.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.310
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.610
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: And
that's how that went.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.910
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So it
became the secret language.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.210
In other words, you
couldn't know it.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.510
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Exactly
[multiple speakers].

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.810
Exactly.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.110
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.410
So, what was the music culture
like when you were growing up?

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.710
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: It's probably
different for each one of us.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.010
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Different
for each one of us, you know?

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.310
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: Yeah.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.610
For sure.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.330
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: My grandparents
were musicians and they played sort

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.880
of a swing and what
would you call that?

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.180
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Dixieland.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.480
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Dixieland.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.780
Kind of Dixieland music.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.080
So, I heard a lot of
that growing up.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.610
Not necessarily them because
they had stopped playing

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.460
by the time I came around.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.180
But recordings and country music.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.700
That's what my family listened to.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.400
We didn't really listen
to Cajun music.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.010
Richard has a different story.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.310
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.960
And my influences were
strictly Cajun music.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.260
My father was a Cajun musician.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.930
Back then lap steel.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.230
No pedals.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.530
Pedals weren't even invented yet.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.320
He played just a six-string
lap steel with Cajun music,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.800
and that's what I grew
up listening to.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.100
That's where I began.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.400
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And Beau?

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.700
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: I don't
know where I come from.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.450
No one in my family for
ages back, generations,

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.430
I cannot trace anyone back that
played any musical instruments.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.040
But I grew up -- my family loved
Cajun music and our culture.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.900
My family owns a Cajun food and
spice manufacturing company.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.050
So, we certainly knew
the culture and music,

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.350
but I didn't grow up with it.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.710
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: I had some of the
greatest Cajun musicians playing

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.780
at a restaurant in my back yard.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.580
And until I started playing
Cajun music 12 years ago,

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.040
I didn't even know who they were.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.070
You know, Dewey Balfa and Octa
Clark and all these guys played

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.510
at a little restaurant called
Mulate's in Breaux Bridge and --

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.810
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
[inaudible] Thibodaux.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.110
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: [inaudible]
Thibodaux.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.410
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: Yeah
[multiple speakers].

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.710
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: I've been to
Mulate's [multiple speakers].

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.010
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: And I didn't
even know who they were other

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.720
than there was some music going
on in the background [inaudible].

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.020
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.320
But you did hear it [inaudible].

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.450
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: But I did
hear it [multiple speakers].

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.750
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Sure.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.190
So, that was certainly one of the
contexts in which you'd see music.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.190
There was restaurants and dance
halls and that kind of thing.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.490
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Right.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.510
And we used to go to some things
called, I remember the first time

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.410
that I really took note
of it was at a boucherie,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.710
and that's where you
slaughtered the pig.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.010
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.310
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: And then
all this stuff was made.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.720
And there was a, it was probably
close to your house growing up,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.480
it has the, right by the overpass.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.040
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Oh
by [multiple speakers].

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.060
That's where I learned
to play the steel guitar.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.360
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Exactly.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.660
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: At
his camp, matter of fact.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.960
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: And I
actually have a picture of me;

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.220
I'm probably about nine or ten
years old holding an accordion.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.300
You know, I've got a little skipper
hat on, you know, doing this.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.530
But I remember people would just
break out instruments, everybody,

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.910
you know, and you just
start this jam right there.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.750
And so not only on the radio, or at
the restaurant, but it was pretty,

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.520
I mean, common to go
to somebody's house

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.040
and somebody just started
playing music.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.340
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.640
So, what was your first instrument?

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.940
Was it the accordion?

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.240
Or did you start?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.540
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: No.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.840
My first instrument was
the piano when I was three.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.140
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: OK.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.440
That's a good starting
place, isn't it?

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.740
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yeah.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.040
I started with piano
when I was three.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.340
And then when I was
in the fourth grade,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.640
I started playing the clarinet.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.940
And through high school I ended

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.360
up playing all the
woodwind instruments.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.190
And after high school
I closed the piano,

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.830
closed all the other instruments
and said, "I hate this.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.130
I don't like music.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.760
I'm never doing it again."

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.060
Done.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.360
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Good
luck with that, right?

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.660
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yeah.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.960
Exactly.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.260
And then 12 years ago,
I ended up going

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.120
in a totally different direction
and I bought a bass guitar

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.120
and somebody -- I was
just going to buy it to -

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.950
my dad was, my dad had cancer.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.370
And so it was just sort
of a therapy instrument.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.670
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Sure.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.970
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: I was
just going to play it

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.270
at home and somebody said,

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.430 position:56%
"Well, you know, there's a jam at
this little store down [inaudible]."

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:44.440
And I ended up going to that
jam and here I am [laughs].

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.040
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So,
you started with bass?

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.100
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Started with
bass and then I went to accordion.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:55.130
And then when I first
experienced that first jam session,

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:00.040
it was in an old house, which
they had converted into a store.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.410
And I opened the door.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.000
And there was this
back room probably

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.300
about the size of this stage.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.810
And they had maybe nine people
in there from the age of two

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.790
to 92, all just playing music.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.280
And I just went, "Oh, wow.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.580
What is this?"

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.380
You know? I had never
experienced anything like that.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.130
So, I started going and then I
got all excited and I just wanted

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.440
to learn every instrument.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.170
So, I borrowed, I told my mom,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.380
I said I want to try
and learn accordion.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.810
So, she said, "Oh,

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.440
I think [inaudible] brother
might have an accordion."

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.340
So, she called a friend
of a friend and got that.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.400
And then I remember seeing a fiddle
on the wall in my mom's house.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.700
And I said, "What's that fiddle?"

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.090
She said, "Well, that's your
great grandfather's fiddle."

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.600 position:56%
And I said, "Could I take that off
the wall and maybe try and do that?"

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.060
So, you know, I got that.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.060
And then a friend of
mine had a guitar.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.970
So, I started learning
all of them at once

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.390 position:56%
but I stuck more with the accordion.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.870
So, I was doing bass and accordion.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.190
And I tried fiddle.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.490
Not so much.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.790
Not so much.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.090
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: What?

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.390 position:56%
But luckily you have, you have Beau.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.690
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: But
luckily I have him [laughter].

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.110
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, tell us
about, Beaux tell us about your,

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.100
how you started with the fiddle.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.550
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: I,
kind of out of nowhere.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:16.070
My family had this spice company
and we were doing a cochon de lait,

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.430
roasting a little baby suckling pig

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.630
for the Super Bowl Half
Time Show in New Orleans.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.930
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Excellent.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.230
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: And
there was Dan Rather

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.700
and all these big guys walking
around in $5,000 and $10,000 suits

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.280
and piece of pig in
their hand, you know,

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.160
with a little grease
dripping down their chin.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.300
So, my dad said, "Hey,
boy," like the year before,

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.180
"if I get you a Cajun accordion
would you learn one or two songs

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.540
and sit on the, by the pig
and play the accordion?"

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.160
I'm like sit by a pig
and play and accordion?

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.770
No, I don't know about that.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.610
And some little guy was with
my sister and said, "Hey Beau,

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.530
I bet you couldn't play a fiddle."

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.830
I'm like, "Oh, I bet you I could."

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.130
Well, anyway, I begged my dad.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.720 position:56%
Three months later he finally bought
me this fiddle out of nowhere.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.400
And I took it home.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.730
Within just a few hours
I came down playing four

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.360
or five songs that I had learned.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.620
And five and a half months later
I went on my first tour half way

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.620
around the world and
started playing.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.210
That was 27 years ago
and never looked back.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.510
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: All right.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.810
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: Yeah.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.110
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, fiddle was
really your first instrument?

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.410
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: I think so.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.710
Yeah.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.010
I mean, I played trumpet a little
bit in high school and drums

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.310
in a very small band, but terrible.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.930
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: I remember
playing with him about that time

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.760
and it's like he came out
of the womb with a fiddle.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.800
He played that good back then.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.100
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.400
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
He's amazing now.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.740
But he was really, really
accomplished even back then.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.040
I mean [multiple speakers].

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.340
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: And I didn't play
as a kid [multiple speakers].

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.930
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: We still talk
about that back home how he just

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.210
like came out the womb
playing the fiddle.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.750
You know? Really.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.050
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Amazing.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:47.000
And so, and you've said that
your first sort of influence was.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.300
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Was my
father [multiple speakers].

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.770
Yeah. My father played Cajun steel

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:55.080
but my very first instrument
was an acoustic guitar at four.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:00.060
And I just learned and I had just a
musically family on my dad's side.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.560 position:56%
Every family reunion I couldn't wait

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.180
because I'd learn something
different.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.220
You know, because I had my cousins
as mentors and they'd show me how

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:12.480
to put my hands and then the ear
kind of took over and then got home

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.940
from school, 13 years old,
walked into my bedroom

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:21.680
and brand new pedal steel
guitar at the foot of my bed.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.260
And my dad, and I'll
never forget this.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.510
I turned around, looked at my dad,
and he just watched my whole move.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.390
I said, "Hi, dad."

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.540
Walk in from school with the
book sack and everything.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.150
And my dad is sitting and my
dad liked his beer, you know?

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.040
So, he had his Schlitz beer
on the table like that.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.430
And he just watched me, just
around the corner like that.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.290
And, again, when I walked
into my bedroom I just froze

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.310
and the book sack just fell.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.610
And I turned around.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.190
And he goes, "There you are.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:49.740
I bought this for you."

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.260
And I'm like, I didn't
know the first thing

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.810
about this thing but
it just sat there.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.440
He puts the picks on.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.920
He says, "Now listen."

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.870
He strums it and it's
just this triad tune.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.410
It's an open tuning.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.710
It made a chord.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.010
I'm like I recognize that chord.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.790
And he said, "Yep,
this one position.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.090
Here's another position.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.990
Here." This is pretty much
basically how our Cajun music --

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.670
these are the three
chords that you're going

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.760
to play for a long, long time.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.390
Didn't show me the picking but
then he gave me a couple people

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.200
to just listen to.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.000
And I went out and sought out
these, back then 45s and LPs,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.460
and I'd go to this camp where
she first got her accordion thing

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.290
at Ellis Trosclair's camp.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:32.470
And I'd spin these records on
this stereo time and time --

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:33.770
I'd scratch it a little bit

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.960
and put it back just to
emulate these sounds.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.230
And, you know, that's how it came.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:42.810
And like Beau did with his fiddle,
it, my steel picking back then

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.310
in four or five years I was
pretty much accomplished

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.310
on the Cajun side of the music.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.840
But then I got bored.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.640
I wanted, there was more
music going through my head

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.120
until I discovered the
pedal steel guitar.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.060
And when I heard it first I'm
like this is what I want to play

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.230
because the pedal steel guitar
goes in depth and you, you know,

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.120
you tune it like a piano.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.420
You have the scale.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.030
You can play notes.

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:12.910
Not just the triad.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.980
And then I was mentored by this
man, Milton Gilbo from back home

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.750
who was accomplished back then.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.800
And he just started teaching
me how this is structured.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.360
I actually had to let
the Cajun music go.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.110
I had to put it in the garbage

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.960
because you've got
to think different.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.280
You can't let this
chank-a-chank sound get in the way

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.940
with what you're trying to do
with the pedal steel guitar.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.670
Well, then I found out about this
school in Nashville that goes

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.570
in depth and teaches
what all these pedals

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.650
and levers do within the tuning.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:42.130
So, you take all this home.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.430
You don't learn it over there.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.110
You've got to take it home
and spend thousands of hours

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.410
to get your hands in all that.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.410
Well, lo and behold it's
42 years later and I'm

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.740
at the Library of Congress.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.480
Go figure, you know?

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.780
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.520
So, you know, it's interesting
because I think a lot

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.580
of people outside of Louisiana,

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.230
if they think about Cajun music
they'll certainly think about,

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.820
you know, accordion and
they'll think of fiddle

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.050
and they'll think of
chank-a-chank guitar,

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:11.070
but they won't necessarily think
of lap steel or pedal steel.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.800
But it was there.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.100
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: It was.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.400
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: Oh, yes
[multiple speakers].

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.700
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: It was
prominent in the '60s is

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.000
when I guess [multiple
speakers] and that's while.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.300
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: In
the Cajun dance halls

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.600
and night clubs is when
it began to emerge.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.900
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
And I play back home

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.700
with a group now called
High Performance

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.110
that has Steve Riley in the band.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.760
Everybody on the planet
knows who Steve Riley is.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.060
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: But that makes--

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.870
all our fathers played
together at one time or another.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.170
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.470
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: We're
the second generation.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.060
So, it's called High Performance
and it's called Cajun music

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.340
on steroids because it's powerful.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.640
It's really good.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.940
So.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.240
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.540
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: But I'm
playing pedal steel not open.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.840
I can emulate the same tones.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: But I will say not
too long ago I dug up an old record,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.770
I don't know where
it's at, and it was,

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.880
you might have been 17 years
old playing on an open tuning.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.180
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Yes.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.560
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: Maybe
Jambalaya; it was fast.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.860
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Yes.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.160
Yeah.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.460
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: It was really fast.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.760
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Yeah.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.060
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: I'm not sure
if it was all the way open.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.360
You may have had a
pedal that brought it

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.660
down the floor [multiple speakers].

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.960
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: No.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.260
No. It was open.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.560
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: So, it
was, it was hopping.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.860
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Just hopping.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.160
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: You might
have been 17 or something.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.460
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Sixteen.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.760
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: Yeah.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.060
You were fast.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.360
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Yeah.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.660
Anyway.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.960
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: Amazing.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.260
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: So,
time goes, don't it?

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.560
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.860
It sure does.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.160
So, Yvette, you mentioned that
one of the people who played

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.460
at Mulate's while you were
growing up was Dewey Balfa, right?

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.760
And I know that you
played with Balfa Toujours.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.060
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Right.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.360
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So,
tell us about that.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.660
About how that was sort of
being in that second generation.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.960
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Well, let me
tell you how I met Christine.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.580 position:56%
She was living in Breaux Bridge at
the time and I was at the Winn Dixie

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.130
in Breaux Bridge checking out.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.740
And there was this girl
standing in front of me.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.670
And, you know, we just
like to talk to anybody.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.970
We don't care.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.270
So, she's standing in front
of me and I said, "Hi."

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:49.450
And she turned around
and she goes, "Oh, hi."

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.750
And I said, "I'm Yvette.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.050
Who are you?"

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.350
And she said, "Well, I'm Christine.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.650
It's nice to meet you."

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.040
And we're having this conversation
and I said, "Well, what do you do?"

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.260
And she said, "Well,
I'm a musician."

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.560
And I said, "Oh."

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.030
And I had just started
playing music.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.580
So, I said, "Oh, well, I'm
starting to play music too."

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.330 position:56%
And I said, "What's your last name?"

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.690
She said, "Balfa."

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:09.990 position:56%
And I said, "Oh, well, that's nice."

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:11.290 position:56%
I said, "Well, you know, I'm playing

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.990
with the Lafayette
Rhythm Devils right now.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.400
I started playing about
three months ago," and I'm,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.700
you know, just doing this.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.000
And she'd say, "Oh that's nice.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.300
That's nice.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.600
That's nice."

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.070
Still have no clue who Dewey Balfa
is or the importance of Dewey Balfa

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.810
or who I'm talking
to at this moment.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.790
You know, so she said,
"Oh, that's really nice."

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.550
She said, "You know, we're
doing a benefit for my sister,

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.840
and if you'd like to come and play
bass guitar that would be great."

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.140
So, I said, "Sure."

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.680
You know, it was right
there in Breaux Bridge.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.030
So, that Sunday I ended up going
to play with Balfa Toujours.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.330
Not a clue.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.650
I didn't know who Balfa
Toujours was.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:48.070
So, the next weekend I'm
talking to this little guy

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.560
who started playing music the
same time as I did, and he said,

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.040
"So what did you do this weekend?"

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.340
And I said, "Oh, I
played with this band.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.640
What's their name?

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.940
I think something like
Balfa something."

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.530
And he goes, "Balfa Toujours?

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:01.830
You played with Balfa Toujours?"

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.130
And I said, "Yeah."

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.000
So, that's when I realized
maybe I should kind of go check

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.300
and see who these people are.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.600
[laughter]

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.810
But, no, it's incredible
to play with Christine.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:17.040
And she basically channels
her father in that music.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.590
And if you close your eyes, you
could be in 2016 or you could be

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:27.090
in 1956 or you could be in
18-- whatever, you know?

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:28.390
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: You're right.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.720
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: So, it's been
an incredible journey playing

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.130
with them.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.430
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.220
I mean for a lot of
people outside Louisiana,

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.090
Dewey Balfa would have been
the first Cajun musician

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.390
that they heard.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:40.690
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: I think so.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:42.470
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Because he started
going to festivals in the '70s.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:43.770
And that's, you know?

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.070
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: You're right.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.890
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Before that no one
really knew what Cajun music was

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.830
outside Louisiana and
parts of Texas.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.130
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Right.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.430
And he was a bus driver.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.730
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.030
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: I mean, you know?

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.330
That's how people knew
him as basically.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.630
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:57.930
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: A bus driver
who played a little bit of music.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.230
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.530
But the other thing that I was
always impressed with when talking

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.900 position:56%
to other musicians about Dewey Balfa
particularly was the way he was just

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.970
a mentor to so many people and
so many people learned from him.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:08.850
And so it's great that you
got to play with Christine

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.150
and you get to play with Christine.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:11.450
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yeah.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:12.750
Yeah.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.050
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Because she was,
you know, sort of the best student,

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.350
the main student, you
know what I mean?

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.650
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Right.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.300
Absolutely.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.900
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, you know,
the group that you played

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.240
with today had those Cajun
influences but also does a lot

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.710
of what you call Louisiana
honky tonk.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:35.550
So, explain that, those
influences as well for us.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Well, it's kind
of like I said earlier to the group,

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.080
I was not going to be a musician.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.610 position:56%
And I ended up going to a Cajun jam;

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:46.910
therefore I play Cajun music.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.790
I still wonder if I would
have gone to a blues jam

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:51.470
if I would have been
a blues musician.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.270 position:56%
I wasn't intending to be a musician.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.870
Same thing with writing songs.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:19:00.230
I didn't intend to be a songwriter,
but when I did write my first song,

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.120
it sort of came out with this
country influence and possibly

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.420
because that's what I grew

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.010
up listening to, you
know, I'm guessing.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.520
But when you add these
guys to the mix,

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.070
it's dance music I think
more than anything else.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:20.120
I grew up as a dancer instead of
a musician to that kind of music.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.590
So, when I started writing
songs, I wanted to be able

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.650
to write songs that
you could dance to.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:30.320
So, we had that Cajun influence in
terms of dance ability to the song.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.020
But when you add the steel guitar,

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.390
it kind of brings in
that country genre.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:38.840
And then when Beau came into the
band, the two of them just latched

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.060
onto this, they sort of did it.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:46.090
The song really didn't
have, it was in the making.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.390
It was creating.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:51.250 position:56%
So, when I just put it out there and
just let those two guys take off,

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:56.250
it just kind of came with
this little Texas swing thing.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:02.040
And then when my son came on the
drums, he's got that, it's natural,

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.340
it's genetic in him and he just,

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.450
so it came to be this little
Louisiana swing honky tonk

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.180
with a Cajun something or other.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.870
I don't know what it is.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.420
It just is.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.720
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.860
Well, you play some of your own
songs but you also play songs

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.050
that you've gotten from elsewhere.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.730
You know, cover songs
of various people.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.400
So, how do you, what do
you look for in the song?

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.110 position:56%
How do you find songs that you like?

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: I have to feel it.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.330
That's the best way to explain it.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.010 position:56%
And my mom, she's all the time,
she's always sending me a text, "Oh,

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.310
you should play this song.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.610
You should do this.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:34.910
You should do this."

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.900 position:56%
And I'll give it a try and sometimes
it'll, you know, it's a good song,

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.020
but I just, I don't feel it.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.620
It's got to strike
something inside of me.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.490
I don't know how else
to explain it than that.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:46.820
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: That's good.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.920
And in terms of writing
songs, I mean,

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.560
you do write a lot of the songs.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:55.660
What do you, how do things
strike you as song worthy?

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.190
As being something you're
going to write a song about?

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.440
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: I don't
really think I write the songs.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.660
I think I'm a vessel that
the songs come through.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.790
There's not too many times where
I've sat down and said, "Today,

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.560
I'm going to write a song."

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.780
What happens is I'll be
doing something and then all

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:17.620
of the sudden I'll say, "I
need to go get my guitar."

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:23.110
And then before I know it
there's a song that comes through.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:32.160
So, it might be something
I noticed, um, driving

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.430
or something I heard somebody say.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.690
I remember one time I was
cooking supper for my son

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.350
and I was cooking a rice and
gravy and all of a sudden I had

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.130
that feeling, I just had that
feeling of something was going

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.370
on in my head and I said I
needed to go get my guitar.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.640
So, I went in my room and I started
kind of doing this little melody

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.380
that was there and the words were
coming and I'm writing this song.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:59.180
And then the next thing I know
my fire alarm was going off

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.240
and my house is full of smoke

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.850
and there's flames
coming up and I, you know,

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:09.240
completely burnt the
supper, but I had this song.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:14.160
And it was called, "Memories of
Clelia," And it was about a dad

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.280
who was contemplating suicide

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.090
because he lost his
daughter and his wife.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:21.690
Now, I don't remember
ever hearing about that

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.370
or experiencing that or anything.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:27.250
So, that's when I know it just,
you know, that was something that,

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:30.270
I was just the vessel
to come out of.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.570
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.560
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: So, you know,
and like I said I might be,

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.460
the guy that I spoke with when
I first started writing songs,

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:38.920
he told me just pay attention

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.060
and I really did take
those words to heart.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.090
And if you pay attention, there's
a lot of stuff to write about.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.390
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.390
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: I think I
notice things and it kind of mulls

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.100
over in my brain a
little bit and then

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.570
when it's ready it will come out.

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:52.170
That's how I do it.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.650
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah, well one
of the ones you sang today sort

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.000
of sounded like that
because you said

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.300
that you heard this phrase
the house with no windows.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.600
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Oh, yeah.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.470
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And you
thought, oh that's a good phrase,

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:03.770
and now you wrote a
whole song around that.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.070
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Absolutely.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:06.370
Yes.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.670
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, how
did that song come together?

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:08.970
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Oh, I was
watching the documentary.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.270
It was like three in the morning.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.660
I couldn't sleep.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.460
And I just thought that was the
most amazing thing, you know,

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.060
like a house with no windows.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.530
It's just -- it's so
vivid and visual.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.410
And I could see the imagery.

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:25.350 position:56%
And I don't know if you've listened
to most of my songs they're kind of,

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.130
I don't want to say
they're man hating songs

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.320
but there's a theme
somewhere in there, you know?

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.570
And it was just weird.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:37.150
It's, like I said, I didn't intend
to sit down and write a song,

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.620
bashing, you know, anybody.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.920
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.040
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: But
it just came out.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.340
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: One
of the great things

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.000
about that song I think is that,
you know, you say, you know,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.720
one of your primary ways of
writing songs is to pay attention.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.800
But that song if you don't pay
attention, if you just sort

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.050
of let it play, it sounds like
it's a sweet little love song.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.350
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yeah.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:57.650
Exactly.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:58.950
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: But you have
to be listening to the lyrics

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:00.250
and know what is going on.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:01.850
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: And sometimes
before I sing it I'll introduce it

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.530
like that -- I'd like to sing
a little love song for you.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:07.480
But you have to be paying
attention to really catch it.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.780
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.440
See if anybody notices what
you're really talking about.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.740
That's great.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.040
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yeah.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.520
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So,
that's sort of your,

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.210
so your songwriting process
is just sort of notice stuff

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.830
or have stuff come to you.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.130
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yeah
[multiple speakers].

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:25.120
Right. And like I said,
and when these songs come,

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.840
this is an amazing thing for me,
I don't partially write a song

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.370
and put it away and then
come back to it or whatever.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.670
When they come, they just come.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:37.200
And within 10 to 20 minutes I'll
have a song and it's written.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.500
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: And I may do a
little bit of tweaking on it but it,

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.640
you know, so that's why I say
I don't, I really don't feel

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.070
that I'm writing the song
if that makes any sense.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.370
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: I
know what you mean.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:49.670
Yeah.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:50.970
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: We get to the
gate on Thursdays, we're like --

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:52.580
she says T, I got a new song.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.880
And I'm setting up my stuff.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.180
I'm like really?

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.480
She said, "We're going
to do it tonight?"

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.780
I said, "What do you mean?

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.080
You're going to throw
me under the bus.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.380
I never heard the dang thing."

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.680
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yeah.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.980
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: She says yeah

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.280
and she just plays it
for me right there.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.580
Right there.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.880
So, we kind of map it out.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.180
Then we play it.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.480
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yeah.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.780
Yeah.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.080
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: It's great.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.380
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, that was sort

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.680
of my next question was how do
you guys then take, you know?

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.980
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
Just like I just said.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.280
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Just like that?

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.580
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
T, I got a new song.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.880
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: It's like FTD
flower arrangements while you wait,

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.180
you know?

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.480
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.780
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: We just
put it all together.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.080
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: As
a matter of fact,

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.380
when we were doing sound check
earlier, Beau had never heard,

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.550
I had put the new waltz
that I had wrote,

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:32.570
or that came out just a couple days
ago, and Beau had never heard it.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:33.870
And I said, "OK.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:35.170
If we have time, we're
going to do it today."

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.200
So, I just start playing it and
they'll just, as a matter fact,

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.910
on the plane, I told
him on the plane.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.210
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: Yeah.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:43.510
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: I had
recorded it on the voice memo.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.630
And so he was listening
to it on the voice memo.

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:46.930
And he goes, "What key is it in?"

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.230
And I said, "It's in E."

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:49.530 position:56%
And I could see him doing like this.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.630
He goes, "I'm learning
it right now."

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.560
So [multiple speakers].

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.860
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: All right.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.050
Well, I think each of you
is in other bands as well.

00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:59.920
So, why don't you tell
me a little bit

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.660
about the other musical
groups that you play with?

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:04.960
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: OK.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.660
So, I do, we do the trio.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.110
And then Richard and I do a duo.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:12.190
And then I have a full band,
which is the Yvette Landry Band.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:16.200
We have a bass player Joe Butts
and my son Trevor on the drums.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.990
I'm also a member of the
Lafayette Rhythm Devils.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:22.530
I play bass, and it's a Cajun band.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.140
I still play with Balfa
Toujours occasionally

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.460
and I play bass in that band.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:35.040
Then I have a little trio called Le
Ferais, which means brass knuckles

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.240
and I play guitar and a little
bit of accordion in that band.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:43.860
And we also have a Le Ferais full
band, which has a five-piece band.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.160
So, right now, and then
I'm just sort of a--

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.460
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: [inaudible]
as well?

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.760
Is that still going?

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.060
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: [inaudible] is
still going, but I haven't been

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.670
with them for the last
couple of years.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:51.970
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Oh, OK.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.270
So, yeah.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:54.570
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yeah.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.870
We got nominated for a
Grammy and then that was a,

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.790
that was a good point for me to
close the door and then just kind

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.830
of move in a different direction.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.400
So, that's what I did.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.710
And then I'm just a sort of
bass player, guitar player,

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.170
or accordion player for hire.

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:06.470
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.050
It sounds like you have enough
bands with or without that one.

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:10.350
So, yeah. Yeah.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.650
So, what about you Richard?

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.550
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: I, again,
play with Yvette every Thursday.

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.050
We do this little duo.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.920
And we do this on occasion,
the trio.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.220
That's like she said.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.500
And I play back home with this
Cajun group I mentioned earlier,

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.040
High Performance.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.400
And we do that on occasion.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.900
It's not a steady thing although
it's two or three times a month.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.200
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.500
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
And we have a couple

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.960
of local country artists back home

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.040
that are reputable
in their own right.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.960
You know, Dustin Sonnier, Blaine
Roy, and I kind of mix that

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.480
and I have a day job as well.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.820
So, I do that and so
plenty enough for me.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.120
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.420
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: I did the
big scene thing back in the '90s.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.700
I was lucky enough and got signed
with a group to Capital Nashville,

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.880
River Road, and we did the whole
big picture of the recording

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:03.150
in Nashville back then and traveled
the country and parts of the world.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:05.860
And, you know, and just rode the
wave and then the wave has to come

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.420
down and then you go
do something else.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.700
And right now the something
else is what I'm doing

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.580
and this is where I want to be.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.040
This is where I need
to be, this is it.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.340
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.640
Being home is sometimes good.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.940
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Thank you.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.240
Thank you.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.540
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.840
I know it.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.140
And Beau.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.440
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: Awesome.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.740
I work with Yvette of
course and I literally work

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.040
for about 100 different
artists on a regular basis.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.340 position:56%
I do a little bit of a juggling act.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.640
A lot Louisiana artists.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.940
I do a lot of session work.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.340
I play with a lot of the
same bands that Richard

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.140
and I work together back at home.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.190
Cajun, country, jazz, blues.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.820
I do a lot of string
arrangements and what not.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.120
I love to travel.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.420
Just, you know?

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.560
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Somebody
told me one time, "Man,

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.380
we went down to your neck of
the woods, and you guys have

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:50.220
about 100 Cajun bands but
only like 12 musicians."

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.520
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: That's
right [laughter].

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.820
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Everybody
just [multiple speakers].

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.730
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
Everybody just floats.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:56.030
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Everybody
just kind of floats

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.330
around [multiple speakers].

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.750
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: But he's the
number one fiddle when it comes

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.050
to session and just playing.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:02.040
He's the one everybody calls.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.010
He's the bomb.

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.310
The bomb.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.610
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Same thing here.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:07.910
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: The bomb.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.210
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: It's good to know.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.510
Yeah [multiple speakers].

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:11.810
There's a lot of great
musicians at home so.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.330
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen (off screen): I have
a question that maybe you can ask,

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:17.040
which is, which we were talking
about earlier which is just the,

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.860
you know, Louisiana is
known for Cajun Zydeco,

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.440 position:56%
but there's so many other influences
from other parts of the South

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.740
and just to talk about that

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.190
because you played a
lot of different styles.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:29.710
Maybe you want to talk
about the history.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.010
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.770
That question is the
fact that, you known,

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:37.230
Cajun and Zydeco music are very
well known as Louisiana music,

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:41.830
but there's a lot of other musical
influences throughout Louisiana

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:45.220
and talk about what some of the
other musical styles are that.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.740
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Oh, I
could tell you it's the blues.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.040
Big time.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.340
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: Yeah.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.640
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: He has it.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.940
I have it.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.240
She has it.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.540
But she mixes it in
[multiple speakers].

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.840
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: It's evident
in that old string music

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.140
like the Rustic Ramblers
and a lot of the 1920s

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.410
and '30s string music
that was popular.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:03.700
You could still hear that trace
back from the Dixieland of jazz or.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: It's not playing
the straight [inaudible] seventh

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:08.950
chord and that's the blues.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.130
And it's in our playing, in
her singing, and everything.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.430
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: That's right.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.610
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: It's
just a natural for us.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:15.910
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: There's
definitely there's that

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:19.090
but then just surrounding
our little Acadiana area.

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.080
So, we have the Cajun.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.380
We have the Zydeco.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.080
We have the country.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.430
We have the blues.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:29.380
New Orleans is right down the road,
so you've got the jazz, you know.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.470
We have more and more
so people are coming in.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.530 position:56%
So, they're bringing old time music.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.110
We have, there's Irish
music that's there.

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: There's German,
there's a couple German communities.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.850
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: There's German.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:43.150
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Right.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:44.450
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: And
there's African communities.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:46.040
There's a lot of influence from,
it's literally the melting pot.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.340
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: You're right.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.640
It's a melting pot.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:53.620
And so all of that music from way
back when will find its way even

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.360
if it's just the tiny bit but
it will find it's way in there.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.660
Yeah.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.960
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.260
Well, that accordion wasn't,

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:04.270
wasn't American originally
or African so, yeah.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.570
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: No.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:06.870
No. No. No.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.170
no [multiple speakers] the
Germans [multiple speakers].

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:09.470
Right. And the reason
why the Cajuns love it

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:13.810
so much is it was so
obnoxious and loud.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.940 position:56%
And so for the dance halls, at first

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.800
when they just had the
fiddles playing, it, I mean,

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.810
it was great music and the
French music that eventually came

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:25.680
down was fiddle music but it
didn't work well in the dance halls

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.590
because there was no amplification.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:31.620
And so when that accordion
came, that was it.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.920
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.220
Excellent.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.110
So, speaking of being able to hear
and maybe not being able to hear,

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:40.150
one of the things that was, that
I think was really interesting

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:43.910
in the concert was when you started
playing the Star Spangled Banner,

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:45.710
you started to sign it.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:47.010
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yeah.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.080
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, tell us about
ASL and your connection there.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.900
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Well, that was a
spur of the moment decision to do

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.330
that but I do teach American
Sign Language at the University

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.720
of Louisiana at Lafayette.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:02.430
And people always ask do you
have any hearing impaired people

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.490
or any people who are
deaf in your family?

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.040
And the answer is no.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.660
I learned sign language
because I was challenged.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.230
I'm a schoolteacher as well.

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.870
And I started teaching
self-contained special

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.520
needs students.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:22.150
And I learned maybe, I was
trying to teach them to read.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.800
And so I learned about 100 signs.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.930
And I switched schools and the
new school actually had a deaf

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:29.230
ed program.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.750
And so the first day of
school I am walking on campus.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.470
And there's these two
little boys that are walking

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:35.420
down the side walk
and they're signing.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:39.030
And I got all excited because
I knew how to say good morning.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.150
So, I walked up to him
and I signed good morning.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:43.780
And they stopped.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.080
And they looked at me.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.240
They gave me this look
like, "Who are you?

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.920
You know, "we know
everybody that signs.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.810
We don't know who you are."

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:54.960
So, this one kid started
just signing 90 miles an hour

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:59.490
and I just did, stop, stop,
stop, I don't understand.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:05.530
And he gave me this look and he
stormed off and he marched away.

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:09.030
And I looked at the other
little boy and I did, what?

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:11.040
And the little kid goes,
you know, like this.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.870 position:56%
So, I'm watching the other kid and
he goes and he grabs his interpreter

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:18.760 position:56%
and he is dragging this interpreter
back and he stands up in front of me

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.040
and he is just, I mean,
hands flying every where.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.830
And the interpreter
is voicing for him.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:26.690
And she is saying, "Who
do you think you are?

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:27.990
Are you making fun of me?

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:29.290
Do you want to talk to me?

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.530
If you want to talk to me, why
don't you learn how to talk to me?"

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:32.830
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Oh, wow.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.350
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: I mean,
this little kid chewed me out.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:36.550
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: He
was not having it.

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:37.850
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: First
day of school.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:39.150
I was horrified.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.450
I was so heartbroken.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:43.860 position:56%
And he just, he said, his last words
to me was, "If you want to talk

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.310
to me, why don't you
learn how to talk to me?"

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.890
And he turned around
and he just stormed off.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:52.530
So, I taught that day,
and I was just miserable.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.210
And I went home and I
will never forget this.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.490
I was washing the dishes and
I am just kind of looking

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.590
out of the window replaying
the whole thing in my head.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:07.010 position:56%
And then all of the sudden I said,
wait a minute, I told 400 other kids

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:10.590
on campus good morning and I didn't
have a conversation with them.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:12.440
Why do I need to talk to that kid?

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.780
Why do I need to learn how to talk?

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.360
Who does he think he is?

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.800
So, I went to school the next
day and I found the interpreter

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.720
and I said, "Where's
that little boy?"

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.690
And she said, "He's over there."

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:26.990
I said, "Go get him."

00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:29.080
So, she went and she grabbed
him and she brought him back.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.410
And he's standing in front of me,
you know, all attitude like that.

00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:35.960
And I looked at her, and I
said I want you to sign word

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.260
for word what I'm telling him.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.090
And so she said OK.

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:45.810
So, I bent down and I said,
"Listen here you little turd.

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:47.860
Let me tell you something."

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:52.420
I said, "I came on campus and I
told 400 other people good morning

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.720
and didn't have a conversation
with them.

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.990
So, there's no reason why I need
to have a conversation with you,

00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:59.070
but I tell you what I will
learn how to talk to you

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:01.900
and when I do learn how to talk to
you, I am going to chew your butt

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.450
out just like you chewed
my butt out."

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.720
And I turned around and I
stormed off and I went straight

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.750
to the teachers' lounge, and
I looked in the phone book

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.240
and I found deaf services.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.540
And I called them.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.670
And I said, "Do y'all teach
sign language classes?"

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.330
And they said, "Yes, ma'am, we do."

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:16.410
I said, "When do you start?"

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.040
She said, "Well, we actually have
a session starting next week."

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.340
I said, "Good.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:21.640
Sign me up because you
have until May 15th

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.950
to teach me how to
chew somebody out."

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.250
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: That's a
good story [multiple speakers]

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:26.550
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yeah.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:28.580
So, that's how I started
with sign language.

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:32.530
And I went to the classes
and then I just sort

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.050
of immersed myself in the culture.

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:37.050
And I fell in love with the
language and the culture.

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.200
And, you know, so I loved it.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.500
And I did.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.850
And I chewed him out in May.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:44.750 position:56%
And the whole time I was doing it
he was just looking at me like that.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.570
And so I was all proud of myself

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:49.040
when I finished, you
know, like there.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.750 position:56%
And he looked at me and he just
went, "See, now you can talk to me."

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.550
And I was like you little turd.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:57.350
You got the last word in
anyway [multiple speakers].

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:00.380
But I'm so thankful
that he did that.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:01.680
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Because, you know,

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.280
I've enjoyed it now
for quite some time.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.580
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Well, Washington,
D.C. really appreciates that.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.480
There's a lot of deaf
education here.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.780
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yes.

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.100
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And so
people really, you, you know,

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.400
see hearing-impaired
people all the time.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.700
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: All the time.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:15.000
Yeah.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: They do appreciate
the signing so that was really nice.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:19.960
The other sort of non-musical thing

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.760
that I think we should
talk about is your books.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.060
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Oh.

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.360
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Because you've
written a couple of books

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.880
that are based around folklore.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.180
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yes.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.480
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And since we
are the American Folklife Center,

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.780
that's another thing
that we're interested in.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.680
So, give us the run
down on your books.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.170
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: It's so much.

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:38.910
So, yes. I've written two books.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:45.890
And I've told this story twice
already, but I'll tell it again.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:50.100
So, I never intended to be, I
never intended to be a musician.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.400
And then here I am.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.700
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.920
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: I never intended
to be a songwriter and here I am.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:59.600
And I definitely never intended
to be an author yet here I am.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:05.560
And the first book came about
from actually a music gig.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.990
I was offered to go play in Maine.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:12.520
This gentleman said, "You know,

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:17.970
we have this guitar,"
what did he call it?

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:20.170
"A guitar society that
does concerts.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:25.700
And we usually have
virtuoso guitar players come

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.630
and you're obviously not
a virtuoso guitar player,

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.280
but I think you have
something to offer

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.040
so maybe we could ask you to come."

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.540
And I'm thinking, why
would I even go, you know?

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.150
But then I thought, you know what?

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:41.070
If you're crazy enough to ask
me, I'm going to go and do this.

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.750
So, I ended up going by myself,

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:47.130
which was my first solo
gig and I was so nervous.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.180
And he picked me up at the
airport with his two children

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.890
who were three and five years old.

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:54.680
And they came to the airport
and they were like running

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.980
around like crazy, you know?

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.350
And then they're hey, Asian
Lady, are you coming to house?

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.070
Hey Asian lady, are you going to
do this, are you going to do this?

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:04.930
And I remember looking at the dad
going why are your children calling

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:06.230
me Asian?

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:08.890
And he said, "Well, I've
told them now for a month

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:10.560
that the Cajun lady was coming

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.060
but they don't really
know what Cajun is.

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:16.940
So, they just assumed
that you're Asian.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.330
So, we rode back and
we got to their house,

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:23.800
and like I said they were just
three and five and full of energy.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.810
And I get out of the
car and I have my guitar

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:27.110
and I have my gig bag
and I have my suitcase.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:30.800
And they are running around and
they're like, "Are you gonna

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.120
to play ball with me, are you
gonna [talking fast sounds]?"

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.420
you know, and all this stuff.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.170
And I'm there, what?

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:37.880 position:56%
And the youngest one, when I turned,

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.800
he wanted me to watch
him ride his bike.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.320
And when I turned he had
taken off all of his clothes.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:47.540
And he had put on his dad's roller
blades, which were like this big.

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.730
And he is on his bike and he
is riding all the around yard.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:53.340
And he is like look at me,
look at me, look at me!

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.970
And I'm thinking, the
other one has tennis balls

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:56.270
and he's throwing them at my head.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:58.630 position:56%
And I'm there, what am I doing here?

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:02.090
And all of the sudden, the
little one gets off of his bike,

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:04.900
kicks off the roller blades and
starts running around the yard.

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:10.060
And then all of the
sudden he like freezes.

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:15.250
And I hear this woman yell from
the window, "Oh, my god, Levi,

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:16.770
do you have to go to the potty?"

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.100
And this is a kid who is frozen.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.520
He just looks at his
mommy and goes, "Uh-huh."

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.480
So, she comes running
out of the house,

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.180
almost knocks me off the sidewalk.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.320
And she picks up this kid
and she flings him over

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.620
and he's kicking screaming.

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.920
And he's like, "I'm not going.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.220
I'm not going.

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.520
I'm not going."

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.820
And she would say,
"But you have to go.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.120
You have to go."

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.220
And all of the sudden he just,
he stiffens up like this.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:46.140
And he screams at the
top of his lungs.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:50.700
He goes, "I'm not going
unless that Asian lady comes."

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:54.650
So, the mom, the mom looks
at me and she goes, ah,

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:56.130
so I said, all right, you know?

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:58.510
So, I dropped everything
and we run in the house.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:02.300
And we get into, she just opens
the door to this little bathroom.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.980
I mean, tiny.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.420
And she puts the little kid
on the little [inaudible]

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.680
on the potty right there.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.320
And then the five-year-old
comes under the sink and he sits

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.770
under the sink and she just kind
of shoves me in and I'm sort

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:17.560
of squeezing between
the toilet and the wall.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.540
And she goes, "Thank you."

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.500
And she closes the door.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.940
So, I'm sitting in this
bathroom with these kids.

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.160
And they're looking at me
and I'm looking at them.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.380
And I'm going what in
the heck am I doing?

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:33.390 position:56%
And so the little one, he is sitting
on the potty and he just does

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:40.760
like that and he goes, "Asian lady,
tell me a story about Asian land."

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.580
And it was in that moment
that I made up a story

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:49.450
about the ghost tree based on
a tree we have back at home.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:52.860
We have the second largest live
oak in the state of Louisiana

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.860
at my grandmother's house.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:59.020
So, I made up this story about this
live oak tree that on October 31st

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:04.270
if you go into the swamp and you
look at it, it will come to life

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:07.430
and it will grow eyes and its mouth
will open up and snakes will come

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.130
out and it will turn you into
stone and then it will eat you.

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:17.790
And so, yeah, I mean, it was a
very successful story I might add.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:21.200
And in the process it ended up
begin a very wonderful weekend.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.950
And I wrote the story
down to send to them

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:25.420
and one thing led to another.

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.280
Somebody read it.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.390
Within a week I had an
illustrator, a publisher,

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:33.210
and a book deal and there it was.

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:34.510
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: All right.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.800
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: So,
that's how that came to be.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.870
And then my second one
I intentionally wrote my

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:42.170
children's book.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:46.720
Yeah. And that one is coming
out at the end of this month

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.430
and it's called "Madame
Grand Doigt."

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.710
And my grandmother used to
tell me stories about her.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:55.340
If you were not behaving, she lived
up in the attic in the rafters

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:58.540
and at night her long fingers
would come down and snatch you up

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:01.040
and you would never be seen again.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.450
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:03.750
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yeah.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.050
Happy little children stories.

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:06.350
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:08.120
Well, you know, sometimes those
can be useful [multiple speakers].

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.420
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Absolutely.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:10.720
Absolutely.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.020
So.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.320
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: All right.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.620
So, we want to thank you for
bringing copies of those books here

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:15.920
to the Library of Congress.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.470
I know they've been
added to our collections

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:19.620
and we're really happy about that.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.920
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yeah.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.220
Yeah.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.520
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So,
tonight you are going to play

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.340
at the Kennedy Center as well.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.640
So.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.940
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yes.

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.240
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, more music.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.540
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Yes.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:32.840
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Is
there anything more

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.140
that you folks wanted
to say about your music?

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:40.520
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen: Actually, Richard,
why don't you talk a little bit

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:45.700
about the fact that, just
about when you were coming

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.650
up there were a few other people
your age studying pedal steel

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.540
and now it's that [multiple
speakers]?

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.390
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Ok,
What I want to say is

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:58.550
that when I began playing
steel guitar, I was 13.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:01.650
And back then

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:07.540
I have three other friends
about the same age as I,

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:08.840
two or three years difference,

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:14.150
that we all started playing the
steel guitar at the same time.

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.960
And we've all, you know, mentored,
and we've all woodshedded together.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.040
We've been to the same training.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:23.190
A lot of get-togethers and
sharing ideas and licks

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:25.290
and whatever you want to call them.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:30.350
And it's 40 years past.

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:35.530
And it's scary because there's
nobody coming up behind us.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:40.050
And I've actually had, well --
I have another steel guitar.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:41.990
I have a couple of them.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:46.300
I've loaned one to a young
guy coming up and I don't know

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:48.010
if he's getting it or not.

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:49.310
I don't know.

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:50.610
It's just scary.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:53.080 position:56%
It's scary that nobody is coming up.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.200
Now, they attempt it.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.860
And spent thousands of dollars.

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.160
And they do what a lot
of other people do.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.870
They get discouraged
and put the dang thing

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:05.050
under the bed and it rots there.

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:10.090
So, you know, it's an instrument
that, you know, you've got to fall

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:12.080
in love with like I
did right out the gate.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.880 position:56%
You know, you got to, I went to bed,

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.910
I remember with that thing
right next to my bed.

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:19.740
And I looked at it like I am
going to learn this thing.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.830
But you have to marry it.

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:24.720
And you have to be
willing to sacrifice.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.810
Because it doesn't come easy.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:29.390
It's the hands, the
feet, or the legs.

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:31.250
It doesn't come easy.

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:35.910
So, but if you work hard, it's
a shame it takes this long,

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:39.270
but you know, you can reap some
of the rewards, but what we talked

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:44.070
about it's scary that I have a
son that is a great guitar player.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:47.940
Set the thing up in his room,
showed him a few things.

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.040
He tried. He is just like,
"Dad, I just can't do it."

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.640
He is an amazing guitar player
but he is just not going

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.940
to attempt the steel guitar.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.270
And there are a lot of others
that are just afraid to do it.

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:59.310
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Do you think
it's just because it's so hard or?

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:00.610
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: Too much
work for me, I tell you.

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:01.910
Yeah. I'm way too lazy.

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:04.400
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: It took
me 30 minutes to figure

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.100
out how to put the picks on--

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:08.020
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: I
left it at her house one.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.280
Tell them the story of me
leaving it at your house one day.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.840
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: He left
it at my house one day.

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:17.060 position:56%
Do I called him and I said, "T, I
said, you think I could kind of mess

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.460
around with it a little bit?"

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.220
And he said, "Oh, yeah.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:23.420
Sure." So, I sat there, I'm not
kidding you, for 30 minutes trying

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:24.720
to figure out how to
put the picks on.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.060
I put them on one way and I'd
try and it just didn't work.

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:27.360
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
And they fly off.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.660
See, you don't put them this way.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:29.960
You put them going straight up.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.260
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: It was weird.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.560
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
At a 90-degree angle.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.860
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: I
tried everything.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.160
None of them felt right
[multiple speakers].

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:39.180
So, I called my friend in New
York who plays steel guitar.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.480
And I said, "Thomas," I
said, "I have a steel guitar

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.360
in my living room," and I said,
"I don't know what to do with it."

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.660
He goes, "OK, Yvette.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:44.960
Listen to me.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.570
This is very serious.

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:49.950
I need you to pay very
close attention."

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:51.250
I said, "OK."

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:52.850
He said, "I need you to take
the guitar, and I need you

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:54.150
to go put it out in the yard."

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:58.290
And I'm thinking is it, OK.

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:00.040
He goes, "And then," he said,

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:06.600
"go in the garage and get a gas
can and pour gas all over it

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.620
and light the match and run.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.220
Run as fast as you can."

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.520
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Burn it.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.820
Burn. [laughter]

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.120
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: He said,
"Stay away from that thing."

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.420
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Yeah.

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.720
Don't go there.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.020
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: It's, I mean,

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:19.320
you got to be an octopus
to play that thing.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:23.900
And it's just, you've got
too many things to do.

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.200
Yeah.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.580
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: But hopefully
somebody will come around back home

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:32.280
and kind of take off
from where we leave it.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.580
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:35.120
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Because when you
hear steel guitar in a Cajun song,

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.790
it's completely, it's a
totally different beast then

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:40.090
if you just have fiddle.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:41.390
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:43.040
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: So,
it brings a whole new--

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.240
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: In which I
wanted to interrupt a while ago.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:51.530
You know, you talked about Dewey
Balfa, how he has been like the guy

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:54.850 position:56%
that brought Cajun music all over
the world and he has, but believe it

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:56.150
or not you have two
styles of Cajun music.

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:58.080
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.430
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: His style
is what went across the country.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:03.080
My style isn't.

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:07.800
We call their style the prairie
type of Cajun music whereas we're

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.320
like known as the Lafayette style.

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.130
It's just a different rhythm.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:13.430
Totally different.

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:14.730
Totally different.

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:16.890
And believe it or not, the
steel guitar where I come

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:20.460
from drives the music along
with the fiddle together.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:24.040
It's that power driven thing
that we do, they don't do.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.260
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: And it's a
lot like the language as well

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.570
because the language
from the prairie regions

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:30.210
which is only about an hour away.

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:31.510
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Not even.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:32.810
It's about 40--

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:34.110
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Forty, forty-five
minutes is completely different.

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:35.410
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: It's different.

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:36.710
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Than the
French that we speak down,

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:38.710
or that some people
speak down our way.

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:40.010
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:41.310
I think most people would notice

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:42.610
that the music swings
kind of differently.

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:43.910
That would be sort of their
way of feeling that difference.

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:46.050
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: It does.

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:47.350
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:48.820
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: But Steve
Riley is from the prairie side.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.120
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.600
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: But he
is also a part of the mix

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.510
with the High performance.

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:54.810
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:56.110
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
And he's probably

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:59.810
to me the best accordion
player on the planet, you know?

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:01.700
That's what I think is the bomb.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:06.990
Although we have a young guy in the
group that plays with more energy

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:09.770
with the Lafayette
style, that's incredible.

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:15.030
But I'm talking for
the pocket, the timing,

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:18.720
Steve Riley to me is
like the bomb, you know?

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.180
Really.

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:21.480
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.940
Yeah. Well, like I
said, we love Steve

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:25.770
and his band members have been
here doing research and stuff.

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:27.070
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Oh, yeah.

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.370
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, yeah, we've--

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:30.330
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Well,
you know, Kevin the drummer.

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:31.630
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:32.930
That's right.

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.230
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
That's Kevin's dad

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:35.530
that got me my first
gig [multiple speakers].

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:36.830
Yes. Yeah.

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:38.130
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Wasn't,
was Kevin's dad

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:39.430
in the original Mamou
Playboys before?

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:41.000
One of their dads was
in that original band

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.260
that they're named after,
but I can't remember.

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:45.040
&gt;&gt; Beau Thomas: That
was Mr. Vorance Barzas

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.290
which was Kevin Barzas's father.

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:48.690
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:49.990
Sounds right.

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:51.290
All right.

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:53.690
Well, I'm, you know, really
glad that we've been able

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:58.040
to talk about all these things.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.650
And I think talking about the
pedal steel is really fascinating

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:04.050
because it is that instrument
that you guys have at the center

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:09.300
of your sound that I think a lot of
people wouldn't necessarily expect

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.340
as much in a Cajun band
because of what you said,

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:17.270
the style that took off was a
different side of Cajun music.

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:18.570
&gt;&gt; Yvette Landry: Right.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:19.870
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux: Right.

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:21.170
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: But it's such
a beautiful sound that adds

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:25.290
that real sadness and heart to the
music that I think is terrific.

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:28.480
So, thank you so much for
bringing your Cajun music

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.880
and Louisiana honky tonk.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.180
&gt;&gt; Richard Comeaux:
Thanks for having us.

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:32.480
Thank you very much.

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.250
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Thank you.

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:36.190
&gt;&gt; Announcer: This has
been a presentation

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.120
of the Library of Congress.
