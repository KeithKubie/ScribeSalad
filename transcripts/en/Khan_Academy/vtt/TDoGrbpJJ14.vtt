00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.936
I think we've all heard
of the word bacteria.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.460
And we normally associate
it with negative things.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.640
You say bacteria, those are
germs. So we normally

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.800
associate those with germs, and
they indeed are germs, and

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.600
they cause a whole set
of negative things.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.540
Or at least from the standard
point of view, people believe

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.470
that they cause a whole bunch
of negative things.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.120
So let's just list them all
just to make sure we know

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.660
about them, we're all
on the same page.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.020
So the bad things they do, they
cause a lot of diseases:

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.670
tuberculosis, Lyme disease.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.990
I mean, I could go on and on.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.060
You know, pretty much
any time-- well,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.800
I'll be careful here.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.080
Whenever people talk about an
infection, it's often caused

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.740
by a bacteria.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.360
It can also be caused
by a virus.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.560
An infection is, in general,
anything entering you and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.170
taking advantage of your body
to kind of replicate itself,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.040
and in the process,
making you sick.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.840
But bacterial infections,
let me write that down.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.720
And this whole perception of
bacteria being a bad thing is

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.260
probably a good reason why
almost any soap you see now

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.495
will say antibacterial on it.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.750
Because the makers of the soap
know that in conventional

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.100
thinking, bacteria are viewed
as a negative thing.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.450
And you're like, OK,
Sal, I know where

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.490
you're going with this.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.470
Bacteria isn't all bad.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.010
There are some good traits
of bacteria.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.530
For example, I could stick some
yogurt in some-- or I

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.510
could stick some bacteria in
some milk and it'll help

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.540
produce some yogurt, sometimes
spelled yoghurt.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.200
And that's obviously
a good thing.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.930
It's a delicious thing to eat.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.125
You say, well, I know I have
bacteria in my gut.

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:09.740
It helps me digest food.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.570
And these are all true, but
you're like, look, you know,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.670
on balance, I still think
bacteria is a bad thing.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.620
I'm not going to take sides on
that debate, as I tend to

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.530
avoid taking sides on debates
in these science videos.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.360
Maybe I'll do a whole playlist
where I do nothing but take

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.210
sides on debates, but here I
won't take any sides on that.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.190
But I'll just point out that you
are to a large degree made

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.260
up of bacteria.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.690
It's not just your gut.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.330
It's not just the gut or the
yogurt you might eat or the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.790
plaque on your teeth, which
is caused by bacteria.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.850
It's this kind of film that's
created by bacteria that

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.920
eventually causes cavities
and whatever else.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.060
And it's not just the pimples
on your face.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.740
Bacteria actually represents
a majority of the

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.960
cells on your body.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.930
So for every-- and this is kind
of an astounding fact.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.220
For every one cell on the human
body, every one human

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.230
cell-- so these are all cells
that all have your DNA in them

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.560
and they'll have nucleuses, and
I'll talk about that in a

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:24.400
second-- you have 20 bacteria.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.100
Now, your response there is to
say, OK, that's fair enough,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.620
but these bacteria must be much
smaller than the human

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.400
cell, so it must be a very small
fraction of my mass.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.070
And you're right.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.890
It's not like we're mostly
bacteria by mass, although we

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.640
are mostly bacteria
by actual cells.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.950
But even if you were to take out
all of the water in your

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.850
body, then by mass, bacteria
is going to be

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.610
roughly 10% of your mass.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.900
So I weigh about 150 pounds,
I've got 15 pounds of bacteria

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.470
walking around with me.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.680
So we always kind of think of
ourselves as like the bacteria

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.930
is riding on us, but
to a large degree,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.980
we're kind of in symbiosis.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.960
We're kind of two creatures, or
not just two creatures, two

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.530
types of creatures living
together, because I don't have

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.160
just one type of
bacteria on me.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.800
I have thousands of types
of bacteria on me.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.060
There's a huge amount of
diversity, and we're just

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.150
scratching the surface in terms
of the number and types

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.400
and diversity of bacteria
that exist.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.980
So I've talked a lot about
bacteria, and hopefully, this

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.030
fact right here will make you
realize that they're super

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.420
important to just our
everyday existence.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.740
Just to make sure we understand
the magnitude of

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.280
this, in a previous video, and
I looked this up again, we

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.130
have on the order of 10
to a 100 trillion

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.380
cells, human cells.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.670
So for every one of these we
have 20 bacteria, we're

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:59.700
talking about having on the
order of 200 to 2,000 trillion

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.450
bacteria on us at any time.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.850
And I'm a hygienic person.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.060
I take showers daily,
and that's even me.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.930
It's not like you can somehow
eliminate them.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.500
And even more, it's not
like you even want

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.420
to eliminate them.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.390
But that's fair enough.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.310
You're probably asking, OK,
Sal, I'm convinced that

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.270
bacteria are important.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.830
What do they actually
look like?

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.700
And they're these small
unicellular organisms. That's

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.590
my bacteria right there.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.090
And they're different from the
cells that make up us.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.910
When I say us, I'll throw in
all plants, animals and

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.780
funguses, fungi.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.080
And the big difference, or the
one that people noticed first,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:47.020
is that all of the Eukarya,
which includes plants, animals

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.660
and fungi, all of their DNA
is inside of a nucleus, a

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.670
cellular nucleus.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.600
So that's the nucleus
right there.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.120
And all of our DNA,
it's normally in

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.140
its chromatin form.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.820
It's all just spread around
something like that.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.780
In bacteria, which are what
people originally just

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.040
classify it on whether or not
you have a nucleus, in

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.540
bacteria, there is no membrane
surrounding the DNA.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.950
So what they have is just
a big bundle of DNA.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.920
They just have this
big bundle of DNA.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.760
It's sometimes in a
loop all in one

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.240
circle called a nucleoid.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.970
Now, whenever we look at
something, and we say, oh, we

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.620
have this thing; it doesn't;
there's this assumption that

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.140
somehow we're superior or we're
more advanced beings.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.850
But the reality is that bacteria
have infiltrated far

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.770
more ecosystems in every part
of the planet than Eukarya

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.710
have, and there's far more
diversity in bacteria than

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.770
there is in Eukarya.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.510
So when you really think about
it, these are the more

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:16.260
successful organisms. If a comet
were to hit the Earth--

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.680
God forbid-- the organisms more
likely to survive are

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.110
going to be the bacteria than
the Eukarya, than the ones

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.020
with the larger-- not always
larger, but the organisms that

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.710
do have this nucleus and have
membrane-bound organelles like

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.900
mitochondria and all that.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.700
We'll talk more about
it in the future.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.860
Bacteria, for the
most part, are

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.280
just big bags of cytoplasm.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.160
They have their DNA there.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.050
They do have ribosomes because
they have to code for proteins

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.240
just like the rest of us do.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.040
Some of those proteins, they'll
make some from--

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.500
bacteria, they'll make these
flagella, which are tails that

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.750
allow them to move around.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.250
They also have these
things called pili.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:08:00.650
Pili is plural for pilus or
pee-lus, so these pili.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.950
And we'll see in a second that
the pili are kind of how the

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.970
bacteria are able to do one form
of introducing genetic

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:13.920
variation into their
populations.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.550
Actually, I'll take a little
side note here.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.870
I'm pointing out bacteria as
not having a cell wall.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.550
There's actually another class
that used to be categorized as

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.080
type of a bacteria, and they're
called Archaea.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.190
I should give them a little
bit of justice.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.440
They're always kind
of the stepchild.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.340
They used to be called Archaea
bacteria, but now people

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.190
realize, they've actually looked
at the DNA, because

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.380
when they originally looked at
these, they said, OK, these

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.789
guys also have no nucleus and a
bunch of DNA running around.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:43.380
These must be a form
of bacteria.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.000
But now that we've actually been
able to look into the DNA

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.160
of the things, we've
seen that they're

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.760
actually quite different.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.160
But all of these, both bacteria
and Archaea, are

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.410
considered prokaryotes.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.970
And this just means
no nucleus.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.350
No nucleus, and more generally,
this is what most

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.740
people refer to, but more
generally, they don't have

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.300
these membrane-bound organelles
that our cells

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.410
have.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.330
Now, the next question you might
say is, well, how do

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.300
these bacteria reproduce?

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.720
And for the most part, they do
something not completely

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.300
different from mitosis,
although I

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.420
want to call it mitosis.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.900
We call it binary fission.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.400
I'm not going to go into the
deep mechanism here, but the

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.430
idea is fairly simple.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.710
I have a bacteria right here.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.500
It replicates its DNA, so
it'll have two of these

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.670
nucleoids here, and then the
cytoplasm essentially splits,

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.920
or it's kind of a form of
cleavage right there.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.320
It splits and then you
have two of them.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.440
You have two of them then.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.970
And then each of them, they
can code for the proteins

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.270
necessary to produce all of
their extra appendages, the

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.580
flagellum, which is this
long tail-like thing

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.030
that can help it move.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.340
And it's actually fascinating
because it's operating at such

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.900
a small scale, but you can still
kind of get this motor

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.950
movement going on.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.070
Even at this very, very small
scale, using very primitive--

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.120
I won't say primitive, because
that's making a value judgment

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.066
on these things, but using-- you
know, these flagellum are

00:10:21.066 --> 00:10:23.650
on the order of several
nanometers, on the order of

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.020
tens of nanometers wide.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.020
So you don't have a lot of atoms
to deal with, but you're

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:32.000
still able to get this kind of
wave-like motion that can move

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.180
the bacteria around.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.660
Now, you're saying, hey, Sal,
in that first video on

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.120
evolution, you told me that we
see evolution every day and

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.000
bacteria is one example.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.100
When we use antibiotics, we
think it'll help eliminate

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.800
bacteria, but that one bacteria
that has some type of

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.660
resistance, it'll survive,
so it is more fit.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.120
How did these guys
get variation?

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.010
Well, the one way, and this is
the way everything can get

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.730
variation, is they can
get mutations.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.600
And bacteria replicate so
quickly, they reproduce so

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.810
quickly that even if you have a
mutation that's one in every

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.705
thousand times, by the time you
have a million bacteria,

00:11:07.705 --> 00:11:09.360
you'll have a thousand
mutations.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.640
So they have mutations, but
they also have this form.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.050
I don't want to call it sexual
reproduction, because it's not

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.850
sexual reproduction.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.170
They don't form gametes and the
gametes don't fertilize

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.090
each other and then
produces a zygote.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:29.840
But two bacteria can get near
each other and then one of

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.720
their piluses-- I'll
do that right here.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.830
So the piluses are these little
structures on the side

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:39.690
of the bacteria.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.250
They're these little
tubes, really.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.340
One of the piluses can connect
from one bacteria to another,

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.710
and then essentially you have a
mixing of what's inside one

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.790
bacteria with another.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.530
So let me draw their
nucleoids.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.570
And then they have these other
pieces of just DNA that hangs

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.310
out called plasmids.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.710
These are just circular
pieces of DNA.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.460
Maybe this guy has got this
extra neat plasmid.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.540
He got it from someplace, and
it's making him able to do

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.790
things that this guy
couldn't do.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:17.040
Maybe this is the R plasmid,
which is known for making a

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.530
bacteria resistant to a
lot of antibiotics.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.270
And what happens is, that
bacteria-- and actually,

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.530
there's mechanisms where the
bacteria know that, hey, this

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.850
guy doesn't have
the R plasmid.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.940
And we're just beginning to
understand how it actually

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.900
works, but this will actually
replicate itself and give this

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.290
guy a version of
the R plasmid.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.550
You could also have these
things, transposons, and I

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.240
should make a whole video
on this because we have

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.100
transposons, too.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.160
But there's parts of DNA that
can jump from one part of a

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.870
fragment of DNA to another, and
these can also end up in

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:44.750
the other one.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.230
So what you have is kind of--
it's not formal sexual

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.890
reproduction, but what you
essentially have is a

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.190
connection, and these bacteria
are just constantly swapping

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.730
DNA with each other and DNA is
jumping back and forth, so you

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.490
can imagine all sorts of
combinations of DNA happen

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:02.840
even within what you used to
call one bacterial species and

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.130
very quickly can turn to
multiple species and become

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.300
resistant to different things.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.820
If this makes it resistant to
an antibiotic, then it can

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:13.150
kind of spread the information
to produce those resistant

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.850
proteins or whatever to
the other bacteria.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.460
So this is kind of a form of
introducing variation.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:23.940
And so when you transfer stuff
via this pilus, or the plural

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.660
is pili, this is called
conjugation, bacterial

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.910
conjugation.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.640
Now, the last thing I want to
talk about, because it's

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.990
something that you've heard a
lot about, are antibiotics.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.930
A lot of people,
they get sick.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.550
The first thing they want
to get is an antibiotic.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.830
And an antibiotic is just a
whole class of chemicals and

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.990
compounds, some of them
naturally derived, some of

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.810
them not, that kill bacteria.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:58.660
So now if someone is undergoing
a surgery and they

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.670
get a cut, instead of them
having to worry about getting

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.240
an infection, they'll take some
antibiotics to prevent

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.980
the bacteria from
growing on them.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.110
But the question is how was this
discovered or where does

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.050
it come from?

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:16.150
It actually came from
Alexander Fleming.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.000
Let me write him down.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.310
Very important, because the
discovery of antibiotics is,

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.380
in my opinion, the most
important discovery in

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.340
medicine so far.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.290
So, Alexander Fleming.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.130
He was studying-- I think
it was Staphylococcus.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.920
I forget which bacteria
it was, but it

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.220
was in a Petri dish.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.765
He was using a Petri dish.

00:14:37.765 --> 00:14:38.985
Let me draw a Petri dish.

00:14:38.985 --> 00:14:40.460
There's a little circle.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.790
There's some nutrients that
the bacteria can grow on.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.180
So let's say the bacteria, you
know, it's growing on this

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.170
Petri dish.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.510
And he went out, and he came
back into the room, and he saw

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:56.880
that some mold, some fungus had
grown on this, kind of a

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.310
bluish-greenish fungus had grown
on the center of his

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.420
Petri dish.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.690
And the bacteria, there was kind
of this space around it,

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.800
and the bacteria couldn't
get close to it.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:14.580
And this mold, this fungus was
called Penicillium, the

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.730
Penicillium fungus.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:16.680
He was able to figure
that out.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.750
He took a sample of this and
then he cultured it, which

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.300
means letting it grow and
then seeing what it is.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.810
This was Penicillium.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.650
And he figured out that, gee,
this fungus must have

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.730
something, some chemical that
it's emitting that's

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.070
essentially killing the bacteria
around it, that's not

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.950
allowing the bacteria
to get near it.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.775
And so that led to the discovery
of penicillin.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.620
This was in the late
20s, 1920s.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.420
By the time World War II came
around, now people had gunshot

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.890
wounds and they had to get
things amputated, whatnot, but

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.850
for the first time, they could
actually give people

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.970
antibiotics and not worry
about-- or they probably still

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.990
worried about it, but didn't
have to worry about this thing

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.670
as much as they did before.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.970
And now, you know, if you have
bacteria, if you have

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:14.540
tuberculosis or Lyme disease or
anything, the treatment all

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.390
involves taking antibiotics.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.600
And there are many, many more
types of antibiotics now

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.140
coming from many, many more
different sources, but the

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.570
general idea is the same.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.520
You want to kill bacteria.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.890
Although you don't want to kill
all bacteria, because

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:26.550
some of it's good.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:30.190
In fact, we are made up a
whole lot of bacteria.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.140
I don't know if I even
mentioned this

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:31.500
earlier in the video.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.540
There's bacteria in our skin
that helps take up oil and

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.460
moisturizes and make our
skin nice and supple.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.930
So, you know, the way you think
about it, you could view

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.000
them as negative or you could
view them as positive or you

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.050
could view them as something
in between, but the really

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.820
amazing thing, at least in my
mind, is that we're living in

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.980
symbiosis with them.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.050
I remember I saw a Star Trek
episode once where you had

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.700
these people.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.680
You had these people, and they
were some alien race.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.430
Jean-Luc Picard had--
they ran into them.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.470
They looked very humanoid
like that.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.109
But it turns out-- let me draw
this human-- that they had

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:07.579
these little bugs in
their brain stem.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:10.000
So they had these big insects in
their brain stem and these

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.310
insects started infecting the
crew of the Enterprise, and

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:17.099
they were controlling their
brains and making them act

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:19.450
weird and whatever not, and
this seemed like a very

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:24.069
bizarre alien concept of some
creepy-crawlie living in us

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:26.890
and affecting our brains and
affecting us in some ways.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.060
But if you really think about
it, we are doing this, and

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.680
it's not just with one
little bug, it's on

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.960
the order of trillions.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.540
Hundreds of trillions of bugs
are with us every day and they

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.540
make us us.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.750
I mean, I'm here recording
videos along with-- or maybe I

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:44.040
should even say the bacteria
is recording videos or it's

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.250
maybe partially responsible
for controlling bacteria.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.870
And it's known that the bacteria
can even affect our

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:49.910
mental state.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.220
There's a whole bunch of
research now that certain

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.650
types of bacteria can
cause schizophrenia.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.780
Actually, syphilis does.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.920
Bacteria can cause depression.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.400
Lyme disease, it's known that
when you go into later phases

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.660
of Lyme disease, it can affect
the mental condition of the

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.320
person who has the infection,
so it affects every part of

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:11.920
who we are.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.100
I mean, it would be hard to
even talk of being a human

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:20.690
being without the 10% of our
mass or the 2,000 trillion

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.670
cells or 2,000 trillion
bacteria that

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.880
really make us us.
