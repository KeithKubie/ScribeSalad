&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.720
&gt;&gt; I am so delighted to
introduce Gail Godwin today,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.496
because she is the author of one
of my favorite novels, Evensong,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.156
which I've been recommending
to people

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.090
since it was published 10 years ago.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.690
[ Applause ]

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.090
&gt;&gt; Gail is impossible to pigeonhole.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.956
Her career has been so successful
across so many different forms;

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.550
novels, short stories,
nonfiction, memoir, and even Oprah.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.726
And without discounting the role
of imagination, it's safe to say

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.716
that Ms. Godwin is an artist who
uses her own life beautifully

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.966
as an inspiration for her work.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.200
She was raised in North Carolina,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.600
where her mother was a college
teacher and a journalist

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.133
and a writer of romance stories.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
She went to a catholic school,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.800
which many of us now
fell we know something

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.933
about from her new
novel, Unfinished Desires.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.200
After earning a journalism
degree at Chapel Hill,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.800
she worked as a reporter
from Miami Herald,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.400
an experience that inspired her
new novel, Queen of the Underworld.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.393
And as she worked for the US travel
service of the embassy of London,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.726
which you can get a flavor off
from her novella, Mr. Bedforth.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.620
In 1967, she went to the Iowa
Writers' Workshop, and in 1970,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.220
she published her first
novel, The Perfectionist.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.006
Three times, she has been a finalist
for the National Book Award.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.526
She's received a Guggenheim
Fellowship

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.326
and two National Endowment Grants.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.060
What we look forward in
Gail Godwin's writing,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.013
and what we always find there, is
deep inside into the human heart

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.243
and the willingness that's
all too rare nowadays

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.576
to consider the spiritual
issues that motivate, inspire,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.763
and challenge thoughtful people.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.763
Please help me in welcoming her.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.130
[ Applause ]

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.010
[ Pause ]

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.163
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ron Charles.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.106
I've been an admirer of Ron
Charles for quite some time.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.703
He used to be the book editor of
the Christian Science Monitor.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.166
And then, now, he is the book editor
of Book World, Washington Post.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.783
And he has taking on this great
new risk, I think, and you--

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.463
if you haven't seen them yet, he
has done three that I know of.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.676
Is that right, Ron?

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.743
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.610
&gt;&gt; Five. He has done five
videos, and you can get

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.210
through Washington Post, either
Book World or [inaudible],

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.783
in which he reviews
books, and there is a lot

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.536
of very professional film work.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.743
So I recommend that.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.716
That's one way to keep up
with our interesting times.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.250


00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.720
I was very lucky to be invited
to the first Book Festival,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.966
and that was nine years ago.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.576
It was on a Saturday, like this,
and it was September 8, 2001.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.440
And things were so much--
they were different.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.130


00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.830
It's like looking at everything
back then in the sepia tones.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.506
They had us read the night before.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.806
Some of us read.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.540
And then we met president and
Mrs. Bush in the green room,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.013
and I'm being an author who likes
to stay at home as much as she can.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.783
I was noticing details so I
could take them back home.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.816
And I noticed that many of the
men were wearing-- oh, Lord.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.250
Can you click those up for me-- they
wearing a black ties, their tuxedos,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.586
but they were wearing
black cowboy boots.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200
[ Laughter ]

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.600
&gt;&gt; And when I spoke with Laura Bush,

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.996
who actually just finished her
performance next door as a writer,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.000
she said she was always
nervous about this festival.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.556
She had-- she started a very
successful one in Texas,

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.316
when George W. Bush was the
governor, and she wanted to try

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.603
to bring it to Washington.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.803
And she said that I have
to do is worry a lot

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.443
to make sure it goes well.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.903
And she must have worried a
lot because it all went well,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.826
until the following Tuesday.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.403
But meanwhile, we're
still on Saturday.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.510
So the next thing then, we went
over to the Library of Congress,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.750
and the president was there, vice
president, all the cabinet sat

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.893
at the table with the Attorney
General, John Ashcroft,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.153
and I had just given a reading from
Avan Song, is that scene where the--

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.886
where Margaret is-- she is a priest
and she's a [inaudible] in a school

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.626
for rich delinquents,
really, is what it is.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.446
And she tells them if
they want someone to come

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.696
and say night prayers
with them, to put--

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.823
to make a sign and put it
on the door that says NP.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.966
And that's how she knows.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.846
And then she's surprised at
how many people really put work

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.953
into their signs.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.220
They're works of art.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.153
So at the table for eight,
Mr. Ashcroft said to me,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.226
"I wish somebody would
make me a night prayer sign

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.250
that I could hang on my door."

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.983
This is still September 8.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.890
And so, when I got
home and recovered

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.926
from all this extraversion,
I spent several days--

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.340
[ Laughter ]

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.406
&gt;&gt; -- making him a
beautiful night prayer card.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.946
And to do this, you
want to have a design

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.103
that doesn't leave any white space.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.770
So everything is filled in.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.703
And then while you're doing
it, you think of that person.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.496
And then I wrote him a
letter and I mailed it off,

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.916
and I got a letter back
several weeks after 09/11,

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.323
and it said thank you so
much for thinking of me

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.800
and so on and wishing me well.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.566
Not a word about the prayer
card, and I have a feeling--

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.003
you know, I did it in colored ink
so they may have looked suspicious.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.530
[ Laughing ]

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.930
&gt;&gt; I have a feeling he never got it.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.636
Anyway, that was 2001.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.473
And then there is quite a different
feeling at this one for me.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.893
For instance, at the Washington
Post breakfast this morning,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.853
but we no longer-- we had it at the
White House then, nine years ago,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.616
and I remember somebody said,
"If you want the lady's room,

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.590
you go down-- we were
on the east room--

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.530
go down that long hall and turn
left, and go down the stairs,

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.583
and there is a nice ladies room.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.586
And I went wandering off all
by myself, and sure enough,

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:20.680
there was this beautiful
room with all the portraits

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.140
of all the first ladies,
Eleanor just as she'd come in.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.350
That's over.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.750
This morning, several people spoke--

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.990
several writers spoke about
the importance of being alone.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.036
Now, isn't that interesting?

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:43.393
A big book festival, authors--
because that's when you read,

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.613
and that's when you write.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.473
I was cheered out by that.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.340
[ Laughter ]

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.340
&gt;&gt; I did give a long time to--

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.330
what I might say to you today,
what you'd like to hear.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.550
I didn't write a speech.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.013
But lately, in the
last five or six years,

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.540
I have developed this marvelous
ability to just lie down flat

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.093
in my bed, and think
and think in paragraphs.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.560
So I thought of what
I wanted to say.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.243
I first, wanted to introduce myself

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:26.010
to you whether you've
read on me or not.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.853
I am a seasoned writer.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.296
I have been publishing novels--

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.533
publishing them for 40 years,
writing them for longer.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.690
I've been supporting myself

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.890
by writing novels for
the last 30 years.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.670
And this summer has been very quite.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:49.610
I had a book tour earlier
in the spring,

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.496
and then this summer was quiet, and
I reached page 90 of my 14th novel,

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.716
and that usually means that
it's not gonna die on me.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.420
[ Laughter ]

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.620
&gt;&gt; Now, I came across this essay.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.886
I've read it before, but I
looked it up online again.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.160
If you haven't read it, you must.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.226
It's-- just put up in
Google, Orwell, Why I write,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.026
and George Orwell wrote this
classic essay about why he wrote,

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.566
and here is the paragraph
that just fascinates me.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.870
He says of a writer, his
subject matter will be determined

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.543
by the age he lives in.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.710
But before he begins to write,

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.860
he will have acquired
an emotional attitude

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.210
from which he will
never completely escape.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.173
&gt;&gt; And I started thinking
about that, and it's--

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.350
you know, what is my
emotional attitude.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:19.170
And I have the feeling that it is
something about wanting to escape

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.710
from whatever confines I'm
in, and at the same time,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.333
more and more realizing the precious
gifts of the shadows to be found

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:42.303
in that-- in those unless confines.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:43.496
As Mr. Francis [phonetic]
said, just before me,

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.863
that you keep writing your
books to side with you friends

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.683
and to fight your enemies.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.883
And an emotional attitude is
certainly choosing your friends

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.523
and fighting your enemies.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:05.790


00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.090
I think that the human--
the characters in books,

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.140
and the human characters

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.340
that attract me the
most are the ones who--

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.453
they always have a mystery to them,
and they're never completely solved.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.853
There is something unfinished
about them, which brings me

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:31.350
to my latest novel, my 13th
novel, called Unfinished Desires.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:34.700


00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.170
I'm gonna talk about that for
a few minutes, but I first have

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:43.063
to tell you that this novel was
first called something else.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.173
It was first called something
else in the contract.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.026
It was first called something
else with the first cover,

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:50.573
and the publisher just kept
saying, "Please, please, please,

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:58.753
please change the tittle because
nobody is going to buy this book.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.453
Everybody who has been to a catholic
girl school is gonna say, no.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.673
I don't want that book.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.340
I don't want anything to do with
nuns who hit you with a ruler."

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.420
And at first, I tried to
argue my point [inaudible],

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:16.963
no nun ever hit me with a ruler.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.763
The original title of the book
was-- and I wish still were--

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.143
the Red Nun, A Tale
of Unfinished Desires.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.566
And so, we finally compromised
on Unfinished Desires.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.606
They thought that would do well

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.996
in all the different
venues where it had to go.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.216
And I'm afraid that some people
might have bought Unfinished Desires

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.156
and hoped there was
something else in it.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.820
[ Laughter ]

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.153
&gt;&gt; But there is enough of that too.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.810
This novel was born in me during
an online interview with an editor

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.400
who was asking me-- he was doing an
anthology on his favorite stories,

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.766
and he had picked one ghost
story called Dream Children.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:20.316
And he was asking me about my
favorite kinds of ghost stories,

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:25.736
and I said my favorite probably in
the world is one called Playmates

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.610
by A.M. Burrage, and English writer,

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.853
my second favorite is
Chekhov's, The Black Monk.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.940
And I said I like ghost
stories that are psychological,

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.663
where you feel the
character is being haunted

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.813
from inside and may not know it.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.483
And quite a few people in
my novel, Unfinished Desire,

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:56.956
a.k.a The Red Nun, are haunted.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:05.476
Now, I went to a school that looked
like the one in Unfinished Desires.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:08.403
If you wanna look at that school,
I tried to make a drawing of it.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.790
It's on my website,
gailgodwin.com, go on to that

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.573
and then click on Gail's art.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.350


00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:21.546
And there's a-- and then go--
then click on the Red Nun,

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.720
and you will find a
picture of this school.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.200


00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.520
And I added some gloom and some
clouds, but it's that school.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.630
It was an old hotel in
Asheville, North Carolina.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.366
It was on top of a mountain.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.300
It used to be a sanatorium.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:46.513
Then part of it burned down,
then it was an orphanage,

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.653
and then some nuns came from France
and from England and bought it

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.400
and started a school there.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:56.950
At first, there was a lot of
anti-catholic sentiment and--

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.050
but then, it became the school

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:02.350
where everybody wanted
to send their children.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:09.423
And the bishop of North Carolina,
the Catholic Bishop, complained.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:11.033
He said, "Here, we have this
school run by catholic nuns,

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.993
and it's mostly Protestants
and Jews who go to it."

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:23.313
I'm really glad I went there
because it set up a mood in me.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.016
I can still follow it in my sleep.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.156
I could follow the rooms.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:30.786
And there is-- there are
several characters in there.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.400
I won't say their autobiographical,
'cause one is the nun.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.690
She is an old nun.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:40.823
She is 85 years old.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.490
She is blonde.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.490
She is trying to bright
a memoir of the school

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.756
that will show her the good light.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.656
And to make all this short
because we gonna have questions,

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.060
through writing this book,
I discovered true working

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.756
with Mother Ravenel, who is
writing her memoirs in 2001,

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.046
which is going back to the
schools beginning to 1908.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:15.123
She somehow resolves the issue in
her between of rampant ambition,

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:24.450
which I think I must have had,
and a place for a spiritual life.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.566
So the only revenge I can get
on my publishers for this change

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.966
of title was, in the paper
back, there is place in the back

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.076
where you have an interview
with the author,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:40.660
and I said I've had
enough interviews

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:42.593
with the author in the other books.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.593
So let's let me have a few
characters interview me.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:54.890
And one of them is Mother Ravenel,
and I have her just give me hell

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.900
for changing the tittle of the book.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:03.730
[ Laughter ]

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:05.020
&gt;&gt; I'm now open to
questions and conversation.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.773
Thank you very much.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.423
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:35.023
&gt;&gt; I mean, I've been watching
you, and it's very impressive.

[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.323

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.773
Oh, okay. They're walking
the mic over.

[ Inaudible Discussion ]

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.313
&gt;&gt; They told me to walk to the mic.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.520
&gt;&gt; Well, okay.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.920
Walk [inaudible] mic.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.786
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's good.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.920
&gt;&gt; In Evensong, you have a beautiful
paragraph there about longings

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.636
and desire and the origins of it,
and I was fascinated with that.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.996
That's the reason why I
picked up Unfinished Desires.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:24.483
Are you expanding that particular
concept of longings that are hidden

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.440
and can be explained
eventually in one's life?

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:33.280
&gt;&gt; May I take you with me
on the rest of my trip?

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.700
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:39.603
&gt;&gt; Actually, yes.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:41.840
Did everyone hear her
question, longings and desire?

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.510
Are you working on it-- are
you still working on it?

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:45.890
Yes, I am.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.756
And my new novel is-- I made
even more of a pressure cooker

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.890
with just a few people
with longings and desires.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.090
Yes, I want to get
really down in there.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:00.210
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:02.210
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.210
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.210
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.276
&gt;&gt; Hi. I want-- would
like to know who are some

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.676
of your favorite contemporary
writers,

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.683
and what are you reading now.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:15.750


00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.880
&gt;&gt; I had just finished--
I just hate to say this.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.586
You're not gonna believe it.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:27.156
But I just reread Anna
Karenina and War and Peace,

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:34.136
and I'm rereading Hilary Mantel's,
Wolf Hall, with great envy.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.803
I read every book-- every
literary novel that comes out--

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:49.820
when it comes out, because that's
when I do in the evenings now.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.600
I read as I watch a couple of shows,

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.396
like the Rachel Maddow [phonetic]
show or [inaudible] show,

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.056
and Masterpiece Mystery
and Doctor House,

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.470
and Boardwalk Empire and Mad Men.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:12.836
That's about it.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.770
[ Laughter ]

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:16.770
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.370
&gt;&gt; I think I have read every
literary novel that's come

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:20.770
out this year.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:25.236
And I've read, of course,
Jonathan Franzen's Freedom.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.413
I was looking at my old
interview that they take

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:36.970
for the first Book Festival,
and someone was asking me,

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.423
"What have you been reading?"

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.623
and I said I'm reading this new
author called Jonathan Franzen,

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.306
Corrections, and I'm
rereading Jane Austen's Emma.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.573
So it's about the same.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:56.456
And I reread Elizabeth Bowen a
lot, and my new novel, I will say,

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.593
is my tribute to Henry James.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.913
I have been fascinated by the
Turn of the Screw for decades.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:09.130
And now, I'm gonna write my Turn
of the Screw with a bow to him.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:10.970
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.170

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:16.970
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.703
&gt;&gt; Hi. I attended the school,
as you know, that you wrote

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.836
about in Unfinished Desires.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:23.436
&gt;&gt; What year were you?

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:25.836
Or do you want-- never mind.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.303
&gt;&gt; No, I don't mind.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:28.970
[ Laughter ]

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.636
&gt;&gt; '56. And now, I just--
I've write it twice, actually,

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.330
and I just really loved it.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.720
And I was wondering if you
had any response from people

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:44.656
who might recognize
themselves in the novel.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.370
&gt;&gt; Well, not-- no.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.266
But long before I wrote it--

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.753
in fact, when I was
writing another book--

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:54.640
when I was writing
a Southern Family,

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:56.623
I wanted to get some information on
that order, that religious order.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.463
And by mistake, my
researcher put me in touch

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:07.583
with the original Mother Ravenel
who did not get her claws into me

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.580
because I left town before
I got to her [inaudible].

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:17.350
But then, she reconnected with
me in her old age and my old age,

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.826
and she started sending me
tapes telling me how to write

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.900
and what words to leave in.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.100
[ Laughter ]

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.433
&gt;&gt; I can see it now.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:30.233
&gt;&gt; So I got an insight into her.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:32.370
It was very valuable, that you know,

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.830
we wanna keep control
over what we have.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.446
She wanted to keep control
over one of her old girls.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:45.110
So she very much influenced me in
terms of looking and seeing how much

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:48.360
of me was in her, and how she could
get have a spiritual right life

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.740
as well.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.006
&gt;&gt; Good. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; The protagonist in Evensong began
in Father Melancholy's daughter,

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.873
are there any other characters
from your older books that you'd

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:03.766
like to revisit and
resurrect in a future work?

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.780


00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:08.003
&gt;&gt; No, but I wold like to resurrect
Magda and the good husband,

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.763
she's dead, even in the book.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.496
And there are certain
kinds of characters

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:21.250
that you don't finish with,
like Unfinished Desires,

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.030
there is a character
called Mod [phonetic],

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.376
who's troubled right
into her old age.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.626
So she didn't get a start
in writing until she is 70.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.720
And I'm doing another character like
that in my new book as a girl of 10,

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.380
and she's alone with
her summer guardian

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.443
who is a very peculiar woman.

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:55.043
And that's the Turn
of the Screw slant.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.250

&gt;&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.080

reader since I was six or seven,

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.420
and probably been an
avid reader of your works

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.043
since you started writing.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.443
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.043
&gt;&gt; And have just-- am so--

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.203
you're what inspired me to come
down here in the mall today.

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:23.350
And I just--

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:24.676
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] with you
back to the convent.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:27.930
[ Laughter ]

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:32.930
&gt;&gt; So I'm just delighted to see
your progress, and follow it.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:35.870
I have a couple other questions,
but I'll write you an email.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:37.443
I presume on your website,
there is someway to--

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.030
&gt;&gt; If you email me, just be
sure to put Gail K. Godwin,

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:43.703
'cause there is a lot
of Gail Godwin's.

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:46.663
There is a tennis champion, there
is a Brooklyn School teacher,

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.076
there is a painter.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.476
So gailkgodwin@yahoo.com.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:52.876
&gt;&gt; Okay, I will.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.143

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, .

00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.076
I think that's all.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:00.876
That's our time.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:08.686
Been a pleasure.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000


00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:04.810
