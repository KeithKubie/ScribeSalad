00:00:00.082 --> 00:00:01.112
- [Instructor] We're
going to talk about one of

00:00:01.112 --> 00:00:03.974
the most significant
figures in Western history,

00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:07.064
and that's Gaius Julius Caesar.

00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:10.469
Now, what we'll see is,
his life really marks the

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.636
transition from official Roman
Republic to the Roman Empire.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.971
And I say official Roman
Republic, because it's important

00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:21.489
to keep in mind, even at
the time of Julius Caesar's

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.783
birth, at the beginning
of the 1st century BCE,

00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:29.641
the Roman Republic already
looked something like an empire.

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:32.730
You might remember that
during the Punic Wars

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.476
they were able to take
over Carthage's possessions

00:00:35.476 --> 00:00:38.976
in Africa, and in Spain, at the end of the

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:43.038
3rd Punic War, they were
also, and this wasn't part of

00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:46.146
the Punic War, but they
were separately, in 146 BCE,

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:49.496
were also able to take over Greece.

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:53.785
So any state that has conquered
these people that have

00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:56.998
different languages, cultures,
and they don't have the

00:00:56.998 --> 00:01:01.165
same rights as a citizen of
that state, well, this is,

00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:07.222
by most definitions, what
would constitute an empire.

00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:11.251
But, during Julius Caesar's
birth and during his life,

00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:14.657
Rome was still officially
a republic, and that's

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:17.017
referring more to its form of government;

00:01:17.017 --> 00:01:19.127
you had a very powerful
Senate, you had these

00:01:19.127 --> 00:01:22.056
Consuls who were elected
for these one-year terms,

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:24.270
and there were all of
these checks and balances.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.720
As we'll see, his life,
especially the end of his life,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.156
marks the transition to an
empire, in which there's

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:36.534
a Roman Emperor who
holds most of the power.

00:01:36.534 --> 00:01:38.495
But let's go into the story, and there's

00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:41.058
going to be a significant
cast of characters

00:01:41.058 --> 00:01:43.408
here that I'm going to go into.

00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:47.575
So by 60 BCE, Julius Caesar
is roughly 40 years old,

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:52.582
and he's already a significant
figure in the Republic.

00:01:52.582 --> 00:01:55.822
He is born to a patrician
family, he rises up through

00:01:55.822 --> 00:01:59.655
the ranks, he's charismatic
figure, and in 60,

00:02:00.897 --> 00:02:04.485
he forms a triumvirate with
two other powerful figures

00:02:04.485 --> 00:02:07.109
in Rome, so you have...

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.478
This is Julius Caesar, of
course, and he forms this

00:02:09.478 --> 00:02:10.880
triumvirate, which later gets known

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.531
as the First Triumvirate, with Crassus,

00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:16.088
who is the richest man in
Rome at the time and is

00:02:16.088 --> 00:02:19.220
believed to be one of the
richest men in Roman history.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.503
As you can see, Crassus
is a good bit older than

00:02:21.503 --> 00:02:24.118
Julius Caesar, he's born
more than a decade before

00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:28.294
Julius Caesar, and he
also forms this alliance

00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:30.509
with Pompey, who is
also a little bit older

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.510
than Julius Caesar, and is a significant

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.293
military figure, a general,
in the Roman Republic.

00:02:37.293 --> 00:02:39.525
And this First Triumvirate,
even though it wasn't

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:43.342
an official, it's an
official government group,

00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:47.570
it allowed them to really
hold the power of the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.058
Roman Republic, and to really
move and hold the power

00:02:51.058 --> 00:02:53.545
within the Senate, this First Triumvirate.

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:56.508
And even though Julius
Caesar was a Patrician,

00:02:56.508 --> 00:03:00.074
he was part of the nobility,
they had populist tendencies,

00:03:00.074 --> 00:03:01.987
they wanted to do things for the people.

00:03:01.987 --> 00:03:03.485
You could view them as, in certain ways,

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:06.433
progressive, they wanted
to do land redistribution,

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:08.966
versus the conservatives, who wanted to

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:12.233
hold the power in the aristocracy.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:13.943
And so, this First Triumvirate is able

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:17.225
to use their influence
to put Julius Caesar

00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:19.975
in as Consul for the year 59 BCE.

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:25.969
And, as I just mentioned at
the beginning of this video,

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.033
there are two Consuls, the
other one was a figure named

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:33.279
Bibulus, but Julius Caesar is
able to dominate the position,

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.233
and he's a very powerful
Consul, and he tries to put

00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:38.945
all of these populous reforms into place.

00:03:38.945 --> 00:03:41.444
So this is already starting
to cause a lot of tension

00:03:41.444 --> 00:03:45.598
in the Senate between the
populus and the conservatives.

00:03:45.598 --> 00:03:49.104
Now, after he's done his
one-year term, he becomes

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:52.822
Pro Consul, which you can
view as a military governor,

00:03:52.822 --> 00:03:55.731
and he's given regions that border Gaul,

00:03:55.731 --> 00:03:58.502
so he's given what would be
considered Southern France

00:03:58.502 --> 00:04:01.722
right over here, border
with the Gallic tribes,

00:04:01.722 --> 00:04:05.010
I guess you'd say, near the Italian Alps;

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.499
these are two of the regions, two of the

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:10.065
three regions, that he's given to govern.

00:04:10.065 --> 00:04:12.733
And he uses his position
as military governor,

00:04:12.733 --> 00:04:16.900
as Pro Consul, to expand
the territories into Gaul,

00:04:19.073 --> 00:04:21.522
to take on these Gallic tribes.

00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:25.298
Now the Gauls, or these Gallic tribes,

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:28.896
they're super fragmented,
there's many, many of them,

00:04:28.896 --> 00:04:32.493
Plutarch says on the order of
300 of these Gallic tribes.

00:04:32.493 --> 00:04:34.996
They were militarily,
fairly sophisticated,

00:04:34.996 --> 00:04:37.792
they were, many historians
say, comparable to the Romans,

00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:39.778
but it was their
fragmentation that allowed

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:42.019
Julius Caesar to go after them.

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:45.763
So over the course of his
governorship, of his position

00:04:45.763 --> 00:04:50.261
as Pro Consul, you also
have the Gallic Wars,

00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:52.547
and that's what I have
depicted here in red,

00:04:52.547 --> 00:04:56.714
from 58 BCE to 52 BCE, and
they end here in Alesia,

00:04:58.292 --> 00:05:03.049
where Julius Caesar's legions
are able to win decisively.

00:05:03.049 --> 00:05:05.118
And that is the end, and he's able

00:05:05.118 --> 00:05:08.784
to take all of this territory for Rome.

00:05:08.784 --> 00:05:12.201
Now, while that was happening, in 53 BCE,

00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:20.698
which is right over here,
in 53, yeah, this is 53 BCE,

00:05:23.567 --> 00:05:26.064
Crassus, who you might
remember, was part of this

00:05:26.064 --> 00:05:30.538
First Triumvirate, he is
off over here in the East

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:32.985
fighting the Parthians;
you might remember,

00:05:32.985 --> 00:05:37.025
the Parthians, this is now
the Parthian-Persian Empire,

00:05:37.025 --> 00:05:39.817
they're the successors
of the Seleucids or the

00:05:39.817 --> 00:05:42.554
successor of Alexander the
Great, who was the successor

00:05:42.554 --> 00:05:46.473
in Persia of the Achaemenid
Empire, and while

00:05:46.473 --> 00:05:50.712
fighting the Parthians, he
is killed, Crassus is killed

00:05:50.712 --> 00:05:52.590
while fighting the
Parthians, which breaks up

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.795
this First Triumvirate, and
then Pompey switches sides.

00:05:55.795 --> 00:05:58.779
He switches sides over
to the conservative side.

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:02.126
So now, instead of being one
of Julius Caesar's allies,

00:06:02.126 --> 00:06:05.256
he becomes one of his opponents.

00:06:05.256 --> 00:06:07.246
And so Julius Caesar,
he's victorious, he's able

00:06:07.246 --> 00:06:11.061
to conquer these powerful Gallic tribes.

00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:15.025
Plutarch, according to him,
Julius Caesar's legions

00:06:15.025 --> 00:06:18.514
fought on the order of
three million Gauls,

00:06:18.514 --> 00:06:20.786
I don't know if those
numbers are exaggerations,

00:06:20.786 --> 00:06:22.773
they sound like they might
be a little bit of one,

00:06:22.773 --> 00:06:24.495
of which one million were killed and

00:06:24.495 --> 00:06:27.784
one million were enslaved,
800 cities were destroyed,

00:06:27.784 --> 00:06:31.951
300 tribes were overrun; and
those might be exaggerations,

00:06:33.005 --> 00:06:35.144
they probably were, but
it tells you the scope

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:39.835
of what Julius Caesar did
when he took over Gaul.

00:06:39.835 --> 00:06:42.882
So, he's already this very
charismatic figure, he was

00:06:42.882 --> 00:06:46.860
Consul, but he's a controversial
figure in the Senate.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.265
He has these more populist
tendencies, while there's

00:06:49.265 --> 00:06:51.329
a lot of these
conservatives in the Senate.

00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:54.531
The First Triumvirate breaks,
Pompey switched sides,

00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:58.122
he's able to take over
Gaul, and so you can imagine

00:06:58.122 --> 00:07:02.289
as he is now victorious,
the Senators are worried.

00:07:03.475 --> 00:07:06.397
They're like, this guy,
if he comes back to Rome,

00:07:06.397 --> 00:07:09.223
he might have too much
power, and he might have

00:07:09.223 --> 00:07:12.030
too much power to do the
things that we, especially

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.751
the conservatives, don't want him to do.

00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:18.265
This land redistribution, and
all of the things like that.

00:07:18.265 --> 00:07:23.186
And so they tell him, in
50 BCE, so this is 50 BCE,

00:07:23.186 --> 00:07:26.769
let me circle that, in
50 BCE they tell him

00:07:28.056 --> 00:07:30.993
to leave his Pro Consul position,

00:07:30.993 --> 00:07:34.016
disband his army, and return to Rome.

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:36.041
Now, Julius Caesar's thinking to himself,

00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:38.458
wait, I just did all of this.

00:07:40.083 --> 00:07:43.563
These people are afraid
of me, if I go without my

00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:45.802
title, without my army, who
knows what they're gonna

00:07:45.802 --> 00:07:48.728
do to me when I go back to Rome.

00:07:48.728 --> 00:07:51.728
So he says, I either go back without

00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:55.384
my armies, or I go with my armies.

00:07:55.384 --> 00:07:59.527
And so, he decides to do the
latter, he takes his armies,

00:07:59.527 --> 00:08:02.795
and he crosses the Rubicon River.

00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:06.003
Now, crossing the Rubicon,
I'm gonna write this down,

00:08:06.003 --> 00:08:10.684
Crossing the Rubicon, is now
a phrase that we have in our

00:08:10.684 --> 00:08:15.483
culture that means you've gone
past the point of no return.

00:08:15.483 --> 00:08:18.026
There's a famous quote
ascribed to Julius Caesar

00:08:18.026 --> 00:08:21.465
once he crossed the Rubicon,
as the die has been cast,

00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:23.457
it's the point of no return.

00:08:23.457 --> 00:08:25.743
And this was a really big
deal, because it was illegal

00:08:25.743 --> 00:08:29.585
for a governor general, a
Pro Consul, to take their

00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:32.244
legions outside of
territories they governed,

00:08:32.244 --> 00:08:34.275
and this wasn't just any
region, he was taking it

00:08:34.275 --> 00:08:37.254
into the Italian peninsula,
he was taking it to Rome.

00:08:37.254 --> 00:08:40.228
So this was very, very, very illegal.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:42.466
So the Senators weren't happy about this,

00:08:42.466 --> 00:08:45.526
so they said "Hey Pompey,
you have to go face

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:48.541
"your former ally, Julius Caesar."

00:08:48.541 --> 00:08:51.284
Now Pompey doesn't know
that Julius Caesar only has

00:08:51.284 --> 00:08:54.487
one legion, a legion is
about 4-5000 soldiers.

00:08:54.487 --> 00:08:56.745
He's thinking surely if
Julius Caesar is crossing

00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:58.958
the Rubicon, he must have
a trick up his sleeve,

00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.484
he's already had, you
know, conquering Gaul,

00:09:01.484 --> 00:09:04.043
he's established himself
as this significant

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:06.359
military figure, and so Pompey says,

00:09:06.359 --> 00:09:08.258
you know, Senators, I'm
not gonna keep him from

00:09:08.258 --> 00:09:12.299
going to Rome just yet, I'm
gonna go over to the East

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:15.946
into Greece where we can
build up our armies and

00:09:15.946 --> 00:09:19.014
make sure we are prepared to retake Rome.

00:09:19.014 --> 00:09:21.022
And so the Senators aren't
too happy about this,

00:09:21.022 --> 00:09:23.014
but a good number of them
says, "Okay, well if you're

00:09:23.014 --> 00:09:25.221
"gonna leave, we're gonna go with you."

00:09:25.221 --> 00:09:27.773
And so, Julius Caesar is actually

00:09:27.773 --> 00:09:30.273
able to, in 49 BCE, take Rome.

00:09:32.485 --> 00:09:34.764
But this isn't the end, and
we will continue it in the

00:09:34.764 --> 00:09:37.412
next video, because you, as I just said,

00:09:37.412 --> 00:09:40.438
the power of Rome has
now moved over to Greece.

00:09:40.438 --> 00:09:42.523
A good number of the powerful Senators,

00:09:42.523 --> 00:09:44.535
you have Pompey and his
armies over in Greece,

00:09:44.535 --> 00:09:47.497
Pompey controls significant
fractions of the navy,

00:09:47.497 --> 00:09:51.664
and so a civil war has now
broken out in the Roman Republic.
