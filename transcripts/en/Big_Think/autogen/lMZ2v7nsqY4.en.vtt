everything and this is one of those

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:46.840
everything and this is one of those
 

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.750
everything and this is one of those
things you can do for as long as you

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:48.760
things you can do for as long as you
 

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.700
things you can do for as long as you
have time you can do it five times you

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:50.710
have time you can do it five times you
 

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.589
have time you can do it five times you
can do it 10 times the longer you do it

00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:52.599
can do it 10 times the longer you do it
 

00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:55.260
can do it 10 times the longer you do it
the more effective it is and it gives

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:55.270
the more effective it is and it gives
 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.180
the more effective it is and it gives
you something to work with you know in

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:57.190
you something to work with you know in
 

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.430
you something to work with you know in
your visualization instead of just

00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440
your visualization instead of just
 

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.959
your visualization instead of just
trying to stay in the present moment

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:00.969
trying to stay in the present moment
 

00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:04.070
trying to stay in the present moment
which is really really hard

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080
which is really really hard
 

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.330
which is really really hard
