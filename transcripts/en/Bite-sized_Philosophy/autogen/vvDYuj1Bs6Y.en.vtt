00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.900
 Now I will read a brief story of Kurt Vonnegut Jr., called Harrison Bergeron. 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.980
 The year was 2081 and finally everyone was equal. 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.920
 They were equal not only to God and the laws. They were equal in every respect. 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.300
 No one was smarter than anybody else. Nobody looked better than anyone else. Nobody was stronger and faster than anyone else. 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.860
 All this equality was due to the 211th, 212st and 213st amendments to the Constitution, 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.100
 and the tireless vigilance of the United States' General Disruptors. 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.380
 However, some things in life were not quite right. 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.200
 April, for example, was still causing people to go mad because spring is not coming yet. 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.140
 It was in this rainy month that the chief troubled people took the fourteen-year-old son of George and Hazel Bergeron, Harrison. 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.380
 The event was tragic, no doubt, but George and Hazel could not think much of it about it. 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.160
 Hazel possessed a normal average intelligence, which meant that she could think of nothing but brief outbursts. 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.700
 And George, whose intelligence was far above average, had a little radio in his ear for mental interference. 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.780
 The law obliged him to wear it all the time. 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.100
 It was set on the wave of the government transmitter, 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.780
 who every twenty seconds sent a sharp sound that would prevent people like George from taking advantage of his mind. 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.540
 George and Hazel watched TV. 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.020
 Hazel's cheeks were tears, but she did not remember why they were. 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.940
 The ballerinas were visible on the TV screen. 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.680
 A bell rang in George's head. 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.020
 His thoughts ran panicky, like thieves from an alarm system. 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.000
 "It was a nice dance," Hazel said. - Who we just saw. 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.740
 - Mm? George asked. 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.100
 "This dance," Hazel repeated. - It was nice. 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.520
 "Ah," George nodded. 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.120
 He tried to think a little about the ballerinas. 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.980
 In fact, they were not particularly good - no better than anyone else in their place. 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.120
 They were loaded with weights of scales and lead spheres, and their faces were masked, 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.920
 so that no one could see a gentle gesture or a beautiful face, 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.280
 not to feel like something the cat has brought from the street. 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.080
 Through his mind, the belly thought that ballerins might not have artificial difficulties, 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.820
 but he could not get too far in his mind because the next bell interrupted. 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.460
 George was startled. Two of the eight baler men were also startled. 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.420
 Hazel noticed his rapping. 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.280
 Since she had no mental difficulty, she had to ask George what the last sound was. 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.260
 "It sounded as if someone hit a bottle of milk with a hammer," he replied. 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.960
 "It must be very interesting to hear all these sounds," Hazel said with a slight envy. - All the things they think ... 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.300
 "Hmm," George said. 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.980
 "But if I were a General Difficult, did you know what I was going to do?" Hazel asked. 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:51.880
 It was very much like the General Difficult - a woman named Diana Moon Glamphers. 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.900
 "If I were Diana Moon Glammers, I would have a bell ringing on Sunday. Something like a tribute to religion. 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.240
 "If it's just a bell ringing," George remarked, "I can think. 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.380
 "Maybe I would have done it very loud," Hazel decided. "It seems to me that a good General Difficult would have come out of me. 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.480
 "Not better than anyone else. 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.820
 - Who knows better than I mean "normal"? 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.520
 "That's right," George nodded. 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.620
 He began to think of his abnormal son, who was now in jail, about Harrison, 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.400
 but twenty-one tomato salutes echoed in his head and put an end to it. 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.640
 - Ow! Hazel exclaimed. "It was great, was not it?" 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.080
 It was so great that George was pale and trembling. His red eyes filled with tears. 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.820
 Two of the eight ballerinas in the studio collapsed on the floor and caught on the temples. 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.000
 "Suddenly he got so tired," Hazel said. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.260
 "Why do not you stretch on the couch?" So you can put your weight on the pillow, dear. 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.460
 He meant the pouch bag with twenty pounds of lead shot locked by a lock on his neck. 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.060
 "Go and hold her, I do not mind for a while not being equal to me. 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.900
 George gently lifted the bag to feel her weight. 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.940
 "It does not hinder me," he said. - I do not pay any attention to it anymore. It has become a part of me. 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.780
 "You've been tired lately," Hazel said. - Exhausted. 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.840
 Well, there was a way to drill a hole at the bottom and pull out a little, very little of the balls ... 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.660
 - Two years in prison and two thousand dollars fine for every ball ... I do not think it's worth it. 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.440
 "If you could get a little out when you get back from work ... I mean, you do not have to compete with anyone here ... Just sit back. 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.420
 - If I do, others will do it and just see 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.000
 we were again in the dark times when everyone competed with everyone else. 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.720
 You will not like that, do you? 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.600
 - Not. 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.460
 - That's it. At the moment people start cheating and circumvent the laws, what do you think will be with the public? 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.460
 If Hazel had not answered this question, George could not help her, because the sirens turned into his brain again. 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.500
 "I guess it'll fall apart," she said, shaking her head. 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.000
 - What? George asked with a blank look. 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.620
 "Society," repeated Hazel. "You just said that?" 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.420
 - Who knows? George asked. 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.020
 Suddenly the TV program broke off because of the news. 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.620
 It was not clear at first what it was about, as the spokesman, 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.260
 like all other speakers, had difficulty talking. 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.740
 For a minute and a half, in a state of excitement, he hesitated to say, "Ladies and gentlemen." 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.580
 He finally gave up and handed the sheet to a ballerina to read it. 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.920
 "There is nothing," George assured him. - He tried. This is important. 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.280
 He tried to do the best that the Lord had given him. They have to raise it for trying so hard. 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.280
 "Ladies and gentlemen," she began to read the ballerina. 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.400
 She must have been amazingly beautiful because her mask was terrible. 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.500
 It was not hard to notice that she was the strongest and graceful of all dancers, 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.420
 because the bag with her weights was as much as for the men of grammar. 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.640
 She had to apologize for her voice because it was unfair for a woman to use such a voice. 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.860
 Her voice was a warm, bright, timely melody. 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.380
 "Excuse me," said the ballerina, making his voice absolutely uncompetitive. 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.500
 "Harrison Bergeron, fourteen," she cried unbearably, 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.200
 - has just escaped from prison, where he was arrested on suspicion of a conspiracy to overthrow the government. 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.680
 He is a genius, an athlete, inadequate, and should be regarded as extremely dangerous. 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:33.060
 A police photograph of Harrison Bergeron appeared on the screen - down with his head, then sideways, back down with his head, then up with his right hand. 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:40.780
 The picture showed its height, compared with the wall, measured in meters and centimeters, at the back - it was two meters high. 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:48.980
 The rest of his appearance was carnival and hardware. No one has ever carried heavier and bulkier weights. 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.480
 He was growing faster than the General Difficult people were able to invent new ones. 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:07:01.420
 Instead of a small receiver in his ear, he had huge headphones and glasses with thick, wavy magnifying glasses. 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:07.700
 These glasses should not only hinder him from seeing, but also cause him severe headaches. 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.900
 His body was hung on metallic pieces. 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.460
 Normally, in the stumbling blocks of strong people, there was some kind of symmetry, some sort of military order, 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.820
 but Harrison looked like a rolling stock of secondary raw materials. 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.940
 In the race of life, he was carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on himself. 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.120
 In order to spoil his good looks, people of the General Difficulty had made him put a red rubber ball instead of a nose, 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.860
 to shave his eyebrows and cover his flat white teeth with chaotic black crowns. 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.080
 "If you see this boy," he continued reading the ballerina, "do not, repeat, do not try to make a reasonable conversation with him. 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.460
 There was a scream, as if someone had been knocking a door off her hinges. 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.640
 There were shouts and desperate shouts from the TV. 

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.760
 Harrison Bergeron's picture rocked on the screen as if dancing in the rhythm of an earthquake. 

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.300
 George Bergeron correctly identified what this earthquake was, 

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.340
 because his own home was repeatedly shaken by the same devastating rhythm. 

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.900
 - God! He exclaimed. "It must be Harrison!" 

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.780
 The thought was instantly driven from his head by the sound of a car crash. 

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.280
 When she managed to open her eyes again, Harrison's picture had disappeared from the screen. 

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.900
 It was the real, living Harrison. 

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:23.020
 A screaming, enormous and reminiscent patrolman, he swayed in the middle of the studio. 

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.260
 The handle from the broken door was still in his hand. 

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:31.880
 Ballerins, technicians, musicians and speakers had fallen on their knees in anticipation of death. 

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.600
 - I'm the Emperor! "Harrison roared. 

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.660
 - Do you hear? I am the Emperor! Everyone should do what I say right away! 

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.920
 He thumped his feet and the studio shook. 

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.200
 "Even as I stand before you now - crippled, wretched, sick," he continued to roar, 

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.720
 - I am the greatest ruler of all who have ever been born! 

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.520
 Now look at what I can become! 

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:58.260
 Harrison ripped his weight straps as if they were wet toilet paper, and they were guaranteed to withstand three hundred pounds. 

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.180
 The pieces of old iron screamed on the floor. 

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.900
 He pushes his fingers under the metal pad of the padlock, holding the gear on his head. She broke her like a match. 

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.800
 Then he pushed the glasses and the headphones into the wall. 

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:17.200
 He removed the rubber nose and a man emerged on the screen, who could carry out awe-inspiring Tor - the god of storms. 

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.180
 "And now I will choose my Empress! He said, looking down at the fearful men. 

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.420
 - Let the first woman, who dares to stand on her feet, come to me to take her partner and her throne! 

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.600
 It was only a moment later, then one of the ballerinas rose and swayed like a shallow willow. 

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.920
 Harrison pulled the mental retarder from her ear, broke the physical obstacles with amazing ease. 

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.060
 At last he removed the mask. She was dazzlingly beautiful. 

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.760
 "Now," Harrison continued, and took her hand, "we will show people what the meaning of the word" dance "is. 

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.660
 - Music! He commanded. 

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.740
 The musicians crawled to their chairs, and Harrison released them from their weights. 

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.220
 "Play as much as you can," he ordered, "and I'll make you barons, dukes and counts! 

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:03.760
 The music started. At first it was normal - cheap, dull, insincere. 

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:10.620
 But Harrison grabbed two musicians from their seats, turned them into the air as conductors and sang the music they wanted to play. 

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.000
 Then he threw them into their chairs. 

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.860
 The orchestra played again, this time much better. 

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.000
 For some time Harrison and his Empress just listened - 

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.240
 - grim, as if they were synchronizing their hearts with the rhythm. 

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.240
 They then moved their center of gravity to their toes. 

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.960
 Harrison put his huge hands on the thin cross of the girl, 

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.700
 giving him the opportunity to test the weightlessness that would soon be theirs. 

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.880
 Then they were carried in the air, filled with joy and beauty. 

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.120
 They have abandoned not only the laws of men, but also the laws of gravity and movement. 

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:47.640
 They wore, swirled, swam, flew, crouched. They were jumping like deer on the Moon. 

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.640
 The ceiling of the studio was ten meters tall, but with each jump they approached him. 

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.180
 Obviously, their purpose was to kiss the ceiling. They kissed him. 

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.720
 They then neutralized the operation of gravity law 

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.940
 and stayed a few inches below the ceiling where they kissed for a long, long time. 

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:14.020
 Then Diana Moon Glampres, the general handicapped, armed with a two-piece hunting rifle of tenth caliber, entered the studio. 

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.380
 He shot twice and the Emperor and his Empress died before they fell to the floor. 

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.880
 Diana Moon Glamphers loaded the rifle again. 

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.060
 He pointed it to the musicians and told them he gave them ten seconds to put their weight. 

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.000
 At that moment, the Bergesson family's TV set burned. 

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.500
 Hazel turned to George to mark the fact. 

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.620
 But George had gone to the kitchen to get a beer box. 

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.980
 He returned with the beer and stopped for a moment until the signal from the transmitter came to a halt. Then he sat down again. 

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.520
 - You crying? He asked Hazel. "Ah," she nodded. 

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.180
 - Why? 

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.740
 - I forgot. For something on TV ... really sad. 

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.500
 - What was it? 

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.560
 - Everything is so confused in my head ... 

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.500
 "Forget the sad things," George advised. 

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.580
 "I always forget them," Hazel said. 

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.060
 "Good girl," he nodded, startled. 

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.780
 There were shots in his head. 

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.900
 - God! You know the last one was great! Hazel looked at him. 

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.140
 - Tell him again. 

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.700
 - God! You know the last one was great! 

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.780
