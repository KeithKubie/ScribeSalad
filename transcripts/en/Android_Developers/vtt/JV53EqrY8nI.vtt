My name is Tang Guangyu, founder and CEO of BabyBus

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.780
Everyone calls me "Donald Duck”

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.620
and I’m hoping this amusing nickname brings more happiness to all the children

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.880
As a father

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.460
I used to watch my kids playing and having fun

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.320
so that I have to keep finding new ways for them to play

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.280
Our team has many young parents and education experts

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.980
together we are trying to determine the most suitable and enjoyable

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.140
educational app for each and every kid across different age groups

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.220
We hope that our “bus” get the same magical power

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.440
to travel around the world and to deliver surprises and happiness to every child

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.440
like Santa Claus

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.320
Now, BabyBus's “Magic” just got a lot stronger

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.680
with Google Play’s firm supports

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.720

Currently, 80% of our international users are using Android

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.640
Starting from September 2015

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.240
all of our apps joined the “Designed for Families” section

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.960
so that kids and parents can easily find the app

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.960
based on their interest

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.860
Our downloads has increased by 367% comparing with last year

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.800
“Ice Cream &amp; Smoothies” is our most popular app on Google Play

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.220
it was officially promoted on Google Play homepage

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.860
During that week, it gained more than 1.36 million downloads

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.800

My name is Ling Ying, Product Manager of BabyBus

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.820
We pay a lot of attention to our overseas users

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.260
we have created 12 different languages versions for most of our apps

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.120
which allows them to meet local user's preferences

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120
Thanks to Google Play App Translation Service

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.380
our users are able to read content in their native language

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.920
Admob is the main method we use for app monetization

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.900
it provides more than 90% of total income from oversea markets

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.280
Cooperating with Google Play

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.560
is the key to our success in oversea markets

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.380
We released our first app on Google Play in 2012

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.640
now we have 103 apps in the market at the same time

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.940
with the number of total downloads exceeding 150 million

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.380
With Google Play’s support 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.380
we believe we will continue to bring great educational products for children around the world
