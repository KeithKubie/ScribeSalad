00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first question involves a piece of technology that Galileo didn't have. A bicycle.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now the bicycle is a wonderful machine.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And let's say you can ride here at a maximum speed of 12 m/s with an acceleration of 3 m/sÂ².

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So this means that if you start from rest, you can increase to a maximum speed of 12 at this rate.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Once you get to 12, you can't accelerate any more.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You could represent this graphically by plotting the velocity versus time.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
At time 0, your bicycle is at rest. After 1 second your speed is increased by 3 m/s.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And in fact, you continue accelerating for the first 4 seconds until you reach your maximum speed.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
After that, your speed remains constant.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What I want to know is how long will it take you to bike 96 m if you start from rest?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And for this problem, you might want to break it up into two sections,

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the part where you're accelerating and the part where you're moving at constant speed.
