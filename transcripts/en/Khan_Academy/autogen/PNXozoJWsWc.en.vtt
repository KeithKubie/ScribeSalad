00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 . 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 . 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 7.5 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.666
 In this presentation, I want to solve some of the discrepancies that 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.133
 Contains multiplication and division of positive numbers and 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 Negative numbers, you will see it 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
 Some deception is more than collecting and subtracting numbers 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 Which we saw in the last show 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 I also want to give you some other kinds of 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 The symbols used to describe the solution group are different 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 So let's solve a bunch of examples 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 Let's say I have -0.5x &lt; 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 = 7.5 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.866
 Now if these are adopted, it will be your impulse to say 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 Let's divide both parties on a coefficient 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 X phrase, this is quite logical to do 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 Divide both sides at -0.5 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
 The important thing you need to realize is when 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 It deals with differentiated, ie when hit or 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 The two ends of the equation are divided by a negative number 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 It does the opposite 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 Reflect the disparate 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
 Think about it that way 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 I will solve a simple example here 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 If you want to tell you that 1 &lt;2, you think 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 You agree with me 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 1 No doubt less than 2 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
 Now what will happen if both sides are hit by b 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 -1? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 -1 vs. -2? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 Well, 2-more negative 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Of -1 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 If here, -2 actually less than -1 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
 Now, this is not proof, but I think I will give you a sense of comfort 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 Towards the cause of the heart of the signal 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 If something is bigger, when we take a negative image of both 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 Ends, becomes more negative, or vice versa 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 So for that reason, if we want to hit both ends of this 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.666
 Equation or divide the two ends of the equation on a negative number 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 We will need to turn the signal over 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 So let's hit both ends of this equation 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 To divide both sides by 0.5 is equivalent to multiplying by 2 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 The goal here is to get 1 parameter here 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 So let's hit both ends 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Equation B-2 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 If we have -2 × -0.5 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
 Maybe you'll say, how did you get these 2 here? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 I'm thinking about what I can do 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
 -0.5 In order to get 1? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 And -0.5 equals -1.2 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 Inverted it is -2 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 If we hit -2 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 In this equation 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 I have 7.5 on the other side 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 I will also hit that with 2 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
 And remember that when we hit or split the ends 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
 We vary by negative number 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.066
 Differentiated 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 We had less than or equal to 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 Now they are bigger than or equal to 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 If in the left side we have -2 × 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 -0.5 = 1 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 We get x &lt;= 7.5 x -2 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 That's equal to -15, a solution set 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.866
 All x values ​​that are greater than -15 will achieve this equation 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
 I challenge you to try and solve it with yourselves 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 For example, zero will succeed 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 0&gt; -15 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 But try something else like - try-16 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 16. Will not work 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 -16 × -0.5 = 8, this is 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 Not less than 7.5 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 If the solution set is all x values ​​- let me draw the line of preparation 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Here-&gt; -15 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 That's the 15th, maybe that's -16 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Those are 14 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 Greater than or equal to -15 is the solution 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.666
 Now, maybe you will also see the solution sets for the discrepancies 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 Written in period format 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 It will take some time 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.066
 To get used to 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 We will include 15, if less 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 For the period is -15 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 Putting it in this bow here means we will 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 We include 15 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 The package includes a minimum 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 Which includes 15 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 We will go down to infinity 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 We will go down to infinity 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 And we put up brochures here 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 Arches naturally mean you will not include 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 the highest rate 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Do the same thing for infinity, because infinity really is 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.066
 Natural number 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 You can not just say, I'm infinity 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 You are not endlessly 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 That's why I put those brackets 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 But the brackets mean we will not be included 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 That limit, but we will also use it endlessly 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 So this and that are the same thing 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.533
 At some times you will probably see icons placed, where it will be 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 So, you might be told that x is a real number 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 - That line, that is the vertical line 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 That means - x&gt; = -15 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 These square brackets mean a set of real numbers, or 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 Set all numbers, where x is considered as real number 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 x&gt; = -15 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 All this, this and all these are equal 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.466
 Let us keep this in mind and resolve more examples 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 So let's assume that we have 75x&gt; = 125 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 So here we can divide both sides to 75 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 Since 75 are positive, you do not have to 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.133
 Variable change 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
 Thus we get x&gt; = 125/75 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 And if we divide the rugs and established on 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.066
 25, we get 5/3 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 If x&gt; = 5/3 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.333
 Or we can write a set solution to start from 5/3 and include it 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 To infinity 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 Again, if we want to represent it on 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 Line setup, 5/3 km equivalent? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 This equals 1 2/3 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 If we have 0, 1, 2, 1 2/3 will be 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 Here in this area 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 We will complete it 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.133
 This is the 5/3 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
 Anything larger than or equal to that will be included 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 In the solution group 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 Let us solve one last example 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
 Suppose we have x / -3&gt; 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 -10/9 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
 If what we want to do is to isolate x on the left side 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 So let's hit both sides with 3, is not it? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 Parameter, you can imagine, is -1/3, so 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 We will hit the inverted, it is 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 3 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 If we hit both sides by 3, we will get 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 -3 × - This can be rewritten as follows 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 -1 / 3x, and on this side, we have -10/9 × 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 3 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 The disparate will fluctuate, because we 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 Multiply or divide by a negative number 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
 So the variance fluctuates 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 It will move from a larger to less than 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 If the left side of the equation becomes x 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 That was the goal 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 This is deleted with this 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 Negative signs are deleted, x &lt; 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 And then we have negative x negative 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 The multiplication factor is positive 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 Then if we divide rugs and denominator 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 On 3, we get 1 and 3, if x &lt;10/3 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 If you want to type it in a period, the 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 Solution Set - The top solution is 10/3 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 It will not include 10/3 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 It's not less than or equal to, so we'll put 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.133
 Quotations here 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 Notice here that it included 5/3 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 We put an arc 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 Here, we will not include the 10/3 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 We put the brochures 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 Will go from 10/3, down to the endless minus 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 Anything less than 10/3 will be included in the solution package 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.066
 Let's paint it 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 Let's draw the solution set 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 If 10/3, we have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 10/3 = 3 1/3, if he may fall - let me do that 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 In a different color-- 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Will be here 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 We will not include that 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 It's less than 10/3 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 10/3 does not fall within the solution set 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.666
 That is 10/3 located here, and everything is less than that, however 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
 Not include 10/3, located within the solution group 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Let us solve another example 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Let us solve another example 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 Suppose we have x / 15 &lt;8 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
 If again, let us multiply the two ends of this equation b 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 -15th 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 If -15 x x / -15 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 Then we have 8 x -15 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 And when we multiply the two extremes 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.533
 With a negative number or divide both parties on a negative number 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 Differing reflectors 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 It's less than, we change it to bigger than 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 Now, this left side becomes x, because 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 These are deleted 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 x&gt; 8 × 15 = 80, + 40 = 120, if 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 -120 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Is this true? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 80 + 40 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Yes, -120 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.466
 Or we can write a set solution that it starts from 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 120. But we will not include the 120 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 We have no equal sign here - down 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 To infinity 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 If we want to represent her, let me draw 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Line up here 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 I'll draw one quickly 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
 Suppose this is the 120 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 Maybe zero is here 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 This will be the -121 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 This will be -119 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 We will not include the 120, because it does not 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 We have an equal sign here, but it will be everything 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 Greater than -120 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 All these things that I do in green will be achieved 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.066
 Differentiated 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.066
 You can try it 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 Will zero succeed? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 0/15? 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 Yes, this equals 0 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 It is undoubtedly less than 8 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 I mean, that did not prove to you, but you can try it 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 Of these numbers must succeed 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 Anyway, I hope you found this useful 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 I'll see you in the next show
