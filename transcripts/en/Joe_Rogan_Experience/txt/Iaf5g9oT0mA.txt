Speaker 1:          00:00:03       We're good.

Speaker 2:          00:00:05       Roy Wood jr. how are you sir? Man, pleasure. Pleasure to have you on here man. And when you shake fun of these guys alive. I don't solutely you are just trying to pay bills. Probably one of the funniest guys out there, man. I'm very excited to have you in here. Foxconn. And we were talking shit about Apple and electronics. Apples fucking you out here. So

Speaker 3:          00:00:25       got the new back book right and the new Mac book with the new OLS or whatever it is. It doesn't fuck with the old versions or final cut. The old video editing software. I used to use new Matt but goes you got buy that shit again. I'm like my n***a, I just paid for that shit a hundreds of dollars with my last computer and now I got to give you, you telling me my old software, no good. But the, and you could make the software work with the new O S if you want it to, but they don't want to get you to mind again and all that shit so dirty. So now I'm having to learn Adobe premiere. I was pretty good. But final cut but I'm having to swap out and yeah, I've got to relearn a whole new thing and if I'm going to do that then I may as well relearn a whole new piece of electronics. But to do that means I have to gut everything. That means you have to gut the Apple TV, you have to let go of the iPhone, you have to let go of the iPad. My girlfriend had the whole house. The companies get you. So everybody in the house, even my son, he had a Samsung, he had a Samsung tablet and I was like get that shit outta here. You had to get you a iPad. So we re gifted that and then got in my eyes. So it's like nah man.

Speaker 2:          00:01:33       Fierce about that Mac versus Android shit as much as they do about like Republicans versus demo [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:01:38       I want something where I don't have to keep paying for the same shit over and over again every three, four years.

Speaker 2:          00:01:42       Apple makes great shit, but they fucked,

Speaker 3:          00:01:46       the interface is so smooth. It's so convenient. I can check text messages, I can do whatever I want on my Mac book. Yes, I can talk to my television, I can one click and all the app pay and all of that stuff. It's beautiful, but in three years it's time to pay up again.

Speaker 2:          00:02:02       I almost switched over a couple years back. I bought a pixel and the pixel two came out but then when it came out I couldn't get text messages and I had a, I got an email Apple and ask them to take my email address off of the I message database in order for you. I'm like take that email off so that I can't get I messages anymore and it still didn't work. I went online to try to figure out what is a way, how do you get out of this? How does this work? You can't, no. And if you, unless you switch over to text message for a long period of time beforehand, like switch your iMessages to text messages on your Apple, on your phone or unless you buy a new number, you got to kind of buy it is if you're going to get an an a Samsung phone or something, you gotta get a new number. What

Speaker 3:          00:02:47       got you, what, when did you make the switch to Apple in the first one second. What was the thing forever? But what was the Genesis? At some point you had to have had like a Sangio 59 that was my old flip phone. Shout out to CGU. Um, I remember when I was in radio, uh, back home in Birmingham, I was gifted an iPod touch. Oh yeah. And I was all Android phones, Android, everything. And I had an iPod touch and at the time all I had to play music was the mini disc player. So I could only hold like five hours. I mean, this is like, Oh one Oh two and I had a five hour minutes and I go, fuck it. I'll carry around the iPod touch and then it made more sense. Why am I carrying an iPod touch and an Android phone when I could just have an iPhone that does both. And that started the journey.

Speaker 2:          00:03:32       I started with iPhone one but before that I was using Mac books. I was using Mac forever. But even before they had an iPhone, I used to make my own PCs or used to go to the store, like go to Fry's, buy a motherboard, buy hard drives all time for that. That's a it you gotta you gotta want to do that? Like it was for me. I was, I wanted to find out how to do it and it was, it was cool to play games on a computer that I put together myself.

Speaker 3:          00:03:58       But then you knew how to like, so you're building the games as well. Are you going out and buying the floppy disc and all that?

Speaker 2:          00:04:02       Um, I'm not definitely not building any games. I would just, you know, like I'd buy video games, just play them on this, but even format in it and doing everything, I would have to call friends that really knew what the fuck was up and they'd have to talk me through shit. There's some things you'd have to do in the bios and you know,

Speaker 3:          00:04:18       the irony of all of this is that I still have an AOL email address as much as I bitch about it. Really? Yeah, I know. And you know what? I don't understand email slander. It's like my fucker. It's, I'm sending you words electronically. Does it matter what company? What does it need? Is my email more ghetto? Does it come with chicken grease stains when you open it in your lap? No, it's the same words that if I send it from Gmail now I have a Gmail account so that people will take me seriously when I emailed them about business ideas. But I still have an old school AOL email that I've had since college and I'm like, it's fine.

Speaker 2:          00:04:59       It's a one. It's one of those things though when you just don't let it go. And just think about you've got mail. You remember when you first heard that you've got [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:05:08       They were happy. [inaudible] someone want to talk to me. It was very exciting to talk to me and then you get older and you realize what, please leave me alone. Who the fuck is this? No, God. Male. Yeah. It was exciting. It was like a new thing. That was 96 that's when I got to five. Yeah. Yeah. 95 96 we had an old CompuServe account at the house and that was how we got online and then we started getting the AOL disc and all of that shit. We had a Compaq Presario too.

Speaker 2:          00:05:41       Oh, I had one of those. I had one of those. I started out with one of those old Macs that was like a beige box member with [inaudible]. Yeah. I don't remember what number it was, but it was 95 94 somewhere around there.

Speaker 3:          00:05:54       I don't know. That might be like the O G Mac book where the keyboard in the CPU was its own little, like heavy.

Speaker 4:          00:06:01       No. You had a keyboard that had plug in a monitor that you had to plug in and it was like a tower. I was like a beige funky looking tower. It was slow as shit. It was 14 four modem. Come on. Yeah, 14 four I remember when you got 56 cat. I couldn't believe it. Look at the speed a, wasn't that Jamie? It was a a monitor. Didn't have the floppy disc built into it. I don't think it's hard to remember. I remember it being, there was a, an actual tower and it wasn't a joint

Speaker 3:          00:06:31       where the whole computer was like the monitor itself or the computer on CPU all together.

Speaker 4:          00:06:36       No, but man, I thought I was living in the future. I couldn't believe something like that. Jamie bro, my older brother had. Yeah, that one on the far right. That was it. Moda.

Speaker 3:          00:06:45       I had a Mac book, man. It had an old school Macintosh and in 90s and he had Microsoft flight simulator and you couldn't tell me shit. I go to his house for five hours, would just fly assessments in real time like I get it. I get why people will sit down with the flight simulator and fly in real time from LA to San Francisco, seen the new ones they have. Oh, it's unreal, but pretty neat. I would need to buy a PC and then I knew I wouldn't get shit done.

Speaker 4:          00:07:11       Have you ever used the HTC Vive? No. Oh, what's the one? What is it? Virtual reality. We have one here. Oh, the whole helmet. Sit down joint dude. My kids come here and they battle to the death to see who gets the VR. They fight each other. Punching, kicking shit. It's amazing, man. You put this thing on and like you're in another world. You're, you're fighting zombies. You're in the ocean with, with, with whales.

Speaker 3:          00:07:34       I went to a Samsung event and they had some AR type experience where you put the phone on and it's fun. But then I just, I don't know. In the back of my head, I can't get, I can't get out of my head how goofy I look to someone else. So it's almost like something I gotta do alone.

Speaker 4:          00:07:48       Yes, you look goofy, you look really goofy when you play. There's a boxing game though, that you can get a great workout in like a legitimate, great workout because this dude comes at you, you see me throwing punches and every time he hits her, you see a bright white spark. You feel like you're getting hit. It's wild, man. You're moving around and bobbing and ducking punches, throwing combinations. If your feet start hurting, right, your hands get tired.

Speaker 3:          00:08:10       Is that going to catch on for real, Joe? Is this like the Nintendo? We when it first came out, no, he's getting bored. You're going to lose calories with the Nintendo wee and then you're just a fat bastard on the couch and learning how I learned how to bowl sitting down with the we

Speaker 4:          00:08:24       Ken, you can get in shape with this for real. Like if you wanted to do multiple rounds of boxing with this thing, you would get in some serious fucking shape because it feels real. When you put that headset on and you're that dudes in front of you and he comes towards you and he's got his hands up and then throw a punch. It's like, Oh shit, and you're moving around. He's swinging at you. You see the punches flying over your head. It's awesome.

Speaker 3:          00:08:45       Now, this isn't something that's predictive in a sense, or is it like different types of workouts at different types of sparring sessions? Because eventually you can predict if you knew the patterns, it's still a workout.

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       Yeah, it's a good workout, but either way you're fucking this dude up. That's the whole idea. The whole idea is to keep it on them. It's not like you hit, you don't feel anything. If he hits you, you just see the spark that's next. Ain't no, they'll have a vis that vibrates it and then it gets electrolysis and, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a haptic feedback vest that you wear. There's a place called the void. He'd go there and as a star Wars game and the storm troopers are shooting you and they hit you in the chest. He feel like my shit hurt. Like does it hurt or is it like just a sensation? Just a sensation. Like laser tag. Yeah, exactly like it, but it'll get bores. Yeah. It's again, they're, they're doing these warehouses now. When you go into a warehouse and it's all virtual reality and so they have everything planned out and like you walk on a cross as beam, there's fire to the left you and fire to the rights. You feel heat. It's all, it's gone now. That's dope. They have it set up to make it, you know, really sort of mimic whatever sensation you're supposed to.

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       No, the guy that I would be, I would be all in for, you know, when I was listening to you coming up, like you started talking about the sensory deprivation chambers and I'm like, that's always been something that's in the back of my head if we want to do it. It's like, do you have any time today? You could do it. Um, I don't know how much time I have after let, let's see. It's it, I know, cause I know it's a mind fuck. It's a little bit of a mind fuck. Yeah. But it's, it's, it's one of those things where I go, when I get a house, I'm getting a grill and I'm getting one of those goddamn Joe Rogan boxes. That's what I call them. Getting one of them Joe Rogan boxes and I'm putting that shit in my fucking man-cave. Everybody should have an isolation tank.

Speaker 3:          00:10:24       It's a, it's a fucking beautiful thing to have man. It just, it settles your mind like nothing else. Yeah. That's, that's the thing that I always struggle with is just too many. I got too many tabs open, of course, at all times. And so is comics too. Yeah. And the only thing that slows me down is video games and puzzles. Puzzles. Yeah. My putting pictures, jigsaw and Sudoku. Ah, does it, like those are the three things that I can do that I know immediately the moment I start the activity, everything closes and I'm just focusing on one thing. That's the only thing I can do when I need to get my mind off of stuff. I was dating this girl one time and get on. You're not, you're in the middle of an argument and so you're trying not to, you're trying not to be a Dick in the moment. So I just start doing the puzzle and just trying to stay calm and then she walks over and just starts undoing the puzzle as I'm doing. Oh my goodness. Oh fuck. Oh my goodness. I'm doing, Oh, the anger

Speaker 4:          00:11:24       sign. That's a sign of someone's intentions. When someone's fun doing your puzzle, like, Oh, you're one of those things.

Speaker 3:          00:11:30       This is my place. This is the one place I can go and just be escalate. Deescalate. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:11:37       Yeah. Well that's bad intentions. Yeah. That's like seriously bad intentions. Someone trying to undo your puzzle. Yeah. That's some shitty kids will fight to the death over that. I'm gonna say the place to start [inaudible] like

Speaker 3:          00:11:47       when we eat smokers say you fucking up. They're high. Right, I understand that now. Yeah, that's, that's the one thing. I'm not with her anymore. No, no, no, no. I crashed that. You can't, I'll, I'll take responsibility on that. We got puzzles. That's my thing. Man. Puzzles and a little bit of video again and bad and cages. I'd love to help Mark Ellison and Craig. That would be amazing. But you need a lot of space. You need like Ellie yard? Yeah, I'm in New York right now. There's nowhere to put a few live in the city. There's no way to fucking, do you like living in the city? No. Why are you there? Cause the daily show, it's gonna work. So that's where the fucking job is. I take the train to Brooklyn. Yeah, I thought about it at first, but then I had a kid the same year I got the show, so I needed to be closer.

Speaker 3:          00:12:31       So we got to Harlem. So Harlem is at least the shorter commute to the studio. How far? Where's the studio studios on West side Hills kitchen on the water. So it's like 53rd 54th street and we're liking the one thirties so no, it's, yeah, it's closer than Brooklyn. Right. Which was where I was originally when I first got to New York. Did you take the subway from Brooklyn? Like yay. I tried to be a city boy. The problem is that I've gotten more done career wise in New York and four years and then I did the eight years I was in LA probably because of the show. Yeah, it's just New York. It's just more, I just, there's more of a hustle mentality. Really. Yeah, I think so. I think that I'm more prone to run into comics that are going, going, going, going, going. And so when you're around that it makes you want to, Glenn makes you want to write, cause you see so-and-so working on a new bit and doing all of that.

Speaker 3:          00:13:22       And I didn't see as much of that in LA. Now granted you don't get to do as many sets in LA because of the logistics of the city. But I just felt like there was more of a go, go, go mentality that just rubs off on you more because of that. You don't get to socialize. Uh, all of my friends are in LA, so a lot of social relationships have suffered because New York is go, go, go and you're trying to get the next career thing done. And then you also got to go home and be a dad. Yeah. That's gotta be weird raising kids in LA or in New York too, rather. Um, I talked to, um, Gaffigan about that. He's raised all his kids in New York city. Yeah. And they're in like Manhattan or they're in Jersey. Where in Manhattan? He's been in Manhattan forever.

Speaker 3:          00:14:02       Yeah, I don't, I don't know if that's something not for the long run. How old your kid is three now. So he's young enough so that it will leave him. Come on back out to LA Roy. Either LA or I would go to Atlanta or the last grade or some shit. That's a good move. Nate BARR gas, he's shown us the recipe. What's he live in? Well, you know, he's, I know he's, I think he's got a place down South in Atlanta. No, in Nashville. Oh no shit. Yeah. Listen, those are both great cities. If you, if you're traveling on the road all the time and you just need a base, you know, and look man, you live, I have a buddy of mine lives outside of Nashville. He fucking takes pictures of his yards. It's all green. I hear birds chirping, shit, you know. Yeah. You knew rateable. You need yard man. I grew up with a yard and you know, so that, and then family and it's just, it's a, I feel like New York is a great place to go, but it's not the best place to start necessarily. Yeah. As a child.

Speaker 2:          00:14:59       But I mean like guys start in LA, people can start anywhere. I mean, it's better starting and it's better start in there than like a place that doesn't have much of a scene. Like maybe Phoenix. Phoenix has like a little bit of a scene.

Speaker 3:          00:15:10       Oh yeah. My first nine years were all Southern. I was a road guy at Alabama. I started in Tallahassee and Birmingham where like those days I can, 98 open mic was once a month per city. Wow. So every week if you wanted to get on, you had to get on the Greyhound and go to another fucking city. That's commitment. So that's the only way. And then we started creating stages, like in the panhandle life from Fort Walton over to Jacksonville. You started meeting? Yeah. You form a little fucking network and this guy's got a Monday night at a shit hole. This guy's got a Tuesday night at another shit hole and looking back on it, it was all trashed age time. That's the best you could do until you move.

Speaker 2:          00:15:47       It is amazing though. How many guys have crafted careers? Just doing that, like the will, the will to do, do time and defined spots and to find place to work out.

Speaker 3:          00:15:58       I wouldn't make the argument that I'm better off now as a comic 20 years in having started on the road instead of starting in a major market. Just because I feel like when you're a road guy you meet every version of what your career could end up being when you're young. Because if you're, if you're San Fran, if you're a big city comic, you only hanging with your peers. You run into the big wigs every now and then, but at some high end Bible shit at the comedy club and then they go on their way. But when you do a weekend with Ron white and you get to watch him properly night after night after night, that's a fucking tutorial and that's a fucking gift. And then you can do what weekend? The very next weekend with a guy who's been doing it 30 years, hadn't written a new joke and 15 burnout, alcoholic hates his kids, hates his wife.

Speaker 3:          00:16:50       And once I got to LA you start seeing, well, no, I know to avoid that because I'll end up like that dude. I know not to do that because I'll end up like that. That was a comic, goddamn, I can't name names. There was a comic that used to, he won custody of his child and the one thing in the court order was that she could not be around the comedy club. So you know what he did if I, William brought her around the comedy club. So as this feature, I watched his seven year old while he would go out and do his set. Oh Jesus. Yeah, but that, that's the last that he was kid because of that. I don't know. I haven't seen him since. Fuck,

Speaker 2:          00:17:30       you can't bring your kids seven year olds. I brought my kids when they were like a nine and seven outside a comedy club and I let them, I let them peek in. It was at the improv in Irvine. And I said, cause we were all down there having dinner together. And I did my show. And uh, they, they were like around the corner. I said, come on,

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       let me take you backstage. I'll show you what it's like. And I, and the show was about to start and I had my daughter like come on, peak out peak out there. And she's like, Oh my God, look at all those people. I would say on stage, I was like, Oh Ron stage. It's like, should I no, don't run on stage. Come back. And that's safe. That's safe. But to have them listen to your shit. Nope.

Speaker 3:          00:18:07       What that taught me was the importance of how important it is who you end up with as it relates to your career. How's it can choke your career. Cause a lot of the guys that I started with, you know, a lot of road guys, they're not doing it anymore or they're doing it at the same level that they were at 98 and a lot of them I can point to dating the wrong person who attacked their psyche and their self esteem in that three, four year window. Cause I feel like every year you get another opportunity to skip a level. Right? Right. And if you don't skip that level, you go back down to levels. And so these guys are trying to go from here to here and you're with someone that's attack. Why are you doing that? You shouldn't be doing that. There was a guy that used to take me on the road with him down South, um, kind of want some mentorship type shit.

Speaker 3:          00:18:56       And we would go do gigs. And if it was within four hours of the city, his wife would roll, his wife would roll. And both kids are in the back seat, car seat age. It's like nine o'clock in Georgia and we're just riding together to a fucking gig. We would do the show and then in exchange for an opportunity for stage time, I would drive this family back home and then I would go home and sleep in my bed. But we didn't spend the night. The family would stay at the hotel while we did the show, and then we would get back in the car and drive the fuck back home. Knowing what I know now, he was fucking chicks on the road.

Speaker 4:          00:19:34       Ah. And the only way she was comfortable with him still doing standup was if she got the role. Interesting. And that's gotta be stressful. He fucked up. He fucked up. But he tried to have both. He tried to say that both he tried to save to career and tried to save the marriage. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:19:51       And I think who you deal with outside the business is as important as how you handle yourself in the business.

Speaker 4:          00:19:57       I understand that her position and that one, I understand that her more than I understand the lady who was undoing your puzzle. I don't understand that. I don't understand that mindset. That's a different mindset. A woman, Alicia solution. That makes sense. Yeah. She's trying to figure out a problem. Well the solutions problem. You still want to do comedy or I'm coming with you. That makes sense. You shouldn't have a three year old in a car seat for eight hours on no Wednesday night. No, no, no. Just cruising the freeway. Yeah. Oof.

Speaker 3:          00:20:23       But if that's the proposition she presents to you in order for you to continue doing your career, then you know, you either got to take it or leave it.

Speaker 4:          00:20:30       Yeah. Comedy is a tricky one man, because in order to do it correctly, you have to do it almost all the time. You gotta be up all the time. I got a good situation where my kids are in bed by like, you know, eight o'clock on a week night and that's when I leave. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       I kiss them goodnight, you know, and uh, I, my spots in the store usually around 10, so, uh, I'll just roll in, you know, I'll hang up my wife for a little bit and then I'll drive into town. It's perfect.

Speaker 3:          00:20:59       But when do you evil sense? Cause that's where I start running into overlap and time is figuring out the execution of comedy versus the preparation to do comedy.

Speaker 2:          00:21:10       Mm. So reviewing the set, watching tapes, well a big one. Yeah. A big one for me is the drive there and home. So it's 35 minutes to the store, 35 minutes home. So that's when I'm reviewing material. I listen to recordings so they have it Bluetooth on my phone. So I do that through the speakers of the, of the car and that helps a lot. That helps a lot. That's gigantic. You know, like uh, it also puts me into mind. I feel like the more sets you do, right, the tidy your standup is, but the more focus you put on your set, like it's almost as good as like a half a set. Like listening to a full set is like a doing a half a set. That's how I think about it. I feel like the same way you found all the extra that you found all the fat to trim.

Speaker 2:          00:21:52       Yeah. You find the fat to trim and you also find like a spark. Like, Oh, why did I say that? Ooh, there might be something there. And then, and then you've got to write that down. And then, and then I spent time just going over scribbles like right here, you know, like straight pride parade, like a little, okay. A little scribbles. You know what I mean? Like, okay, what was I thinking there? Oh, that's right, that's right. It's right there. And then I'll start adding stuff together and then I spend time just straight out writing the straight out writing times. Almost always when everyone's asleep. So like when I come home from the store, it's like midnight or something like that that everyone has to pass time, spark up a joint, fire up the old fucking laptop. And that's when I ride.

Speaker 3:          00:22:31       There's, there's a time, the thing that I struggled with the most in writing is consumption. Um, Chappelle says something years ago in a magazine about how every comedian needs to understand how their joke machine works and identifying the stimuli that you were encountering during the time when you are having a creative high in your, in the writing cycle, when ideas are just popping in, coming to you, document what was happening, what was going on during that time and do your best to recreate those situations and scenarios to inspire writing when you have writer's block. So I know for me it's stuff that bores me or stuff that annoys me, be it reading, magazines, TV, whatever. So I have to find time to watch it that I don't like or can't stand because I know my mind will wander into a place where I can write some stuff but like to physically just sit and consume television and that's what I have to start doing on the go. Like I get it now. Like, I used to think these people were stupid, and now I'm one of those people who walks around staring at the fucking phone, watching my DVR on the train or something because I have to constantly take in so that when it is time to write that there's something that there's something writing there.

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       I had a conversation with Theo Von about this last night where he, uh, he's burnt out and he had a cancel some shows and I said, what's going on? And he said, man, he goes, I just been going too hard, too hard, too much, too many weekends, you know, nine shows a week over and over and over again. Seven, eight, nine, 10 weeks in a row. He goes, I just, I need to stop. He goes, I'm not taking anything in recovery. He goes, everything I'm putting, I'm just putting everything out. He goes, I didn't know. I had nothing to say. Everything seems fake when I'm saying it. Like I feel, I've felt, you know, that, you know, you laugh when you felt that spot where you feel like everything you're saying feels fake. Like you're just bullshitting.

Speaker 3:          00:24:22       Yeah. I, I'm trying to, I'm still working on a lot more stuff that has more teeth to it and I'm starting to become obsessed as in the word, but there's something noodle in at me about veterans and the trajectory of veterans when they come back from war and all of that shit. And I was trying to work on a bit about Vietnam and started watching this Ken burns documentary that's on Netflix right now. And it's like, it's fucking crazy. Like they, they interviewed North Vietnamese soldiers as well. Like I ain't never, ain't never in my life. So you know shit like, cause normally Vietnam is always told from our POV and they're sitting down with just straight out via Carla. Yeah. We was trying to get them motherfuckers, we'd set them up like an remorseful in the sense of speaking about the war from their perspective and going and, and it tells the story from both sides and so it changed, it altered how I want to tell the joke. And that's the stuff that you have to do from time to time to make sure that your jokes aren't weighted to one to one side that's black,

Speaker 2:          00:25:27       but level material, man, if you're gonna make some jokes about war and Vietnam and soldiers and soldiers returning, you're just, you're, you're entering into the trickiest of balancing beams. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:25:37       That's where the reward, that's that Gabby Douglas, double, triple, whatever. I'm sorry, some of them Biles. Pardon me, Simone Biles, and yet she did, what did she do? I don't know. Something they'll make illegal and competition next year because black women did. And you're like, no, don't do that shit no more bitch. It's like when Syria Bonelli was figure skating and she did a back flip on the ice and they were like, yeah, no more. Backflips they said, no more back. Yeah. They were like, you know, yeah, there's French chick did a back flip and immediately the ILC was like, no more backflips it was too amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:26:12       Wow. Maybe they're worried about like those BMX dudes, BMX dudes and they started doing double flips and they started doing flip, triple flips. A bunch of them started crashing and breaking their necks.

Speaker 3:          00:26:23       Oh, that fucking snowboard shit. That's insane. Yeah. Snowboard freestyle.

Speaker 2:          00:26:30       You're stuck on that thing too. It's not like skis where your legs move.

Speaker 3:          00:26:34       That one in the snowmobile where they're coming over the handlebars of the snowmobile and coming back down. I'm like, no man, no

Speaker 2:          00:26:41       anything with BMX or

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       motocross or any of those crazy white dudes that are doing flips. It's all just how many flips can you do landing on your front tire and the Rex man, I spent an hour one night just watching Rex, just watching guys try to do flips and land wrong. It's like picturing nerves getting ruined for life. Spinal cord injury, compound fractures. There's a birth of big air 30 for 30 where he'd talk about when he started this shit in the 80s in Oklahoma and it would just doing it for the love, like there's just a dude with a ramp in his yard and just work traveled. No email, no nothing. Just word of mouth does a dude with a ramp. So when we're in town to do that race, we're going to go over to this dude yard do for that ward. Dangerous shit. You gotta be like a trapeze guy.

Speaker 4:          00:27:32       Like before there was motorcross and bikes and shit. What did you do? Like if you are a crazy person, you gotta be a trapeze guy. Yeah, we'll real options. You have winning with skateboarding. Skateboarding wasn't really, they weren't thrashing like that in the 80s you know, they were just rolling around like assholes. Like we're on a sidewalk, move it pedestrian. The crazy shit they did is get in a pool. We're in a bottom of a pool. This is nuts man. We're on the edge. The shit they do not like kids like in general athletics wise, like the stuff they're doing now. Like you see it and in jujitsu and an MMA, the kids that are coming up now, they're though they're so advanced in there, they're all doing flying triangles and flying armbars on each other. It's like God damn like humans are evolving. So I came up playing baseball.

Speaker 4:          00:28:15       Is there, are there certain maneuver like in baseball before you turn like 15, I think they try to limit you throwing breaking balls. Mm. Cause it'll fuck with ya. Um, elbow Tommy, John and all that shit. Right? So are there MMA moves where you just as a child, you just, you're not allowed to do this yet. You have to be your grown man leg locks. As a beginner, they generally try to get you to stay the fuck away from leg locks cause leg locks. I don't know if you're familiar like heel hooks. There's, there's techniques that you do that are going against the edge of your knee. So like, here's your knee, your knee bends like this, right? They're going against it this way, trying to bend or back that way. And it just, you're, there's not much give in your knees, man. And so when you get a heel hook, it's like your leg, your leg is like in front of like wrapped around a guy and they've got their heel trap like this and they're pulling on your knees sideways and your knee just gets ripped apart.

Speaker 4:          00:29:11       And it happens. It's very, very common that guys get knee injuries from being overzealous and uh, not, not, not like giving a guy a chance to get out of a technique. There's a heel hook right there. I see that guy screaming at his fucking face, bro. I'm telling you it is some fucking horrific pain. You get your [inaudible] tear it apart, your fucking ligaments pop. You know, it's, it's a terrible, terrible feeling. And there's not much room for like in an arm bar does like your arm is locked out. You can kind of take it a little bit before you have to tap. But with your knee, the moment you feel pain, it's too late. Your for, yeah, look at that right there. Whoo. Look how bad it is. Ripped apart. That's Dean Lister, Dean Lister's up fucking gorilla. That dude on the bottom. He's like one of the leg lock pioneers in jujitsu. He's fucked up many dudes. Future walking. I'll say this about MMA. It's definitely leveled bar fights. Oh yeah, a little bit more now. I've seen some scrawny guys like really fuck a big dude that know what they're doing. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:30:15       Like at five and you'd just see the D and it's funny because there's all the shit talking before the fight and then the fight starts. And then of course the big dude is like tapping and does the scrawny do to still go on. I'm like, dude, there's no riff. You're, you're at a bar. Like this isn't, you don't get to tap out. You get your shit

Speaker 4:          00:30:34       broken. Yeah. There's a lot of people that get in fights, don't know what they're doing. It's strange. It's like, imagine if you challenged the guy to a basketball game. You've never played basketball. We were ridiculous. Like, I know how to do it. I've watched it on TV, but there's a lot of people that do that with fights, but the consequences of a fight are way more grave than the consequences of a basketball game. Somebody kicks your ass in basketball. You just look like a fool. Somebody kicks your ass in a fight. You're you, you getting fucked up. Maybe permanently. Maybe your face is gonna be scarred up for life and ain't no fighter man. I'm Oh one in one lifetime. Oh one and one one draw. What happened with the draw teacher show

Speaker 3:          00:31:08       and got in a fight and got in a fight in the eighth grade at a stop. The violence rally. No, that's real shit cause I figured that'd be the best place to talk. Shit. What's, what's a better spot? Talk your shit than at a stop the violence rally because presumably someone will come in and go, Hey man, right, let's not do we brothers and our Mario Brown slept the shit out of me. Mario Brown. Where are you at Mario? Mario Brown is uh, air force retired. We'll still, we're cool. We'll pull it to this day now. But on that day he slipped. It dug shit out of me in the gym in front of everybody. That's the worst. And you take your ill in front of everybody.

Speaker 4:          00:31:54       Ooh, that's a hard one. That's a hard L thought I was going to get off on that one wrong. You know, I didn't know how to fight at all until I learned how to fight. I was terrified of fights and never, never, never was. Never was the guy who like, I was just trying to get away from everybody cause I grew up in different places. We moved around a lot when I was a kid, so I didn't grow up like with a bunch of friends where everybody knew everybody. It's like I was always the new kid so, so you always had to always, always. And so then when I was 14, I was like, all right, fuck this. I moved to a new city, new town. And I was like, I gotta learn how to fight. And so I take, started taking martial arts. I just became obsessed with it. Do you teach your kids? Yeah. Yeah. I teach them, but they're not into it anymore. They uh, they were into it for a little while,

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       but they, they like doing other stuff. Mostly gymnastics and shit.

Speaker 3:          00:32:43       But do you, are you teaching them, did you think to it? Cause I'm trying to say it with my son. You know how to approach self-defense. How he's three, he's three. I noticed that early. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:32:54       But it's not, it's, it's not a bad thing to get it to be a part of his body when he's really [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:32:58       black daughter started when she was five. But the question becomes about teaching proper conflict resolution. Cause I also, I'm wired a little weird in the sense that I feel like because he's a black kid, he's not going to get judged the same if he throws the first punch. So I don't want them in a position where he might get expelled or some shit, you know? Right. But if you've got to get him out the fuck off, you gone on bend that knee sideways. You got to guess.

Speaker 2:          00:33:24       Well that's the beautiful thing about kids learning jujitsu too is that also the really used to conflict because you have conflict in the gym all the time. Not conflict in a negative way, but when you're sparring, you know you slap hands and you just do it and you go full blast. You try to get each other as hard as you can and you can do that in jujitsu cause you're not hitting each other. You just choking each other and getting an arm bars and then when some gets you you just tap and then you move on to the next thing. And the, the thing about doing that is then you're not worried about conflict. It doesn't seem as scary to you. Like for me, until I started learning martial arts, I was fucking terrified of everybody. I thought everybody was going to kick my ass. Like fuck. I was like every, I'd seen some do that bullied me and like Schiff and I'd go around the whole opposite way of school. I'd walk the total way around the school to get to the

Speaker 3:          00:34:10       ah bro, how much longer was that? 15 extra minutes. I didn't care. I have to walk 20 extra minutes home if I didn't want to cut through the South park projects cause there was this dude Spencer that was always every week for sure. Go on, give me the damn business. Those people would ruin your lives every week. Like they would sit on the porch and watch me walk in the corner store and then would come and take my fucking now ladies and laughing and mind you, I've set aside lunch on my, I ate less at lunch so I can eat candy and chips on the way home and they were snatched that shit right out. My only thing you say me growing up, I had an ad, a good ass basketball goal. So all the gang bangers in the neighborhood would come to our yard to shoot ball.

Speaker 3:          00:34:53       So I essentially learned every, every terrible person in my neighborhood, shot ball at my house. So you can't fuck with me because then you won't be able to shoot ball. Oh that's nice. So I don't know if my mom did that by design. I know she did it to keep me from going up to Powderly park to shoot ball where, you know, that's why the bullshit would go down. But all the bullshit came to her house. But out of respect to my mom and my dad, like they never started shit and I just walk around the neighborhood perfectly fine. Now at school I can still get fucked with, but on the walk home it was gravy. That's very nice. Once she got the basketball that was good.

Speaker 2:          00:35:28       That's very nice. Yeah, it's hard. A kid who's really mean who's like bullying you in high school and and junior high school and that could fuck whole lives up. Sometimes people never recover from that shit. You know, it's a natural inclination that people have to fuck with someone who's scared and weak to just you see it in animals man. You see in dog.

Speaker 3:          00:35:47       Yeah we are animals. That's what we forget. We get like clothes and automobiles of civilizes. No it still, I'm trying to take your woman and reproduce and I'm trying to, if I can spread my genes and I'm going to take your food. Like that's the basic of bullying is that

Speaker 2:          00:36:04       [inaudible] yeah, it's nature and it forces you to overcome. Cause almost every fighter that have ever met professional fighter was fucked with George Saint Pierre, who's like one of the greatest of all time, told the story on the podcast about, he was a driving his range Rover when he was world champion through Montreal and he saw this homeless guy and the homeless guy was his bully in high school and he realized, he was like, Whoa. And he's like, what's going on man? What are you doing? And like talk to the guy and try to make amends with the guy and help him out a little bit. But it's like fuck man, this is his bully in high school. And he realized like most people that are causing pain and inflicting pain on people, they're in pain, man. That's why they're doing it. You know, it's like victims, you know the victims of crimes often times perpetrate those crimes on other people that that happens.

Speaker 2:          00:36:55       Kids get abused at home, they get beaten at home. They're the ones who want to beaten kids up at school. You know, they're just, they want to dish out that violence on someone smaller than them cause they're getting a dished out on them by someone's larger. Yeah, man. I mean that's, that's the constant victim narrative. But on the other hand, families of people that grow up that are martial artists, like, like all the kids know how to fight. They're the nicest, friendliest people. They don't worry about it. It's not the thing that fucks with their head. Like for me, I knew I didn't know how to fight. So it was scary. So like every time someone would fuck with me, I'd be like, Oh, got to get away. I can't fight. I don't know what I'm doing. Some dude got me in a headlock and threw me down on the ground and was gonna punch me in the face.

Speaker 2:          00:37:35       I'll never forget this. Like, I forget what was happening. We were talk. We, like I said something, he said something stupid to me. I said something stupid back to him. Then he just got me in a headlock and threw me on the ground and he helped me like that. He was gonna punch you. I was like, nah man, I ain't gonna bother. I'm just sitting there going God damn, I'm helpless. Locked up in a headlock with this dude on top of me going fuck. And the only is the only his mercy that he didn't punch my fucking face in or he didn't want to get suspended or whatever and I remember going that's it. I'm going to learn how to fight. This is ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          00:38:04       Do you, do you ever run into the people from your past who have a revision as history on y'alls relationship and they

Speaker 2:          00:38:11       not too much cause the only people that I'm friends with from back then I'm actually good friends with and I was friends with when I was growing up like a couple of buddies. But most people I don't,

Speaker 3:          00:38:20       well most of the dates they never bought a ticket to your show and came up to them?

Speaker 2:          00:38:23       No, by the time about a time I was in high school that's, that's the only people that are still I am in contact with anymore. I had already gotten balls deep in martial arts like my first year of high school. So by like into high school, I was already crazy. I was already competing and traveling all over the place and so it was, but I do run into people that fake stories. I run into people that tell me things that hat, remember that time we were at a party, you kicked out dude in the hand. I'm like, dude, I never kicked anybody. Never happened. The dead a hundred percent definitely never happened. I never went to a party and beat anybody's ass.

Speaker 3:          00:38:55       Never have him with that memory or do you correct them? Correct.

Speaker 2:          00:38:58       Dumb. I'm like, I never fought anybody. Some dude was telling me some story about some guy told him that one time we were on the street and some guys across the street were talking shit. And I went across the street and kicked both of them in the head and like that never happened. Never happened. I'm a guarantee you it never happened. Cause the last time I was in a street fight, I was like 15 I'm like this,

Speaker 3:          00:39:17       it never happened. This is not a true story. See, I'm the opposite man. People come to me with shit that I don't remember. I just let them have it. If that's your memory of us in college, fine. Whatever. Weird though. Right? When you know

Speaker 2:          00:39:32       when you definitely know. Like I know for a fact, I was never in any street fights outside of high school.

Speaker 3:          00:39:37       I had a professor from college accused me in a fake, this was a Facebook thread of some article about me and like all the other alumni commenting on it. And one of the professors I remember in 1994 when you said this thing to me in class and stormed out of class, I'm like, I didn't enroll until 96 but I didn't say that. I just, I literally just apologize like, because she's clearly been mad at me all of this time about something that I didn't even do. And I'm just like, there's nothing I can say this. That's your narrative. Fine. You know what? I'm sorry for the shit that I didn't do. Whatever. Roy would all peaceful. But yeah. But then she replies on her that, well, thank you. It means a lot. And then so in my weird arrogant brain, I've freed her of her anger or whatever the fuck it is.

Speaker 3:          00:40:27       She thought I did, but I didn't do it. That's a great approach. I just don't feel like going back and forth. That's a great approach. It's so much easier to evade. I'm more of an Aveda and a schemer than a fighter. I'm not gonna argue with you and go back and forth, but what I will try and figure out a way to do is over the next two years, diabolically dismantling anything you stand for and believe in. Like that's, that's my approach to things. Like there's a comedy club owner. God is my witness before I die, I'm opening a comedy club across the street. This is a NIGO. No, I've heard the stories. Where's this one? Uh, can you not tell? It's easy. It's one of the Carolinas. Well, we'll, you know, [inaudible] the internet.

Speaker 2:          00:41:19       We have such a complicated relationship with them because we need them and we don't want to do it. I don't want to fucking run a goddamn comedy club, but we need one. You know, to have some guys dealing with a bunch of maniacs like us, day in, day out, every week coming in and telling jokes and getting drunk smoking weed in the green room and all the chaos that comes to the art form. Yeah. We need this

Speaker 3:          00:41:38       to the comedy club as essential. 100% you ever get scared that the young people don't really go to the clubs? Don't really fuck with clubs. Yes, yes I do. It's going to change the business model like in the next decade.

Speaker 2:          00:41:50       Well, one of the beautiful things about comedy clubs though is that we all use them. Like even if you're doing arenas, like you use comedy clubs, you use comedy clubs to exercise. Like Chappelle comes in all the time. Does the belly room, that's a 70 seat room that dude just strolls on in. It'd be half-full. Yep. And he'll do 40 fucking minutes. And that is so critical, man. It's so, it's so important to get that work in.

Speaker 3:          00:42:14       That's why I don't like when a lot of the vets attack the, as they call them Instagram comedians or the vine or not vine anymore, but [inaudible] what the fuck? Yeah, they get mad at them because the club will book them and they'll go, well the live shit was trash and it's terrible. And it's true for most of them it's not the greatest performance cause they haven't had the chop shit, but they sold 300 paid tickets and everybody ate and drank. What do you think is keeping the lights on for your 30% selling capacity as

Speaker 2:          00:42:54       to come

Speaker 3:          00:42:54       back in next year and then next year to go from 30% sold to 40% sold. They're not making no money off of you, but if these IgE comedians can come in and at least help keep the lights on, I think in the greater integrator scheme of comedy, there's more good than bad that comes from that. And I also feel like there's, there's a, there's a level of ignoring the tools that they've been able to use to get an audience in lieu of the fact that they don't put new standup on TV anymore and lets it's contest shit. Comedy central just started with the, the lab at the cellar shit. But other than that, I mean it hasn't been a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:43:29       Well no one's even watching TV anymore. I mean, the numbers on regular TV programs are so low now. Like if you're doing a set on Conan, like what is, what did we win over this? Right. Like the numbers are like less than 400,000 people watch it a night.

Speaker 3:          00:43:44       Yeah. That's a lot. That might be live plus three yeah. On top of that, I might not even be just live. They might be live plus DVR over the [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:43:50       Yeah. It's crazy. So no one's watching anything anymore. If you can get onto a stage, the way I feel about Instagram comedians or YouTube comedians is if you're doing standup, you're a comic. You might be a shitty comic and you might've be a famous shitty comic because you're famous from vine or whatever the fuck it is, but who's your comic like it's whether or not you decide to become a real comic and actually do the work and put in the time and then one day be, look, I hope that we see these YouTube comics and they're fucking terrible and then you go to see them seven, eight years later and they're murdering their crushing. Great timing, great premises. I'm like, we got one, we got one. We need more. This is a hard gig. Think about what you had to do when you were starting. Think about you traveling around, all those fucking things. Getting on a bus to do open mics. They had an open Mike once a month. That takes a kind of grit and resolve that. Most people don't.

Speaker 3:          00:44:43       This shit is like hazing where the O heads feel like, well they didn't suffer the way I suffer. Therefore your success is invalid. I don't take that cause you didn't do it the way I did it. This is the only way to do it. The game evolves that the points of access, it's like, it's like comedy is like, to me it's like a fucking grocery store and you've been in line, you've been in this checkout line and then a new checkout line opens and then all these fuckers just cruise through that checkout and you're still stuck in the same waiting to get a tonight show set line and the Instagram line opens and people just start whisking through to success and you don't know whether or not to change lines or stay in this one.

Speaker 2:          00:45:23       You build. The beautiful thing about comedy is you don't have to get out of the line. He just opened up a new line, open up an Instagram line, open up a YouTube line. You can do all those,

Speaker 3:          00:45:31       but they ain't been waiting in line as long as me. So why did they get to leave the store? You know you have that jealousy, that little piece of jealousy when someone has not been in line. As long as you leave the grocery store before you, that's comedy now.

Speaker 2:          00:45:42       It is, but it's wasted energy. You can't think about that. You can't, like, you should think about that the same way you think about someone having success in some field that has nothing to do with yours. Like if someone who is a Nobel prize winning scientists like fuck, I could have done that, but you didn't. It's really the same thing. It's just, yeah, it has nothing to do. But some people are like that. Some people see someone with like a startup, some internet startup and it makes $1 billion and they get angry. They get angry because no, go, go fucking do something. Don't worry about what other people are doing. It's a giant waste of your energy.

Speaker 3:          00:46:15       Yo, I read a book, um, rebel without a crew. Think it's um, I think rich Rodriguez, I think his thing is his name. And he was a film maker and he made the, I can't remember the name of the movie, but it was the prequel to what became Desperado. Oh, rather target Rodriguez. Yes. Yeah. And you talked about just shooting that shit gorilla and for essentially pennies less than $10,000 shot a whole last film and walks through how we cut the corners and you think of how to shot paranormal activity for like $55,000 50 or $60,000. The first paranormal activity was dirt cheap. They shot the first saw $4 million in 30 days in one building. Whoa. Every and every scene in the car did just shaken the fucking camera and jump cutting billion dollar franchise getting rebooted now like that. Like when I see shit like that, I don't get jealous. I go, well fuck. I need to go and fucking gorilla some shit together and learn. So that's why I started trying to learn like in video editing, audio editing and all that shit, man.

Speaker 2:          00:47:21       Yeah, no, it was inspiring. I love one, when I walked in the green when I saw you fucking with that software. I love when people are hustling when they're doing things like that. New things. And you're like, you know what? Fuck this final cut pro shit. I'm going to learn Adobe premier. They keep fucking with me. Make me buy a new version every year. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:47:38       yup. Now to be fair, Adobe makes you rent the shit, but I think there's a way to, yeah, does that too now with like Whoa, office whole office suite $80 a year. There's so many credit access to it. Just crux, crux. And then you can't use the old version of office with the new, and if I send you a file that's like office Oh three, you can't open it with the new off like opens as a text file with no form. Like they do it to fuck you

Speaker 2:          00:48:05       barely use office. I use it, I have it, but I write with right room for the most part. Do you know what that is? Is that script software? It's no, it's um, it's a software that turns your whole screen black and then turns the text green and you can't access your browser. You can't do nothing. You just have green software. Have you ever seen it? No. You write down, Oh, ms dos coding type action. Yeah. On, uh, on my windows computer, I use a [inaudible]. I use a program called Scrivener. I do most of my writing on that and there is a distraction free option there. That's what it looks like. That's what it looks like. Matrix. Yes. I write like I'm in the matrix. That's how I write when I'm on my, my Mac because I think they have a version of that that they don't.

Speaker 2:          00:48:47       They have a version of that for windows. I think they do, but I've never really installed it. I just use a, yeah, I need to, yeah. It just says Macco S it doesn't say anything about windows. I heard a story that they wrote the first independence day movie in three days in a hotel room. Make sense? So let's do it. Just focusing in like that type of shit, which has helped me focus. You got a lot of coffee or some Adderall or something like that. You dumb action movie. Three days easy. You can go crazy now. This is a gorilla style shit man is. That's how this podcast gets started. This park, this podcast reaches some stupendous number of people every month and it started out with a laptop in my living room cause I was bored. Me and my friend Brian because uh, I had just gotten back from Colorado and I'm, I was like, yeah, I can't believe I'm back in LA. This is fucking terrible. I'm like, wow, let me do something. And so I just started doing like Q and A's on the like a like a laptop talking to people on Ustream. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:49:49       That's the one thing I wish I could have back. I wish I had taken YouTube more seriously. You take it right now though? I do now, but not in 2005 when it first came out to content. Just start rolling out the same thing you were complaining about before. No, I'm just, it's the wish that I had done something. That's what your career is, is that man, if I hadn't done this sooner and done two things, I would've done sooner. I'd taken the internet more seriously and I would have taken some more as advice and not gotten on TV for 10 years. I don't think any, I don't think any comic can do it though. I think it is impossible to be a working comic and stay off of if you stayed off of television for 10, if you started your career and just never did shit, no festivals, just crush, crush, crush, crush. You become fucking legend that by the time you finally decide, you look at college quarterback that just stays in college for years and years and years and never interested the draft. And by the time you do, then everything is stratosphere. But there's too much money is too many offers.

Speaker 4:          00:50:51       Well, you know who did that? Joey D is, Joey Diaz didn't do any standup comedy on TV until like 1520 years in [inaudible]. He was crushing. But Joey also I think is from a different cloth. We are, he wasn't seeking that out either. He was, well, he was seeking it out. They were scared of him. You know, he was talking about eating ass and taking in the muffler and all this chaos and going to the Buffalo tick. Yeah. He talks crazy. But I think I have a different perspective. I think, um, there's a, I have a bunch of old sets for me. When I was living, uh, I was on TV, I was doing comedy like five years, four years. They're terrible. Yeah. But the good thing about it is they exist and it's lets you see like, look, this was in the beginning I was talking terrible. But just keep going. You just keep working at it, keep working on it. You get better. You know, like I'm not under any illusion that I didn't use to suck. I tried to talk about it as much as possible. I was terrible when I first started it. You're okay with that being out there. Don't give a fuck

Speaker 3:          00:51:49       dude. I've been digging in the crates. I've been digitizing a lot of my old VHS shit trying to, you know, just for posterity and going through some of my old fucking TVs. They're all terrible. Like the Letterman set is probably the only thing. The Letterman and Def jam said and Oh six those are the only two that I'd still to this day, I still stamp the sat, those jobs, everything before that premium blend star search. Last comic standing Apollo comic view, all of it. I'm like, Barry, that shit. My biggest fear is becoming famous. Whatever the fuck that is. And then B T just rolling out some sort of, remember when fucking thread. Oh, just you load of black comics. They used to suck 20 years ago and just going, no,

Speaker 4:          00:52:37       but that's who you were. That's, that's part of the process. Yeah. I liked, I liked the process. I don't care. I'm fine with it. The problem is that the gatekeepers that decide stuff, they only want the newest shiny thing. So if they see you too soon, you're new to rescue problem Roy. That's the only problem. You don't need those fucks. You don't need gatekeepers. Internet. The internet has no gatekeepers. You have people that have podcasts that get you on their podcasts. You do your own podcast, you would put out a lot of content. No gatekeepers.

Speaker 3:          00:53:05       I'm with is that, it takes comics discovering it because the problem is a young comic is that you inherit the goals of your predecessors. So as a young comic, especially as a road comment, every road comic is trying to get on TV. So they make you believe TV is where you need to be going. Don't fuck up the YouTube shit. Little n***a tell you right now, you got to get on, goddamn, let them, and you get on Letterman and then you get to show I got on Letterman and is not a knock on Letterman and it's worth as it credit, but the worth of the late night credit in 2006 versus 1996 it's not the same currency. No, there was a deflation in the currency, so it got me more rooms. It got me more money, but there was no Ray Romano fucking here's your career, choose your career, here's your Kevin J like, yeah, it doesn't work like that, but the only, but you're chasing what somebody else wanted and the game is always moving.

Speaker 3:          00:54:00       The school of fish are always, so you have to be ahead of that curve and it's just didn't listen to the instincts. Yeah. It's hard to see where it's going though. If the people from your PR, your predecessors, the the guys who were successful and you were coming up where they were headlining and you were middling for them, that that was the goal. The goal was the tonight show. The goal was yet, but I don't think is that hard to see the future. Not necessarily see the future, but see the trends of where people, what people are paying attention to. I'm quicker to read fast company than I am a variety or Hollywood reporter because we're tech goes, that's where people going. But people go, they want to laugh. So you figure out a way with that to integrate laughter into whatever the new tech or the new hat, like this tick-tock, shit, whatever this, this, that that is, I've seen it but I don't know what it is.

Speaker 3:          00:54:45       A better fucking figure it out. Cause that's the next one. Is it then? That's the one you brought up to you. We should, maybe we should do a ticktock account. I don't know that you'll like it. It's music. It's musical vine in a way. Like it's, it's music sketches, but it's still funny. It's entertaining. So Thompson girl does it like all the time he's into it. That's okay. He's like ironically doing it. But yeah, but he does some fun shit. He does some funny shit. It's self aware that he's a guy that shouldn't be on tick-tock. So his existence on tick tock is what makes it funny and makes it, he knows how to do that shit, but he's ahead of me. He's a hit. He's ahead of that curve. So the other thing that then compounded gas like me from my generation is that Dane cook was one of the first that was like, all right, fuck TV, what's over here? And so many people shitted on Dane. Out of jealousy that you ignored the fact that his mass space move was some fucking Bosch shit. It was. It was huge. It was huge for everybody. I remember I read people magazine, there was an article about how he had like 200,000 or 300,000 MySpace friends.

Speaker 3:          00:55:51       That's crazy. I remember thinking that is crazy. How does he have so many friends? Yeah. But he was using that and talking to people online constantly and rather look at him and see how he did it. You stand in your checkout lane and go fuck him. He got out of the store before me. Um, well I, I shifted and I started promoting on it. I didn't, I'm just saying a lot of comics like me just didn't you lean on what you're told because you look at older comics as mentors instead of realizing that maybe they don't have this shit figured out either and you should be trusting your instincts. He was the first guy, right? He was the first to really make it through the internet on the digital side. Yeah, 100% yeah, I'd say that. I can't think of anybody performed cause I can't think of anything before that other than Yahoo chat rooms. No, he was the first guy. He was the first guy on the first guy for sure. That became famous from my space. My space was like the first platform of that social network and shit. His album sold like 2 million copies or something crazy like retaliation. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:56:48       That's why if you stop and think about how nuts that is today, like today, a big artists like if M and M puts out an album, how many does he sell?

Speaker 3:          00:56:57       I'd say 401st week. Maybe three to 401st. Well, let's give it a year. Depending on what week you release right now, you could be number one with like 30 [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:57:08       thousand sales. Whoa. Yeah. 40 50,000 sales boy. They just gutted that record business, didn't they? That is crazy. What happened with the internet? The internet took out porn and took out music by the knees. I used to have a fucking neighbor. He lived right down the street like two houses down from me. This crazy porn dude. I used to do jujitsu with them too. It's all steroid up and maniac wild eyes too. It was just crazy. Just Coke. Yes, Coke and steroids and he was just fucking up a storm. Constantly pulling. It was like past his house and he's always had these fat Mercedes parked in his driveway and [inaudible] hot girls in their underwear walking around was hilarious. Let's do as a maniac. But then they, the internet came around the internet just gutted his business, just gut it and they repossessed his house. I'll never forget man, his fucking house got repossessed and I remember seeing it in the, like the real estate section. I was like, fuck man, dude lost his house. He was, he had a fat fucking Rolex with diamonds all over it.

Speaker 3:          00:58:09       Pouring got really fucked over. But you and you want to talk about the people selecting what they want to see. That's what's, what's a bigger focus group than people who want to fucking Jack off and they've decided I would rather see somebody in the hood in their house with no lighting and just terrible fucking camera work. And that's as interesting what it was. It is that porn became free and they just used ad clicks and they would just pirate everyone's porn. Say if you were a porn producer and you were making a bunch of porn, they would just take your point and put it on like whatever website and then you would have to get a lawyer to try to take it down. Yeah, it was like some lime wire to the 80th pallor. It was like way worse than the entire business. But you don't think the free side or like the amateur porn? Oh yes. Part of it too. I mean that's a bigger now, but in the beginning, yes, it was just pouring clips, getting shopped up and nobody paying a $40 for a five hour DVD. You know what I notice? Not that know. I was doing research recently. You know what I noticed? There's a lot of like stepmother porn. It's a lot of like a step mom, horny step-mom porn or step-sister [inaudible]. It's all like taboo stuff. It's all was also a lot of getting caught porn. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. Like the, the wife walks

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       in, you're in the middle of get your Dick.

Speaker 3:          00:59:23       Yeah. And it cuts right there when she walks in. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of that. I did a, we did a story on racism in porn for daily show. And so we were shooting up in Chatsworth for whatever. And what I did, and I learned so much about the porn industry in that I didn't know that, like they would just have a fuck house where it's like an eight bedroom house and every bedroom is, it's individual studio set up for whatever genre of porn. It was like at least five different genres of porn being shot in that house. And we're out in the, and, and I, and mind you, I still have this image that if you're a porn star and you're working with a porn studio, there's some Brit, there's got to be little bit of money. And one of the, um, porn stars was, is it actress?

Speaker 3:          01:00:09       What's the fucking word now? Porn actress. Yeah. So one of the actresses, her car is blocking someone. So I'd go out, just give me a keys, I'll move your car in this car. I had to be the most at the sad is fucking like to the point where I'm like, if this is what fucking on camera gets you, there's gotta be something else out there and you want to talk about people that need to see where the curve is. I think if you're a woman and you're cool but doing porn, you're probably better off just doing it on some self-starting shit than even dealing with any of these LA crooks in the first place.

Speaker 2:          01:00:41       Yeah. If you could figure out a way to get an audience, I know there's a lot of dudes who, uh, they, they run these companies that girls use where they just, uh, people pay to see their videos. Like, like someone will ask you like, uh, like if you're a, a porn actress, they'll say, Hey, I want you to use this dildo and cover your tits whip cream and I'll give you 150 bucks. And then,

Speaker 3:          01:01:04       Oh, some live stream private Skype protection.

Speaker 2:          01:01:07       Yeah. They make their money doing that and they'll do that like all day long and rake in thousands of dollars.

Speaker 3:          01:01:12       Yeah. Just like the food videos where you sit but neck and eat some food and you go on like a virtual date with the person. Yeah, I think its butt naked foodie sometimes naked. Sometimes not. And like you haven't seen a lot of that in Asia. Yeah. A woman's just looking straight at the camera. So anyway, today I remember I'm young, I'm talked to her. That's up to you. Back to her. It's sometimes it's just a straight video and you don't get to interact with it because there's multiple people watching the feet concurrently or if you want to pay a little extra. Yeah. One-on-one. I will sit here and pretend to be on a date with you and we can just, and it's just, that's more feeding loneliness and some sort of erotic desire, but there's not a lot of money in it. No Khalifa was talking about this shit a couple of weeks ago.

Speaker 3:          01:01:55       What was she doing? She says she only got like 12 K for the year. She only did porn for like a week, right? Didn't, she deals like a year or something like that, but whatever it was, it should've been more than 12 K so let's all she deserves. What I'm saying is I didn't see the points. I don't know whether or not it should have been 12 ketchup. She put in a solid effort. Less kidding. If you're someone that wants to do porn, you are coming off better just setting up your webcam. Like Joe Rogan day one podcast, you and Brian would have a laptop and a microphone and just turn into a web cam on and just doing whatever the fuck you want to do with yourself. Then dealing with the industry and the record industry is becoming similar to that too.

Speaker 4:          01:02:37       I think so too. But I think that it's hard for them to find an audience that way. There's so much porn. Like I got a joke I was doing for awhile about why are they making new porn? Like who is jerked off to all of it. Yeah. There's no way anyone has seen it all, but yet they keep making new porn. It's like, it's crazy. Like there no demand. Like there's, there's no demand for new stuff. There's plenty. Like you would have to be some kind of crazy creep to the scene. Every porn that I've ever is ever existed, but it's no different than MMA. This people innovate, people innovate and in porn back flipping and POV in the same areas, breaking their necks. Yeah. It's the, I think the, the cam thing is the big thing. Girls fuck on camera. You know, they'll, they'll have the boyfriend come over and they'll fuck them and suck his Dick on camera and you pay to watch. And I think that's, that's the big thing. And they do private shows and like the guy could tell, you know, you could tell the girl, Hey, I want you to do this to him. And they'll do it on camera. You notice training.

Speaker 3:          01:03:37       You know the funniest shit though. So Steve burn and I, um, we were in Pittsburgh and three things lead to another and we ended up at a strip club and it's a weekend. And so apparently I didn't know this, but porn stars tour strip clubs and they'll go to a strip club on the weekend and dance and sale, whatever pocket pussy or whatever vagina mole they have and all of the strippers fucking, you know like some of the shippers a cool cause. Oh they bring more people into the club. But for the most part the man are saving that tip money to tip the porn star that they came to see. So it's like being a seasoned comic and then the Instagram comment comes in who's never stripped before. Like yeah you fuck on camera but it's not stripping what I do as an art. What you do is slightly behaved cause you not like there's like a beef between like strippers and prostitutes.

Speaker 3:          01:04:36       Cause like some strip is a second fucking in the back of the club and it fucks up money for the rest of the strippers that are, that are playing the game straight up. Right. So it was this weird tension in the strip club bow. The porn star was on stage and I could not stop laughing because it was comedy. And that's part of why like stripping to me is performative. It's in a weird way, it's comedy and strip and it's damaged people, entertaining strangers. So there's more of a synergy. So I don't really get anything out of watching the stripper cause in the back of my head, I know you're thinking about groceries and some other shit, but it was hilarious as a comic to watch two different, same different types of before. It's like the magician versus the standup versus the juggler and how they all kind of don't really like one another for one reason or another because they all think what they do is superlative to the other gas craft. And it was, it was God damn it was fucking hell there.

Speaker 2:          01:05:34       That is an inside scene that only strippers can really appreciate what you're talking about. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like for them, they're like, yes, those bitches real than it coming over here. Bunch of fucking whores.

Speaker 3:          01:05:47       There's, um, there's a couple of strip clubs that I used to go to and Birmingham where like, you know, the club would close it too and the police would leave. And then at three the club, it reopened and then it was open season and is whatever you want to do. And then you would see strippers in the parking lot yelling at the other strippers who were choosing to stay for the 3:00 AM session saying that y'all are messing it up. And that's why nobody comes before two is because of what you're doing. And so it's just a,

Speaker 2:          01:06:16       so at three it became like a brothel. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. That's insane. Isn't it hilarious that you could fuck anybody you want for free and there's not a law about it. But as soon as money gets exchanged, you're a criminal and everybody's mad at you. If you're just a slut, no one. But if you want to fuck people from money, that becomes a real problem for people because people desire sex so much and there's so many guys that can not get laid, but they've got some money and if they find out they can pay for it, like people are like, no, you can't. You can't pay for it. You could pay for everything. Everything that's legal. Everything else that's legal you could pay for except sex. You could pay to have someone cook for you. You could pay to have someone rub your back. You could pay to have someone cut your hair.

Speaker 2:          01:07:01       You could pay to have someone mow your lawn. You could pay to have someone take out your trash. You could pay to have someone clean your house. All things you don't want to do. You can't pay for someone to suck your Dick. You can't that someone could do it for free. If they like you, there's no problems. It's very strange or an exchange for college tuition. You can't even do that if you made like a deal, like you suck my Dick and I'll give you a house. People go, Hey, you can't do that. That's prostitution. Very strange, right? I mean, think about all the things we do that we don't want to do, but we do it for money. Everything's fine. There's no issue. Even think like, you know, I grew up doing terrible construction jobs. I'd never wanna do you know, it might be better suck dudes did for 1000 bucks then don't look Lee drywall fucking carry cement bags all day for $400 for a whole week.

Speaker 3:          01:07:51       At least she got that. I used to work day jobs. I used to work day labor when I was on the road as an MC so I can make more money like in the one advantage to South hat was that the comedy clubs back then were like five, six day runs. So during the day Columbia runs, um, comedy house theater in Columbia. South Carolina used to be a six night room and it was Tuesday through Sunday. So I would get to town Monday and Tuesday morning I would go to a day labor spot, get a job assignment and work the whole week, nine to five and then at night go do my little MC bullshit. Kids need to hear this kid's coming out. They need to hear this. That's important. You got it. That's real hustling, dude, why am I going to sit here in a hotel all day and do nothing when I could go make a quick like in minimum wage was like five and a quarter.

Speaker 3:          01:08:40       It's like you, you're only making 40 bucks. But that was extra money. Like I counted on that little extra money and we used to work summit fucking, Oh my God. There's a quick Creek factory in Columbia, South Carolina, and I've worked there. I worked there two weeks at a time. Anytime I played the comedy club, I worked at the quick Creek factory. Wow. So did you have to call them up or did you, how do you show up? You show up at six in the morning with your, with your drivers license and you sign up and then you sit in a lobby and you watch the morning news until your name is called and then they give you your job assignment. Wow. And so you bring boots, you bring a hard hat cause you don't know what you're going to get. You might get something with a keyboard, you might just be outside holding the stop slow fucking stop stick while they pave a road.

Speaker 3:          01:09:23       And that's your gig for eight hours. Wow. You just stand in the fucking Carolina heat and just fucking five 25 an hour. I love stories like this dude, that was my first 10 years was just working day labor weird jobs to make extra money. Um, and if it, if the gig was under five hours, I would drive back home. Like I wouldn't even stay so that I could go, at the time I was still working morning radio. So if it was within five hours, I would do morning radio, get off the air at 10, be on the road by 11 five hours nap. Do the show, get back in my car at 10:00 PM five hours back to Birmingham, sleep at the station, wake up at six wash, rinse, repeat. Or I can't lose the radio gig because that's too, that was too much of a good get right.

Speaker 3:          01:10:11       And I was doing prank calls and I was using the prank calls. I was taking my prank calls at the time and sending them to other morning shows. This is website radio online, which kind of breaks down. It's almost like billboard, it's all, it's almost like Nielsen or some shit, but for radio. And so I would go there and I would look for other local morning shows that weren't syndicated in cities where I wasn't performing. And so I would send my print calls for free to these morning shows and go, look, I'm a comic. Here's some free print calls we do in Birmingham. They're not going anywhere else. You want to M an Omaha? The guy says, yes, he's not. He doesn't have shit else to play on the air. So I was in the prank calls, the guy that played a prank calls for a couple of weeks, a couple months, and then I would call the local comedy club and go, Hey, I want to feature in your room. I'm on the radio and I know I can get on there and had, and this is when the belief that that radio still could bring people to the show. So I would call local comedy clubs in cities where my print calls with Aaron and use that as leverage to get booked as a feature instead of a MC. And so that's how I was able to kind of jump a level because I was a feature that was coming in town with the pre plugged in media access and all of that shit.

Speaker 4:          01:11:28       Dude, you're a hustler, you're a real hustler. I love hearing shit like that. I really do. I love hearing the driving part. I love hearing that getting the day job part. Kids need to hear this. All you fucking kids listening to this right now to think if you wanted a job in show business, this is what comes with it. And that's why you're so good, man. That that hustler mentality, that's so important. That's so important.

Speaker 3:          01:11:53       You just network, you find people that you can that are as driven as you and then you just figured out ways to work together and do shit. But comedy is so, so many motherfuckers are lying bro. They're lying. How so? And you lie, you get the leverage and like it's like, so the way I got hired on radio, so at the time the thought was that this is 2001 I'm out of college and if I can get on the radio then that'll give me more access in the city and I can host my own comedy night by hosting my own comedy night. I can offer money to out of towners who also have comedy nights and do swap out. So I needed to get the, the radio gig. So at the time they were doing some sort of contest or some shit and who's the funniest in Birmingham or some shit. And I missed the window for the contest. And so I knew the long story. Long story short is that I go to the radio station. I asked the guy at the time, buck, while whose house a 95, seven not the same storm. Lot of different Buffalo,

Speaker 4:          01:13:00       any buck Wild's okay, perfect. Say Oh different Buckwild. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:13:06       So I said, Hey man, I'm a comic. I have a degree in journalism. It's a perfect fit. Fuck with me. And he goes, nah, we're done with that. We're not going to have a comic. I go, okay, cool. Now I've done enough of the comedy club and Birmingham to know that on black weekends, the black radio station hosts the black comedy night on Fridays and they throw out tee shirts and all that shit. So I'd go to the comedy club and I told Bruce air, as I said, Hey, I just got hired at 95, seven. Um, and they want me to open for doc ugly this weekend. And he goes, okay, that's fine. I'll go back to 95, seven. I go, yo, I know you don't want to fuck with me, but I'm opening for Dio this weekend. Do me a favor, watch my set if I'm funny. Put me on Monday morning. He goes, you gotta deal. So I get to the comedy club that Friday and all I have to do is keep buck wound Bruce heirs apart.

Speaker 4:          01:13:59       Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:13:59       so that neither one knows what the fucking lie was and Bruce came backstage and you just, if as long as you act like you belong and you act like the truth is the truth, people will kind of merge in with that shit and Bruce gamer and goes okay buck while you go out and throw the tee shirts and then you bring up Roy and I went out and it was seven minutes but I fucking crushed like just when you need that one set to go right. And every syllable, every fucking karma is perfect and I demolished in front of DL ugly and I walk off stage and book wows is see you Monday morning and that's how I got radio. It's just what were you going to do? Not fucking book me. I'm already not really working the comedy club. I'm already not hired by you. What is the penalty for this lie? Is this lie? Will this lie send me to jail? No, can lie. It's a hustle lie. Yeah. I'm not saying load your resume with 50 different credits that you don't have, but if you've performed somewhere else outside of where you're from, you have performed across the country. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:15:07       What you basically did is like the comedy version of a subprime mortgage loan. You're like he sold the house to someone who really shouldn't be buying that house, but it worked out and he kept the house. Yeah. That's amazing

Speaker 3:          01:15:19       man. I just, I came up man, cause you know I got arrested when I was, when I was 19 so for the credit card fraud we were still in credit cards and college and like buying jeans and all of that shit. So my first two years of standup I was on probation. So when you have that, I could have gone to jail or this shit could be a lot worse. Living in the back of your mind forever hustling like, I don't know, people got the hustle. I'm just like, no, this is, I have no choice. I have to fucking do.

Speaker 2:          01:15:49       I knew a dude who was one of the original credit card fraudsters. His name was international Sal international style. Yeah, yeah, yeah man. He was a dude who used to come to this pool hall I was at and international Sal was like, uh, he was a real nice guy, but he was a famous loser at gambling and that would, he would make millions of dollars on credit card fraud. He had, they had an organized crime empire and this what they would do back in the day, you remember they had this transparency like they would run your card, they'll put it on a machine and go, chill, shoot, shoot. Yeah. Carbon, carbon Heartland. They would take those carbons, people who worked in these department stores would take the carbons and sell them to him. He would take those carbons, make a totally new credit card out of that car with some sort of machine, and then they would distribute them to these guys.

Speaker 2:          01:16:38       They would buy goods with this stuff and then they would sell the goods and then guys would come to him in the pool hall with paper bags filled with cash. And all he wanted to do was gamble on pool and he could never win. And when I'm telling you never, when that guy was playing with dirty money and he knew it, his head was fucked up. He would be staring that nine ball would be in the hole and he would be like a foot away from it and you see his hand shaking and you're just changes. Just fuck it up and hit the rail. It bounce it off. And people would go, no, he his tick,

Speaker 4:          01:17:09       I can't fucking believe he missed an international Sao. Could never win. He could never win. But he was one of the original dudes. Did you find something from him? Something very weird just happened. What happened? So I'm typing, I'm typing international Sao, right. And I hit space bar and two things come up. Credit card thief and pool player. But when I click the search for that, nothing shows up. Huh? Like for instance, credit card thief and it just brings up a bunch of other stuff about credit card thieves and other people. Honestly, it might be because us, I've not, I'd never looked her up before, but the search might exist because of us because I know other international Sal before and him being a credit card, these people fled. My friends. Mom was actually taking care of him when he was in hospice. He was, he had cancer. He died of rectal cancer.

Speaker 3:          01:18:02       God damn Sal. Yeah, it was bad. It was bad. Tara. No, no, no. Salbi terrorists. A famous pool player. This international style was not a famous Salbi terrible international South couldn't win, but he was one of the original credit card fraudsters. He went to jail for quite a long time with and then got out and was doing the same goddamn thing again. What's crazy though is that when you get arrested, especially for like some white collar shit like that, like what they don't tell you about getting arrested is that the first thing they do is try to pin other unsolved shit on you. So before you even like get a mugshot or anything, you just go sit in a room and they go, here are all the mugshots of other people. We are looking at for similar crimes. Do you know any of these motherfuckers?

Speaker 3:          01:18:44       Then you get a handwriting sample and then a as in like there's, and that's when you find out like, Oh I was just a petty fucking teenager that just took her credit card to get some jeans and then you start realizing like, Oh there's an entire fucking syndicate of shit happening in this city that I didn't know anything about. They're trying to fucking pin on me. And that's when the fear set in. Cause like in your hair you're like all right, well I know I probably won't go to jail. I hope I don't go to jail. Oh shit. I might go to fucking jail for some shit he didn't do. Oh they don't care. They do not go. And that's when sided, you're already a criminal. And that's when I got into comedy. Ooh. That was the fucking depression. Like that was the fucking moment like Oh shit.

Speaker 3:          01:19:24       Well Joey Diaz went to jail for armed kidnapping. That's how he got into comedy. He robbed the dude over some Coke with a machine gun, taped him to a chair and shit. And then when he was in jail, he learned how to do stand up. That is the best cold open to a biopic. When Joey Diaz gets this biopic, it has to start with duct tape on somebody. The duty kid now he took pictures together, didn't he put it up on his Instagram? He took pictures with the guy who kidnapped. He's like 31 years ago. I kid, not this cocksucker our friends. That's the beautiful thing. No man is the redemption and being able to make a mistake and get back in the mix. Well, some of the greatest discipline people good went to jail because they were like Bernard Hopkins, one of my all time favorite.

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       He's one of the greatest middleweight champions of all time. And Bernard Hopkins spent like six years in jail for armed robbery and he learned how to be disciplined when he was in jail and when he got out of jail, he not, not only did he have like a drive that other people probably couldn't comprehend, but he knew what would happen if it went bad again. He knew what would happen if he slid back down that road again and apparently like legs, a corrections officer to said when he was getting out, you'll be right back in here. And he was like, fuck, I will be the fuck I will be. And turned out to be one of the greatest boxers of all time. There he is. Joey's with the guy. 32 years ago I made a mistake. So what? It's not where you start. [inaudible] showed up to my show 32 years ago. I made a mistake so wide. His dad's way of finish. That is crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:20:53       You know, that's, that's what the whole redemption is about. And [inaudible] you know, do what you can, which is second chance. That's why I'm just trying to grind man. All this shit is a gift. I could have been in prison for whatever reasons I didn't get sent to

Speaker 2:          01:21:04       want people to have redemption. It's interesting. This culture today wants people to be in trouble for things they did in the past and you have to be who you were 30

Speaker 3:          01:21:13       yeah. Yeah. We all go to church and ask for forgiveness every Sunday for an opportunity to be forgiven for what we were that week.

Speaker 2:          01:21:21       Well, the idea that no one, no one gets a chance to redeem themselves. It's a terrible world. Like that's one of the best things about Christianity is the idea that you have redemption, you confess your sins and you move on.

Speaker 3:          01:21:34       I just think that it's all new and I think there'll be a, I think it's all new. I think there'll be a market correction at some point because as a society we are obsessed with who you were. Credit reports, rental history, drug history, employment history. Fucking you sit down with somebody who want to know your dating history. So I can, Twitter is just racism history or your bat joke history. It's, it's, it's an opportunity for the first time as a society to audit your past behavior when all we do is judge who you are now based on who you were. That's what our society is established upon. So that's why it doesn't feel so out of pocket to me that people don't, it's like Oh it's a new way to see if you were me. I can literally search your name plus a word and see if you say it the word and then I will fucking name no different than African bankruptcy sitting on your record from, I like how you described it,

Speaker 2:          01:22:32       market correction cause I think that is what's going to happen. We're going to understand that what we're doing now is kind of unsustainable. Like going back and judging someone on some shit that happened in high school or whatever it was and and try to look at words you said when you're trying to make a joke, like what happened with Kevin Hart and apologize for it many times. And then he's hosting the Oscar and they like, look, 10 years ago he said this and he's like, look, I'm not going to do this. I'm not going to do this again. I already apologize for those things. I'm going to move on. Sorry. And the Oscars got fucked. They went up to have a no host. Now

Speaker 3:          01:23:03       did we get fuck did the opposite fucker stand ups get fucked

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       cause the Emmy's don't have a host now either. It's good. Good. Listen, listen, I love Sebastian. I love Sebastian, but Sebastian made me cry when I was looking at this fucking video. Musical world ward. He's going to have the amaze. Yeah, he's hosting that shit. And there's some thing, this is what comics do. We host. We don't get the chance to make the jokes. Nobody wants to make Sebastian sold Madison square garden out four times. Yeah, the fuck is he doing hosting the video music awards? I want to sell it out. Six. Why else do it? Why else do it? Let me show it to you before you, before you cast any judgment, go to it. Go to Sebastian's page. There's like a thing where he's like asking, he's asking Jimmy Kemo how to do it. It's like dog, get out, get out. Of course they're forcing them to do a bunch of shit.

Speaker 4:          01:23:53       That's not good. That's not terrible brand for him, right? No, it's not a brand for anybody. Tear. No. There's certain who else is going to roast that shit? Who else is going to show up and you get a roasted? He's a nice guy, so that's just not going to go shit. Look, if you got on the first promo, he roasted himself for even being there in the first place. Yeah, that's okay. But if you will, some show face roast people like of Ricky Gervais' was hosting something that's different. A totally. They'll get mad at him and he goes after him. That's his brand. He is cutthroat. Yeah. Shit's on everybody cleaning himself. I don't know. I just, I've always enjoyed comics being able to have that to just go to whenever. Like if you look at the history of the Oscars, it's almost always stand ups.

Speaker 4:          01:24:35       A lot of times I just don't give a fuck about award show. So there it is. That's the truth. Yeah. That's the real truth. It's not even the award host. It's why the fuck are we doing this thing? And I would see Chris rock prepare for these award shows. I'm like, you're Chris rock. You couldn't pay me to come anywhere near one of those stupid fucking shows. If I was Chris rock, Chris rock walked out at the NAACP awards and did a Jessie Smollett, nobody else's going to give you a I. You laughing, look at you enjoying that shit's different. No other comic is going to give you that. That's true. What is the worst possible thing that could be said in this room full of black people that hold him and that she'll say crit and he fucking say there right to it. He went right to it.

Speaker 4:          01:25:20       I just don't think Kevin would have done it. No. Kevin would've done that. Kevin would've done that at the Oscars, but Eddie Murphy had done it. You see Eddie Murphy when he did that, when he got that everybody went after bill Cosby. It was just a quick little loose solid jet. But it was great. Yeah, it was great. What he's talking about. And then making them give him back his awards like Ooh, yeah. Um, wait. Does who come back from that? Oh, does Jesse Small that you can't, right? Yeah. You can come back from everywhere. Black people are the most forgiving genre of people. R Kelly still sells tickets now, right? No, no, no, no. He did come back hard though. That is amazing, Kelly. So tickets time, everybody saw the piss tape. He had supporters. That is a Raymond in Brooklyn. Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:26:05       Yeah. Black aunties. Deaf. Not be, but then, so if you're telling me justice, Molly can come back and telling a lie on the streets of Chicago and taking a look. Wicked Huizar Kelly, that's not as good as R Kelly. But Kiki, he can get cast in some Jesus movie and diction and it'll parallel and he'll be fine. Meaning that anything happened? The problem is that the people that could give him the redemption or some of the people who's trustee portrayed, right. That's the problem is that you started looking at the lead Daniels in the Tyler Perry's and you know, maybe the Ava DuVernay's and the people that are in that world of black cinema, they could get them back in to whatever this crossover mainstream world is. So it's about earning that trust again. But I think there's no, and I'm just saying from personal experience, you know, there's no group of people more forgiving than I think black entertainment. I don't think they're ever gonna forgive him for calling himself the gay Tupac. I don't think gay people would give them for that. And that's for gay people to decide. I'm a Tupac fans a different way. What the fuck?

Speaker 3:          01:27:04       Why the fuck did you just say, yeah, he's gone. But then you sit down on somebody's couch and you go, you, that was the old man, the new mean now. And then you come out with your wife, you do some selfies on Instagram kissing. Yeah, but he's not going to have a wife, boyfriend, husband. Okay, fine. Whatever it is, come out and be happy and normal in some level of attrition for what happened. He didn't have to like explain the whole thought process for putting on the hoax. Why he kept the news on his neck. Of course, talking to the cops while I was holding the subways. Yes, you got to get drug through the mud. Yeah. Come on out and get this dragging and then get back to work and nobody's going to care. Five, 10 years from now, nobody's going to care. Good actor.

Speaker 3:          01:27:46       I thought he was fine on empire. Empire. It wasn't my cup of tea after a couple of seasons, but I mean it was fun. Show was entertaining. Little acted I, I never looked at it and went, Oh my God, it's fucking, it's not like I'm looking at it like some self produce Netflix movie where I go, how the fuck did this get on online? He's still saying that he didn't do anything right. He's still saying that he actually got mugged. I haven't kept up with it. That's one of those stories where after he got clear at the first time, I quit clicking on links and then the city of Chicago started soon when the city of Chicago decided to Sue him for the cost of the investigators item done. Yeah. There's just certain shit I don't click on anymore and just as smelly stories, I just said, is he in a new movie out?

Speaker 3:          01:28:24       I don't want to read it. That's the only thing I need to know. Yeah, I get it. I think. I think, I honestly feel like there is a way, bang. Marv Albert was vice for people on the back where he's wearing a dress, so there's a way back in attainment. There's always a way back. This is a way back for what's his face from the fucking, what's his name? The Matt Lauer is there way back for that guy. Oh, I don't know about Dallas. That's why when I'm fucking around hone and justice Molay was lying on two Nigerians, the curb. That's Matt Lauer do. He just got labeled up. Fuckers up in the room. Can't be just hitting the child. That's the narrative. But apparently all those executives had that button. They all had that button to lock the door and use it to grab the ass. Did, did I try not to bring that up? Did I bet they did. I bet a lot of them are sweating it out right now. Um, they lock somebody in the room. Is there a way back from Matt Lauer? I don't know if it is a long road. The problem with Matt Lauer is I was talking about this last night or different, the small Lake, he knows he owned any of it.

Speaker 2:          01:29:32       Here's the problem. He doesn't do anything. He doesn't do anything that a regular person can't do. He just talks to people. He doesn't do anything. He doesn't sing. He doesn't tell jokes. He can't paint. So he's replacing, making motorcycles. Yeah. What do you do? That's so awesome. He doesn't do anything that everybody can't do. Everything he does, anyone can do. He's talking to people. That's all he does is like, hi, I'm Matt Lauer with good morning America. Whatever the fuck the show was today. So today's show, hello, how are you? He just talking and he's talking is bland and non spicy as possible. But in the, in the,

Speaker 3:          01:30:08       so you think he's, cause they replaced him. Was it a, was Carson Daly, was that kinda who they used for awhile and today? I don't know why I'm asking you. I know you don't wash this shit in the morning. I had Carson daily and my girl had this shit on. Daley had this one show that was on forever. Yeah. Last call. Like one o'clock in the morning that no one watched but it stayed on. Yeah. For years. They just started the morning show for a long time too. Yeah. Does like special interest pieces? Yeah. He's been in a mix. Oh, I didn't know. Yeah. Last call. You're making that up. No, no, they just turned it. Matter of fact, they just turned last call over to a new house. They gave it to a Lilly Singh. Mm. So there's, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:30:48       Cause here's the thing. For there to be a path back, there has to be, what is, what does redemption and ownership of whatever you've been accused of. Look like, right. Because if you're in, this goes back to the whole redemption conversation. Is it about your truth or is it about the truth of your accusers or is it about what society perceives you as right? Or the combination of those? Correct. Because if you don't believe, if you don't agree with what your accusers said to you, then you're already fucked because that's part of the redemption is respecting their truth. Even if it's not true to you and it's not what you believe happened and what went down when you hit the shot out like you did to the teacher. Correct? Similar. Correct. It's just, Hey, I'm sorry. Right now granted, I don't know if Matt Lauer would be saying that sincerely.

Speaker 3:          01:31:42       I was sitting like, look, what can I do to show attrition to move back? Because now even if you've had that with the, with your accusers, society at large still gets to decide cause the same way society decides who wears the crown, I get to decide who to take the crown from short. You you do about that. Right. So I mean that's in a fucked up way. That's the game. I hope I'll be saved up enough money. He saved him the money he made. He was making ungodly something. What? I fucking go spend your money. Just relax. Go spend your money. But that's, that's ego. But that's ego in feeling like I deserve to be [inaudible] took it and did it. Damn it. Diamond [inaudible] turn off fucking employment.

Speaker 4:          01:32:24       It's also, you get used to that gig of being that guy who was on TV. Hello. Good morning everyone. Welcome to the today show. Today we have Tom cruise. I'll never forget him and Tom cruise arguing over whether or not Brooke shields should take antidepressants. That's a real, that's a real clip. Oh, crazy. Yeah, they're, they're arguing over it and it's so strange. Him and Matt Lauer and Tom cruise and Tom cruise is telling Matt Lauer he's being glib. Who? Being glib. Matt, you're being glib. Cause ma ma, you know Tom cruise is like, he's a Scientologist and they don't, they don't believe in pharmaceutical drugs. They don't believe in antidepressants or psychiatry. There it is right there. There's the two of them arguing and Matt Lauer has got that. I'm thinking cause I'm holding a pen and pieces of paper war the world. That's early art. It was a big deal.

Speaker 4:          01:33:11       It's a big deal. It fucked a Tom Cruise's career for a long time as people like this guy's a fucking nut. Plus they talking about somebody else's business though. I, I'm talking about, he had talked about it publicly. He had talked about the mistake that she's making by taking, uh, antidepressants. Okay. Say, yeah, yes, that's it. Then I saw in the game, well the psychiatry, psychiatry is the enemy of Scientology. They have all these, um, they have a big science of psychiatry kills and it's like someone would like an electric fucking shock thing in their head going, ah, it's like in Hollywood. Like they're, they're on this crusade against SA against psychiatry. It's like a big part of what Scientology is. The thing that makes me laugh is that I don't see a lot of Southern Scientologists. I don't see a lot of Scientologists the big things in Clearwater. That's the number one headquarters. Clearwater, my sister lives down there. She lives real close to where the num, the headquarters is. It's fucking weird down there man. Everybody just, they're all walking like they got a secret.

Speaker 3:          01:34:14       Do you, do you think in this society, do you think Scientology will be the last religion created? Like when you really think about how recent Scientology is, it's like the 1940s or fifties somewhere. Not like, it's roughly the same age. Just like, I don't know. I can United airlines, Delta airlines, like it's not an old religion. We have videos of the guy who made it. Yeah. Yeah. Will that be the last religion that is like create it? No. Cause every other religion is like old school. You know, centuries and millennials old, but

Speaker 4:          01:34:47       no, there'll be new ones. The interesting thing is they're probably the last ones to get task tax exempt status because their tax exempt status is being questioned right now. Like there's people that very angry about it,

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       but they did it because they all started lawsuits against the IRS and they started thousands of lawsuits. The idea was that they were going to Sue the IRS into recognizing them as a legitimate religion and the way to do that was just overwhelm them with litigation and that's what they did, right? Yeah, they still do. That's what they did. They then they achieve tax exempt status a long time ago there. They're very, it's a very strange, have you ever read, I'm going clear, I saw the, this HBO thing, it's the doc is great. The book is even crazier because Lawrence Wright goes into depth with all these different people that were like, as they were realizing that it was horseshit. Like as they were getting like the, the ninth level of doom papers open up and it's handwritten nonsense by a retard like that. That guy who wrote it was a, he was self, he was like self-diagnosing all of his, his own personal ailments and dealing with them himself and then trying to like pass that off as like a way to live amongst all these people that were paying attention to him. But all of it started for him from himself diagnosing.

Speaker 3:          01:36:04       Is it? Is it natural for Scientologists and I'm only, I only know what I know from that doc and Leah remedying within lifetime shade. Is it natural to not be like the way a Christian is just openly Christian? Just, Hey, how you doing? The Lord loves you. I'm here to tell you about Jesus. I don't really feel like you get that from science. Like normally what I like and watching that doc, I didn't know the dude from Chicago PD used to be like the gritty.

Speaker 2:          01:36:29       Yeah, detective guy. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:36:32       Oh damn. I know you used to be a Scientologist, but you'd never find out that somebody was into that shit until after they're out of it

Speaker 2:          01:36:38       now. I think people keep it tucked. It's not like Mormons where they riding the bikes and you know what the fuck the deal is. Yeah. Now they keep it tucked in, but I think back in the day they used to talk about it as openly as Poe. They'd proselytize, they try to get you to join, but how like just calm. Just try and try to get people to come to these events, try to get people to come to these free workshops, all these different things on anxiety, different things on the mind. Dianetics that's what he did. Decided to write about Dianetics and it's like the science of cleaning your mind and avoiding all external influences that are negative and that are ruining your, your perspective. And

Speaker 3:          01:37:19       you said B commercials for that. And in the eighties and nineties

Speaker 2:          01:37:22       damn man, I bought it. I bought a Dionex book. I got on the list with the volcano exploding in the commercial. I remember I bought everything man. I bought Tony Robbins shit. I bought all kinds of, I bought book of five rings. I bought fucking art of war. I bought everything. I was just trying to figure out like what's the best, I was into psychology when I was young because I was fighting all the time and I was always scared. So it was trying to figure out this gotta be a way to like overcome these mental hurdles. Like does that was like for martial arts competition. The big thing was the fear and wasn't your physical ability wasn't as much of a hurdle as the fear, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       if the, the fear of competition was terrible. So I was like, it's good, but sometimes I feel confident and it'd be great and other times it'd be fucking terrified and like what got to figure out how to be consistent. So I started getting into all that kind of stuff and then when I came to LA, um, it's like in 94 I saw Dianetics commercials said fuck it, I'll order that. So I got this little wave, the questions you seek the answers to here it is. Can word said during an operation harm you later page one 82 is it possible to increase intelligence page one 22 I was like, Oh my God, ed. Yeah, look at that. Tauntaun ah, Dianetics bro. Be like a fucking volcano takeover. Yeah. I was like thinking that I was going to be able to figure out all my mental problems through this book.

Speaker 4:          01:38:42       And then I got on the list and like every week I got some new workshop to go to or this I just put it there. Just a male, female or male, just male. This is the 90s that's all they did was just mail you shit and, but Oh my God, I got, I wanted this. It wasn't until I moved and one of the reasons why when I moved, I didn't forward my mail. I contacted all the companies because of Dianetics. I'd get so much shit from them. Really? It was the fucking, that much shit. It was so much shit. It was like letter after letter, like the grocery store. Also, it started freaking me out that they knew where I was. Like it bothered me. It bothered me. Like it bothered me that I was on a list. I was on a list of someone who bought the book but didn't go to any classes and they knew where I was like maybe I could get them, maybe they would just knock on his door.

Speaker 4:          01:39:28       Hey, do you want to clean up your brain? Hey, come on, we've got the solution. Don't you want to be a volcano? That's scary bro. Yeah, that's scary. There's a lot of people get sucked into that man. I met quite a few people that were Scientologists. I was in the summer, the um, [inaudible] I call it the, you can do it, motivational stuff. And I remember in high school, um, I J ROTC commander w used to, he used to make us watch this guy think his name was Bob Malott. [inaudible] M O w a D Bob Malott if I'm not mistaken. He was a Vietnam vet and he like survive like a terrible white phosphorous grenade accident and suddenly like get fucked up real bad in Vietnam. But it was now doing motivational speaking and once a month we would watch videos of this dude. And like it just starts in a way, like if you get into one, you can kind of start getting in line with the next and the next.

Speaker 4:          01:40:17       And I think before you know it, that's when you're into Dianetics land before you've realized like you can find someone that's meaningful with a meaningful message. And then as you progress more and more, is that all right? I agree with less and less of each author that I'm starting to fuck with. And so it ended up Bob Malott and Dan like I think Dave Ramsey started foe financial shit. Yeah. Well when I was 21 and I was first starting to do comedy, that's when I was really devouring as much of it as possible cause I was trying to figure out like how to not be so lazy, how to be motivated, how to get shit done and how to, how to like find the correct path and think about things correctly.

Speaker 2:          01:40:55       And so I, that's when I really got into [inaudible]. Yeah, I would follow all those personal power. Like you had workshops that you would do like a little like notebooks and shit fill out and things to talk about and things to concentrate on. Like if you did do it, it would help you. But really what it's all about, it's just getting your shit together and moving. Just go do something like what you did by taking a job when you would show up at a gig and you'd be working there Tuesday through Sunday and then take a day job and work nine to five. That is more hustle and more hustle mindset than anything you're ever going to get out of an Anthony Robbins book. Like that is like just doing it. Just doing it makes you do more, like do more hardship, makes you do more hard shit.

Speaker 2:          01:41:37       Understand that you want it bad so you're willing to put in the work and do things you don't want to do. It's what makes you have that confidence that you know how to push through and the the, the mentality that I'm the type of do to get shit done. Like I'm gonna show, I'm not going to waste my day just sitting around a fucking hotel room. Now I'm gonna go to work, I'm going to work all day. I'm gonna drive five hours and keep that radio gig and then dry fires and spent 10 hours of the fucking 24 in a day in a goddamn car to do gigs forward. Focus just to do gigs. Keep that radio kid. Yeah. Those things are every, like I had a guy on yesterday, this guy Dan Crenshaw, he's a Congressman who's also a Navy seal. When we're talking about 'em mentality, I'm like, when you went through buds, is there, do they teach you how to think or do they show you by example?

Speaker 2:          01:42:22       They don't teach how to think. They just show you. They harden you through all that work and through all that work, do that insane hell week. All the shit that you have to do when you go on through buds training, the six months of breaking you down and building you back up, they teach you. You could do anything just by my making you do anything, so you will understand how you can pass your limits, what you thought your limits were, are no longer your limits. That's what I feel like is missing from a lot of people that are getting into motivational this motivational that they ain't doing shit. You got to go do something. That's the number one thing right? Is fucking action. Take action. Do you believe that people that aren't as successful as you think they should be are qualified to be motivational speakers?

Speaker 2:          01:43:07       No. No motorcycle. Yeah. Most people who are doing motivational speaking should stop. They should stop. You're just robbing people. You're not even motivated yourself. Like I want to see, I want to wake you up at three o'clock in the morning. I go, come on man. We're going running like, let me see. You want to see what you do when you're tired. Let me see how you push yourself. Come on man. Get up. Get up again tomorrow. Get up again tomorrow. Get up again tomorrow. The next day. Get up, get up, get up, get up, keep going. How long can you maintain a positive attitude? Where's all his teaching it teaching people you can't do shit yourself. They you need to show people that you could do it. The best motivational speakers to me are guys like David Goggins cause that, that guy that that's and that fucking, that coin right there.

Speaker 2:          01:43:48       That guy does it every day and he's got videos. He just did a a hundred mile race the other day. Put up the results on Instagram. You could see him showing up 22 hours after the race starts. He finishes a hundred miles. Like those type of people. Those are motor. If you ever, you ever seen Goggins is a Instagram page, but this is insane bro. He's a fucking animal. This motherfucker got abs on a coin. He's an animal. He's got the world record chin-ups in in 24 hours. He did some preposterous number of chin-ups. What's that? I believe he was beat recently. Somebody beat him. I think so. I have it. Yeah, we'll probably come back back. Yeah, but it's those types of people. Those are real motivational speakers cause they're actually doing something. There's a lot of people that are teaching you motivation. They don't have a business. They don't, they're not their businesses motivation. Like it's a weird business. It's like yeah, it's like teaching someone how to drive a race car. You never drove one.

Speaker 3:          01:44:44       But see that's why. And that goes back to the whole for me, the whole New York versus LA thing. In terms of comics, you just be around other the comics that are just doing, like when you see David tail, like you'll see David Taylor in February, you'll see them do 20 minutes, right? And then you'll see him in March, you'll see them do a totally different 20 and then you'll see them three months later and he's taken two pieces of the five minutes from those first 20 and put it with a new killer. Fucking 30 and I'll go, what happened to the 20 Oh yeah, that stuff wasn't tight enough. And it is, but this joke, this is it. And when he breaks down, why that joke that you love doesn't even fucking mattered to them because it was to get to this like that. You can't teach that. You can't explain it, but you can show it. And then I can go home and go, fuck, I need to write. I need to go back and look at my old shit and figure out a way.

Speaker 2:          01:45:33       David tells one of the rare guys that became an alcoholic, sobered up and got better, right? Like usually the guys who are drunk are fucking hilarious. And then they stopped drinking and they get boring. Yeah, he got the opposite. He became a way better comic titer and just punchlines. And

Speaker 3:          01:45:53       people say that about M and. M they say they don't. Once he sobered up

Speaker 2:          01:45:57       and what? Clean these better? No, that it was worse. Yeah. That's what usually happens. So it happens to everybody. It happened at Kinnison happened to bill Hicks. It happened to everybody. I never had on, not, not necessarily Hicks.

Speaker 3:          01:46:08       I've never had alcohol, a love alcoholic. I'll drink here and there. But I used to get pissed in my twenties when I would go on stage drunk or tipsy or whatever the fuck. And then after the show people would give the liquor credit for me being funny and it used to offend me. So that's why I stopped drinking.

Speaker 2:          01:46:25       Wow. Okay. Fuck. Gave credit to the list.

Speaker 3:          01:46:28       You're so funny. When you joined, this was funny. You should drink more or the, you know, on these road rooms, they'll sing you shots cause you're on stage with Jack. And they've associated that as part of the, so also you lose control of the audience. At least I do when I'm up there drinking because then this is a shot. Someone else sends a shot and now it's a fucking date. It's a rock. It's a pep rally. It started about, yeah, when

Speaker 4:          01:46:49       people are sending you shots, that's a disaster. That's a disaster because then everybody wants to send you a shot. But then what am I doing in my performance that made someone think it was cool to do that and that that would make this experience better for everybody. You're doing a Bert Kreischer, you turn it into a party, take your shirt off at the story, my style and hollering at each other to shut the fuck up so I can get this chisel shit out of my mouth. So I, uh, so it totally changed how I, you know, and also alcohol makes me sleepy and then it was too much driving in the 20s and stuff. So I can't be drowsy, hit it home. So I don't know. It was just never my thing. Yeah, it's a tricky one man. Because like one drink will loosen you up two drinks.

Speaker 4:          01:47:29       Ah, now again, a little silly. Three drinks. Now you're kind of drunk, you know when you could still do it. But is it as good as one drink? No it's not. But once you get one drink and you get happy, you want another drink, fuck off another one. And then next thing you know it, you're a little drunk and you're on stage. Like I'm at that age now. I can't remember what comic did a joke like this, but maybe a couple of them. But we're before you drink, you have to look at your schedule for the next day and a half to make sure you have the bounce back and recovery and all of that shit. Yeah. It's not just can I go out Friday? It's what am I doing Saturday and Sunday? Well, you're a goal-oriented guy. It seems like for goal oriented people, the alcohol is one of the biggest impediments.

Speaker 4:          01:48:10       You know, the craziest thing. And the only thing I've never been able to make proper time for in my career is exercise. Really? Yeah. Why not? I'm not good about exercise because they're a trainer. You've got money cause it's a that still, I don't have time. There's the time and so and my brain, it's while I'm at, when I'm going on, when I was still living in LA, I had a trainer and I got to New York and then it's must do this. Must write, must watch the video. If I exercise I will be too tired and then productivity will go down. And when I know deep down when I exercise, I'm more creative. The brain juices and shit work more. But it's the only thing that I've never been able to like properly regiment in my life. Well this is how you fix that force yourself.

Speaker 4:          01:48:50       Like we're in August. Okay. We have a what? Six more days? Seven more days of August, something like that. What is today? 10 more days. 10 more days. Say the 21st so we have 10 more days. August. Do you just say, at the end of this fucking month, I am going to have a trainer and I'm going to work out three days a week with that trainer, period. This is how we're going to do it. Write it down and then just get it done and force yourself for one month, for one month, for the month of September for that month. You have to work out three days a week and you write it down and then publicly stated so that you can't back out of it. Put it on Twitter or put it on Instagram. Take one of those shirtless pictures of my gut, just profile, show everyone and let them clown me.

Speaker 4:          01:49:30       But if you do that, you'll force yourself to do it. And next thing you know you've done it. You know like I have this dog that loves running and so I'm, I make sure that if I don't take him running, he's, he's always a pain in the ass. He's dropping the ball on the table, trying to get you to play. Like he's a very energetic. Yeah. So like that motherfucker makes me run five days a week, five days a week. I get up, I'm like, come on bro, let's go, let's go. He goes crazy. He starts running around in circles. He and then, and then we, we go hit the trails. Is this the dog that you saw? What was it? What was it? A snake or some shit you ran over while you were jogging one day. Like [inaudible] dog. Yeah. That was a different dog.

Speaker 4:          01:50:09       Yeah, that was crazy, man. I jumped over this log and as I was jumping over this long, I'm like, that's how rattlesnake it was. Fat dude. Like my forearm. I was like fuck one of the biggest snakes I've ever seen in terms of rattlesnakes. It was big like six feet long, big. That is a big fucking snake. And he was just laying flat out on the road. Like a stick. Just warming. Yeah. And the dogs went right over it. They didn't even notice it cause it was just completely flattened out. I was literally in the air over it before. I'm like, Oh my God. Yeah. That was a different one. Man. I've killed a bunch of rattlesnakes. Men always seeing those fuckers. There was one in my neighborhood real recently where there's a video of a Bobcat and a rattlesnake duking it out in the middle of the street, like telling them they fucking a mile from my house and man, it's crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:51:00       Freaking coyotes out here, man. There's a lot of weird wildlife out here. You know California's got weird wildlife. There's a lot of shit out there. A lot of Bobcats and mountain lines. What did we have down South? We just said squirrel. So that was the only little [inaudible] that shit. You guys have coyotes now. Kylie's are everywhere. They have coyotes in every fucking state. 50 States probably eating them. I fucking coyote saying, Oh yeah, for sure. People eat coyotes. There's someone eating a coyote right now. Right now. While we're someone listening to this right now. Jerky, not bad. I guarantee you one of your listeners knows a person that makes a coyote jerky. Probably. Yeah, I'd try that shit. My friend Steve Rinella, who's going to be here tomorrow, he cooked and ate a coyote on TV. They wanted to see what it tasted like. Oh look at this fucker on a trail near San Diego.

Speaker 4:          01:51:49       We could go the size of that chicken fucker. God damn, it's all curled up and ready to go to, we're two sprawled out as the society. Yeah. Well these motherfuckers are everywhere too and we need them by the way, cause that's why there's not as many rats and rabbits and shit. It's a whole beautiful ecosystem out there. Have you heard the number of rats they've found out or in LA recently? I just saw a story about it last night. It's disgustingly scary. All at the comedy store. 12 million over 12 million. They're all the comedies and if they hit all 12 there's about 1.5% of them that are, have this disgusting diseases. And instead, if it hits over 2% it starts spreading into people. Oh. Oh good times, bro. You got to move to the mountains. Yeah man. I moved some quotes, bro. Genetic code to simple that can freaking reproduce.

Speaker 4:          01:52:35       Yeah. Sisters and mom is that sisters and fathers and yeah, no problem. They have no problem fucking this. No mutation. Is that true? They don't. They have like a spreading problems. That's why they can really dreamless gestation can be pregnant again. Three months. Give me pregnant again. Did you ever see that? A documentary on Netflix, that rats documentary? No. Whoo. You ready for that one? That's a good one. Write that down. That one's going to freak you out because it details, they catch some of them and they just run some tests on them. And this is a in suburban Atlanta and they find all kinds of crazy fucking diseases and they have Manhattan, they show all these rat scrambling over garbage and into the sewer system and they show how smart they are, how they'll send the young rats to test out poison. And then the young rats will eat the poison and die and then the old rats like, okay, we get it.

Speaker 4:          01:53:27       And then they, they're smart Daptiv. Yeah man, they're, they're clever. I mean there are the most prevalent mammal in any city. You know, if you look at any like just sheer numbers and just we're going to do, that's a hustle hustler right there. There's more Brown rat in New York city than there are human beings. I think there's more bio mass of rats than there is bio mass of human beings. So that means the weight. Yeah, just the weight. The weight of check volume. That's true. I might've made that up, but the biomass of a, I mean just the sheer numbers, it's, there's not another other animal that you can think of that's like that. What's the remix

Speaker 5:          01:54:07       of anywhere between eight point 4,000,020 14 all the way up to 33.6 million rats in New York city. Cheesy.

Speaker 4:          01:54:16       That's more than there are people for sure. Yeah. Try 18 million. God, God, rats. The documentary's amazing man. They're vectors of diseases. They've always been, wasn't carrying diseases. What's the number of red? What's the red infestation looking like in countries where they eat rat stuff? Interests, disease. Fucking not a lot of countries eat rats. He knows the weirdest shit. You ever seen those temples in India where they feed the rats? The rats are everywhere. Dude. That'll give you the heebie. Jeebies. These people were drinking out of like bowls of milk that the rats drink out of. They like scoop it up. They, they have all these rats over like literally running [inaudible] or is it just this is your crib either rats, they feed them. Look at this. What do you got here? Jamie? Was this rat temple speed up ahead. So you could see what it's like when the, all the rats and the people interact.

Speaker 4:          01:55:09       Yeah. So they put out food for the rats and the rats. You could pick them up. I mean the rats, I have zero fear of people and in fact they're like, they get along with people. So this is like a temple that you visited in India and fucking rats are everywhere and everybody treats these rats with respect. Very coexisting. Yeah. So the reason why rats are scared of people, they recognize that people want to kill them because they carry diseases. But in India they just got a totally different vibe going on. So look like those pigeons are hanging around those rants in New York city. Rats, hunt pigeons. You ever see rats, killer pigeons and drag them away like, Whoa. Have you seen the video of the Pelican? That aided pigeon swallowed the whole boom. I saw a Pelican eat a duck, hold jock. Just pelicans and low key assholes, assholes, dinosaurs.

Speaker 4:          01:55:58       Look at these fucking rats, man. They're everywhere. That's where we're headed. Rats are pellets. We hit headed with fucking rats in New York. You think so? It's just gotta be normal. I mean, people are gonna try and stomp 'em out and poison and trap and all of that. But at some point you just gotta go high man have hit two. They're maintaining right now. All right, you can still go to a restaurant. You still go to the movies, still go shopping. It's all normal and there's millions of rants running underneath your feet under the ground. What's, what's the plan? What's de Blasio's plan? Yeah, for people. Definitely rats. Fucking plan. What kind of plan is you have to take care of his corrupt cops. Take care of his, uh, all the problems with the streets. Take care of all the crime. Take it. They know rat problems and plans, but they had like all these studies and EPA motherfuckers that mr money did they have, how much money is Blasio have like how much money they have to spend on things like rats.

Speaker 4:          01:56:55       They probably don't have any budget. It probably doesn't present as much of an ominous threat. This crime or bridges and you know tunnel shit and takes all you know, infrastructure probably it would have to be a pandemic disease, which as Jamie was saying can happen there. We have medieval diseases showing up here now that particularly in trash and shit in Hollywood or in downtown LA with all the homeless people. It's fucking crazy because people are literally just shitting on the street just shitting everywhere. The, the, the homeless situation in downtown LA scares me more than the rat situation. What's the numbers? Oh you need to send us a thousand have you ever driven through skid row? Yeah. Bananas, right? Yeah. Cause it's close to fashion row. This are you into fashion? No, but I was over there one day. There's thousands and thousands of people just living on the street.

Speaker 4:          01:57:50       Thousands, thousands. Like a, like a whole gigantic theater sells out and all the people pile out onto the street, but that's where they live. That's what it's like. It's like, like people go into the Verizon center, like 7,000 people you find in a few streets and they think the solution is some sort of hostels or something that they can start trying to do. Good luck. These people have accumulate, they've like, they've become accustomed, they've, that's their lifestyle. Like that's not what they want for sure, but they're accustomed to being homeless. Like they've acclimated to that world and they've lived in it, many of them for years and years and years and they go to places in shelters where they get food, they sleep out on the street. They have a whole community of people that are out in the street. They're all doing drugs and most of them are psychiatric patients. Half of this stuff, a lot of them ask the thing

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       that really fucks me up with the homeless population in this country, is it half of it? And then on some mental illness, shit, maybe some of them, their family just can't give them the care they need. But if they got the care they need, maybe they could be a little more level enough to at least be under a roof with the love when a somebody that can afford to, you know, yes. To take them in. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:59:01       no, no, I think you're absolutely right. And in the 1980s they, some of them have problems that are solvable. Yeah. Some of them, but some of them don't have anybody to help them get through the problem. Sure. I mean, and then things deteriorate, you know, they get worse and worse and worse. And as you get older, you lose hope and then you say, this is me, this is who I am now. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:59:19       There's, there's like, there's, there's like this weird thing with the homeless as well, where I feel like as a country, like we, we're quicker to help people in groups like it, like in a weird way, it still fucks me up and it's gonna come out wrong. But if there's a natural disaster, the amount of money we will pour into relief and support for particular area after the hurricane or the tornado or whatever, and that's fine. That same type of outpouring happened just once for the homeless coast to coast. It would change so much fucking shit, bro. Yes, but if people are fucked up in a group at once, then it doesn't, it doesn't resonate. Like when you see a single homeless person or the news just shows you the row of tents, you don't see the person crying with the rubble behind them and they've lost everything. It doesn't, for whatever reason, it doesn't connect the same.

Speaker 2:          02:00:15       No, you're absolutely right. We need, like if if something like Katrina happened or a giant earthquake, then we would realize we have to do something, but if there was no homeless people and then all of a sudden something terrible happened and there was 20,000 almost people wandering around downtown, we would immediately go, Oh, we've got to fix this simmering, slow sort of effect. It's similar and similar how much money we spent on other countries, right? How much money we spend on aid, how much money we spent, and we don't fix inner cities that have been impoverished since the fucking 18 hundreds we don't ever go in there and try to solve problems. We don't look at it. I've been saying this forever, like if you want a better country, the best way is to ensure there's less losers. And the best way to ensure there's less losers is give people more opportunities and fix places where you're, you have no chance.

Speaker 2:          02:01:06       I mean, how many people that grow up in, in neighborhoods where they have no chance get out. It's like it's a tiny, tiny fraction of people that wanted to become successful and happy. Most of them are trapped by the environment that they find themselves just by a random roll the dice, they wind up and they're in Detroit and they're in the worst neighborhood in Detroit, or they're in the South side of Chicago or they're in Baltimore or wherever the fuck it is, and then no one does anything to fix it. No one does anything to change it. But if there was no place like that and all of a sudden the disaster happened and then there was a place like, then there'd be an outpouring of contributions and people would want to do something to try to fix it.

Speaker 3:          02:01:43       Yeah. I just think that we live in a society where it's just the people in power know that if you help the people that you've been oppressing, then you run the risk of facing their RAF once they have power. Do you think that's what it is? To some degree? Why would I, if I have an opportunity to make something better and people are labeling me as the fault for you being in that situation in the first place, then I run the risk of losing power because those people are going to come get me, they're gonna vote me out office. So it's, it's about aligning your views and choices with the people and it's gonna keep you in that office.

Speaker 2:          02:02:25       Yeah, I guess, man, I just would think that in today's day and age people would be more forward thinking and they would think, look, we've got a lot of problems with the environment. We've got a lot of problems with climate control like we've got, we've got real issues in this world, but we also have problems that have been here forever that no one's done a God damn thing defense. So these new people are like, well the oceans rise and the oceans rise and what are we going to do? Like what the, it's not going to affect all these inner cities, these inner cities that have had these same problems forever. If you looked at the problems like murder problems in this country, like the, the places in the inner city where you have like gang violence and murder and drug trafficking on the same fucking problems over and over and over again year after year,

Speaker 3:          02:03:09       don't go, go ahead, go. There's no no effort. What do I gain if I am, if I'm a politician and I'm in power, what do I gain by helping those people?

Speaker 2:          02:03:22       Well, you get more people that do well and you have a better economy and you have a safer society and people look at you like you're a real leader. Like, wow, mayor wood, look what he did. Sure. If they give me the credit or unless it gets politically spun the wrong way or some shit. Yeah, but I mean then I'm out. That's the case with every single thing a mayor or governor does. We're just, I don't know. I just think where black politics like that is concerned, we are more than

Speaker 3:          02:03:47       inclined to vote and do things that serve our own interest first. Politicians are more inclined to do, to enact policies that serve their best interest and we're more inclined to vote for things that serve our best interests. So the two things work against each other. Then for it to work, for the system to work, you got to vote for things that are for the greater good, even if it means sacrificing your own position in the process. And that's what I think a lot of politicians don't do

Speaker 2:          02:04:11       in this day and age. Trying to help impoverish communities when now there's an awareness of how long stuff's been going on. And how do you know who Michael Wood? Um, jr is, is that his name? Michael Wood jr. yeah, he was a cop of Baltimore and um, he uh, came across um, this paper from the 1970s that was detailing like a rap sheets, all the problems in the, in the area and all the different crimes. And he was realizing this is in the two thousands. He's like, these are all the same places with the same crimes that we're handling now. So here we are 30 plus years later, the same exact crimes in the same exact places. And you'd like the feeling of like futility, the handling this, the fact that no one gives a fuck and that this has been this way forever and nothing's being done Dawn to do anything other than just continue the process of arresting people, letting them out, arresting people, letting them out and then it's just chaos.

Speaker 3:          02:05:12       I'll give you a good example of self interest. So in Newark, New Jersey right now they are facing water contamination levels that are higher than Flint and there has been cover-ups out the ass. That's where I was born. So well I go get your shit checked. Get parents to let, it's in the past, I think it's like past eight years or so. They're starting to, they're starting to pull it the threads now and figure out, Oh what the hell was this? What's going on with the water? And it's all these people getting fucked up. The people who covered it up, those, the people in office who could have made the decisions that you, that you're saying to not fucking let fucked up water getting to the water table. So if a corporation says, Hey man, fuck it, don't worry about that dirty water. Here's some money and some campaign processing.

Speaker 3:          02:06:04       That's what happened. I don't think so. I mean you've got to unravel the story. We got to see how it unfolds. But if there is a coverup, a cover up only happens if someone has more selfish, self-serving intentions in mind. Like the core base of a coverup is to fuck over somebody who doesn't deserve to get fucked over. So off that alone, the choice you're making isn't for the greater good of the society or the pride or like the way, and it's like, you know what ants do is so dope when it's a flood, you ever seen the fire and to make the float? That's what, that's what we have to be, but we're not going to beat it cause nobody wants to be the ant on the bottom. Drown, might drown and can't get back up to the top in time. We don't, we don't do that

Speaker 2:          02:06:47       well. I think there's also a sense of futility. Like there's a lack of resources to handle everything. So you just take, take what you can handle, what you can and keep moving and then just get the fuck out of Newark. I mean that's how people look at it. People look at those neighborhoods like a place to escape. Not that it's anything that can be fixed.

Speaker 3:          02:07:06       Yeah, that's what I, that's what I struggled at lit with Birmingham and terms of going back home and trying to do things that feed the neighborhood positively. Cause I feel like I never had that growing up. Like, you know, there were a couple of people and then you Bo Jacksons and your Charles Barkley's, they come around and you know, give a high five to the kid or two. But to be able to do things that create opportunities so that, that feeling of hopelessness or whatever isn't always there. Or if there's one thing that can be like big Sean did something that was dope in Detroit, he put $100,000 down on a recording studio. And to help underprivileged kids have access to just fucking just record, just to do something that makes things better. So the problem is that in the process of trying to give a fuck, it's stressful and there are people that are pushing and working against you and you could easily just go to sleep in your bed comfortably at night and just not care.

Speaker 3:          02:08:09       But I try, I do as much as I can back home. But the idea of getting the fuck out, I'm always torn on because it's like I'm gone. Um, if nothing else, I can pay my bills til I die on and think my son could go to a decent division two school and be fine. But if I'm not using my gifts and all these advantages to try and help him better other people somehow, then I feel like I failed the city. Well, I feel like I failed where I came from. So I'm trying to figure out how, because I don't, I've never, what I've never seen is someone that gave back or attempted to put back into without it costing them something in the process as well.

Speaker 2:          02:08:56       Right. I see what you're saying. Like you, you'd have to make a big sacrifice in order to help and you'd have to take time that you don't even have time to work out. So how the fuck do you have time to go and save Birmingham? Yeah. Yeah. That is a problem. I mean, you have bandwidth, right? You have a certain amount of bandwidth in your, in your brain and how much of it can you dedicate to charitable things? How much can you dedicate to your career, your family, dad? It's the constant process. I mean I think it's the job of people who are running cities and States and the country, but it's about how much resource, how much resources they have and how much did they delegate to fixing these problems that have existed forever.

Speaker 3:          02:09:38       What I've learned, man, is uh, I learned a shit ton. We shot, um, you shot my comedy central pilot in Birmingham, um, this summer, which was not an easy feat in terms of the logistics of it. Just cause Birmingham's not a, it's not Atlanta, it's not a bunch of fucking cameras just laying around, but you start seeing how different entities of at the state level and local 11, leaving the County level all have to get a little touch. I'll have to have a hand in it somehow so that everyone feels like they are all part. Like you have to please too many people at the same time to get anything to get anything remotely done. I dunno, I can't speak for the rest of the country, but I know in Alabama that's generally how it is.

Speaker 2:          02:10:24       I think that's generally how it is with all politics. I mean everybody wants a little bit of credit, everybody wants a little bit of a say in it, fine but the credit, but just help

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       get you to credit but help like do this logistical thing to help that. Like that's the stuff where nobody wants to really or you're not sure if anybody really has genuine intentions on helping. Yeah, cause not everybody's happy for you to crib.

Speaker 4:          02:10:50       That's the saddest shit ever. When you think about charitable organizations and you find out how much people are making to run those charitable organizations in palace and shit. Yeah, and how little the money actually goes towards the charity. Like Jesus. Like I know there's going to be some red tape and bureaucracy, but it's like red cross, isn't it? Some insane number. Like, how much of money from red cross actually goes towards the actual charity itself. I'm going to say 10% that might be generous that, but that is a crazy number. That night. It cost 90% of all the money that comes in just to deal with overhead

Speaker 3:          02:11:27       sticks and moving stuff around. And that's why, that's why I kind of like go fund me, cause you can just find them. I fucking be like, here, here's $100

Speaker 4:          02:11:37       yeah. When there's real problems, what do you got Jamie? What's the number? Let's guess type that in. And it's like stories come about. The CEO's been serially misleading about where the 91% of money that they says goes. I dunno. Oh, so it's less than 10% 9% 91% there's 91% go somewhere other than the charity. So it's 9% no, no. I think they're actually saying 91% goes to the charity. We're very proud of the fact that 91 cents of every dollar that's donated goes to our services. The services, the services. Gas. Yeah. Come on. Did you see that? Do the dinero Deniros suing some lady that worked for them that watched 55 episodes of friends in a week. No. Yeah, she embezzled money. Uh, allegedly embezzled money. Uh, took, used his miles to fly on her own personal trips. She was making 300 grand a year, but the, the big story that clickbait title was a, he sued her for $6 million after a wild friends.

Speaker 4:          02:12:45       Been she watched 55 out of 55 episodes of it in four days. That's 2008 so that's DVDs in 2008. That is hilarious. So they're still going after it 11 years later. Oh, she began, she was his assistant in 2008 and then she, and then, okay, she began as denier as assistant and she now is being sued. So she basically got to a place where they're working together for 11 years and 11 years of employment, DeNiro Robinson Rose to vice president of production and finance. According to this suit, which lists are 2019 salary, $300,000. She finally left the company in April after being suspected of corporate sabotage, said the legal filing. And she embezzled money and she went crazy. Oh seven hours a day. That's 14 episodes. That's doable. It's doable for four days. I benched 24 in like a day and a half. The whole season. The whole season.

Speaker 4:          02:13:47       Fucking a DVD box at day's me was also a good show. It's just funny that I had all this shit that this lady did. Apparently allegedly the 55 episodes of friends are the ones that became the headline that everybody had to click on it cause that's the funniest shit. Watch 20 episodes of arrested development one day and somebody shot. So this is you just sitting around watching TV while she's working for, what is she supposed to be doing? Like maybe she's doing research, maybe she's waiting around for something to do. What did the real project needs? Friends research, looking for cast. I don't know what to Neo projects are even around. I mean, well DeNiro is probably trying to figure out where all his money's going because he's getting divorced right now, so he's probably, yeah man, he's getting divorced. There was some public spat at a restaurant where he yelled at his wife, I wouldn't have to do these shitty fucking movies if you weren't spending all my money.

Speaker 4:          02:14:36       Ah, yeah. Oh, I see that. I always feel bad for people like the Cubs second baseman bins. Obras he's been like, I don't know what the like, Oh, physically unable to perform. Like he's basically been on the disabled list the entire season while he goes through and deals with his divorce. Oh God. Like [inaudible] serious shit. She going to go make millions of dollars playing baseball. I can't right now. I have to go to court and count my cash and make sure that my shit, so his disabled shit is just dealing with the divorce. I forget. Not even a real injury. No, it's not a real injury. Well, I guess it technically is mental. What it is. That's a girl taken apart his puzzle. Yeah. Took apart as fast as she's doing. She's taken apart the puzzle of his life while she's forcing him to go through. I think it was like infidelity or something.

Speaker 4:          02:15:27       Somebody cheated. I had a buddy of mine who, uh, he had it paid for his wife's lawyer and you don't even think about it that way. Like if you're married, you go, well, who's paying for her lawyer? But bitch, you're paying for her lawyer. If she didn't work, you pay for the general of the opposing army to try to dismantle you financially. And he didn't have a prenuptial agreement. So he went to a war for fucking years, years and years and years and they were trying to drain him. And the lawyers are smart man. They know that the real settlement is great, but what the real money is in legal fees leading up to the settlement. They just drag that shit out for a couple of years, hundreds of dollars an hour. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          02:16:07       and next thing you know, you've lost millions of dollars. And this guy, you know, busted his ass 12 hours a day, forever. Lost almost everything still to this day. How about this? He's been married for, I think he's been married for 14 years to a new woman. He was with her for 12 years and he has been paying her alimony than they were married. Wow. He's married to a new woman and didn't even have kids with her, so he's been paying her for 14 fucking years. I'm talking six figures every year. She doesn't do shit. She lives in a fat house in the Palisades. The whole thing is bananas. You see Larry King is getting a divorce. Yeah, I didn't know that. He's head. This is his eighth wife. Yeah. Love it. I hope he gets another one. I hope it gets another one and these are like a skeleton and they have Jordan walked them out. They're in an exoskeleton.

Speaker 4:          02:17:04       I can't prove it, but I feel like the divorce lawyer industry is tied to the wedding industry somehow. Somehow they don't have to be tied in like legally. They know they both benefit from one another. Of course. Yeah, of course. Look at that perfect relationship. How'd it go wrong and I just want to know what the arguments were. Well, apparently there was infidelity as well, allegedly. No way. I can't believe she did cheat on him on her side or his side. Her side. Apparently she had a year long affair prenup in that one and then she looked fucking hot 20 years ago when they got married cause she's like 59 now. So when they first started shacking it up, she was in her thirties probably look and smoking. She's pretty pretty lady. You know, you'd think that's an addiction. Love the same as any other drugs.

Speaker 4:          02:17:54       Sure, of course. Yeah. Most people lose when you're talking about getting married seven times. Yeah. It gets a little wacky. Yeah. He's had marriages that lasted like less than a year. They'd get divorced and marry another one. Right. I would get married I think once I, if I do it, it'd be once I know one in me, one I got one in me. I was proposed to a girl like can Oh three those are one of the biggest mistakes. Almost. Almost fucking me. How'd you get out of it? It's funny. She was cheating. Woo. That's nice. That's a relief.

Speaker 3:          02:18:27       Yeah. It was back in a day when you share cell phone plans and she kept pushing us over our minutes for the month. I'm like, what the fuck are you talking to? So the next month I requested the full itemized call. Long be like back in the day, sprint would send you your entire call log for the month. And I just went through it and then I could see the patterns of when I was sleep or when I was on stage. You could just see that when it's all in front of you, it's easy to just see that. Oh yeah. When I go to work at 6:00 AM you can call it this.

Speaker 4:          02:18:59       Wow. Yeah. And it was real easy to track down. Did you confront? Ah, yeah, I was, I was a little extra about it, but I was young. I was fucking young. Yeah. I called 'em, uh, call sprint and the, the, I basically turned my phone into her phone. Oh shit. And then I started texting the dudes. Oh, her phone. How many guys? Those two guys. Oh. And so I tell both guys

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       to come over at the same time. To now, so that those two guys, which is so catty and me, and of course they show up, she calls me, curses me out, and boom, bam relationship to, Oh, so you told them to come over while she was at home. Correct. But you weren't there. Correct. Ooh, I like it. No, that's D's. But in like in the bigger scheme of things, if one as it came over and hit her or done anything stupid, I'm liable and that, yeah. Hell yeah. No, come on. You're not liable for someone calling me. I'll charge you with murder for somebody. They shot days. There are laws, not that I deceive to men, that the showing up to the fucking house, he gotta remember my brain is going, don't go back to jail ever again. So in my brain, I'm going, there's something that could have, that could have gone South somehow. I don't think you would've got in trouble for that either way. I wouldn't want that. I see what you're saying. Teamed up by some psycho dude who's jealous or whatever. I didn't want that. I was jealous that he's the other one who's cheating on yeah, and I have my little $700 engagement ring from the Zales.

Speaker 3:          02:20:34       I took it back and this is what I learned that if you returned an engagement ring, the sales person loses the commission. Oh, they take the commission back out or the next check. Cause it had been a problem. He got upset. He wasn't upset, but he spent like an hour trying to talk me out of return. Real. Yeah. He said, man, just go. Think about it, man. Go think about it. Did you tell him just walking around the mall? She's fucking two other dudes. That's ultimately what I have to do. And once I told him that he processed it with no fucking, I just took the L no pushback. Yeah. It was a $700 ring. It's cut was probably only going to be like, what? 70 $80 what's the cut? It didn't want to give up that 80 bucks. I respect that. He's fucking hustle and he's selling jewelry in a mall.

Speaker 3:          02:21:11       Yeah. You don't want to fucking lose your fucking commission. Yeah. Those are bad decisions being made. Buying jewelry in a mall. It's crazy though. It's more like, it's like Joey though, where like she and I are like pool now. Oh really? Yeah. Like she's married like it's all. Oh wow. It's all love now. Wow. That's good. Look, people grow and learn. Does. That's hilarious though that you did that. Yeah, that was, that wasn't my finest hour, but like I said, I'm not a fighter. I figured out a way to die by luckily construct a situation that tears down your entire fucking operation. Yeah. That was a good move. That's a learning process too, for hurts like, damn. How could I be so odd? I mean, because what I'm going to do drive over and cuss you out and guru and cheating them. No, no. We don't all know about each other. Yeah. It's time for us all to meet. So Hey man, come on over to the house. Hey man, you come on over to the house. Meet me at 11 don't come too soon. Come exactly at Alem. Wow. Call sweet. Want to be there? No.

Speaker 3:          02:22:16       Some explosions. You just got to walk away from, no, man, I don't want to be there for that one. Nah, that's where it goes. I have never, that's something I've never lived down like, and then it just, it was just ugly. It was just one of those things where you just go, you know what? Maybe I shouldn't have done that. Her mom's calling me the next day. Well you just talk to her, talk to the baby. Oh boy. No man, I can't like it was did. It was full blown, bro. I'm sending pictures of the fucking ring and all types of stuff. Like, Oh, you got an extra. Yeah, it was, it was not, it's not my finest hour,

Speaker 2:          02:22:56       but don't you think that like those brutal breakups and all the chaos of infidelity and all that kind of nonsense, like it gives you a better understanding of relationships when they go, well, it gives you, it's all luck, life lessons. Like you don't get to be, you don't get to be a seasoned grown up human being without getting your heart broken a few times without having a bunch of things going on. Disappointing. In your work life and then then you become a person with an understanding of all the variabilities that you're dealing with in life.

Speaker 3:          02:23:28       I think the problem though, you know with love is that it also can be corroding in a sense where if you've really been invested and you've really tried to love and then it didn't work. I think like I feel like if you've been in love a couple of, I also feel like people get married sooner. There's something more pure about it, but people get married later. It's more honest. Yeah. Like it's like this blind love and love. We never been done dirt. Oh my God, the sky is falling versus you're a grizzled vet. You've been cheated on, you've cheated. So you know both sides of that coin. So you know how it feels. It like, you know, both sides of that. So when you enter into a relationship, it's more pure. But because you have these battle wounds and these battle scars, I don't know if you love the same as the couple. They got married in their twenties it's still love

Speaker 2:          02:24:21       is on who you're with and how much you appreciate them. It also depends on where you're at in your life. Like if you got married now, you're a successful man. I mean you did all the grinding and the hustling, but someone would be entering into your life now while you're already made it, you're successful. You're established. The hustle of getting to there as now, it's just about about maintaining, which although difficult, you have the confidence that it's going to happen that you don't have in the beginning, that early days hustling when you were taking those odd jobs. Who the fuck knew where your life was going? That's one of the beautiful things about it.

Speaker 3:          02:24:56       There was gigs I was headed to. I didn't have gas money to get home and the gig I was going to was the gas money to get home. So please don't cancel and please don't pull some, some black promoters shit and don't pay me like I literally need those $40 I have no way to get home. Wow. And sometimes you don't get paid and if you don't get paid on the way home, you stop at a daily work spot and you do some yard work or whatever. Yeah, you go do some daily work real quick for the day. You miss a day, you miss a shift at the radio station, a radio station. Hey man, I got car trouble in Kentucky. I can't get home. I'm a mr morning show. Sorry. I mean you go do some day job, get your $40 and get home.

Speaker 2:          02:25:33       But that's a real life experience that you just can't pay for. That's so valuable. The fact that you did do it, even though it was horrible when it happened, like the resolve that you did, did you develop from being that person who figures your way through all those problems? So like if so if you got married now, like you're a different person like you, you could, you'll figure shit out better now.

Speaker 3:          02:25:57       It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. You also, you also learn how to communicate better so that it doesn't devolve to a point where either you were being malicious to each other. Yes, me and my goes way better communication than any of that I could have imagined with anyone in my twenties yeah. Because of those experiences and learning. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's the part where you try to fucking correct within. There's always a piece of you. It's like, do you ever find that, I guess I can't ask you this as a married man, but you find yourself sometimes looking at past relationships like jokes where you go, Oh, I know how I could've fixed that. Oh yeah. For sure. Yeah, please. Sure. What the knowledge you have now of relationships and love. Yes. I can look back on stuff that I fucked up and go, all I had to do was this, this boom, and that joke woulda hit. Yup. That would've been damn. Yeah. So that eats like the way, like when you do a TV set and you forget one part, the joke, and now for the rest of your life, that's the set. That's who you are. If there's a piece of you that's going, fuck, I should have done that, man. Yeah, but that's

Speaker 2:          02:27:10       of growth. It's like you have to leave behind these poorly finished projects to, to appreciate the one that you're gonna put out next. That's going to be the best version of it. I look at every fucking special. Every did go. Even if there was successful, I just go, I don't have nothing to do with them. I can't watch them. I've, I fucking get disgusted.

Speaker 3:          02:27:29       My first two special should be combined into one. I'm like, I can literally look at the material go, Oh, that's segues with that.

Speaker 2:          02:27:35       Yeah. Cut that out. Put this in there. Yeah. Yeah. And then there's old specials that I said, Ooh, I'd like to have another crack at those ideas because those are good ideas. I just didn't implement them correctly. So move on. Kinda move on.

Speaker 3:          02:27:48       Yeah. If the idea is still valid and working in insult. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:27:51       You get trapped, you trapped in old ideas. It's out there. It's done new shit. Find something new that resonates just as well in the future as, as this stuff does to you when you're looking at the past.

Speaker 3:          02:28:03       I dunno, I feel like I have some unfinished thoughts from the last special of course,

Speaker 2:          02:28:09       but that, that desire and that hunger is what makes you a great comic. Like that. That's not done. Oh, I've got gotta do more. Oh, this is gotta be better next time. Or I may make it tighter and make this better. More punchlines, less less fat. All that's

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       what that discomfort an adjunct is. What makes you an artist.

Speaker 3:          02:28:25       That's why I like trying to do stuff that has some teeth or some edge or some opinion to it. You know, trading and stuff that I don't know if you should go with it. No, let's go there. Let's figure it out. There's, there's a joke in there. Somehow

Speaker 4:          02:28:40       when you can navigate those waters successfully, it's like, fuck man. You get on the other end with a big laugh. Ooh,

Speaker 3:          02:28:46       whitewater rafting. It's, and there's just rocks coming and you're going left. Right? Like does the guy calling out how to do the joke and you're just navigating your way down the rocks and if you make it, it is the most rewarding. Dismounts that for me is better than just some in more, but yeah, something more mundane I had just, I can't do it.

Speaker 4:          02:29:09       Yeah. Yeah. When you see people that do in the same mundane shit over and over and over again, you, they don't know what it's like to have that thrilled. They're, they're basically getting on a fucking Seesaw every day, the same Seesaw over and over. And there's no thrill in that. No, no. You're not four anymore. There's this

Speaker 3:          02:29:26       too many good thoughts out there. That's why I love talking with Neil Brennan. Like Neil Brennan is like one of those perfect comics that I can like go, Hey man, what do you think about this? And he'll tag it darker and take it to a place that I wouldn't have even considered. And you know, like you start noticing like there's only, so even if you have a bunch of comedian friends, there's only certain France and understand how or which way you're trying to go with a bit. Cause someone else might give you a tag that drifts off into easy land and I don't want it.

Speaker 4:          02:29:55       Right, right, right. Yeah. No. Neil's a great joke writer and his, his shit like I like his, I like watching him workout premises cause you know, you can tell him like he's put some real thought into those ideas. Yeah, it's, it's an, it's a thesis statement. It just happens to be fun. Like he's really breaking shit down. Yeah. I liked the ones where I know that it was an argument that he had with a girl that he's bringing it to the stage and try to work it out and make it funny. Cause if you have an argument with a girl and then she comes to see you at a comedy club like a month later and that argument gets relayed to the audience and it's fucking hysterical. Oh you win. That's how you win. You win and you fucking slam dunk. That is a fucking grand slam. That's shatters windows in the parking lot. I've never had the courage to do it. I never had the courage to perform material in front in front of somebody I was dating. Never done it. No, it's hard. You gotta, you gotta take a chance and them being really mad at you when you get off stage.

Speaker 3:          02:30:56       I'll give you an example. Like Wilson events is another guy that I like talking to out in New York and the premise, the joke premise is that there are no hit video games sit in Vietnam. Like that's how much we don't want to. That's true. Explore Vietnam, world war II and middle East is just the hits. We only want to discuss the hits where we won. That's a good point. There've been games envy of course there's some video games in Vienna, but as far as hit popular Twitch level Ninja shit, right? None in Vietnam. And then we'll submit a told Willis event supremacy and he goes that and he says that's because if you plan a game based in Vietnam, you can't win even if you want to. Even when you win you still lose. And it's taking that thought and figuring out how to weave that.

Speaker 3:          02:31:46       But like that's what I mean where a friend can help me work through an idea. But then somewhere come, the trick is to come around the backside of that and make sure that you're reinforcing and uplifting the people that chose to fight and like I'm trying to, yeah, it's a whole world that I'm just obsessed with. I dunno. And it all boils back to the whole Trump draft Dodger thing and the hypocrisy that if we agree that the troops are fucked and they're treated horribly, then how is draft dodging bad and that being the, the thought and [inaudible] for Vietnam, correct war, we all agree was a terrible war. We didn't know it at the time and some people chose to go, but a lot of people were threatened with jail that they didn't go. So if you did not go based on revisionist history, was that not a solid decision in terms of avoiding?

Speaker 3:          02:32:38       And so it's about getting that thought through without disrespecting the heroism of what happened. So tricky waters, this fallen tree, white water rafting baby rocks. So I haven't figured it. Those are the, those are the basic Lego blocks and I have to figure out how to get down the river without fucking hitting a jacket. Do you write in like essay form? Do you write things out like with a computer? Do you, do you write, once I have the ideas together, I'd just go loose on stage. Um, I'll go, I'll just run a bit a couple times on stage without any structure, without any real structure. Just bullet points here. The four points I want to make. Do that for a week. Listen to the audio, the stuff that's hot transcribed. And then from that transcription start filling in the blanks of how to flesh out the thought and the point a little bit more like I like, but then some stuff requires research.

Speaker 3:          02:33:33       There's a bit, that is a bit that I'm working on now about how, how the most important person, the most important character in a civil rights movie is the white person is the evil white actor. You cannot have a powerful civil rights movie without a white person being evil. So these actors are never honored. They're never nominated for shit like civil rights movies only as powerful as the white actor. He is evil because that captures what was fucking happening back in that day. Right? So I need to like sit and physically go to box office mojo and look at the last 10 years of civil rights movies versus civil rights movies versus white savior movies and pull actors and pull examples and then look at their and then go to their eye MDB and look at their trajectory post civil rights movie to establish a pattern of if you're a white person, you do evil, your risk.

Speaker 3:          02:34:28       Cause my arguments that you're risking your career. If you're not an alias actor and you plan a racist, you may not do shit else at the, because for black people, if you say n***a, it's too real. So we can't see you as a fucking Romulan in a star Trek movie years later we're unable to process. So, so that joke, I have that idea and I'll just work that thought a couple of times. But now before I put it on stage again, I need movies. I need examples to back the thesis statement. So that's what I'll start writing and really start looking at all of these examples. And I also have like, it's in the same ballpark of that is about how like people call it like green Greenblatt, like a white savior movie and how this movie is about white people doing a D D for black people back in the day.

Speaker 3:          02:35:15       And black people don't like white savior movies because you know, it avoids the pain and the struggle and all that shit. And I feel like white savory movies are just reactionary to powerful civil rights movies cause nobody wants to be portrayed negatively. So if there are enough civil rights movies that play white people as evil, it's inevitable that a white person is going to write a movie about. Remember at a time we drove you around to play the piano, that it's inevitable. We, we fit your chicken when we drove. So don't just say all that. Don't just show all those evil things we did. Let's also acknowledge the time we drove you around. And I think if I go back and I looked through the history of the box office over the last 20 years, I guarantee you I'll be able to find an oscillation between powerful civil rights movie and white savior movie.

Speaker 2:          02:36:03       And when you write that out and you're just going to write bullet points and then just run it on stage right

Speaker 3:          02:36:08       now we'll, we'll do bullet points of all the movies and then so the next stage is I'll do, I'll write all those movies out and I'll go on stage and do half of those movies. One set, the next set I'll do the other half of movies and see which ones resonate the quickest with the audience because they're not all going to be timeless classics. Some of them are going to be deep in the woods, but like Mississippi burning or like Malcolm X and driving miss Daisy. Those are two perfect examples of conflicting films in the same year. So I need iconic examples like that where everybody knows the movie. Correct. What? I haven't even seen it. Yes. So that's trial and error. So that just has to go on stage a couple of times and then once I know what the movies are, then we write it. Then you verbatim that shit it really fucking get it work.

Speaker 2:          02:36:49       That's black belt level comedy. That's black belt level. It's like you have to, you have to have like this is not something that's obvious in front of you. You have like a scaffolding and you're trying to construct this and figure out a way that it squeeze the most juice out of it. That's, that's that whitewater rafting. That's it's so it's so rewarding when that gets pulled off.

Speaker 3:          02:37:10       I just feel like if you look at every genre and it's not to defend a white savior movie as much as it is to just show why the fuck it happened. Yeah. This is about black people in the nineties like boys into it in the 90s that was the era of shoot 'em up bang, bang hood classics and somewhere around 95 96 black cinema became much more positive and reinforcing and it was waiting to exhale and poetic justice and above, not above the realm. What's the other one? Um, loved Jones and love and basketball. Like there were all these more positive black centers that was indirect reaction to not wanting to be perceived and portrayed constantly in a negative light. So I could probably go deep into the fucking weeds race by race on sentiment. Like I could do all the Asian movies and end with crazy rich Asians as the counter to that. But it's not necessarily Asian savior. Like there's no way, I don't know how to connect that. But I believe there is a way with all of these cinematic movies to connect it all together. And at that point you probably got a 25 minute bit that you know needs to be chopped down to 10 to 10 but that's how you build all that. You build the whole house and then you just start chopping off.

Speaker 2:          02:38:27       And when you do that are you writing it out? Do you, do you ever write things out? Was while I was asking as a forum, cause one of the things that I've found that has a great benefit as I write things out, not trying to be funny, instead of just writing it out in a way where I'm trying to be funny, I just write it out. Like I'm writing an essay, like I'm writing an article for a magazine and then in doing that I'll, I'll extract chunks that are funny because I find that when I'm trying to write as a comic, I'm trying to write, set up punchline. It's too defining, it's too limiting. But when I write in an open form, then funny ideas are in there and I just come out and pull them.

Speaker 3:          02:39:05       Do you think, do you think part of that is having the advantage of the audience being with you immediate? Like when you have your audience, you're afforded that opportunity to, cause it's weird because the way we build material now, I don't think that's how you did it when you first started. Was it more about just the joke, the joke, the joke?

Speaker 2:          02:39:24       Yeah. You had to be, you had to gain their confidence, right. That was the thing is like you have to start strong. You have to have a good opening bit. You couldn't fuck around two months. They had have confidence in you. Like this guy, this guy kind of waste my fucking time. You know, they, they just see if you're on a show, when you're in a, when you're an amateur, I mean fucking 10 other people before you, you have to grab them, you got to grab them, you've got to grab them and show them that you have something. Yeah. But then once you become an established comedian, the other problem is you're working with a bunch of other established comedians like say if I'm working with you and then there's Joey Diaz and you know all these other fucking people that are going on that are murdering and then you go up with some bullshit new stuff like that stuff has to be ready.

Speaker 2:          02:40:02       Like having an established audience is great for a couple minutes and then you better have some shit. You know? It's almost like they have, there's more. So things have to be more tight, but some people don't do that. Some people don't do clubs anymore where they're working with a bunch of people. They don't do like the store or the improv where they're working with a bunch of people. Instead they do their own shows, they do their own shows only they have the same opening act all the time and then people there to see them and it's a low bar. They don't have to worry about it as much. I think that's, that's a mistake. But I think the essay form, I started figuring that out maybe 10 years ago. I started writing things in essay form. I originally just do it as blog posts. I would write blog posts and I'd take those blog posts and I was extract ideas from them and then make it into comedy. But I feel like the writing without the limitations of it needing to be funny is where I'd get the most ideas.

Speaker 3:          02:40:56       Yeah. And then you also have the most truth in theirs.

Speaker 2:          02:40:59       Yes. Cause I'm not just trying to bullshit people for a laugh. I'm trying to find out, like what is it like if that premise of the white savior movie, like what is it about why people making these moves? Like what are they trying to, are they trying to defend something? Are they trying to exonerate themselves? Like what are they trying to do when they make that movie? Has it just a feel good? Is it their distorted idea of how to bring everybody together? Is it show that some white people were really good back then? Yeah. Even in the bad times. Look, great movie. Hey, good job Michael. You know, good job. Well like everybody did a great job in this movie. Like what, what is it that, that's the, the motivation you could find, you know, you find those, those gems of humor, those roots of humor in that,

Speaker 3:          02:41:41       yeah, that's what I'm, that's what I'll, I'll, I'll try that. I'll try writing, writing and out more before putting it off

Speaker 2:          02:41:49       writing that way. Cause I don't have to do anything. There's no expectation. Like it just, it just thoughts. Just spill the dots out and then you get absorbed in the writing. And then in that absorption you're, I mean you're a funny guy. You're always going to think funny thoughts. Those funny thoughts are going to come out when you're talking about something like and what the fuck was this guy thinking? And then you go on this whole rant about this thing that maybe if you didn't give yourself the opportunity to sit in front of a computer and just stare at the screen and stare at those keyboard, you probably wouldn't have come up with that premise.

Speaker 3:          02:42:18       Also. Um, once I have the joke in a decent shape, even if it's kind of loose, I start watching myself on mute performed like I go from audio to wants to joke as structure to video and then just watching myself on mute and just seeing body language and just seeing does this look funny? Does this look? That's interesting. I've never feel for, and, and I think you just had it once once identify where my comedic trends where it's quick, spastic movements, but not a lot of stage talking. Walking the stage doesn't work for me. I'm not Chris rock, so operate in like a three foot box to either side of center stage and if it's quit in hit, but nobody, if I, if I take my head one way then bring my shoulders instead of bringing my head and shoulders at the same time on a turn is if I'm caught while I'm contemplating a point.

Speaker 3:          02:43:15       Something as simple as that for me helps jokes and then I can go back and listen to the audio at the back on, watch the video and see where I'm getting laughs just off movement and I haven't said a word yet and for me it's quick movements and facial expressions. Those are the extra little I caught at the extra season and that's the shit that, you know, once you kind of get the joke in a good place, where can we add a little season and is it a vocal inflection? Is it coming down on this part? Is it looking this way? Then look in that way for the like, like almost borderline performative, like on some acting shit, but just looking and finding places where the emotions can change and not necessarily on this line I do this thing, but it's just, Oh, this part is funnier if I'm not as excited here.

Speaker 3:          02:44:02       That Foxworthy says some shit I was watching and bring the funny and he told one of the contestants, eh, if you started at 10 it's when the competition comedy show the new show, it's last comic standing. But with sketch comics mixed in there as well. So it's not, it's not strictly stand up, it's sketch and variety acts and all of that type of shit. But the same shit you go out in front of three judges, somebody crushes your dreams and then you talk shit about it behind the bags once she kicked off the show. Uh, but he tells somebody wants you started at 10 you have nowhere else to go. So I tried to keep that in mind in terms of just not being too big too soon with the material. Just shifting gears.

Speaker 2:          02:44:44       It's, it's a fascinating process. And we discussed this on the show many times before that there's no books that can tell you how to do it. The only way you get liked, one of the things that's really cool about this conversation is young guys coming up, young girls coming up, they want to learn how to do comedy, can listen to your process and they'll get an idea of the map ahead. They'll get an idea of the road because there's real, there's no courses you can take that are ever going to prepare you. You have to find established comedians and listen to them talk about how they do it and in a sense what we're doing is we're laying down like a sort of a a course for, for the up and coming class for the people that are starting out now that don't really have anyone to show them how to do it. They can cut a lot of time out by listening to a guy like you who is explaining the mistakes that he made and then the good choices that you made and then your process.

Speaker 3:          02:45:35       I tried, one of the tricks that I had early on was to just avoid topics that anybody else was talking about. And then even if the joke wasn't the funniest, I got credit for being original. And I don't know if this will work for every comment, but I know coming up early two thousands in the back half at a Def jam era to be a black comic, there wasn't talking about fucking and sucking and weed and you have the been so Brogan, like I just, I didn't touch none of that shit. So to a mainstream Booker it was just, Oh wow. He did a joke about suicide. Okay, well let's look. Yeah, look Kim, well there's such a triplet jokes that it was just weird off-brand shit, but still finding funny in that this such

Speaker 4:          02:46:17       to pick on tried and Truven tried and proven subjects because you know that work, you know, and you're scared in the beginning, right?

Speaker 3:          02:46:24       Yeah. You start, you see, I feel like you start as a weird image. Like my early, my first few years of comedy was this weird Martin Lawrence, Doug, Stan hope hybrid child. Like, I dunno, it was terrible. It's very terrible. But I started noticing that when Blake, the first thing I needed to do with the first objective when I got on was to, all right, all the road bookers say you got to get a TV critic, you get to get a TV credit and then I can pay you more. All right. Well the only thing that was booking people on irregular was comic view. So BTS comic view became the path, but then I didn't get comic view like two, three years in a row and I looked at the material, I submit it versus the material that was being performed. It was guys doing better versions of the same topics as me.

Speaker 3:          02:47:13       So all right. This year we're going to try doing different topics from everybody. So I watched comic view for a whole year, kept a log of every topic that was touched on for every episode and just never did jumps about those topics. Wow. So you actually wrote it out. Yeah. Every week. Come of you came on every night though. I remember back in like 2000 2001 come of, you came on Monday through Friday and it was six comics and episode, so every week you had a cross section of what 40 motherfuckers were talking about. Wow. For 12 weeks. And that's a shit ton of comedy. That's a shit ton of topics and you'd be surprised. There's a lot of repetition and overlap. So by simply not talking about that shit, it's enough to get you a little bit right. It's no different than what's happening now with the alt scene. You're just a different delivery. You're a different cadence. You have a different look. Being different is almost as important as being funny now. Yes. I don't think that one, I don't think they'd be in different, should we prioritize over being funny? But if you're different and you're fucking hilarious, then you,

Speaker 4:          02:48:12       yeah. People appreciate it for sure. Just like any other John rhe of art, whether it's music or cinema, anything being different is, is rewarding.

Speaker 3:          02:48:20       That's why I've always liked emo Phillips, man. Really? Yeah, that's what I came on. Well, I just wanted to do the, and the cadence was never

Speaker 4:          02:48:32       typical. Right. That shit just, I'll say, all right. That's at minimum it's different. So he's challenging himself, so I'm going to try that feels long. Yeah. Dio Vaughn's got Theo comedy, like Theo complex. You can't imitate that. Like the only way that shit works is if it comes out of Theo's mouth. It doesn't even make sense coming out to someone else.

Speaker 3:          02:48:53       CEO gets a laugh on, he gets a laugh on the setup and he gets a laugh on the pause and the pause is that anticipatory gate like you already know. They already know what's going to be good and they should go out there to get the ah, yeah. Like he's,

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       he's good man. Yeah, he's real good. And I watched that guy turned a corner man about two, three years ago. He just hit his groove and he went full mullet. Wow. He had a mullet before, but it was, he just found that groove, like whatever it is that made him, he found what it is. They found the frequency and then he just hit into it. And very, very, very original. You'd never hear him talking about like stuff that other people have talked about. There's a New York guy like that, Martin Norman. Martin Norman has a way. Sure. A lock. Love Mark. Norman pivot is coming on soon. He's up as on here a couple of weeks. He's great. Norman just knows how to pivot in a way you think is going this way and it's just a basketball crossover. Very good writer. Very good writer. Well, listen, man, I've got to wrap this up, but uh, this is awesome. I really appreciate it. I'm glad we finally did it. Thank you so much. It was awesome. Thank you Joe robe. Enjoyed your work for a long time. So glad to have you on here, man. You know, when the Vietnam joke gets worked out, let it know. Let us know. All right. Bye buddy.
