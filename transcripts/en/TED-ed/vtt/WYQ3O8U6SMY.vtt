00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:08.996
In the winter of 1995,

00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:15.081
scientists pointed the Hubble Telescope
at an area of the sky near the Big Dipper,

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:21.146
a spot that was dark and out of the way
of light pollution from surrounding stars.

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:25.975
The location was apparently empty,
and the whole endeavor was risky.

00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:29.095
What, if anything, was going to show up?

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.816
Over ten consecutive days,

00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:36.867
the telescope took close to 150 hours
of exposure of that same area.

00:00:36.867 --> 00:00:40.924
And what came back 
was nothing short of spectacular:

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:44.876
an image of over 1,500 distinct galaxies

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:49.006
glimmering in a tiny sliver 
of the universe.

00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:53.007
Now, let's take a step back to understand
the scale of this image.

00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:54.927
If you were to take a ballpoint pen

00:00:54.927 --> 00:00:58.576
and hold it at arm's length 
in front of the night sky,

00:00:58.576 --> 00:01:00.597
focusing on its very tip,

00:01:00.597 --> 00:01:07.694
that is what the Hubble Telescope captured
in its first Deep Field image.

00:01:07.694 --> 00:01:08.587
In other words,

00:01:08.587 --> 00:01:13.838
those 3,000 galaxies were seen 
in just a tiny speck of the universe,

00:01:13.838 --> 00:01:17.347
approximately one two-millionth
of the night sky.

00:01:17.347 --> 00:01:18.947
To put all this in perspective,

00:01:18.947 --> 00:01:22.767
the average human measures
about 1.7 meters.

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:26.777
With Earth's diameter 
at 12,700 kilometers,

00:01:26.777 --> 00:01:31.918
that's nearly 7.5 million humans
lined up head to toe.

00:01:31.918 --> 00:01:37.897
The Apollo 8 astronauts flew a distance
of 380,000 kilometers to the moon.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:43.738
And our relatively small Sun has a
diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers,

00:01:43.738 --> 00:01:46.827
or 110 times the Earth's diameter.

00:01:46.827 --> 00:01:48.058
A step further,

00:01:48.058 --> 00:01:52.719
the Milky Way holds somewhere 
between 100 to 400 billion stars,

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.398
including our Sun.

00:01:54.398 --> 00:01:59.118
And each glowing dot of a galaxy captured
in the Deep Field image

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:03.348
contains billions of stars
at the very least.

00:02:03.348 --> 00:02:06.148
Almost a decade after taking
the Deep Field image,

00:02:06.148 --> 00:02:09.549
scientists adjusted the optics
on the Hubble Telescope

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.869
and took another long exposure
over a period of about four months.

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.990
This time, they observed 10,000 galaxies.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.130
Half of these galaxies have since been
analyzed more clearly

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.449
in what's known as 
the eXtreme Deep Field image,

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.670
or XDF.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.349
By combining over ten years 
of photographs,

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.880
the XDF shows galaxies so distant

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.330
that they're only 
one ten-billionth the brightness

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.160
that the human eye can perceive.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.140
So, what can we learn about the universe
from the Deep Field images?

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.552
In a study of the universe, space and time
are inextricably linked.

00:02:47.552 --> 00:02:50.490
That's because of 
the finite speed of light.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.520
So the Deep Field images are like
time machines to the ancient universe.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.750
They reach so far into space and time

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.160
that we can observe galaxies
that existed over 13 billion years ago.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.611
This means we're looking
at the universe as it was

00:03:05.611 --> 00:03:09.141
less than a billion years 
after the Big Bang,

00:03:09.141 --> 00:03:13.664
and it allows scientists to research
galaxies in their infancy.

00:03:13.664 --> 00:03:17.990
The Deep Field images have also shown
that the universe is homogeneous.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.633
That is, images taken at different
spots in the sky look similar.

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:25.841
That's incredible when we think about
how vast the universe is.

00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:30.151
Why would we expect it to be the same
across such huge distances?

00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:33.295
On the scale of a galaxy, 
let alone the universe,

00:03:33.295 --> 00:03:36.392
we're smaller than 
we can readily comprehend,

00:03:36.392 --> 00:03:38.221
but we do have the capacity to wonder,

00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:39.206
to question,

00:03:39.206 --> 00:03:40.251
to explore,

00:03:40.251 --> 00:03:41.292
to investigate,

00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:42.761
and to imagine.

00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:45.362
So the next time you stand gazing up
at the night sky,

00:03:45.362 --> 00:03:49.252
take a moment to think about the enormity
of what is beyond your vision,

00:03:49.252 --> 00:03:52.502
out in the dark spaces between the stars.
