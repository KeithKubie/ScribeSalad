00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.670
The War of the Worlds Mass Panic (That Never
Happened)

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:17.840
On October 30, 1938, from the Mercury Theater
in New York City, Orson Welles broadcasted

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.980
a “modernized” radio play of H.G. Wells’
(no relation) 1898 novel “War of the Worlds.”

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.910
For the last three quarters of the century,
we’ve been told that this fictionalized

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.920
CBS broadcast sent Americans into a panic;
that citizens across the country did not realize

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.090
that this was science-fiction (despite the
fact that it was explicitly stated at the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.800
beginning and twice during the broadcast)
and thought the USA was under attack from

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.670
an invading Martian army.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.040
Littered with realistic simulated news reports
and “eyewitness accounts,” the hour long

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.440
broadcast was innovative and an extremely
entertaining way to present the story.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.789
But the thing is, no such nation-wide panic
actually occurred.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.360
While there were certainly many exceptions,
documented evidence indicates most who listened

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.930
did know it was a dramatization and were completely
aware that New Jersey was not being destroyed

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.300
by visitors from space.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.340
Further, as you’ll soon see, the broadcast
didn’t have very good ratings when it first

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.530
aired; so even if everyone who listened had
thought it was real, it wouldn’t have resulted

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.860
in the level of mass hysteria commonly spoken
of since.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.869
War of the Worlds first appeared in magazines,
simultaneously, in the UK and US in 1897.

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.210
It was published as a book in 1898 and is
considered one of the most influential pieces

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.350
of science-fiction ever written.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.220
The Englishmen H.G. (Herbert George) Wells
was already quite a famous author by the time

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.369
he got to Martians attacking Earth.

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.160
In 1895, he published The Time Machine (as
well as popularizing the term), The Island

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:58.210
of Dr. Moreau in 1896, and The Invisible Man
in 1897 (directly before War of Worlds), securing

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.780
his position at the time as the world’s
best, if not truly the first, science-fiction

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.780
writer.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.509
After War of the Worlds, he went on to write
several more books, including the non-fiction

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.640
best-selling three-volume Outline of History.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.370
As you might have guessed from all this, H.G.
Wells was quite a well-known writer in 1938

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.660
and his novels, including War of the Worlds,
were widely read on both continents.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.349
So, when Orson adapted the novel in 1938,
there was nothing particularly new about the

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.690
story itself.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.170
The differences came from the medium and structure
of the story-telling.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.410
While the 1938 version told the story of the
destruction of New Jersey, the 1898 original

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.790
takes place in England, or more specifically,
in Surrey and London.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.580
Another significant difference between the
two works is that H.G.’s version is told

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.700
through the eyes of an unnamed protagonist
and his brother.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.760
Orson’s is told through staged news broadcasts
and reports.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.760
For instance,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.600
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a grave announcement
to make.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.000
Incredible as it may seem, both the observations
of science and the evidence of our eyes lead

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.230
to the inescapable assumption that those strange
beings who landed in the Jersey farmlands

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.909
tonight are the vanguard of an invading army
from the planet Mars.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.709
As for the number of listeners, as Orson stepped
to the microphone in the evening of the day

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.640
before Halloween in 1938, there were already
several well-known factors that potentially

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.370
were going to affect the number of people
who were actually going to tune in to the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.020
broadcast that evening.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.300
For one, the very popular Chase and Sanborn
Hour, a comedy variety show hosted by the

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.430
ventriloquist Edgar Bergin, was airing at
the exact same time on a competing radio station,

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.430
NBC.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.510
Additionally, several major CBS affiliates
(including in Boston) preempted the broadcast

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.130
for local commercial programing.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.090
Further, as the program progressed, the C.E.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.220
Hopper Company called approximately five thousand
households to ask the question, “To what

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.110
program are you listening?”

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.110
C.E.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.409
Hopper was an American company that measured
radio ratings for the major networks to see

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.939
how much they could charge for advertising
during a particular program, much like Nielsen

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:11.529
ratings today for television (in fact, A.C.
Nielsen bought C.E.

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:13.000
Hopper in 1950).

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.440
It turns out, only two percent answered something
in reference to War of the Worlds on CBS.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.430
None of these people spoke of any “news
broadcast” or “special bulletin about

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.560
aliens” either.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.340
So besides very few listening in, it would
seem those who were all knew it was just a

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.500
story, which perhaps shouldn’t be a surprise
considering it was announced at the beginning

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.280
and twice during the broadcast.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.810
So, how did the “The radio broadcast of
War of the Worlds created mass hysteria”

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.680
myth get perpetuated?

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.550
In short, the media.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.979
Newspaper headlines across the country gave
the impression that panic gripped the nation:

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.680
“Radio Fake Scares Nation,” read the Chicago
Herald and Examiner; “Fake Radio War Stirs

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.780
Terror Through US,” was reported in the
New York Daily News (accompanied with a picture

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.030
of a frightened man and a woman with an arm
sling whose caption read “war” victim.);

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.580
“Terror by Radio,” could be found in a
New York Times editorial.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.800
The newspaper industry had quite a bone to
pick with the new medium of radio.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.020
As W. Joseph Campbell of American University
wrote in the BBC News magazine in 2011 (for

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.440
the 73rd anniversary of the broadcast), “…the
so-called ‘panic broadcast’ brought newspapers

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.990
an exceptional opportunity to censure radio,
a still-new medium that was becoming a serious

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.840
competitor in providing news and advertising.”

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.880
That same New York Times editorial with the
inflammatory headline had this to say about

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.410
its new competitor, “Radio is new but it
has adult responsibilities.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.410
It has not mastered itself or the material
it uses.”

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.320
Additionally, the newspapers also wanted to
sell papers and what better way to do that

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.740
than using words like “terror” or “panic”
or “war.”

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.240
Using anecdotal and scattered stories, they
made it seem like many citizens were ready

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.540
to bear arms against the alien invaders, but
in truth those stories were either very few

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.259
and far between or in some cases completely
made up.

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.889
According to law enforcement and hospital
documentation from the night in question,

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.620
there were no reports of people taking to
the streets with guns, no one taken to the

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.240
hospital on the account of the radio broadcast,
and no known person committing suicide as

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.020
a result of the broadcast.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:25.350
The only noticeable effect was that law enforcement
saw a spike in calls in the New Jersey area

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.880
particularly (the site of the supposed attack)
on the evening in question, with most simply

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.460
asking whether the broadcast was a hoax and
calling to find out more information.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.669
As David Miller points out in his textbook
Introduction to Collective Behavior,

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.509
Some callers requested information…

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:43.860
Some people called to find out where they
could go to donate blood.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.910
Some callers were simply angry that such a
realistic show was allowed on the air, while

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:53.360
others called CBS to congratulate Mercury
Theater for the exciting Halloween program.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.870
But in the end, there was no massive panic
and the spike in calls to the police is one

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.580
of the few bits of evidence we have that at
least a small percentage of the listeners

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.810
had concerns or complaints over the broadcast.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.979
Quite simply, newspapers created the “panic”
after the fact (including U.S. newspapers

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:15.849
writing nearly 13,000 articles on it over
the next month), the public swallowed up the

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:22.009
newspaper’s reports, and radio and CBS particularly
were happy to embrace the claims as a demonstration

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:26.819
of the power of the new medium, which was
good for advertising dollars and ratings.

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:31.319
Orson Welles himself believed there had been
a mass-panic, rather than simply as it was-

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:34.919
a small percentage of the small percentage
of the U.S. population listening in believing

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:39.650
it was real for a little while despite that
during the broadcast it was stated that it

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:40.650
wasn’t.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.280
The myth of the nation-wide panic has perpetuated
itself ever since.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.550
As to the motivation behind presenting the
story as real, Orson Welles had this very

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:55.150
pertinent thing to say (considering the misinformation
the newspapers would spread about the broadcast),

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:00.099
We were fed up with the way in which everything
that came over this new magic box, the radio,

00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:01.440
was being swallowed.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.600
People you know do suspect what they read
in the newspapers and what people tell them,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.560
but when the radio came, and I suppose now
television, anything that came through that

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.030
new machine was believed.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.419
So in a way our broadcast was an assault on
the credibility of that machine.

00:08:16.419 --> 00:08:21.470
We wanted people to understand that they shouldn’t
take any opinion predigested, and they shouldn’t

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.280
swallow everything that came through the tap
whether it was radio or not.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:36.260
But as I say it was only a partial experiment,
we had no idea the extent 

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:49.260
of 
the thing…
