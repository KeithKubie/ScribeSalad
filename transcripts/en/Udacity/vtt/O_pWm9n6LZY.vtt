00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.870
Now for an exercise.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.910
No more programming Turing machines.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.720
Instead I want you to try to figure out
how long the simulation process takes.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.340
We'll let m be a multitape
Turing machine, and

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.220
we'll let s be its single tape
equivalent, as we've defined it.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.910
If on input x m holds after t steps,
and we can assume t is greater than

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.210
the size of the input, then the single
tape machine halts after how many steps?

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.910
Give the most appropriate bound.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.159
This question isn't easy, so spend
a few minutes thinking about it and

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.780
take a guess.
