00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.744
- [Voiceover] So we're told
that h of x is equal to the

00:00:02.744 --> 00:00:07.399
negative cube root of
three x minus six plus 12.

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:10.656
And what we wanna figure out
is, what is the inverse of h?

00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:11.631
So what is...

00:00:12.618 --> 00:00:16.947
What is h inverse of x
going to be equal to?

00:00:16.947 --> 00:00:17.928
And like always, pause the video

00:00:17.928 --> 00:00:19.153
and see if you could figure it out.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:22.412
Well in previous videos,
we've emphasized that

00:00:22.412 --> 00:00:23.733
what an inverse does is...

00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:27.058
A function will map from a
domain to a range and you can

00:00:27.058 --> 00:00:29.635
think of the inverse as
mapping back from that point

00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:32.073
in the range to where you started from.

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:34.244
So one way to think about it
is, we want to come up with

00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:37.437
an expression that unwinds
whatever this does.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:41.697
So if we say that y, if we
say that y is equal to h of x,

00:00:41.697 --> 00:00:45.424
or we could say that y is
equal to the negative of

00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:50.424
the cube root of three
x minus six plus 12.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.752
This gives us our y.

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:54.812
And you can think of y
as a member of the range.

00:00:54.812 --> 00:00:58.109
A member of the range in
terms of what our input is.

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.961
In terms of a member of the domain.

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:01.958
We wanna go the other way around,

00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.883
so what we could do is we
could try to solve for x.

00:01:04.883 --> 00:01:07.414
If we solve for x, we're
gonna have some expression

00:01:07.414 --> 00:01:09.097
that's a function of y.

00:01:09.097 --> 00:01:11.175
We're gonna have that being equal to x.

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:13.554
And so that would be the inverse mapping.

00:01:13.554 --> 00:01:14.937
Another way you could do that,

00:01:14.937 --> 00:01:18.975
is you could just swap x
and y and then solve for y.

00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:20.381
But that's a little bit less intuitive

00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:22.017
that this is actually the inverse.

00:01:22.017 --> 00:01:24.897
So actually, let's just solve for x here.

00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:26.836
So the first thing we might want to do is,

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:29.552
let's isolate this cube root on,

00:01:29.552 --> 00:01:30.632
let's say to the right hand side.

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:33.045
So let's subtract 12 from both sides.

00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:38.028
And we would get y minus 12
is equal to the cube root of,

00:01:38.028 --> 00:01:39.963
it's actually the negative cube root.

00:01:39.963 --> 00:01:40.833
Don't wanna lose track of that.

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:44.014
Negative cube root of three x minus six

00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:46.825
and then we subtracted 12
from both sides so that 12

00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:49.624
is now, that 12 is now gone.

00:01:49.624 --> 00:01:52.668
And now what we would do, what
we could multiply both sides

00:01:52.668 --> 00:01:55.804
by negative one, that might
get rid of this negative here.

00:01:55.804 --> 00:01:58.174
So we multiply both sides by negative one.

00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:03.682
And then we multiply this
times a negative one.

00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:04.877
On the left hand side,

00:02:04.877 --> 00:02:07.582
we'll that's the same thing as 12 minus y.

00:02:07.582 --> 00:02:12.582
And on the right hand side,
we're gonna get the cube root of

00:02:12.904 --> 00:02:15.504
three x minus six.

00:02:15.504 --> 00:02:16.691
And now and this is gonna be

00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:18.803
a little bit algebraically hairy.

00:02:18.803 --> 00:02:21.337
We wanna cube both sides.

00:02:21.337 --> 00:02:22.742
So let's do that.

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:24.761
So let's cube both sides.

00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:26.933
And actually it doesn't get
that algebraically hairy

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:30.104
because I don't actually
have to figure what this,

00:02:30.104 --> 00:02:31.490
I don't have to expand it,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.424
I could just leave it as 12 minus y cubed.

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:35.555
And so if we cube both
sides on the left hand side,

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:39.108
we're just left with 12 minus y cubed.

00:02:39.108 --> 00:02:41.411
And on the right hand side,
well you take the cube

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.397
of the cube root, you're
just gonna be left with

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:46.811
what you originally had
under the cube root sign,

00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:48.029
I guess you could say.

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:50.799
And now we wanna solve for x,
let's add six to both sides.

00:02:51.892 --> 00:02:56.759
So we're gonna get 12
minus y cubed plus six

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.757
is equal to three x.

00:02:58.757 --> 00:03:02.211
Now we could divide both
sides by 3 and we're all done.

00:03:03.457 --> 00:03:05.977
Divide both sides by three and we get...

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:07.830
We get x...

00:03:09.414 --> 00:03:13.783
Is equal to 12 minus y

00:03:13.783 --> 00:03:18.732
to the third power plus six over three.

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:22.041
And so this, if you have a member of the,

00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:22.958
one way to think about it,

00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.849
if you have a member of the range y,

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.659
this is going to map it back
to the x that would have gotten

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.052
you to that member of the range.

00:03:29.052 --> 00:03:31.296
So this is the inverse
function so we could write,

00:03:31.296 --> 00:03:35.799
h inverse of y is equal to this business.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.664
12 minus y cubed

00:03:38.664 --> 00:03:42.017
plus six over three.

00:03:42.017 --> 00:03:43.912
And like we said in previous videos,

00:03:43.912 --> 00:03:46.856
this choice of calling y the input,

00:03:46.856 --> 00:03:48.938
well it could be anything,
we could call that star.

00:03:48.938 --> 00:03:52.986
We could say h inverse of
star and we're just naming

00:03:52.986 --> 00:03:55.962
our input star is equal to 12

00:03:55.962 --> 00:04:00.559
minus star cubed plus six over three.

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:03.854
Or if we just want to call
the input x, we could just say

00:04:03.854 --> 00:04:06.165
h inverse of x and once again,

00:04:06.165 --> 00:04:09.166
this is just what we're calling the input,

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:12.339
is equal to 12 minus y to the third

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:15.350
plus six over three.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.588
Might be a little bit
confusing because now,

00:04:17.588 --> 00:04:20.425
in theory x could be considered
a member of the range

00:04:20.425 --> 00:04:23.731
and we're mapping back to
a member of the domain.

00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:27.987
But either way, we can
call the input function

00:04:27.987 --> 00:04:30.190
to a function partially anything.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.061
But there you have it, that
is our inverse function,

00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:35.298
that essentially unwinds what
our original function does.
