Galileo and the reason for that and the

Galileo and the reason for that and the
 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.670
Galileo and the reason for that and the
reason I think least to my mind he's the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680
reason I think least to my mind he's the
 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.800
reason I think least to my mind he's the
greatest scientist is the way we do

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
greatest scientist is the way we do
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.909
greatest scientist is the way we do
science now is to actually have ideas

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919
science now is to actually have ideas
 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.319

that we can test with experiments and

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329
that we can test with experiments and
 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.090
that we can test with experiments and
it's this it's called the scientific

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.360
it's this it's called the scientific
method so critical to making science

thanks you know here's the way things

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
thanks you know here's the way things

must be and of course that's a recipe

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040
must be and of course that's a recipe
 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.280
must be and of course that's a recipe
for making a lot of mistakes and for

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290
for making a lot of mistakes and for
 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.090
for making a lot of mistakes and for
having a false impression of the world

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
having a false impression of the world
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.050

and we go away oh did was to say okay I

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
and we go away oh did was to say okay I
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.300
and we go away oh did was to say okay I
have an idea but I think the way to go

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
have an idea but I think the way to go
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.530
have an idea but I think the way to go
is to do experiments and to test the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540
is to do experiments and to test the
 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.950
is to do experiments and to test the
ideas and that I think is is the bedrock

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960
ideas and that I think is is the bedrock
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.350
ideas and that I think is is the bedrock
upon which modern science is built also

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360
upon which modern science is built also

I mean he took a lot of heat for what he

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
I mean he took a lot of heat for what he
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.680
I mean he took a lot of heat for what he
did in his lifetime from the Catholic

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690
did in his lifetime from the Catholic
 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.060
did in his lifetime from the Catholic
Church and and he was operating under a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070
Church and and he was operating under a
 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.330
Church and and he was operating under a
pretty extreme circumstances and given

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
pretty extreme circumstances and given
 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.280
pretty extreme circumstances and given
those circumstances I think he performed

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
those circumstances I think he performed
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.430
those circumstances I think he performed
pretty darn well
