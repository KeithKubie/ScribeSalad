00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:04.136
&gt;&gt;Mike: We're two teachers
at the same school.

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.346
Both of us teaching two
sections of geometry.

00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:11.546
And yet, even in the same school,
the variance can be so wide

00:00:11.546 --> 00:00:13.116
at how two people teach
the same lesson.

00:00:13.116 --> 00:00:16.656
And so our practice minimizes
that difference in how we teach,

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:19.776
so the kids get a more
equitable, stronger lesson.

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.676
I'm Mike, and I teach
Geometry, and Academic Numeracy

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.446
at Leadership Public
School of Hayward.

00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:28.156
&gt;&gt;Mike: And here's your challenge.

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:30.106
You're going to be silent.

00:00:30.776 --> 00:00:32.446
You're going to be right
there in your seats,

00:00:32.516 --> 00:00:36.266
and for the next minute-and-a-half,
I want you to think

00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:41.186
of at least three solutions
to this equation.

00:00:41.616 --> 00:00:45.136
&gt;&gt;And I collaborate regularly
with my co-teacher, Rose.

00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:46.686
&gt;&gt;My name is Rose.

00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:51.316
I teach Geometry and Pre-Calculus at
Leadership Public Schools in Hayward.

00:00:51.626 --> 00:00:53.916
&gt;&gt;So the definition,
all angles are equal.

00:00:55.456 --> 00:00:57.956
And more specifically like Aaron
said, they're all 60 degrees,

00:00:57.956 --> 00:00:59.766
and that's always going
to be the case.

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.766
They're always going
to be 60 degrees.

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:03.496
&gt;&gt;Mike: We're a network
of four schools,

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:06.046
and we're very much all
about trying new ideas.

00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:07.476
Succeed at some and fail at others,

00:01:07.476 --> 00:01:11.036
with the idea of eventually making
wide-scale change in our communities.

00:01:12.216 --> 00:01:15.616
On a daily basis, our goal
with the video camera,

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:18.446
besides general feedback,
is to build a library

00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:20.246
to match completely
with the curriculum.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.486
And we'd like full lessons.

00:01:21.486 --> 00:01:26.236
And we'd also like to edit
and code by practice or task.

00:01:26.236 --> 00:01:27.786
&gt;&gt;Rose: I try more things

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:29.546
when a video camera is
there, than when it's not.

00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:32.206
Because when it's not, you
get kind of comfortable

00:01:32.206 --> 00:01:34.796
in your every day trend of things.

00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:35.846
But when the camera is there,

00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:38.806
it forces you to want
to do something extra.

00:01:38.806 --> 00:01:43.976
And then you see that extra
thing actually make a difference.

00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:47.566
&gt;&gt;Mike: The way we
create that curriculum is

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:52.136
after Rose teaches a lesson, we will
meet, sit down, and for a minimum

00:01:52.136 --> 00:01:54.316
of 15 minutes a day
tear apart that lesson.

00:01:54.316 --> 00:01:55.546
We'll talk about the pacing.

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:57.386
&gt;&gt;And you got through
this in a timely fashion.

00:01:57.386 --> 00:01:59.456
It was really good to see
the pace at which you went

00:01:59.456 --> 00:02:00.806
through all -- was it six?

00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:01.576
[Rose:] Yeah.

00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:05.806
&gt;&gt;Mike: And we'll talk about expected
errors and missed conceptions.

00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:09.516
&gt;&gt;And this here would be at
least, I think it was valuable

00:02:09.516 --> 00:02:10.286
to take those two minutes.

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:11.756
&gt;&gt;Rose: Yeah, I agree.

00:02:11.906 --> 00:02:13.016
This is what they missed, at least.

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:14.876
&gt;&gt;Mike: So in the common
misunderstanding, missed conceptions,

00:02:14.876 --> 00:02:16.276
errors section of the teacher notes.

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:17.566
That definitely has to go in there.

00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:21.576
&gt;&gt;We'll edit, put sticky notes all
over them so we can make them better.

00:02:21.846 --> 00:02:23.466
She'll give me feedback;
I'll give her feedback.

00:02:23.636 --> 00:02:27.656
And that's how we continue
to have the curriculum evolve

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:29.496
and make it more precise
and powerful.

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:32.176
&gt;&gt;Rose: Teaching isn't just
about standing up there

00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:33.346
and giving them instruction.

00:02:33.346 --> 00:02:36.596
It's also about developing yourself,
so that they go to the next level.

00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:39.986
&gt;&gt;Mike: Last year, Rose and
I felt this relationship out,

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:44.146
and we got to a point where we felt
comfortable challenging each other.

00:02:44.786 --> 00:02:47.716
Sometimes arguing a lot; sometimes
supporting each other a lot.

00:02:47.716 --> 00:02:49.486
But all very productive.

00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:52.086
&gt;&gt;Rose: We're very open
to going to each other.

00:02:52.086 --> 00:02:55.196
And it's because we
have this camaraderie

00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:57.526
that took some time to form.

00:02:58.836 --> 00:02:59.526
&gt;&gt;Mike: With the benchmarks,

00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:03.186
I noticed that my classes were
under-performing her classes

00:03:03.186 --> 00:03:04.736
by an average of ten percent.

00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:08.856
And so I had to sit down and just
look at that data dispassionately.

00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:10.986
And as a competitive
person, that wasn't easy.

00:03:11.076 --> 00:03:13.316
I got into her classroom, and
I watched her teach a lesson,

00:03:13.316 --> 00:03:14.856
and then I went and tried
to teach the same thing.

00:03:14.856 --> 00:03:17.006
And then she would
come in and video me.

00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:18.686
Give me feedback.

00:03:18.926 --> 00:03:20.616
And this give and take,
back and forth,

00:03:20.616 --> 00:03:23.396
eventually helped me
refine my own practice.

00:03:23.396 --> 00:03:25.146
I was being a little too verbose.

00:03:25.296 --> 00:03:26.616
So I wasn't getting
through the whole lesson.

00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:29.546
And I wasn't getting to some
of the higher level tasks

00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:31.226
as consistently as she was.

00:03:31.226 --> 00:03:35.196
And when she saw this, and I
saw this, I was able to adjust,

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:38.216
make changes, and by the end of the
year, our data was indistinguishable.

00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:43.576
&gt;&gt;Rose: In order for any of
us to grow and be better,

00:03:43.716 --> 00:03:47.916
which ultimately means student
achievement, we need someone

00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:51.596
to tell us, "This is going well,
and this is not going so well.

00:03:51.596 --> 00:03:54.186
Here's a potential way to fix it."

00:03:54.546 --> 00:03:59.386
&gt;&gt;Mike: It's a reciprocal, positive
relationship, where we both improve

00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:02.566
from that feedback, and so this
type of relationship, I think,

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:05.946
is more or less the
secret to our success.
