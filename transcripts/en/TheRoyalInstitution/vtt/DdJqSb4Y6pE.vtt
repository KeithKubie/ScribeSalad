00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.410
 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.510
Exercise.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.050
Love it or hate it, we've
all got to do it.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.230
And it's thanks to a protein
called myoglobin that we can

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.170
extract oxygen from our red
blood cells and store it in

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.240
our muscles.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.420
Encoded by a gene on chromosome
22, myoglobin has a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.960
key role in providing oxygen for
the biochemical reactions

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.330
that keep us moving.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.430
The protein also has a very
significant place in the

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.720
history of 20th century
science, and it all

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.490
started with this.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.200
Here at the science museum in
London is an early model of

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.770
the myoglobin molecule.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.520
And while it may not look
very impressive--

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.900
indeed, the model is
rather disgusting--

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.260
it represents a landmark
achievement.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.120
This, the culmination of over
20 years' work by scientists

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.710
working in Britain, is the very
first protein structure

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.446
to have been seen
by humankind.

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:17.030
 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.650
The model was built in 1958 by
John Kendrew using information

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.960
collected by firing
x-rays at crystals

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.060
of sperm whale myoglobin.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.760
By measuring the pattern of
spots generated as the

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.750
myoglobin crystals scattered the
x-rays into many different

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.400
directions, he was able
to calculate the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.210
structure of the molecule.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.330
This early model is
relatively crude.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.130
It only shows the overall
shape of the protein.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.780
But that's because Kendrew's
first crystals

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.620
weren't very good.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.740
But the technique, x-ray
crystallography, would come to

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.840
revolutionise the way that
we study biology.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.770
And since 1958, it has allowed
scientists to work out the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.620
structures of many different
biological molecules from the

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.020
enzymes that digest our food,
to the ion channels that

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.000
conduct electric signals
in our brains.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.250
 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.590
Today in my lab, we still use
many of the same techniques

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.660
that Kendrew first applied
to myoglobin.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.710
 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.570
Within a few years, he had
improved his original crystals

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.950
and was able to reveal the true
complexity of myoglobin's

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.490
atomic structure, unveiling its
beautiful helices and the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.730
precise arrangement of bonds
between its atoms.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.520
 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.230
You can now see exactly how the
protein chain falls around

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.710
the porphyrin group to create
a binding site for a single

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.960
molecule of oxygen.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.420
 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.310
One of the most interesting
things about this early work

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.670
was that when Max Perutz applied
crystallography to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.090
study horse haemoglobin, the
molecule that transports

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.520
oxygen in red blood cells, he
could see for the first time

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.890
that it was very similar in
structure to myoglobin.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.600
 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.800
This showed not just the
evolutionary relationship at

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.700
the molecular level between
different species--

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.200
horses and whales--

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.820
but also that evolution could
adapt a relatively simple

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.320
structure and give it a more
complex form and function.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.070
In fact, if you take a glance
to the right of Kendrew's

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.110
model at the science museum,
you'll see Max Perutz's

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.700
structure of haemoglobin, which
is made of four chains,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.240
each of which looks very
like myoglobin.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.220
From that humble, rather hideous
start in 1958, it's

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.690
amazing how far we've
travelled.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.050
Over 90,000 structures of
protein, DNA, and RNA

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.120
molecules have now been
determined by x-ray

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.850
crystallography, giving us
detailed insights into how

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.670
life operates at the
molecular level.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:31.765
