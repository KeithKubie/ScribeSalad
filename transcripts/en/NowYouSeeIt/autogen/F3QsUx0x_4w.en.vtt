00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
Lets say you think of an amazing three act story

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.980
that you want to create.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.020
"I think I just"

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:06.600
"yeah"

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.820
"I just had an idea"

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.000
The first question you have to ask yourself is

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.960
What do you make?

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.840
Should your story be written as a movie or a novel?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.380
It's a simple question, but the answer gets complicated

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.000
because of how often stories get retold in different artforms

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.260
The majority of highest grossing and most critically acclaimed movies

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.980
were adapted from novels and many unforgettable stories became famous

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.820
both as a novel and as a film

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.680
but each of these stories is presented differently depending on the medium used

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.780
so what's the difference between telling a story through a film and through a novel

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.480
What can a novel convey well that a film may have trouble with?

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.500
When I was in high school, I read "How to Write a Movie in 21 Days."

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.540
The first chapter of the book provides an interesting thought experiment

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.160
to consider the differences between a novel and a screenplay.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.360
The experiment asks you to think of a scene and write that scene both as a novel and as a movie.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.280
Consider a scene where a robber breaks into a home to steal something.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.240
In a novel, we may get the inner thoughts of the robber before the robbery.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.300
The robber and his predicament get described to us through various literary devices.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.940
no other option and with the shaking
hand he lifted the hammer and smashed

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.420
the window shattering the glass in his
expectations for a quiet life free of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.940
Where the novel stands out is its ability to put us in the thoughts and perspective of a character so smoothly.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.940
Of course, movies do the same thing.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.720
Movies narrate, have voice-overs and even talk directly to the viewer

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.700
but the novel can transition from thought to action so seemlessly

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.940
to the point where the vast majority of some novels can take place completely within the mind of a character

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.460
and the story can remain gripping and moving.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.000
In movies, action is more common than just thinking.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.560
"Alright, you just need to calm down. We need to think for a second."

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.560
"We just need to think this out."

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.560
"Fuck thinking, we need to act."

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.640
It's rare for a movie to spend the whole time narrating because it would get boring

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.120
but novels are different.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.460
Instead of showing a character, a novel completely inhabits the mind of a character in the world of the narrative.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.120
Novels can tells us how a person is feeling, tell us what something looks like, or what something tastes like

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.120
in a way a movie has trouble with.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.280
"Catcher in the Rye" wouldn't work very well as a movie because movies are best at showing action and movement.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.860
The vast majority of "Catcher in the Rye" takes place inside the mind of Holden, and little action occurs as Holden ponders.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.380
So when a scene consists of nothing but Holden sitting on a train thinking,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.540
the novel is the best method for bringing Holden's thoughts and character to life

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.580
While there are definitely good movies that showcase a character's thoughts,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.340
novels do it better.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.800
In the adaptation of "The Hunger Games" from the novel to the big screen, the writers had to do away with a lot of what was going on inside Katniss's head

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.800
because it didn't transition well to screen.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.560
In "The Hunger Games," Katniss has to fake a romance with Peeta to win affection from the viewers

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.120
and in the first two books, she constantly thinks about Gale back home and has an inner struggle about whether or not she likes Gale or Peeta

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:44.300
The movies almost entirely do away with this plotline in the earlier films because it's really awkward adding love triangle to a film that has no action associated with it.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.580
Movies aren't good at thoughts. They're good at actions.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.760
The "Great Gatsby" film adaptation has several differences with the novel and it capitalizes on what movies do better than books.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.100
They show. To show Gatsby's anxiety towards seeing Daisy,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.760
he orders a ridiculous amount of flowers for the house and hires dozens of servants to redecorate Nick's lawn.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.000
The visuals show Gatsby's overpreparation and anxiety from seeing Daisy.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.660
The scene of him waiting for Daisy has the ever-increasing volume of the time ticking in the background as we get closer and closer to the clock.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.820
"I can't wait all day. I'm leaving"

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:25.740
Along with DiCaprio's performance all the elements of the scene--the editing, sound, visuals and acting--convey the sense of anxiety Gatsby has.
The novel does it a little bit differently. The

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.380
novel has no flowers delivered and only
one of Gatsby servants comes to mow the

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.600
lawn. Instead of representing nerves
through big visuals we get told about

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.960
Gatsby's nerves through literary devices.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.080
Both scenes are written very similarly with
almost the same dialogue and action but

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.700
the subtle differences between the
movie's visuals and the novel's

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.180
descriptions are how two different art
forms convey the same mood. The novel

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.260
tells us about his nerves through
description and the movie shows us his

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.220
nerves through editing, lighting, sound
and acting. So what would a robbery look like

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.200
as a movie? To play to the strengths of
film when it comes to conveying the

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.110
robber's hesitation and regret we would
show rather than tell. Maybe we get a

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.670
close-up of his trembling hand or sweat on his brow. Maybe he'd be dressed in

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.550
everyday attire instead of the typical
robber gear. The shots could be close ups

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.440
and point-of-view shots to place us into
his perspective and empathize with him

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.340
and the shots could be edited very quickly to up the pace and anxiety of the scene.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.690
These visuals are what would make the
story powerful. For the novel, metaphors

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.850
tone, hyperbole and all the other
countless literary techniques are the

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.310
key to telling a story and lighting,
camera angle, actor placement and other

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.780
cinematic techniques are how movies
show a story. Different techniques with

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.810
different strengths and weaknesses.
Movies show. Novels tell. Many people on

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.030
the internet loathe movies that don't stay
true to the novel's they are based on.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.860
There are a lot of reasons for the
changes from novel to screen like

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.370
fitting feature-length screen time and a
desire to appeal to a larger audience

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.780
but I think one key difference some
people miss is that movies can't always

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.180
replicate the mood of a novel because
movies have to present the story with

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.740
different techniques. Perhaps "The Great
Gatsby" wasn't a good adaptation because

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.300
it focused too heavily on the visuals of
the story and not the emotion behind it.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.690
Take this excerpt from the novel

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.320
That moment is recreated
in the movie like this

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.360
"He seemed to be reaching towards
something out there in the dark."

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.760
The movie doesn't come close to capturing the moment correctly. In the novel, Gatsby can

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.210
be seen trembling even from a distance
with both arms stretched out. It's

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.160
obviously a very personal moment for Gatsby, where he looks extremely desperate

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.010
almost pathetic with such dramatic body
posture. In the movie he just does this.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.320
No trembling. Just one arm. Not
embarrassing, not intimate. It's

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.780
completely casual and this is the whole
point of the scene. It's supposed to be a

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.270
very uncomfortable moment to see Gatsby's desperate and weak side but the

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.460
movie recreates this moment totally wrong. The movie's visuals made Gatsby look so

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.430
cool and his life so dazzling that we
miss how he's not just a cool rich guy

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.530
with a weakness for a girl. He's actually
an extremely empty, hollow failure that's

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.510
anything from great. The movie's visuals
along with the modern score made Gatsby's

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.460
character much less moving and pathetic
like the novel did. So sometimes the movie

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.090
gets it wrong. There are many more
examples where the movie does it write

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.680
and maybe even better. What better way to show the clamor of a foreign world than

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.200
to go from a world in black and white to
a world in color? What better way to show

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.820
a narrator dominating the scene than by
having him look straight at us and

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.039
introduce us to the world himself? What
I'm saying is that for every poor

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.180
adaptation there are dozens of examples
proving otherwise. Many stories work very

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.389
well on screen and off so I don't think
movie adaptations of a book are cursed

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.510
to be worse than the book. I just think
that sometimes the filmmaker doesn't

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.229
bring the emotion of the book onto the
screen properly. So the next time you

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:45.860
read a book or watch a movie

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.970
ask yourself does it show or tell?

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.970
"I know kung-fu."
