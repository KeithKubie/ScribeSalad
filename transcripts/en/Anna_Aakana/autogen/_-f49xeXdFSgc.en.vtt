00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
Hello there!

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.060
So I have had surprising amount of requests since i first started this internet thing

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.880
to go over my everyday makeup routine.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.600
And although by I'm no means a professional, I will leave that to Michelle Phans of the world.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.620
I was, like, why not? I show how I go from

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.120
this

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.520
to this

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.560
Now, to start off double your eyes with optimism

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.020
It's all about your prespective on the world,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.180
But you wanna be careful and not put to much optimism

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.900
or else you just be left with disappointment via your high expectations.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.780
I also like to line my optimism with little bit of something  that I call

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.420
'"I don't give a f#ck about outcomes"

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.100
Because the less that I care about result and  more I concentrate on the process of what I am doing

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.780
the happier I am.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.260
Now I like also to give myself a little bit of a cat-eye,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.340
than everyone I meet knows, that I own four cats and I love cats and

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.340
if you have a cat, we are automatic best friends

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.620
Now, when you are done with perspectives, start a lining, shaping, and filling in

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.540
your thoughts,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.040
because we are our thoughts,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.420
and if your thoughts are negative, self deprecating or judgemental

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.420
guess where its gonna go?

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.400
it's gonna trickle all the way down that beatiful face

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.520
and make you ugly.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.580
Next, we gonna blend. And blending is so important

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.340
because you wanna make  sure that everything is even and nicely spread out

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.840
so

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.400
intellectualy,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.960
emotionally,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.500
physically,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.000
spiritually,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.880
what are you doing to make sure that all of these areas are well maintained and balanced?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.660
Physically, are you taking care of your body? Diet and exercise wise?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.900
Intellectually, are you always try to stimulate your brain and learn new things?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.480
Emotionally, are you in touch with your feelings and making sure that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.520
you are working through what ever it is that you are going through?

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.060
and, of course, spiritually, are you in touch with whatever your meaningfull philosophy of life is?

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.360
and have you confirm the questions about morality, and your existence, and your purpose to

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.200
to a good degree.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.980
Kindness,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.760
I think we tend to overlooked this  the most.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.800
all we tend to do too much.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.840
by I mean can you imagine if we all try to outkind each other

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.440
how f#cking great the world would be?

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.100
But just make sure that you doing it in a modernly healthy amount

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.460
because I see a lot of girls, who a way too kind

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.460
for all the wrong reasons

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.740
and end up giving all of themselves away,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.740
and  are left with nothing.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.280
When you are in the end here, don't worry. One of the final steps,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.880
I believe, is what you say.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.640
Are you speaking in a way that you are would be proud of

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.640
Are you gossiping way too much?

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.100
I am really guilty of this.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.400
Are you being too insulting even in a joking way?

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.520
And last but not least is your self esteem.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.580
Is your self esteem low and flat, and unflattering?

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.800
Do you feel really ensecure and freezy?...

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.280
I am trying so hard to make  the language match\make up and this other thing

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.620
So forgive me if it doesn't make sense.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.820
But in other words does what you do out here match with what you feel in here

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.740
Because I believe confidence and how you carry yourself is going to effect more of your relationships

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.820
than anything else.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.900
If everyway you come from is from insecure and unadequate  feeling place

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.560
you are not gonna be a very fun person to be around,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.720
so make sure you take care of this when necessary

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.080
And I conclude the tutorial of how I put on my face

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.980
and the message of this video is pretty obvious,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.320
take care of this but also make sure  you're taking care of everything behind it as well.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.760
One thing I'm really like to do is a looking in the mirroir

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.040
and all imagine that I'm rapidly aging until I'm just a skull

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.540
like I am have flesh falling off, and, like, wrinkles, and have maggots is going through an eyehole and everything

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.840
And I don't know if it's exactly mentaly healthy but it's a nice reminder of the unpermanent nature of our flesh

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.320
Yeah

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.320
think about that

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.440
I will see you next week

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.820
Stay awesome Gotham

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.480
stay beatiful too

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.940
inside and out

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.940
Oh, yeah

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.000
Also  I lyed this not my everyday make up routine

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.740
It's only when I'm going on camera

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.340
when I'm not on camera I either have no make up on or just  have like a eyeliner or something

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.560
because your skin eats what's on it

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.600
sooooo

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.480
Yeah, i feel not up to a makeup artist

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.160
and I was like:" wow, my skin eats sh*t that's on it...

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.560
That's amazing..."
