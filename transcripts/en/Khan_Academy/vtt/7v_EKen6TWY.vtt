00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.730
- My name is Lisa LaBracio.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.380
I'm 32 years old.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.500
I am an Animation Director at TED-Ed.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.210
I've always wanted to
do animation so it just,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.340
at whatever point that in high school

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.220
when they tell you to
start looking at colleges

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.890
and where you might to go and
what you might want to do,

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.000
I was very tunnel
vision, this is the thing

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.840
that I am going to do.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.190
So I eventually decided
to go to the school

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.990
of Visual Arts which is
here in New York as well.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.400
And I chose that school because
they had a very specific

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.040
focus on traditional animation.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.670
Which, for whatever reason,
is the thing that I really

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.630
was sure I wanted to do.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.510
So not 3D, not computer
generated animation,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.430
but hand drawn, traditional cel animation.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.920
So I started school for that.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.700
And was in my first year of school,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.700
worked for an intern on an animated film,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.770
a feature animated film.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.330
That was a really cool project for me

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.440
because he was still
shooting that film on film

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.480
and animating it on cel,
even though a lot of places

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.620
had moved on he hadn't
taken to digital yet.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.030
So I kind of got this
opportunity to work on animation

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.440
in a truly old school way.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.480
I was painting cel's for him.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.450
And that was totally free
internship that, you know,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.660
I wasn't paid, I just
went three days a week

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.220
during the summer I commuted
to work on that project.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.370
I started an animation in the
independent animation world,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.500
which is the low end of that.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.130
Working on documentary
stuff, and short films,

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.730
festival films, projects,
ads when they come in,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.300
but all, you know, that's
the lower end of it.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.910
I work as an Animation Director
and as an animator there,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.720
so I actually work with
that educator to ideat.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.320
So to make that lesson, into
that script, into a video.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.930
As an Animation Director, what
will happen is that I will

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.170
get a script early on in the process,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.250
and from there it's my job to research

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.530
all of the information in
that script, as I'm trying to,

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.780
of course it's been fact checked

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.150
when it's come to me already,
so I'm not doing research

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.910
in the typical sense, but
more in a visual sense.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.420
So I'll look at other
artist's work for inspiration,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.530
I'll spend some time on
Pinterest, I'll be reading up

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.400
a lot of extra information
about the topic,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.170
looking at all the different theories,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.940
and communicating with
the educator quite a bit

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.490
to ask questions and get more information.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.650
Then from there I start to put together

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.400
a style board, or a look
and feel, for the project.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.140
So I'll start to decide what
method of animation I'll use

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.340
because I work in traditional animation,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.280
so I do stop motion, hand
drawn, a lot of tactile elements

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.130
as well, and then I'll
start to create characters

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.940
and story boards, and
then at that point decide

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.070
if I need other people on board with me

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.270
to help me execute the project.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.050
As Animation Directors at
TED-Ed we get creative freedom.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.730
So we do get to decide what
style and what way to execute

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.440
the project we get to do each time.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.140
Which is a major perk.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.840
That said, if anything that
we're doing is not in service

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.700
of the information.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.220
So it's very important that we're creating

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.210
an overall educational film.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.120
For what I do as an Animation Director,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.100
and especially working
on educational material,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.150
it's important to be really
strong with visual storytelling.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.670
And some of that is something
that just comes from

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.790
having watched a lot of content,

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.860
and some of it's from
having made the content,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.080
worked under directors
who made great decisions

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.070
that you watched, and
sometimes terrible decisions

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.750
that you watched, so that
way you can learn from that.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.880
But I would say that's the
number one important skill,

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.453
is that visual storytelling.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.100
Which comes with a sense of like,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.913
what's best to have on
screen to tell this story.
