but when we talked to developers the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
but when we talked to developers the
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.589
but when we talked to developers the
question that we get most often is how

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
question that we get most often is how
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.790
question that we get most often is how
to think about machine learning within

that they're solving using ml okay so
let's get started so the first question

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
let's get started so the first question
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.570
let's get started so the first question
is why use machine learning at all and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580
is why use machine learning at all and
 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.620
is why use machine learning at all and
to answer this I'd like to give a very

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
to answer this I'd like to give a very
 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.870
to answer this I'd like to give a very
simple example what if I was to ask you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
simple example what if I was to ask you
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.880
simple example what if I was to ask you
to write a program that tells the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
to write a program that tells the
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.830
to write a program that tells the
difference between an apple and an

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
difference between an apple and an
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.230
difference between an apple and an
orange you might start by writing manual

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
orange you might start by writing manual
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.569
orange you might start by writing manual
rules for example maybe you'd count the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579
rules for example maybe you'd count the
 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.069
rules for example maybe you'd count the
number of orange pixels in an image

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079
number of orange pixels in an image
 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.050
number of orange pixels in an image
versus the number of green pixels and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
versus the number of green pixels and
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060
versus the number of green pixels and
compare the ratio and that might work

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
compare the ratio and that might work
 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.760
compare the ratio and that might work
for these two images but the problem

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
for these two images but the problem
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.289
for these two images but the problem
with writing manual rules is that it

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
with writing manual rules is that it
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.020
with writing manual rules is that it
doesn't scale and for every rule that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
doesn't scale and for every rule that
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.030
doesn't scale and for every rule that
you can that you come up with I can find

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
you can that you come up with I can find
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.880
you can that you come up with I can find
an example that breaks that rule for

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
an example that breaks that rule for
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.100
an example that breaks that rule for
instance what if I gave you an image

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
instance what if I gave you an image
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.459
instance what if I gave you an image
that was in black and white or what if

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
that was in black and white or what if
 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.810
that was in black and white or what if
instead of a green apple

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
instead of a green apple
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.850
instead of a green apple
I gave you an image of a red apple

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860
I gave you an image of a red apple
 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.899
I gave you an image of a red apple
accounting for all of these exceptions

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909
accounting for all of these exceptions
 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.340
accounting for all of these exceptions
and writing all of these rules would

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350
and writing all of these rules would
 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.070
and writing all of these rules would
require lots and lots of code and if I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
require lots and lots of code and if I
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.869
require lots and lots of code and if I
gave you a similar problem in the future

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879
gave you a similar problem in the future
 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.760
gave you a similar problem in the future
like tell me the difference between

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
like tell me the difference between
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.950
like tell me the difference between
a raspberry and a strawberry you'd need

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960
a raspberry and a strawberry you'd need
 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.770
a raspberry and a strawberry you'd need
to start all over clearly there has to

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780
to start all over clearly there has to
 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.550
to start all over clearly there has to
be a better way rather than relying on

manual rules machine learning learns

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840
manual rules machine learning learns
 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.470
manual rules machine learning learns
from examples and the general way that a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
from examples and the general way that a
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.660
from examples and the general way that a
machine learning model works is you take

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670
machine learning model works is you take
 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.280
machine learning model works is you take
a set of inputs in this case labeled

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290
a set of inputs in this case labeled
 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.380
a set of inputs in this case labeled
images you feed them into a machine

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390
images you feed them into a machine
 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.400
images you feed them into a machine
learning model in this case a

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410
learning model in this case a
 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.010
learning model in this case a
convolutional neural network and the

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020
convolutional neural network and the
 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.720
convolutional neural network and the
model makes predictions and if the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730
model makes predictions and if the
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.760
model makes predictions and if the
predictions are incorrect what happens

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770
predictions are incorrect what happens
 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.920
predictions are incorrect what happens
is it actually slightly adjusts the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930
is it actually slightly adjusts the
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.810
is it actually slightly adjusts the
model to make it more accurate generally

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820
model to make it more accurate generally
 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.130
model to make it more accurate generally
the more data that you put into a

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140
the more data that you put into a
 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.330
the more data that you put into a
machine learning model it's a more

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340
machine learning model it's a more
 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.550
machine learning model it's a more
accurate it will be what this allows you

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560
accurate it will be what this allows you
 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.890
accurate it will be what this allows you
to do is then you can take a new set of

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900
to do is then you can take a new set of
 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.260
to do is then you can take a new set of

all of these features is that they can
 

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.120
all of these features is that they can
be quantified numerically we can for

we launched that experiment we actually
showed that there's a significant slope

00:20:49.739 --> 00:20:49.749
showed that there's a significant slope
 

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:54.079
