Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on it's Bill Bird and his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, May 9th, 2016 what's going on? How you go in there? Fuckos um, oh, freckles laying on his back trying to get rid of the cyanic. It's much better. Cyanic oh, cyanic a lot of people don't know that was the original lyrics to Panama. You know, David Lee wanted to say, you know, Sciatica and Eddie wanted to, and Alex wanted Panama and Michael Anthony, he's like, come on guys know, except he said it in a much higher voice. Can we fucking just get along here? And David ended up giving it to the brothers and that's what it, next thing you know, he was on his own room, just a Gigolo. So, um, yeah, my back's doing, uh, it's doing much better. Slowly but surely I've, I've kind of found out it's going to sort of work itself out if I just don't have to sit on my fucking ass from here to Jacksonville every other week. But that's the life that I live. You know, this is the weirdest injury ever. Usually if you're fucked up, sitting down, you know, and resting is a good thing. This thing, I just got to kind of get a lay down.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       I'm a mess. I'm taking that fucking Ibuprofen. I don't even, what the fuck it is? Some anti inflammatory thing. I'm stretching like a fucking NHL goalie, trying to get everything all fucking on done down there. But I don't know. I don't know what's going on. I don't know. But it is a, it is getting better. But I um, I flew all the way back today from a Jacksonville, uh, had a great time. And by the way, here's, here's some, uh, here's some advice for you when you're out on the road and you're going to get a breakfast. All right? Unless you're in some mom and pop place and he could see over the counter, you can watch them making your food, which I don't necessarily really like to do. If you're going to order eggs, don't ever order scrambled eggs. I know what you're thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       Why, Bill? Why, why wouldn't you do that? Cause they got a giant fucking VAT that they've made scrambled eggs or the fucking oatmeal of eggs. When you go to restaurants, it's just, it's like the trailer Zonea it's just that as you're fucking, you know, is your fucking eggs. Especially like this morning, the place where I went to Jacksonville, he aided the Chili's restaurant in Jacksonville, Florida. I know you guys. You're jealous, right? Oh my God. He gets to see everything. So me and Forrest Shah who murdered it all week, um, we ordered the, the whatever, the American breakfast or something there and your only option on the eggs was scrambled. Okay. Now if that's the fucking case, that means they got a giant VAT that was probably made, I don't know how long ago, whatever the health code violation is plus five minutes, you know, it's been sitting.

Speaker 1:          00:03:08       So you get the rubber fucking eggs and then bacon, they just make a bunch of fucking bacon. They got that sit to the side, you know, and then they had their bullshit hash browns, which, you know, it was already all the whole fucking thing was already made. The only thing that really tasted good was the biscuit. So, um, if you ever at the airport, you know, or if you're going down to the hotel lobby for their continental breakfast, um, you always never order scrambled eggs or the eggs over easy, get an Omelet, you know, um, do something like that where they just aren't going to just have this shit already made. Um, or you could do the gross shit with the syrup, but that's going to fuck your whole day up. I feel, I mean, not like I didn't order a big salty breakfast, but for some reason as salty breakfasts, as bad as it is, I can continue to function.

Speaker 1:          00:03:58       But if you get a waffle or pancakes of French toast to that Shit, you know, you might as well just have somebody put you in a fucking sleeper hold co's cause you're going down and you go down early. Um, so anyway, just a little travel tip for you there. Um, so anyways, you know, all this past week, uh, the lovely Nia, my beautiful wife was away and I was telling you how immaculate I was keeping this place fucking immaculate. All right? And um, I literally like, there was no trash in any of the barrels. All the fucking pillows were all poofed up look like it looks like a show room. The living room, right. I made the fucking bed, you know, it was spotless. I wiped down my side of the fucking sink, you know, brush my teeth and all that shit spotless. Okay. I got a car washed and waxed, filled it up with gas, all of that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:05:01       Everything was done. Went through all the bills, got the junk mail, all the bullshit, the recycling, fucking everything. I did everything right. So I'm thinking she's gonna come home, you know, cause I was leaving and right as I was leaving, she was coming home so he would just missing each other. Right. So I was thinking when she came home she was going to be like, like, Oh man, you know what? I might have to bring her in for this shit. You know what, I'm going to have to bring her in for this. Hang on one second. Hold on one second. All right. All right. So I'm back here. So anyways, let me keep setting this up. So my whole thing, Nia, was that when you came home, this place was going to be absolutely spotless. So you'd be like, oh my God, that's so nice. And then also you wouldn't feel like I was just hopeless SAP without you. Cause that always bugs me. Like when women go like take, take, did they fall apart without us? Like I'm like, I've

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       never said that about you, nor have I ever thought that I've never come home after being away. And the place has been in shambles because you don't know what to do. Oh. So I don't know why. Nothing. No. But You keep holding on to some idea of, of something that [inaudible] song was talking to them like manspreading well I keep, I gotta be on the fucking couch. Um, no, I don't know what you're so concerned about that for like the place has never been disgusting or gross after I have gone away. So I don't know why you have this big hangup about, you know, I don't, I don't get it. You know what? No, I don't either. Well, I'm trying to think. We, you fucking will actually let me work through my shit. No. Okay. Sorry. What jerk you're telling this story and then you're out law.

Speaker 2:          00:06:49       So any adult, because I'm told what happened. So I'm fucking waiting. I'm on the road on the road again, and I'm in fucking Hollywood, Florida, right? And all I'm thinking is, oh, the text message I'm going to get. Oh, it looks so great. It's so wonderful to come home to a nice clean house. It looks like a fucking show room. And what do I get? I get a fucking videotape from you. She's in the pantry now. Evidently something went bad in the pantry. Okay. Something didn't go bad in the pantry is just some shit that's going down in the pantry. There's some shit going down to the pantry. So here's the deal. I'm fucking on in the pantry. Um, I'm here by myself. I'm writing on the fucking show every night until seven o'clock at night, I'd come home, my brain is fried, I come home, I order a pizza, I pour a scotch, I eat, and then I stare at the wall.

Speaker 2:          00:07:41       I go to bed and I get right back up and we stare at the next draft in the next script. That's been my life. So I didn't in defense of me. Okay. The one fucking place I didn't go into, so there was the pantry. Let's stop saying, I don't like that word. I just realized Pantry pantry stuff saying I don't play Shit. It just, it's uh, I don't know. It's too close to panties in this food and I don't like when food and sex are combined. Okay. Now I know you don't like that you pantry here. Oh, that nine and a half weeks when it's fucking her with all the groceries on her was like either eat or fuck, not together, you know. So anyways, um, so she sends me this video, she's like, Bebe, how did you not see this? Right. It just starts fucking giving me all this shit. I'm like, what the fuck? All right. And she pans up to the top of the fucking ceiling and there was, what was it? There's the larvae. Larvae. Little, yeah, little moths. Modal. What? Go. It's an inside joke. Oh, go ahead. And inside with who? With the fucking people listening to when I,

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       no. Yeah, there's sort of larvae. There's, there's mods and stuff. Because some, like if there's flour that's been opened and it's not sealed up properly, or grains or cereal, they'll create little mom's like if you have fruit out for too long, it'll make fruit flies. So that was what was happening. Fruit flies. It attracts them. No, it creates them from that. I was just talking the Terminex guy about it. They just, they, I don't know. Flies come from apples. Listened. Yeah. Like if you have fruit and stuff out to [inaudible] and then fucking nine months later you get a fruit fly. You're like, there's no warm in there that's making it happen. No, that's not what I mean. It's not a fruit having sex. She said, well, if that's what you're saying, you're saying the constant. I'm saying, I listened. I don't know. I'm not a fucking term next person.

Speaker 3:          00:09:43       But he was telling me that when it's dirty mobs, fuck on those apples out in the orchard now and they plant their seed in there and then it comes out like alien. Okay, bill, there's not any fruit in the pantry. Okay, so we have, we have grains and he's just staring at your crush right now. It's so comfortable though. My lower back is so comfortable right now. Oh, you know what, I figured out a thing to get for you for that. But anyway, we'll get back to that. But if you have grains and cereals out exposed and like this little closed environment where it gets warm, it produces these larvae and little flies and mobs and shit. So that's what the guy just told me. He's not saying it right. Well how are you saying it? Are you saying? I'm saying please tell me how you explain things and how clear it is when you explain things.

Speaker 3:          00:10:30       What I would say is like, you know if you're having a cookout and you leave food out, all of a sudden flies or an ant show up, but they don't come from the food. That's what he told me. I'll be, you keep saying they, they come in from the apples and it's confusing me. You said it came from animals. I said nothing about ample line. This one up though from apples. I would never say it came from you. The start throwing apples into the mix. I was trying to explain to you about grains and shit. You're right. Maybe I was saying it's like fruit flies suck in school. I can't even hear what you're saying because you don't listen. That's why you got damn add. You don't listen. You don't listen and you start saying things and you said them and then you distribute them to the other person.

Speaker 3:          00:11:18       Like it's so confusing to talk to you sometimes because you don't live it so fucking hard. It is hard. How about we were just watching the Simpsons and you watch the entire episode in midway through it. You were like, why is that happened hanging? I'm like, where did the blue snake, like a major plot point that hadn't been explained not even five minutes earlier, but you don't pay attention to, how about this? How about my fucking back is out and I was in Jacksonville, Florida this morning. How about that? What does that have to do with anything that we're talking about? Well, maybe I'm a little fucking, you know, not focusing on a fucking cartoon. Okay. You're

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       such a baby when you traveled to whenever you travel, you fucking for like one day like, oh my God, I do know how you do this. And then it goes right out your fucking head. And then the next, next time I coming back off the road, you look, oh, let's go. Well, you know Susie Fricker sees having a fucking who hot down the fucking street. You want to go to that? When I say no, you flip out at me. I don't know what you're talking about. Should do you know exactly when you know who she is to see the frigging, oh yeah, he's that bright thing. All right, so whatever. So she comes home and evidently there's some sort of bug horror movie and you know how, what infestation infestation and you know how the ladies react. They don't like insects. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       They don't like insects the way men don't like cats hate those fucking things. There's nothing better than a cool cat. I like a cool cat that chills and lays in the fucking sun. Yeah. You know I liked their own new prison up on you. Yeah, I don't like that. I'm, when they're practicing killing it like that, you just look over and they're staring at you from the corner now than they stop and try and play it off. I don't like, I don't like that. They stand on your chest in the morning, waking you up. I don't like this shit in a box and then you got to pick it up. It's just too much. It's too much. Cleo. Shit's just outside. But we still got to pick it up. I know, but I don't have to. It's not in the house. I mean, if you're going to shit in the house, go in the toilet.

Speaker 2:          00:13:26       I think some people can train their cats to shit in the toilet. I don't know how, but, well, I can tell you how they can't communicate with other human beings. So they put all their energy into yeah, like they, they got like that gift. They have like a like uh, Asperger's, Asperger's with cat, some sort of, um, what's that thing that always talking about nowadays? Autism, autism, autistic with people, but okay. They can communicate with cats. What the play an instrument to front up with. No one in his diagnosis of the mental illnesses. It's just, they'll just stop right there, please. He's talking about when are you going to get angry tweets. I'm not marking, marking any of that. I'm making fun of people that put, you can't fucking say anything anymore. Everybody gets all worried. Oh, I know. I do benefits for all of those things. All of those things I know about my free fucking time. All in black. Oh Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:14:31       I remember when things were funny. Oh, it was so simple. Back in the day where you get was you could just say shingles and one every fucking jerk off. Didn't have some way they can just spout about fucking annoyed. They are, but everything else is fine as long as it doesn't come around to my world. Can I just ask what this situation is here with the Ziploc bag? What about it and how you're keeping your equipment stored? Yeah. Bill's got this cord and the little foamy part that you put on the windscreen, the wind screen and a couple of batteries and an old zip lock bag that's ripped and just doesn't even zip anymore. Right. So I'm just wondering why basically because it's still holds the things and if I just throw that thing out, another one's going to break and then that thing right there is probably going to end up on the nose of a porpoise and it's not gonna be able to eat.

Speaker 2:          00:15:23       It's going to die because everything ends up in the ocean. Yeah. You know, they say that put letter in its place. It's like the second eldest shit that you throw out the saying you don't pollute. We all pollute. It's just some of us do take this on the road with you. It's not like I was having an idea that good. I mean, well I take that on the road that you're just going to be like babbling about something that you don't really know about us at all. I mean, I don't really flip the chart anything. Uh, so you take this on the road with you? Yes. Alright. Well as I could maybe get you a nice, never had a problem leather Satchel. Really? You got a skin of fucking cow because I already, I already have one that'll last longer than putting it in this ridiculous thing that's never going to biodegrade.

Speaker 2:          00:16:05       What's this bad think and that they won't biodegrade. Other thing will be here somewhere in the dirt somewhere hundreds of fucking years after we're gone saying you can have a nice way to carry your things that doesn't look like you know the bags that we used to use for sandwiches. What is your fascination with just like buying shit? What do you mean fascination with buying ships session? I mean, look at this, look at this, that you're carrying this thing and I really wish you guys could see the Ziploc bag right now. It's, it's a mess. A man of your stature should not be carrying around your podcast equipment and an oil as well. What did you say? Ziploc bag. A man of my stature. Fuck it. Two seconds ago I was a fucking moron. But now, now cause you

Speaker 2:          00:16:54       to shave from naenae. So what do you like tonight? Who We got Saint Louis Blues meet me in St Louis. Louis v versus to the Dallas Stars. Formerly the Minnesota North Stars. Are these hockey teams? Yes they are. Oh, if they're not like the kings or the a Bruins, I don't really know. Oh yeah. What are your feelings about the kings and the Bruins? Well, if it came down to it, I would be a Bruins fan because I'm from Boston. So you just say no, you're going to root for yeah, but the other, the rest of them, I don't know. Those are my two. What do you like? I like boltings but I just, I started pulling for the blues because the blues had been in the league since 1964. Who's kidding? Who cause the Bruins didn't make the playoffs. So I was like, all right, I got to pick somebody and I'm not going to jump on the Black Cox and Kings bandwagon because they were always in it. So I'm going to for sworn under dog.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       And I was like, well the blues, they've been around since 1967 so the Minnesota north stars, but the people in Dallas haven't been rooting that long, but I really liked the players and shit. I like, I like Dallas but I, I've, I've ever been written for um, a babbling open.

Speaker 2:          00:18:03       You're looking a little bit. Yeah. St Louis. They're relaxed. They're going to be a, a kings game that we can go to cause I really enjoy going to that. Those two kings games we went to. Yeah. That they got bounced out. That done. What do you mean bounced out there? Uh, they got beat by the San Jose Sharks. Oh, so they're not in it. It's over. It's over for them. The Stanley Cup playoffs. There you go. They got, they lost in the first round. What about the breweries? We didn't make it. We were, oh well then I don't, we overt, well we, it

Speaker 1:          00:18:35       sheaves throughout the year because at least as far as I was concerned about guided we'll do, fuck am I going, I mean with the players that we had and every that we got rid of, I thought we were just gonna be trying to figure out who the fuck everybody was for half the season. And then maybe, you know, I dunno. What about the Toronto Blue Jays and what happened was we will going to be making the playoffs and everybody's all bunched together. We look at fucking third seat. Then we'd had a west coast trip and we got to fucking asses kicked and a, it all went away and a flyer and red wings fans talk shit about, you know how high he didn't make the playoffs and they both got the right there. Fred in the first fucking round. So I enjoyed that. Okay, well that's Ronald [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:19:11       Blue Jays. Is that a, is that a hockey team? Nope, that's baseball. Oh the Toronto Maple leafs. The amount of the maple leafs got the first pick in the draft of the raptors. Are they have a hockey team? Nope. Where they basketball team. Oh Jesus keeps, keeps saying this shit. You know. And then I'll do you, you pick something else that I don't know anything about. We'll see who's more. Right. Um, what do you went to that you know about? Did I just say that as a question? What are you going to let you know about? I don't know. Fashion. Okay, go ahead. Um, oh Jesus. What's the name of the guy who makes fun of fat people? He used to be fat. Ah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:54       Is that, that's, that's not Alexander Wang is it? No. Is it Michael Richards? Is it Michael? A Michael Kors?

Speaker 2:          00:20:02       No, he's German. Is it Paul Mitchell. And he is the head of a very, very like the most famous fashion house in the world. It's not for Saatchi cause he got shot by that guy. Yes. No, it's not the Chanel cause that was a chick and she's dead. Right. But she has an apartment in Paris that you can go into if you're skinny enough. Right. But you're, you're closed. You're getting there. I Chanel is right. Chanel's the right fashion house. A person who you're talking about is that the cad creative director for Chanel? He looks like a war criminal. Right? He's chairman. I'll say you go and why were they war criminals? Because they lost, we would had just as many people going to fucking Nuremberg. We really would've. Okay. Dresden, Karl Lagerfeld. Ah, fuck. I remember when we saw him and the last time we were embarrassed in the cab and I started freaking out because I saw Carl walking down the street in Paris and I thought he was a cool looking dude, man.

Speaker 2:          00:21:08       He's a vampire looking through vampire war from old queen looking dude. Yeah, pretty much. That's him. Name is sports team. Go ahead. Um, I'll name one of you. Tell me what it is. They are the yellow jackets. Somebody but did not make that up. Yellow check. I feel like that was a high school. I feel like that was a fucking fusion band. Um, what about no, no. It wasn't like wake forest or something that's a college basketball team or some, some sort of jackets. Uh, the Grizzlies Grizzlies to rotten. No, Michigan at some place cold that would have grizzly bears. Right. So it's not going to be a southern Julian good guests. But they moved. They were initially initially embed. Oh, okay. It's a Midwestern kind of thing. They were initially in Vancouver and then they went to another in Memphis. Oh, that says the Memphis grades. And for some dumb reason they kept the name kind of like when the New Orleans jazz moved to Utah, the widest fucking place ever taught jazz. Like you'll never see any jazz or hear any jazz in Utah? I wouldn't think so.

Speaker 2:          00:22:20       No Jazz Clubs and Utah. It's like the New Orleans Mormons, New Orleans Morgan. I like that name better. All right, well we enjoyed you hear neo. Oh, I'm done. I don't know. Your phone's ringing. Oh God. Oh look at us. I know. I get a call her back. Um, are you done with me? Are you wrapping up the podcast? Did you answer questions? No, but you can come back for that. I actually kind of tired, so I think I'm going to leave oh down. Nice reversal. I kicked you off and then you're like, no, let me come back. And then you tell me to go fuck myself. You know what? I I enjoy that. I respect that. So I just came on to tell the larvae, larvae and then leaving and get out of here so I can straighten out my legs and fucking give my, I feel like Kennedy right now. Are you even able to do a podcast in the upright position anymore? Um, this is why I married you with. This is the type of compassion that I've come to expect from you. You're such a fucking baby. I, I tough my way through all of this shit. I never, I never see doctors. I don't take medicine. That's cause you're dumb.

Speaker 2:          00:23:34       You're dumb. Well, it's because I grew up so people don't go to the hospital. They don't go to doctors. They will take medicine. No, you're dumb. We have advances in our society, but I'm tougher than you. You're a baby. So fine. Be Tough. All you want, but like be smart and tough. Go to the doctor if you're so tough. Go to the doctor and hear what they have to stay after school special. Yeah, I will. I'm getting their beats stuff by going to the doctor and hearing what they have to say. That's real toughness. That's real talk. That's real socks on. All right. I'm out of here. Nini out. I'm sorry I had to ah, I enjoyed when you come out. I like miss you baby. Huh? Don't say Huh? You heard me listen, I went out. You know. You know why I don't go to fucking doctors and all that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:24:23       Why? Because doctors, they practiced medicine. They practice on you. They don't have shit down. And one of the, one of the things that they still don't know a lot about this, but it's not like they don't mean it like they're practicing. Like you sit in here practicing drums, you know, that's not the same thing they went to medical school. I understand that. So why are you like taking that word? So literally, have you ever seen Lars Ulrich played life and he practices, he fucks up all the time with Metallica. Oh my God, Nia. I'm telling you, if that's what it means, you practice medicine and then you learn off other people. Just look how much better hair plugs have gotten. Look how much better they get in with the fucking, you know, cutting part of your eye out and then you can see better. You told me you were going to go to a doctor to figure out what was happening with your leg.

Speaker 2:          00:25:06       Okay. So I know, I know, I know you think you know what it is, but can you please go to a doctor? And so it doesn't become a chronic issue. And then when you're, you know, 50 which is, can I, can I finish? Can I finish Kathy? You're going to have some sort of handle on it. He had one of the things that they know the least about is the back. Okay. And I'm just, I'm just not going to just go to a fucking chiropractor. I'm going to find somebody you know who has a good reputation of not just fucking opening people up like a fire. It isn't fine cause I wasn't done talking. You always jump in because you're suggesting that I just want you to go to some random ass clinic. I was just joking around. I was joking around. I'm holding you to this because you said you were going to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:53       So are you going to do it? Um, I don't know. Film pretty good. I don't like going like this. I don't like going to the doctor the way. I'd only go into the fucking mall. I just, the whole idea going over there and parking and just the whole fucking thing. I know. I need to fill the shower. Make sure you show up 15 minutes before. Oh yeah. Y'All be there. See that? I know, but once it's done, it's done. And you need all my first show in Hollywood, Florida. There was a couple of ladies in the front row. Uh, we'll asking if you were there because they needed relationship advice. Oh yeah. You know, they were like, how come we don't have boyfriends? No, they didn't say this. That's what they said. Someone actually wrote me and asked me about you proposing and actually that's what I

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       wanted to do. I wanted to talk about this email I got. Should we do it today or should we do it though? Fuck his writing you and how the fuck are they writing you? Because they read Mike because of my website, tender headed films.com. So they were writing me because remember I was going to do a podcast all those years ago and then I just never did it. Um, no, they wrote this whole thing about how did you get a guy who was so anti marriage to propose and all that kind of stuff and how did it happen? And did I propose? No, I did not propose.

I'm one of those people that can't keep a consistent speed, you know, so you make your car sick. And what was hilarious was he was driving a Prius and the way he was driving this thing, I would be surprised if he was getting eight gallons, eight miles per gallon. He just kept doing that.

Speaker 4:          00:35:10       Eh,

Speaker 1:          00:35:12       just stomp and glide. Um, I, I just amaze me some people like how they cannot hear, you can't hear the engine, you know, he can't hear the fucking rpms going through the roof. You don't understand that is wasting fuel. I know. You know how bad those cabbies get fucked over. You think that he would be concerned about something? You think if you drove for a fucking living, you'd have an understanding of how fucking works.

Speaker 5:          00:35:39       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:35:41       It was so fucking annoying. It actually, it just kind of just became funny and he was a really nice guy. But, um, I know some people like, it's almost like, it's like the driving with a fake foot, you know, or a mechanical foot like the prototype and it, you know, it's either on or off. There's no, um, consistency of speed. This guy, he just kept going up to like 65, 70 miles an hour and then glide back down to like, you know, 52. Of course I'm looking at my fucking phone, so I'm starting to get six. Yeah. You know, it was, it was a shit show and absolute,

Speaker 5:          00:36:14       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:15       Fucking shit show. Oh, you know, when I went to Florida, by the way, I landed in Miami, every time I land into Miami, I'll you immediately start seeing all these beautiful women and every time I go there, I just hear Tony Montana's voice going. The city is like one big pussy waiting to get fucked.

Speaker 5:          00:36:31       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:36:33       And I was trying to bait me into those two women that was sitting in the front row to get into that fucking conversation. Um, but she did buy the bait. She didn't take the bait cause they were like, why don't we have boyfriends? You know and you should have seen him cause you, I dunno cause you guys are you not wearing any clothes that be the one tag is beautiful as you are. No guy wants to put up with that. You got to walk down the street like some over protective dog. I keeping everybody away. Everybody's

Speaker 5:          00:37:08       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:09       Well one of them was barely wearing a shirt. Granted I wasn't complaining for where I was standing front but I mean it just seems kind of obvious. You know what I mean? You got it. You got to cover up the goods a little bit. I mean I would say that to Madonna. I don't know if she's currently dating 70 right now, but Madonna is in fucking unbelievable shape for her age and if she would just put on something elegant, you know what I mean? Instead of rolling around with half a fucking pussy lip hanging out. I don't know why she does that. She said something late, you know, as she did yet another thing are all fucking career has been like one big publicity stunt after another. You know, I'm wearing a wedding dress, but I'm fingering myself at the fucking award show. Right. You know, right from there.

Speaker 1:          00:37:49       And then, oh, it's Jesus, but he's African American and now I'm trying to fuck them. It's just paint by numbers. Shock. And what's funny is I actually like our music borderline feel like, uh, just keep, you know, that's actually, I threw out my back doing that Molly Ringwald dance. Um, anyways, yeah. And then she goes on Letterman. She says, fuck 50,000 times. She does stand up on the tonight show was just one big fucking thing after another. I saw her latest one was she showed up to a movie theater and I move out movie premiere or whatever the fuck she, I don't know who the fuck knows what it was, you know, some fundraiser to get toothbrushes to some fucking gods for sacred place. So she shows and she literally has her titties in her ass out like a see through dress. And she of course says, well, what I'm doing is I'm challenging the boundaries and um, of, you know, of course women, you know, got to drag all that bullshit. And then it's like, no, you're 57. Okay. Nobody wants to look at that. Okay. Like it my age, I am, I am well into put on a fucking sport coat.

Speaker 1:          00:39:03       Nobody wants to see it. It's just a, yeah, you're not pushing any boundaries. It's just, it's a, a, you know, you have it a little bit of a midlife prices. I think she looks fucking great, but she looked way better if she fucking just, you know, you know, put on, split out a fucking dress, fucking adore. I Dunno. But then again, I saw Iggy pop and he wasn't wearing a shirt, but I don't find guys aren't like attractive. It was just sort of funny to me that funny. I just was just him not giving a fuck. So I guess if she just said, look, I don't give a fuck. I just felt like Kevin my ass and titties hanging out. I wouldn't have a problem with that. But the fact that she's sitting there trying to say that. No, no. Wait a minute. I think she might be right. Maybe she is right. Hey, come here. You gotta answer this question.

Speaker 6:          00:40:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:01       There's a chance I might be common like they don't understand that daughter till she comes here. I'll sing a sing some of my favorite songs by her. A bad boy. Bad girl home by six. Hey, pick up the mic. I got a question for you

Speaker 2:          00:40:21       now you want me back?

Speaker 1:          00:40:23       Yup. That's like that street joke I told you. Right? Watch one. I heard Jackie the joke mental.

Speaker 2:          00:40:30       The one about the gorilla. No, the one with the fucking cause. I like that one. The married guys walking out of the house and his wife's yelling at him. Don't get the fuck Outta here. Get the fuck out. I never want to see you again. So he's walking away and she goes, I hope he had died a long, slow, miserable death. And he turns around, he goes out, what now you want me back? That's stupid. That's a stupid joke. It just reminded me of that. Anyway, school, I could have told it better, but I got, I just got off plank. Jackie jumped in and tell us a way better. Um, all right, so my daughter recently [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       she showed up at some fucking, you know, raise awareness thing. I don't know what it was. It was a carpet she showed up and she had a butt cheeks out in a titties out. Okay. This was the met ball that happens every year in New York City. And that's for the mets.

Speaker 2:          00:41:24       Yes, it is. Go math, but it's just for one of them. I know. It's for the fucking museum. Yes. The hacky date. Every person in their twenties goes on in New York and Madonna, let's go to a museum. Um, Garla only the Creme de Creme dialing. I invaded. So Ralph Lauren pretends to fall. He sniffs or butter on the way down. So what happens? You know, this super rich people, they're all freaks, aren't they? I guess it wasn't at the point of eyes wide. Shut it. I don't know what the point of I wide shut was. Well, what happened was Stanley Kubrick died. He died halfway through. I saw a great fucking movie on a plane called the insiders. It's a movie made by, uh, some Korean director, man. It was fucking phenomenal. Really enjoyed it. Okay. Had One of the best fucking fight scenes that I, I've seen, cause the gay was missing a hand, you know, so he had to like fucking, you know, everybody knew one handy was throwing right.

Speaker 2:          00:42:28       And it was multiple attackers. It was the shit. I almost gave it a standing ovation on the plane. If it was pre nine 11, I could've done it. But I started to do and they're like, sorry, I had to sit down. Okay. It's another freedom lost. So anyways, so fucking Madonna shows up. Yeah. Sorry. Okay. So she says that she's trying to fucking push the boundaries of or whatever, the fucking sex and that type of thing. Okay. So I was going like, Duncan, mind you 57, no wants to see me without a shirt on grants. She's in better shape than I am. But like, you know, Almond must my sport coat years, like, you know, covered up their freckles. Right. So what I'm saying is you're in your sport coat you, yeah, yeah, yeah. You get to a certain point, you get to your forties and stuff like that. Women Dress elegantly and men dress like gentlemen. Yeah. In other words, yeah. You cover up, uh, you know the fucking battle scars of what you've been through. Okay. Do any fucking wine and cheese plates?

Speaker 2:          00:43:36       No. What I'm saying is, so I was saying with mark, but Donna just put on a nice dress. You could look really elegant. Right. That's not really her vibe. Yeah, I know. I know. But you know something, it's like he like look who's can do Michael Jackson. He, if he was still alive [inaudible] the short pants with the glitter socks. It's like, come on dude. Some points you've got to update the look what is, what is your point? What this whole Madonna thing. And so I, as I was saying that, but then I was like, wait a minute. But when I saw Iggy pop with no shirt on, I thought it was bad ass that daddy didn't give a fuck. So that, that's, that's bullshit. So I should be actually applauding Madonna. Wow. Look at you. See that? That's not, that's not okay. I was going to say, you're going like wow, look at you. You're really known as DME. So my apologies to Madonna.

Speaker 2:          00:44:24       Feels like I'm shot. Take it. Look at my fucking 57 year old titties teeth. She's my age with 10 she's 10 years. We're 10 years apart. So She's 50th wait what? I, I'm 57 years. Wait. Yes she is. She was born the same year it was Prince Oh shit. The same year as Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson was 58 prince was 58 and tick but was 58 I never know how old Madonna is ever. And that was like in 1957 Oh my God. You're right. She's gonna be 58 right? Had no idea. And August, yeah, she'll be 58 so 1958 as far as music goes, was kind of like 1943

Speaker 1:          00:45:12       1943 was Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, all born 1943 and then they all died in 1970 and then people started to understand drugs. And you know, bringing a jump rope on the road and maybe becoming a Vegan. So now they live longer. Michael made it to 50 prints, made it to 57 but don is still going okay. Right. So all of them in their own way kind of went on stage with their ass hanging out. Right. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:45:51       okay. Where are you going to fuck it. I want to do some questions here. Okay. Say you brought me into, show me that you've evolved and seeing your own. No, I was trying, I was trying to seek, see if that was a double standard women and showing their bodies and you know, double standard also works with women. The way they look at guys in certain situations too is you guys aren't like perfect. No one, no one is claiming.

Speaker 1:          00:46:17       Perfect. Okay. Well the media just seems to cover your complaints

Speaker 2:          00:46:22       and then this chest to ever have a voice. Uh Huh. Thank God you have this podcast. I know. No one would hear me. Okay. Listen, you got to understand the world doesn't live with me. They don't have the privilege of living with me the way you do. So I need to do this once a week. That's a fucking beautiful watch. Who got you that? You did? That's right. Asshole response to stinky German from last week. So this poor bastard, um,

Speaker 1:          00:46:55       he's German, right? Yes. And uh, so he lives in Germany. He's old school. He didn't leave and try to be like, hey, I wasn't part of that Hitler thing. Right. He's still listening. His grandparents said, you know, I don't know if it's me, but this guy's making a lot of sense.

Speaker 2:          00:47:14       So,

Speaker 1:          00:47:18       so because of the mistakes of his forefathers and mothers, the gods have cursed him that he just sort of smells a little musty and east, she's tries showering, it has all this shit. He doesn't know what the fuck to do. So evidently this, there's this other musty guy, formerly musty guy heard about this. Okay. That's you look into his diet. Yeah. We, we've talked about that in halitosis and maybe you have a fucking as a sinus infection. I don't know what, but he just, he just smells bad. Then no matter how much he showers. So this guy says, yeah, anywhere. Where's the yeah. Was quite, it's quite a mystery. I'm boy, I tell you, I'll tell you this person's in response to this. This is a formerly musty person, so I hope this helps the, uh, the sour kraut cheeses. See, that is my best fucking fun ever.

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       I'm sorry, but that shit was great. All right. That was pretty good. That was pretty good. That was good. That was good. All right. I'm gonna, I'm gonna. He said, I'm gonna and keep this simple because we all know if you're reading issues, I admittedly have, I've been a fan for years, but this is the first time I feel the need to chime in on something. Last week you read a question from a German guy that had a musty body odor and did not know what to do about it. He said, growing up, I dealt with the same bullshit that poor SAP is going through. I always smelled musty. I could not wash it away, no matter how often I showered. This is brutal. I feel bad for these people. I tried everything and finally realized it was, eh, it was antiperspirant for some weird reason, my body reacted when I put it on and I smelled musty.

Speaker 1:          00:49:14       I actually stopped wearing deodorant for a few weeks in the winter, so I did not smell like a complete savage. After that period of time, I began wearing deodorant, only skipping all brands with antiperspirant. Uh, happily the stinky, musty odor went away. Hope this works. You Stinky Fuck, love the podcast. Your comedy and F is for family and go fuck yourself. Yeah. So basically what I got from that is maybe his body is having a reaction to something that he is using. I don't know. Cause your body should sweat the weight to keep you cool. Right. That's the whole point of sweating. So anti perspirant I know maybe people who sweat excessively, they don't want to be sweating through their clothes or something. So I don't know. But it sounds like that person to go to a doctor. Well they haven't been able to figure out what's going on. And he's in Germany too. And those guys don't fuck around over there. They're very efficient. Yeah, no. Oh yeah. I mean the cars, the trades, the rocket side trick, you know, if everybody could just forgive him for that one crazy 10 year period, I think they got a little sideways. They'll never, they'll never live it down. No, you can't. Sorry. You know what? It's on video. That's why,

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       you know, other countries could do shit. And it happened before like a certain, something that happened in 1915 that we always see advertised. Uh, my vote dear bill on Capitol Hill. I don't know what you're talking about. Well, you should. You know what if there was movie cameras around you? What? Movie Cameras. Yep. Motion picture things. Have you ever heard of vermin supreme? Um, he's been on. I don't, I don't, I don't believe that this is somebody's name. I'm going to look this up before you guys make a fool of me, which is not hard to do. Why don't you read it first? Because then I start commenting and then halfway through I realized it's a prank phone call. Vermin supreme. It's coming up. That's vermin supreme. Vermin supreme as an American performance art or artists and activists who has run as a candidate and very low various local states.

Speaker 2:          00:51:23       Um, okay. Let me see what this, what's up with this guy? Okay. I never heard of this guy. He's been on the ballot in New Hampshire and his platform has a lot to do with dental health. He also has a plan in place for the Zombie Apocalypse, which involves setting up thousands of treadmills to put the zombies on to help power the new world. He wears a giant boot on his head. Oh, I've seen this fucking guy. That boot that's right. And carries around a rubber toothbrush. Here's an article on him. He also has promised free ponies for everyone. Oh, so he's a whack job. I don't know if he's a whack job, because that's a really funny joke though. The zombies on the treadmill. Are you looking them up? Are you texting? I was looking at Madonna photos. Okay. We were back here and we've now, we've moved on. We've moved on, but I just was looking at photos. I'm here. I'm a don't preach Amin. Trouble dealing dope. Do you know any new Madonna songs?

Speaker 2:          00:52:27       I just said, I'm sorry. I did my fucking, I did TV. Your, your, your, your vocal warmups. Yeah. This was not a good luck at the met ball. It was just I, yeah. Oh, ladies, can we stick together first of all and just get something right? Yeah. Home. But now it's not, I'm not being catty. She just, it's just so thirsty. It's just, I don't [inaudible] and I love Madonna, but this is just too much. Or you're done. Yeah, I'm done. I'm sure her kids enjoy, uh, wife's family is a bunch of dramatic babies. Oh God. You're the baby. And we go, hey bill, I'm sick of this election. I hope Trump wins. I know he's a jerk, but I hate Hillary. I think Bernie is a nice guy without a clue. He says a lot of great things, but he's going to raise taxes. He talks about

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       making college free, but his taxes, we'll make it. Oh, nothing is free. And that, yeah, that's never going to happen. But nothing that, you know, free health care. It's not, it's not free. Somebody has got to fucking pay for it. He talks about making college free, but it's taxes will make it harder for people like me to pay my student loans. I make 95 grand a year. I have a kid, a hundred grand in student loans between me and my wife. We live comfortably. But if you take another 20 $504,000 from him a year, I will feel it. Yeah, definitely. I am already only netting 60. What is the fuck is all of this? What's the plan? The family has a venture. Dramatic babies. All right. Blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 5:          00:54:07       MMM,

Speaker 1:          00:54:10       okay. So we'll get into, we'll get into his family here somewhere. I'm not opposed to giving money to help people who need it, but when is enough enough? $1 trillion on dumb shit every year. And you need more from me. Fuck off Bernie. I love how he's blaming Bernie. You know, Bernie didn't create the fucking situation. Um, he's trying to get us out of it, I guess. I don't know if it's gonna work. I don't think, I mean, I don't know if people work with the guy, but oh God, what a fucking decision this year. Um, so I make this point to my wife, my wife's family. I didn't yell. I didn't say fuck off Bernie. I just said, I don't think we, the people should have to give more money if they're wasting their money. They already get, well, my wife's family lost their shit. They said that I'm selfish and that if I vote for Trump, I'm endorsing hate and greed and fascism, a really question mark.

Speaker 1:          00:55:03       They endorsed Obama and I have a problem with him. Hatefully blowing up kids and wedding parties with drones. Why doesn't that make them hateful? Um, they then went on to talk about for 30 minutes about hate and how theirs, they were scared about what would happen to the country and they're scared about how children would grow up in a country with anti quote Hitler minus the concentration camps. I told them that comparing an Egomaniac to Hitler is unfair to the victims of the Holocaust. It trivializes the actual evil of Hitler and embodied her mother and father were both taken aback and said that my way of thinking could potentially be dangerous to their grandchildren. What period the fuck period is going, period on period. Well, you dope.

Speaker 3:          00:55:53       Yeah. You fucking opened up your fucking mouth about politics. Talk about Paul, know who he is and he's young. He doesn't know. Well, you know? Yeah. And how did you learn? How did you learn and how did I learn by bringing it up. By doing that? Yeah. This is the deal. You know, you can't talk

Speaker 1:          00:56:09       about politics and religion and shit like that. Those are going to say get got it got really heated. Yeah, right before they said that shit. Well you can't. And also you just, yeah, I don't know. He gotta be, if you really

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       are going to vote for Trump, I just, I think there's only certain sections of the United States where you could say that where you'll get a, yeah, I get it. Oh, well, tell me more about your opinion. I feel like if you say, you know what, fuck this, I'm voting for Trump, most people are going to be like, are you fucking kidding me? So I'm not surprised at that, but

Speaker 2:          00:56:42       no. Yeah, you really a lot of shit. One Oh own. I was, I made fun of him when, uh, you know, I got some shit for it. For making fun of Trump. Yeah. From who? People who support Trump. Oh, well, okay, fine. Yeah, they have, believe it or not, there's people that I know it has a lot more than I thought. Remember when we was first talking about running and we're both like, this is never going to happen. This is a joke. This is ridiculous. And now here we are. And he used like the only Republican left standing. So I mean, I guess I underestimated him. Yeah. He's like the less humble party. He's like the Leicester City of Pollock politicians. Um, but here's the thing though, I, but I think like, you know, Hillary Clinton is the fucking devil because she's acting like she gives a fuck and she's, you know, she's one of those Bilderberg people. I don't like her. I like Bernie out of all of them. I liked Bernie Sanders. I just don't think anybody's going to fucking work with, well, the California primary is coming up, so he's, he's not throwing in the towel. Ernie, Bert I have. Do you know something? But we got to vote. We have to go. I have to vote for a person that I feel is actually truly gives a shit about regular people and yeah, that would be him. Whether he's going to be successful or not. And I know what a lot of people,

Speaker 3:          00:57:57       well, you're going to put Trump

Speaker 2:          00:58:01       good. The office. I've always voted for the fucking third wheel. Every fucking God damn time. Well, when the primary happens, we got to vote for him. That's the only way that he'll listen. I don't have to do anything that you say. Okay. But I don't know what I'm going to do. So basically his, this guy's in law. Do you know what? We just did eight him, you know, we just did. We just did with this guy did, which is what we just fucking talked politics and gave endorsements to. Bernie said, we shouldn't have done that. I still haven't made up my mind that I'm going to do that. Why are we were giving endorsements just by talking about it, by saying that you're going to do it well, it's how I feel like that guy that fucked, we like those, those people that you see on Facebook and they go, Hey, do you know me?

Speaker 2:          00:58:39       I pretend to be a doctor on his soap opera and I think this is who you should vote for. I apologize for that. People. I, I, I try not to say that eventually when she was going to come up doors thing, anybody where we'll, let's just leave it. I'll tell you what, I'm endorsing a nice fucking cold Budweiser. When I sit down to watch game five, that's what I'm endorsed. What is, what does he want to know? He was just sort of like, what the hell? Now My, now my inlaws don't want me to have children with my wife because they think I'm evil and they're gonna. I'm gonna raise a little evil. Trump's might think about Trump is his fucking about lack of compassion for fucking people. When you sit there and say take his coat and like riling people up like that was just says that he says really, really awful things.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       But the thing I like about him is he lets me know that they actually count the votes because no super rich people want that fucking guy. And I always thought for years my conspiracy theory is like, they don't count these fucking thing. They do. Oh, it's pretty fucking close. And they put the money on both horses and then that fucking fine. But uh, the fact that he's actually doing well, he's speaking a lot of people out there need, it's going to build a wall and he's going to have the people whose wallet and pay for it telling you these talking mad shit. I don't know. I feel like I, all those years of watching the apprentice and celebrity apprentice are now coming back to when you tried to find a CEO for a company that doesn't exist. It's all coming back to bite me in the ass. I've been supporting him this whole entire time.

Speaker 2:          01:00:06       I'm partly to blame for this bullshit. So what does this look? He can't be a complete moron. What is this kid saying? What does this point? He's just is, no, he's just saying what the fuck. So we just will not talk about politics anymore around your inlaws. I'll tell you that much. But then he said looking forward to seeing you in Dublin, myself and some friends that will be coming from Belfast. Well I'm going to be doing Belfast too. So you don't, yeah, you don't even need to do that. Yeah. And we're putting together the dates. I'm definitely doing Dublin. Definitely doing Belfast. Yeah. I'm doing a little 10 day tour over there. Cause skin, it's not a good time to go to Scandinavia this time of year because they actually have sunlight and it's warm out. So when I usually, well, because they're going to want to be outside. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. If you go in December and it's already fucking dark, go to movies and stuff. Still though, I would imagine just cause it's sunlight most of the time doesn't mean why would I listen to the promoters over there? I'll, I'll listen.

Speaker 2:          01:01:06       When is this happening? I'm going to go, that's going to be happening individually. Like I think it's going to start on the 31st and it's going to go into August. Very excited about that. Exciting things are happening. I love Ireland. Oh No, I love the people of Ireland. Look who you're with or potato face himself through advice with neighbors emotionally. Germany. Oh mighty Billy. I don't actually don't even know that cause I never done the whole a CFC if they're always like a more German than Irish cause I am German, Irish Catholic podcasts. It doesn't get any wider. I wasn't getting any wider. All mighty Billy Ball bags. Uh, alright. And vice with neighbors. Question. I live in an apartment complex here in the lovely state of Oklahoma and I have this neighbor who lets her dog out on her balcony every morning. Somewhere between the hours of four and 5:00 AM oof. The dog barks aggressively for hours afterward. Of course it wakes me up. Poor thing. The dog that is and this about this poor bastard or lady Oklahoman. Um, Oklahoman Oklahoman.

Speaker 2:          01:02:22       Uh, where am I? Okla Homo Sexual? No, no. Isn't that one of the characters on your Nashville show? I want to write a song with you. We'll likes about us. They gay cowboy, the gay cowboys to gay cowboys. Cutting edge character. That's the first gay cowboy ever in primetime in Bram time. Yes. I've been prime time during the lunch hour. It was just littered with them when I was growing up. Those people on Captain Kangaroo, right? Ernie and Bert isn't what they said. All those guys. Right. All right. Question. I live in an apartment complex here in the lovely state of Oklahoma. Okay. Yeah. The dog parks aggressively for hours. It wakes me up and I have to go. I have to work at 8:00 AM I filed complaints after an altercation in which I went out and scream, shut your fucking dog up before I make you shut him up.

Speaker 2:          01:03:16       Oh. Was that your opening line or something along those lines? My muscles. My message has not been heard by the apartment costs and she continues to let the dog out. What should I do? Sincerely, a blue collar working man, just trying to get some fucking sleep. Who is also Saint Louis Blues gave the stars of fucking Molly whopping today. Hope you watched it. I miss that. Um, well fuck urine here in Oklahoma, man. You know what you need to do? Take out your side iron. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, eh, take the fucking dog out the bell bow.

Speaker 2:          01:03:57       Don't even joke about it with rubber bullets. Don't even joke about that. Who is your super, you know, he put rubber bullets in the gun and every time the dog barks, king very signed a dog barks, you shoot it and its ass and it starts to Oh, when I bark and then it'll shut up. No, you can't do that. Uh, you would get arrested for that. So why don't I would just go down. I would buy a month's worth of cube steaks. Right? Why does it does a dog shit and Piss on the balcony? Is that why she's letting it out there? Cause that's gross. I don't know. But that is so fucking not acceptable because you know what's probably the fucking dog gets up at Ford 5:00 AM is keeping her up to him up so they, oh my God. No, it's you. Gotta you gotta call them on or something.

Speaker 2:          01:04:41       Oh wait. Did he say that they're not paying attention at the, like when you say it's not going over well with the people in the apartment? Well he has like, she just has a neighbor. I can't, I don't think that, oh, it's an apartment complex. Yeah. You got to say something to the management company. Oh look, there's no fucking way. He's the only person that's annoyed by this. Of course, I would go around and I would get a bunch of signatures and then I would, you know, try to have everybody all get together and say, ah, that bitch needs to shut the other bitches. Oh, cleo. No, what's up buddy?

Speaker 6:          01:05:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:05:21       Yeah. This little bit, no. Why are you, it's time for this one probably to go out. Speaking of all that. All right, well you do that well, I will wrap up the podcast here. No, you take her out. Um, sorry. Hey, is it Jacksonville this morning? That's my, uh, that's my excuse. All right, well that's going to be there. The, uh, the light on weight, so we didn't offer any advice besides your horrible joking advice. Of course. I just said you get a bunch of signatures. He can get enough signatures, not going to do shit. You got to go to the management company and be like, this dog is barking at four or five in the morning every morning. Oh, he said he already did that. Oh, and they're not paying attention. He said he's in this fucking, what do you think signatures are going to do? Any technology like to hear him about fun? No, that's not it. Oh wait, I missed one.

Speaker 2:          01:06:07       He said, I have this day. I live in an apartment complex. The dog barks. I've, I filed complaints. Yeah. Like nothing's happening. Um, that sacks. Wow. So you have to do this thing. I'm not going to pay my fucking rent. There you go. I'm not paying my rent until you get this one. Yeah. To shut this damn dog. Oh yeah. Cause that's not fair. Yeah. How about that long? She's lived there. That sounds like something an older person would do to just like put their dog out on the balcony and just let it bark all morning cause it probably goes out, takes a piss, takes a shit and then once to come inside and meanwhile the owner has gone back to sleep. All right. Well obviously I was joking. You don't shoot it the dark. No, you don't. All right. That's right. Cleo is the other one. Um, all right. Virtual reality headset, blow job.

Speaker 2:          01:07:01       Uh, all right. I know you hate technology but we'd like to hear your opinion on this. My girlfriend, half jokingly promised me a double blow job from my 30th birthday. Um, I do not expect this to happen, but I have been joking with her that the date is approaching and she should have a girl lined up, et cetera. I have also been talking about virtual reality slash Vr headset as I'm thinking of getting one, I don't know what that is. Yeah. What is that? She asked me the other day, would I be able to watch porn through it? I said yes. She then said instead of the double by, why don't you wear the headset and I can give you normal. Oh by while watching a porno. Wait, what do you what? What are you saying goodbye? Oh Bj. Yeah. Oh, you know what? It was underlined in red so I couldn't see the bottom part. I was like, why does this by, Oh my God. Your reading skills are atrocious. Yeah, and by what actually mean that there wouldn't be a guy and a girl doing it. I was even, I was thinking about like his girlfriend would be like by, she was down there with another chick.

Speaker 2:          01:08:19       I am stupid. See this people, you too can be successful in life years dumb as me. She then she then just instead of instead of a double Bj, he read this again. Wow. Why don't you wear a headset and I could give you a normal BJ while watching a porno. Why can't you do that now with a TV? Because I feel like that's something like weird Tron, futuristic shit where you put it on this opening Pandora's box or is this a way for Vr to be seen as a techie sex toy? You are really asking the wrong person that question. You know bill doesn't know what looking forward to see you in Dublin. Myself and some friends will be coming from bell. Oh this is the I that was the one. Okay. Um, is this the same? No, I read the ending to the other one to that one and it was weird because the ending was in front of the other one.

Speaker 2:          01:09:13       Oh fuck you and fuck everybody else. Yeah. It's all fun. It's all fun and games. Until I stopped podcasting. Oh, I've had enough of this sensitive deep. No I'm not, I don't care. Um, it is a slippery slope but I feel like that could be really kind of cool. Does she get to do it too? Like does she get to watch some porn while you like go down on her? That'd be really trippy. It would be trippy. But the thing is then then when ends up happening is, is then you end up getting like a that, that disconnect. Right. And now you don't want to do anything that's the one of you is wearing the helmet. Yeah. That's weird. Oh my God. I have to like see you. So that's, I got, that's a dangerous, yeah, that's like one of those things like do you think I could do heroin once and like be all right with that?

Speaker 2:          01:10:01       No, I saw something, I'm trying to think where I saw it. Saw what in one of those Asian countries, because they're always ahead of us, they have better cell phones. There was a, uh, a guy trying out like a virtual reality sex suit, which I had a bit on this thing in like the late nineties when I first heard that they were going to do that. Um, and by the way, the fact that you haven't already called me out going like book bill, How did you just stumble upon this? I'm dead honest one. I don't remember the waiting for the rest of the story cause I felt like there was more, could have been while I was watching Internet porn probably. Yeah. But they don't have advertising advertisers for that. It was like a story on the side of the thing. They have all those and how do you know them? Yeah. Right back at you. So yeah, but they don't have any, I don't have ads like that. Right. That's true. Well this is what it was. It looked like a fucking dude. He was like, let go mummy suit, who's hilarious. Literally was all wrapped up in toilet paper. That's how I remember it because it was so horrifying. It was just, it was one of those things, whatever I was looking at that then came up and I went, wow. Right. He was, and it looked like

Speaker 7:          01:11:20       mmm.

Speaker 2:          01:11:21       His hands with to his side. He had on the fucking, you know, I'm old and I can't see anymore those glasses, those cataract glaucoma, cataract glasses from the drug store. Yeah. So he had on those, he, I think he was all wrapped up because he didn't want anybody to see who he was. Yeah. Maybe that's what it was. Okay. And then there was this thing, obviously his dick was in it. Oh my God. And it just, the same way your hand would be going like bang, Bang, Bang, Bang against yourself. It was this thing. It was the most fucked up thing ever. Would you ever use one of those flesh bought things? You know how porn stars, they get mold. Those things are so fucking gross. I think those things, those things is so fucking gross. A long time ago I did somebody podcast. I'm not gonna say who, but people who listen to podcasts, no.

Speaker 2:          01:12:07       Who is, he had one of those things and it look like some Jeffrey Dahmer body part automatically. Who your tax just sitting. I don't think you'd do cause I know who you're going to guess. But it wasn't that person. Um, it looked, no, it just looked like and it, did he say that? Did it feel like every, it can't feel like a real vagina obviously, but like it's, it's just, it's, I, I can't believe that it does. Like shit like that doesn't cause you to either be like become like a necrophiliac or some sort of perk, feel Yak. Why would it make you feel a necrophiliac? Cause you fucking something that looks, looks like a body part and it's not alive. Women have like dildos and vibrators and stuff and it's like the same sensation. So why wouldn't a one of those fleshed bought things feel like, isn't that kind of like another Madonna Iggy pop thing by looking at it the wrong way maybe?

Speaker 2:          01:13:02       No, I don't think, no, I don't think you're looking at it. I remember back in the day, back in the day, don't like the idea of a fake vagina. You don't, you're not comfortable just sitting on a table and it has a handle on it and I'm holding it. No, that's not your thing. You're not into, that feels like Henry portrait of a serial killer. I remember back in the day, right when you actually had to go to a porno store to get your porn, and they had like, you know, always, always behind the counter and they would have shut up there.

Speaker 2:          01:13:36       They had this, it was like what's in the box? It was literally a head in a box. The chicks, Bob was like, [inaudible] you stick your Dick in it. You know? I'm like, somebody's going to buy that. Yeah. It was in like the same box, like a basketball came in and someone's gonna take it, grab it by its fucking ears that are stuck to the side of its head and then just going to go home and fuck ahead just to head. Now there's no fucking way that that doesn't fuck you up. Psychologically. If you do that long enough, then you go out with a real person. It's already annoying that they have to buy a dinner and that the, there's a whole body attached to it and you have to talk to it. Yeah, and they all, they're thinking of just grabbing you by your ears. Water, water. I want to alert. It's over. Yeah. It's fucked up. Well, I still feel like we're going back to the question. I feel like they can experiment with it like once or twice, but it can't be like a regular thing that they're doing all the time because then yeah, that'll completely fuck up your sex life because then you'll just be looking at everything you do. Like it's supposed to be this hyper reality dual reality. Virtual is just not good.

Speaker 1:          01:14:47       You don't, I was just saying this out. Let's just fast forward here. Okay. Now. So that becomes the thing, right? Which you know what's gonna people are gonna do it and then we're, it's going to become is porn stars will be making all of that fucking money. [inaudible] and it basically you have a girl fucking, ah, they'd probably just be like the whole suit. It's eventually just going to be the whole suit. Right. What are you talking about? Like the whole, I'm talking about like in the future, like when like everybody has like a virtual reality sex suit that's will actually helped the population problem. Right? The virtual reality sex suit [inaudible]. Okay. And then porn stars will then have their likeness, they'll do a POV porn and then they get money and then you have to like subscribe to that. So you can do, you can do a virtual reality thing where you at with any porn starts with like asa, Akira and then he, and then here's what happens.

Speaker 1:          01:15:48       Yeah. Okay. Who's going to be the first celebrity that crosses over and eventually, right, because they're sick of doing superhero movies and they don't want to do the grunt work of an independent cause. Like you notice now they're all doing ads over here. Back in the day, all the celebrities did ads, but they did them overseas, right? Remember we used to go over and we all look at so and so doing a fucking watch thing or look at her doing this thing, but they'd never do them here because it was that whole, um, um, stigma that if you did a commercial, you're a sellout, blah, blah, whatever the fuck it was. Or it's like you're doing a commercial, you're a movie star. I'm, where we start is not even on TV. Forget about doing an ad. Now that all went away, you know? So I'm saying eventually somebody famous would do it,

Speaker 2:          01:16:35       right? You could, yeah. Get a suit and program it so that you're having sex with like Lindsay Lohan or something and the first one, the first and the first level will go down. Now be one of those reality TV show stars. Right. You know when the reality show goes off the air,

Speaker 1:          01:16:50       like Jersey shore, they were all fucking huge. Now it's just disappeared. Where the fuck are they? Right. You could probably talk a couple of them and is doing it right. Are we pitching a show right now?

Speaker 2:          01:17:00       I think or some kind of like high tech concept. We'll that will probably make a lot of money that's going to end up at sounds like a movie. It sounds like. Like a what was bad and this is what's going to happen. You're to have these self driving

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       fucking cars. Huh? You're going to have self driving fucking cars and people would be laying in them in virtual reality suits having sex with any famous person they want to write and bill have like, because you don't need to steer in wheeler gas or brake or anything anymore, you literally feel like your suit in there and then when you're done, you roll rollover up from that seat into like another, like a, uh, like a freshen up like tub or some shit.

Speaker 3:          01:17:36       So I think we're totally going in that direction. I think you're right. We'll, we'll, we'll see it in the next generation. Before it was just, yeah, the fleshbots stuff or just the mold of the vagina or the deck or whatever. And then it's going to be this virtual, it'll be super expensive at first

Speaker 1:          01:17:51       is going to go into a complete, it's gonna be like one flat screen TVs first came out and they have 14 grants. So don't buy the first virtual reality sex suits virtual way to the, like they'd come down to like 800 bucks at best buy. Then you get them right.

Speaker 3:          01:18:06       Figure out how to like make this technology and just like patent it and that's how we'll make our,

Speaker 1:          01:18:11       yeah, yeah. We're going to figure out how to do that. I can't even read copy. We're not calling it that. That's what's going to happen. I've already selling it right now with these self driving cars, like the interiors of cars. What they're going to have now, they're going to have office ones. They're gonna have sleeper ones. People just want to sleep, going to work. They're going to have one second to catch up on your emails and all of that type of shit. Yeah, the different those that'll be like the different, um, the, the social one, the social and office one, all of that type at all. I don't know. And then eventually is going to be like, well, why are you even going to work now? Because everything's automated. And then there's robots, right? And then one day, the whole fucking thing just turns on us.

Speaker 3:          01:18:55       What if there was a company like in some really random, not really random, like a Japan,

Speaker 1:          01:19:01       by the way. Neither one of us is high right now.

Speaker 3:          01:19:03       No, not at all. Completely that high. It's the middle of the day. Never been more sober. What if there was a company somewhere and like, I dunno, not Japan, but like Eastern Europe that said, we want to do this deal with you where we have these like sex dolls with your face on them and they offered you like, yeah, an insane amount of money. No, no, to do it. Oh, and you could buy a bell birth sex doll.

Speaker 1:          01:19:33       Do you realize the photoshops I'm going to get and I'm going to have to re tweak now you asshole.

Speaker 3:          01:19:38       Oh, you're right. Oh, they're going to be horrifying, but hilarious. Like a bill. Birth sex. Um, what'd you do? Yeah, they come out of like somewhere random, like, you know, Norway or just something or like, you know, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:19:53       One of those plays random like Norway, love Norway. That's
