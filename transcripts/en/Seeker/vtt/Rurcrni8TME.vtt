00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.760
Hey guys, Matt here for Science or Fiction.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.520
Flying to far off destinations and exploring
a new city is great, except for the jet lag

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.540
you inevitably get after you land.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.380
But that’s just flying, right?

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.289
It's not like you can just make a plane that
magically gets rid of all the physical effects

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.130
of traveling through the sky at around 35,000
feet for several hours.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.740
That’s just some crazy fantasy that none
of us will experience in our lifetimes…

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.260
it says that right there next to me doesn't it. Yeah, thought so.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.320
If you’ve ever been on a long flight across
multiple time zones, you have probably experienced

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.990
the unfortunate symptoms of jet lag.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.600
Simply put, jet lag is a temporary sleep disorder
that typically occurs when you cross two or

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.840
more time zones.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.780
And there’s a pretty easy explanation as
to why it happens.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.760
When you take off from one time zone and land
in another, your body’s circadian rhythms

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.920
can’t just magically adapt, because your
body still thinks you are in the time zone

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.730
from which you came.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.039
This can leave you feeling irritable, tired,
and it can even cause stomach problems.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.039
Fortunately, it is temporary.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.010
It varies from person to person how long the
symptoms last, but typically it takes a day

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.700
per time zone crossed before your body can
adapt to the new rhythm.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.780
But if you are going on a shorter trip, it
can also put a major kink in your travel plans.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.850
I mean, who wants to get all the way to Berg
en and be too tired to explore the exciting,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.990
second-largest city in Norway?

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.520
Don’t you want to see this bird?

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.049
How about this rack of sweaters?

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.340
Now despite what this article seems to say,
there is no total cure for jet lag (some things

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.130
just require time, guys), but Boeing has designed
a plane that can minimize its symptoms by

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.140
using air pressure and increased humidity.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.439
Most planes are currently pressurized to simulate
the conditions a person would feel at 6 to

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.950
8,000 feet, which isn’t bad considering
that most planes fly between 30 and 40 thousand

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.950
feet.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.170
But 8,000 feet is still a pretty high altitude
that can lead to symptoms like headache and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.620
nausea, similar to what’s called “altitude
sickness”.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.300
The Boeing 787 Dreamliner family of airplanes
is pressurized to a new maximum level of 6,000

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.030
feet; 2,000 feet lower than most other aircraft.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.380
Altitude chamber tests show that because the
body absorbs 8% more oxygen into the blood

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.490
at this altitude, passengers experience fewer
headaches and less dizziness and fatigue.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.010
That lower cabin pressurization is possible
due to increased use of composites.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.840
These new Airplanes are 50 percent composite
by weight.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.700
Carbon fiber reinforced polymer, also known
as CFRP, resists fatigue and corrosion more

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.590
than traditional metals used to build planes,
and therefore allows for more internal pressurization.[1]

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.390
CFRP also means that planes can withstand
more humidity.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.819
Metal can corrode when exposed to humid air,
but that’s not as much of an issue with

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:34.920
the new material.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.680
Now, that matters to you because, while you
might not notice a change in humidity in the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.099
moment, you likely will notice that your throat,
eyes, and nose are less dry when you land.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.909
Now, again, these engineering changes don’t
cure jet lag, but the lower cabin pressurization

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.030
and increased humidity will make you feel
more comfortable during your trip to Bergen.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.390
That being said, I’d sleep on the plane
if you can.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.380
Unfortunately, there’s still no total cure
for jumping time zones.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.709

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.580
Can you get jet lag flying on a helicopter?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.000
I guess then it wouldn’t be jet lag.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Helicopter-lag?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.290
I know you would get a headache because helicopters
are super loud but did you know that there’s

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.010
such a thing as a stealth helicopter.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.900
It’s a thing, check it out here.
