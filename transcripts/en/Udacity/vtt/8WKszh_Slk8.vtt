00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.260
How did we find the value for
x in x -4 = 7?

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.250
When solving an equation,
the goal is to get the variable on one

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.652
side of the equation alone
with a coefficient of one.

00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:16.050
You are not done until your
equation is in this form.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.219
With the equation of x- 4 = 7,
we can do this

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:26.390
by adding four to both
sides of the equation and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.759
then we get x + 0 because
-4 + 4 = 0 = 7+4.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.450
So why did we add four to
both sides of the equation?

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.220
Why can't we just add it to one side?

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.601
That's because an equation
is perfectly balanced.

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:46.588
We could think of equations as scales
that have to have the same value on

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.140
both sides.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.880
If you perform an operation on one side
but not the other side of the equation,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.230
the equation will be out of balance and
therefore it is no longer true.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.430
So if I add four to one side of my
equation but not the other side,

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.610
my equation is no longer in balance.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.550
I have to do the same thing to the other
side to rebalance the equation.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.770
So, how did I decide on four to add?

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.860
It's because I'm trying to
get X by itself and -4+4 = 0.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.211
We can check our work here
by substituting 11 in for

00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:25.030
X in the original equation.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.278
x-4=7 becomes 11-4=7.

00:01:30.278 --> 00:01:34.272
11-4 is indeed equal to 7 so
we did it right.

00:01:34.272 --> 00:01:35.510
Let's try another one.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.970
Find x if x+12=16.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.110
Enter your answer here.
