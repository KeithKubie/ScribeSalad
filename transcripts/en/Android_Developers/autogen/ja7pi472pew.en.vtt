had implemented it and tried to pick the

had implemented it and tried to pick the

00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
particular type of implementation that
 

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.370 align:start position:0%
particular type of implementation that
fit<00:24:58.400><c> the</c><00:24:58.549><c> best</c><00:24:58.820><c> with</c><00:24:59.150><c> the</c><00:24:59.299><c> platform</c><00:24:59.540><c> and</c><00:25:00.169><c> with</c>

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:00.380 align:start position:0%
fit the best with the platform and with

00:25:05.169 --> 00:25:05.179 align:start position:0%
