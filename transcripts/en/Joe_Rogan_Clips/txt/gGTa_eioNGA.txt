Speaker 1:          00:01          It's not good. He might be. That's our mat. I um, I bumped into someone's car once and I left a note with my phone number and my, uh, my address. Nice. And, uh, not my address, my phone number and my name and um, they called me up and they just so happened to be very good friends with someone who else friends with. So then he calls me up and he tells me, dude, you hit my friend's car. And then he tells me, then I go tell him to call me. Man. It's cool. Yeah, it was undetectable. I, it wasn't bad, but it was something. Yeah know it was like, it was a little scuff on the bumper, but it was my, it was, I was like, oh, thank God I left a message. I felt like such a piece of shit up my friend. And he was like, and some fucking asshole hit my friend's car and took off.

Speaker 1:          00:54          You believe that shit. I'm like, no. Crazy Bro. That's, that's bullshit. And now cameras have everybody doing everything so you'll always get busted. Yeah. When do you think it's going to be where you have a Tesla, you know with those things do when you think it's going to be where no one's driving. How many, how many more years? We're, well, we're a lot of people aren't driving 20 I would say 20 to 30 you remember when Prius's were a joke? Yeah. Someone had a preach to like get that fucking stupid thing away from me. Yeah. Or even the early Tesla. The roadster. Like, do you know that top gear you want to, you know that British show top gear? Here's what's crazy. I found out they did an episode where they pretended that the Tesla roadster died on them while they were driving around the track.

Speaker 1:          01:41          But it didn't really die on though. That was just the storyline was that they wanted it to die. So that's gross. Apparently the way the show is made, it's like a comedy show and it's scripted so they can get away with doing something like that. So Elon Musk's sued them and I think he lost, believe it or not, cause they don't claim to be. Exactly. They don't claim to be factual and they complained, they, they, they don't, they don't claim to not have narratives. They create. So gross that up just to make sure that I'm bad. Grossly gross. It's amazing how many shots that they take. Elon Musk called top gear, completely phony and his company sued for libel and malicious falls. So it's a judge dismissed the suit in October saying no view or the program could have reasonably be compared the roadsters performance on the track to real world performance on the street.

Speaker 1:          02:32          That seems fuzzy. I don't know what that means. Okay. What is um, 2012 that way? What is the case? What did he said? What Elon Musk said that was that they faked it and they claim the power Tesla. Okay, let's see what it says. We could figure out, I think, I'm pretty sure that's the story. After tests dropped the car off, Elon Musk claim that one of his employees was along for the delivery. Notice that a script for the episode inside there was a segment about the Tesla breaking down, but that was only the tip of the iceberg. Top gear claim that the Tesla roadster ran out of power while driving after just 55 miles, much less than the 200 miles quoted by Tesla, albeit it was being driven hard. A claim that must said was untrue. According to him, the roadsters logs show that the car had never dipped below 20% charge during the entirety of the filming.

Speaker 1:          03:22          The clip followed with the roadsters motor overheating, which wasn't addressed by mosque. And finally a break failure, which must claims was instead a blown fuse and not an equipment failure. Battery powered electric cars will soon die altogether. Former topcare host James Mason. Ah, interesting. Isn't that amazing? So there were some, it sounds like there was some horseshit for sure, but it does sound like there was a real break problem and the brake problem was a blown fuse, which there's nothing you can do about that, but just that it's such a strange thing that like, yeah, you just have to attack electric cars. Like it's just a, well, I think the wem them making a script. If they had a script that said that the test was going to break down, they thought it was be funny. It's a comedy bit. It's a comedy show with Jeremy Clarkson was fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          04:10          He's really funny. But there is definitely all the people that are, yeah. You believe a lot of the stuff that they say and the performance of the car. I, you know, I always thought it was funny, but I also saw them as experts. Well, they kind of are. Yeah. I mean, uh, they know a lot of shit. Yeah. They know a lot of shit about cars, for sure. Jeremy Clarkson, he knows a lot about cars. The problem is people go to them for advice and lap times and all that shit. And if you're saying a car is breaking down you, you engineered that script, it's pretty dirty. That is dirty. Well, that's how like Sean Hannity gets away with saying that he's not a news program. Does he get away with that? So it's like WWT give news. Yeah. He says it's a, it's a, it's entertainment.

Speaker 1:          04:52          Really. Yeah. Oh dude, that's hilarious. Way. You have a little, a little out. We're not a news program. We don't claim to be. He says that. Yeah. Although a lot of people are coming to, to thinking that's news, but isn't he, um, uh, commentary program? Isn't that what they say? Oh, he's not that. He's new. He says it's entertainment. Oh yeah. Do you find entertaining? No. You should sue, I should say. It's just so I could do, besides this entertaining, he's a liar. It's not that entertaining. I didn't find it entertaining, so I'm going to sue them. And the game of Thrones people, dragons.
