[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.600
KATIE: Thank you for coming
to Jason Phillips talking

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.110
about practical
nutrition application.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.600
I've been a client of
Jason's for a little

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.840
over a year and a half.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.510
He has a variety
of different kinds

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.840
of clients from elite athletes
to regular people like myself,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.520
and even people that have
dietary restrictions, stuff

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.600
like that.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.280
He's a wealth of
knowledge, so I really

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.300
hope that everybody has some
kind of question to contribute.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.564
Without any further
ado, you're better--

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:37.230
JASON PHILLIPS: It
was better this time.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.430
KATIE: I was calmer this year.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.960
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah,
that was better.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.543
We did this last year and Katie
didn't like that part as much.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:45.427
But-- yeah.

00:00:45.427 --> 00:00:47.260
Thank you guys, first
of all, for having me.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.960
I've picked up a little
cold since being here

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.770
the last two days.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.667
I live in Florida
by way of Arizona,

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:53.250
so I'm not quite
used to this weather.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.182
So I apologize if you
hear me sniffling.

00:00:56.182 --> 00:00:58.140
That being said, quick
little background on me,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.389
not that it's super important.

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:02.012
But I got my way into
nutrition and fitness

00:01:02.012 --> 00:01:03.720
a little bit differently
than most people

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.820
find their way into careers.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.670
I was an anorexic at
the age of 18 years old,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.260
walked around at 118 pounds.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.000
That's not a very good look on
a male, but it is what it is.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.430
I found myself in a pretty
bad downward spiral.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.820
I actually credit the whole
fitness and nutrition industry

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.460
for bringing me out
of that and actually

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.710
helping me find my way,
building the businesses

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.777
that I have today.

00:01:26.777 --> 00:01:28.860
So I've been forever
thankful for that and my goal

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.860
has always been
to pay it forward.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.610
That's what brings me
on stages like this.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.530
That's what takes me
into the hundreds of gyms

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.690
that I'm in every year and
working with, literally,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.470
the thousands of clients
that my businesses serve now.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.254
With that being said, I
guess we're here talking

00:01:44.254 --> 00:01:45.420
about practical application.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.180
And I think it's a pretty
appropriate term, in the sense

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.750
that 90% of what you guys hear
outside of walls like this

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.610
is, this is the way to diet.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.720
This is the way to train.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.020
This is-- eliminate
this, do this.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.350
And the reality is, all of it
has some merit for probably

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.145
one specific application.

00:02:03.145 --> 00:02:04.770
Everybody is going
to come in this room

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.311
and every single
person here is going

00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:08.759
to have a separate set of needs.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.190
There's not one dietary
protocol in this world

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.850
that serves each individual's
needs in this room.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.850
So my goal today is to
educate you and teach you

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.307
what you should be looking
at, in terms of setting up

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:21.390
your own dietary protocol.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.120
What things in your lifestyle
should you be observing?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.960
What things within the way that
you have a stress response,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.290
your activity level, your
previous dietary protocols,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.270
your training protocol?

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.950
All of these things
have to go into what

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.590
you're going to do nutritionally
to get the results that you

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.790
desire.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.000
Now, I come to talks like this.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.500
I wasn't brought here because
I'm an amazing public speaker,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.839
but because Katie claimed
I'm a wealth of knowledge.

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:48.630
So I'm not going to
sit up here and lecture

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.980
because that gets boring.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.210
I don't ever bring slides.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.100
That's even more boring.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.600
But what I want to know is,
what do you want to know?

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.600
I like to think that
everybody attends something

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.370
like this because they have
a question in their mind.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.600
There's something you've
heard in the media.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.420
There's something
your friend told you.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.560
There's something you're
currently trying or have

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.830
tried that you're wondering
why it doesn't work

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.410
or why it does work.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.780
So let's get those
out of the way.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.980
Let's put them on the board.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.160
And then I have a really good
base to talk to you about.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.740
Someone has to be really not
awkward and break the ice.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.690
We have a microphone
right over there.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.414
And I think there's
handheld mics that

00:03:23.414 --> 00:03:24.330
can get passed around.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.530
Is this the one?

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.277
Yeah.

00:03:27.277 --> 00:03:28.360
They've got them up there.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.132
So someone's got to be not
awkward and go to the stand.

00:03:31.132 --> 00:03:32.340
And there's a couple of them.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.798
For those of you guys that are
watching on the live stream,

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:37.860
I do have the Dory pulled up and
there's two questions already

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.986
on there.

00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:40.860
But someone in here has
got to be not awkward

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.943
so we can get this moving.

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.720
Maybe?

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.330
There we go.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.280
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.150
JASON PHILLIPS:
What's your name?

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.870
AUDIENCE: Ben Johnson.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.350
JASON PHILLIPS:
Nice to meet you.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.520
AUDIENCE: Thanks
a lot for coming.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.790
JASON PHILLIPS: Absolutely.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.210
Thank you.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.040
AUDIENCE: I joined last time you
were here and it was excellent.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.706
JASON PHILLIPS: Thank
you for having me.

00:03:57.706 --> 00:03:59.000
AUDIENCE: So red meat?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.340
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.923
AUDIENCE: How much
should I be eating?

00:04:00.923 --> 00:04:03.300
Can I get by not
eating red meat?

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.550
Is there a point where I'm
eating way too much red meat

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.490
and it's bad for my heart?

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.130
What are the rules around that?

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.650
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.150
Cool.

00:04:14.062 --> 00:04:15.520
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming, Jason.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.019
JASON PHILLIPS: Thank you.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.344
AUDIENCE: I'm Doug Weiner.

00:04:17.344 --> 00:04:22.120
I have questions around
flour, gluten, GMO, organics.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.130
Where does that fit
in with someone's diet

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.171
and how do they want to
sort of incorporate that?

00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:28.632
And what are the things to
avoid, that kind of stuff?

00:04:28.632 --> 00:04:30.670
JASON PHILLIPS: Absolutely.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.970
I'm going to break it
down into two ways.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.970
I'm going to say flour
and gluten because that's

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:37.940
kind of a hot topic.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.490
But I'm also going to say
quantity versus quality

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.560
because it's another
hot topic in this space.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.280
AUDIENCE: Hey, I'm Mike.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.580
JASON PHILLIPS:
Good to meet you.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.020
AUDIENCE: What do you
consider healthy fats

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.400
versus unhealthy fats, if
such a distinction exists?

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.970
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.132
My name is Scott.

00:04:58.132 --> 00:04:59.590
JASON PHILLIPS:
Where are you from?

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.980
AUDIENCE: England.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.980
JASON PHILLIPS: Awesome.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.900
What part?

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.850
AUDIENCE: Near Birmingham,
a little bit south.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.290
JASON PHILLIPS: I've
been to the NEC.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.620
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.120
OK.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.960
You're on it.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.330
I've recently been doing
spirulina, as in a supplement.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.550
What are the benefits
for spirulina?

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.520
JASON PHILLIPS: I'm going to
go broad and say supplements,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.799
but then I'll put
spirulina in the--

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.560
I was wondering if
there's a difference

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.880
between a whole carb, like brown
rice versus like white rice

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.030
with vegetables when you're
balancing out the fiber

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.640
content of a food on its
own versus the fiber content

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.540
of your meal and how that deals
with glycemic load and things

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.110
like that.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.430
JASON PHILLIPS: So are
we talking glycemic index

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.530
versus glycemic load
versus fiber intake?

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.535
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:05:48.535 --> 00:05:49.660
JASON PHILLIPS: Does that--

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.045
that's what I gathered, right?

00:05:51.045 --> 00:05:51.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.380
JASON PHILLIPS: First,
we said a whole carb.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.255
And then it was brown
rice versus white rice,

00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:56.830
and that's usually
glycemic index.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.260
AUDIENCE: I guess
my question is--

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.490
and I've always wondered,
there are certain foods

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.570
that are high in fiber that are
low glycemic load on their own,

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.267
as a food--

00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:06.100
JASON PHILLIPS: Yes.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.770
AUDIENCE: --because of their
fiber content or whatever.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.310
Is that different, in terms
of how your body processes it

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.110
from eating a simple
carb with lots

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.765
of vegetables, which lowers
the glycemic load of the meal?

00:06:17.765 --> 00:06:19.390
JASON PHILLIPS: Does
this glycemic load

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.760
change from an individual
food to multiple foods?

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.702
AUDIENCE: Sure, yeah.

00:06:22.702 --> 00:06:23.410
That makes sense.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.520
Yeah.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.370
JASON PHILLIPS: Is that
what you're asking?

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.494
AUDIENCE: I think so, yeah.

00:06:25.494 --> 00:06:27.640
JASON PHILLIPS: I think
that's what I'm hearing.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.501
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:28.501 --> 00:06:30.250
JASON PHILLIPS: Quick
answer, I can answer

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.070
that one right away-- no.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.350
Glycemic load is glycemic load.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.840
Let's put a numerical
value on it and say 50.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.680
If it's 50 here, it's
50 here, whether that

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.680
came from white rice and
asparagus or brown rice

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.890
on its own.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.690
But it's good that
you're thinking

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.370
glycemic load versus
glycemic index,

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.327
because glycemic
index is a lot of BS.

00:06:49.327 --> 00:06:50.910
AUDIENCE: Can we
talk about that, too?

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.231
JASON PHILLIPS: Absolutely.

00:06:52.231 --> 00:06:52.730
Yep.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.900
No, that was really good.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.608
I was just trying to
make sure I answered

00:06:59.608 --> 00:07:01.494
the question appropriately.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.910
Thank you.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.442
That was a good question.

AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Tara.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.910
JASON PHILLIPS: Hi.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.243
AUDIENCE: I feel like you
hear a lot of different things

00:07:11.243 --> 00:07:13.020
about, eat multiple
small meals a day.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.530
Keep your metabolism going,
versus I eat one meal a day.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.860
What are your thoughts
on that and constantly

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.194
fueling your metabolism
through lots of snacks?

00:07:22.194 --> 00:07:23.027
JASON PHILLIPS: Yep.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.480
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Katie.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.540
There's also been
a lot of interest

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.100
around different
diets, specifically

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.680
the Whole30 is one that I know
has been really popular lately.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.980
I would love to hear
your thoughts on--

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.800
I don't know if I--

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.615
oh, someone already mentioned
that before I got here.

00:07:44.615 --> 00:07:46.270
But your thoughts
on different diets

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.000
and whether those diets
are all basically fads

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.710
and whether or
not it makes sense

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.885
to even pursue one or change
your whole eating lifestyle.

00:07:53.885 --> 00:07:54.760
JASON PHILLIPS: Sure.

00:07:57.772 --> 00:07:59.230

also like to know

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.438
what you feel about cleanses.

JASON PHILLIPS: You're just
setting me up with that one.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.680
AUDIENCE: When you're
macro counting,

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.330
say you have 135 carbs, 135
protein, and knowing that it's

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.469
four grams per each of them--

00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:18.010
JASON PHILLIPS: Or
calories per gram.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.051
AUDIENCE: Calories, yeah.

00:08:19.051 --> 00:08:21.800
Can you mix that up-- say,
do a little bit more protein

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.570
and a little less carbs?

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.190
I wanted you to
elaborate on that so I

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.675
understand if I can play
with that a little bit

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:29.925
or I have to be kind of exact.

00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:35.270
AUDIENCE: Can you also
explain what a macro is?

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.186
JASON PHILLIPS: I can.

JASON PHILLIPS: Oh, OK.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.930
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about THROWDOWN.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:53.290
JASON PHILLIPS: About THROWDOWN.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:53.998
What's THROWDOWN?

00:08:53.998 --> 00:08:57.640
AUDIENCE: I want to know, why
is THROWDOWN better than some

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.920
of these other stimulants
that get your heart going

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.900
before a workout?

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:02.920
JASON PHILLIPS: When
we get to supplements,

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.700
remind me that
THROWDOWN even exists.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.930
AUDIENCE: I know you don't
like to talk about your own,

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:05.950
but I'm curious.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:06.220
JASON PHILLIPS: I don't.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:06.719
I don't.

00:09:06.719 --> 00:09:08.920
AUDIENCE: So I'm
putting you on the spot.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.420
JASON PHILLIPS:
I'll happily explain

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.912
why it's better than everything
out there, but what else?

00:09:13.912 --> 00:09:15.370
So for anybody that
walked in late,

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.078
we're just going
through a few questions.

00:09:17.078 --> 00:09:20.149
Basically, the fact that it's
far more fun to get answers

00:09:20.149 --> 00:09:21.940
to your own questions
than it is to hear me

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.770
talk about really
boring food stuff.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.364
That's what we're doing.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.370
JASON PHILLIPS: OK.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.570
AUDIENCE: This one's simple.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.426
What's your stance
overall on fruit?

00:09:30.426 --> 00:09:31.800
Because I've read
a lot of things

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.240
around how fruit is bad
now because it has sugar,

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.520
which sounds crazy to me.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.600
So I want to hear from
you what you think.

opinion of Shakeology?

JASON PHILLIPS: How far can I
go without offending people?

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.125
AUDIENCE: OK, good.

00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:00.750
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah,
this is recorded,

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.560
so I don't know if I can
offend that many people.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.460
I would feel really bad
if people are doing it.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.876
I'll tell you why
it's crap, but--

00:10:11.655 --> 00:10:12.530

hear your thoughts on dairy.

eat dairy or meat.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:20.270
So--

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.269
JASON PHILLIPS: Why not?

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:23.060
Just so I know which
route I'm going down.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.620
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.800
I did a January where
I did a vegan diet

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.301
and felt so much
better, in general,

00:10:29.301 --> 00:10:30.466
with everything, kept on it.

00:10:30.466 --> 00:10:32.690
JASON PHILLIPS: Was that a
21-day jumpstart, perhaps?

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.250
AUDIENCE: Mm, no, it was
just a month with friends.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.625
We were like,
let's just try this

00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:38.660
out as a cleanse in
January five years ago.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.925
And now that's my
consistent diet.

00:10:40.925 --> 00:10:41.930
I eat fish, though.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.480
So curious to hear
your thoughts on what

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.890
I should be considering, if
a no-dairy diet is something

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.526
that you're doing.

00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:51.650
JASON PHILLIPS: Pro or con.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:52.280

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:52.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.060
JASON PHILLIPS: Sure.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.037
When I get to dairy, I
might have you remind me

00:10:55.037 --> 00:10:57.620
of some of those details because
I won't remember all of that.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.380
But that's a really good
question and a lot of good

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.305
can come out of that.

00:11:01.305 --> 00:11:02.180

AUDIENCE: Quick
question on organic.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.910
From a broad base standpoint,
organic is exploding.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.980
Do you think that
certain categories,

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.360
it's worth more to
pay more for organic?

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.570
Or is it kind of all
just label reading?

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:25.720

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.055
Victoria.

00:11:26.055 --> 00:11:27.805
I was wondering if you
could kind of speak

00:11:27.805 --> 00:11:30.680
to what types of meals
you'd have pre-workout,

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.720
post-workout, aligning with the
macros and the meal planning.

00:11:46.352 --> 00:11:46.860
KATIE: OK.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.984
And maybe you want to write
down the Dory questions

00:11:48.984 --> 00:11:49.600
on the board.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.080
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.630
Another one came in, I think?

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.135
No.

00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:55.200
All right.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.220
On the Dory, we have, "what
is my stance with somebody

What is the long term effect of
extended periods of undereating

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.130
and/or eating poorly?"

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:08.460
That just changed.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.140
"Is it possible to
do irreparable damage

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.130
to the metabolism or
is this a wives' tale?"

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.250
For that person, I'm
going to categorize

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.900
that as metabolic adaptation.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.810
I'll explain that and that
should answer your question.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:37.011

over yours that's on here?

00:12:37.011 --> 00:12:37.510

"How does the effect

to the stress of
physically overtraining?"

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.820
I'm just going to categorize

"What are my thoughts
on the blood type diet?"

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.630
For Googlers who
haven't heard of this--

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.964
I hadn't until another
Googler told me about it--

00:12:55.964 --> 00:12:57.380
it's a nutritional
philosophy that

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.900
advocates a different diet for
each of the four blood types.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.850
I'm going to answer
that really quickly.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:02.780
It has zero merit.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.170
There's zero
scientific basis to it.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.700
If you actually go and you
read the peer reviewed studies,

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.780
we've not proven that a blood
type actually correlates

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.970
with certain food
intakes or intolerances.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.020
As with anything,
and as you'll get

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.184
to know by the end of today, if
you feel good that way, great.

00:13:23.184 --> 00:13:25.100
But you're going to see
that any specific food

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.970
type is far inferior to
the total quantity of food

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.710
consumed.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.119
That's a quick
answer to that one

00:13:32.119 --> 00:13:33.410
without going too deep into it.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.690
In all fairness, I haven't
done tons of research,

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.080
but I know empirically
or evidence-based,

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.570
it doesn't have any merit.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.010
"Calorie spiking, i.e.

in hitting weight targets,

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.270
I've never heard it
called calorie spiking,

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.700
but I'll label it that way.

00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:02.670
All right.

questions come up--

KATIE: As we go,
after this, don't

00:14:10.602 --> 00:14:10.860
be afraid to raise your hand.

JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.631
This whole thing is definitely
meant to be interactive.

00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:15.570
So as we go, if I'm
not explaining it

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.550
in a way that resonates
with you, by all means,

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.496
tell me to shut up and
ask more questions.

00:14:23.819 --> 00:14:25.860
AUDIENCE: I've got two
questions on opposite ends

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.370
of the spectrum.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.070
JASON PHILLIPS: Sure.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.407
AUDIENCE: One is, do you
have any thoughts on fasting,

00:14:29.407 --> 00:14:30.490
like intermittent fasting?

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:31.496
JASON PHILLIPS: Like
intermittent fasting?

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:31.882
Sure.

00:14:31.882 --> 00:14:32.507
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:32.507 --> 00:14:35.560
And the other-- and I
really enjoyed the last talk

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.700
you gave, especially the
conversation towards the end

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.670
that we had about booze.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.670
JASON PHILLIPS: Alcohol.

00:14:45.387 --> 00:14:47.970
Man, I thought we were going to
get away without that question

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:48.340
this time.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.840
I thought people
were actually going

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.870
to think I was really nice.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.800
OK, cool.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.920
Where do we start?

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.940
I'm going to start with this
one-- quality versus quantity.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.300
Who brought that one up?

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.266
That was on you, right?

00:15:04.266 --> 00:15:04.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.056
JASON PHILLIPS: Give me the
specific really quickly.

00:15:07.056 --> 00:15:09.930
AUDIENCE: Well, just
as far as my wife

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.740
has been trying a bunch
of different diets,

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.570
specifically Shakeology is
one of the ones that came up.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.320
JASON PHILLIPS: Got it.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.300
AUDIENCE: And so
we've been looking

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.091
at what are some of
the food choice options

00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:19.470
for her, in terms
of what to pick.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.810
And then, obviously,
organics and GMO foods

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.860
are something that's a
very hot topic right now.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.710
So I'm just trying to navigate
that a little bit to make

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.377
recommendations.

00:15:26.377 --> 00:15:27.335
JASON PHILLIPS: Got it.

00:15:27.335 --> 00:15:27.840
OK.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.756
Quality versus quantity
is the biggest debate,

00:15:29.756 --> 00:15:32.430
I think, in the nutritional
industry right now.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.860
I think if you've paid
any attention to what

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.230
the literature suggests in
the last five or six years--

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.260
and when I say
literature, I mean media--

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.968
the media is trying
to get you to believe

00:15:40.968 --> 00:15:43.440
that you need to be paleo
or you need to do Whole30

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.630
and it only needs to
be quality emphasis.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.840
And I think that's great.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.756
I think that, for the
first time as a culture,

00:15:48.756 --> 00:15:51.060
our awareness of what
we're actually consuming

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.475
is at its peak.

00:15:52.475 --> 00:15:53.850
The problem is I
think that we've

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:57.660
traded an awareness of quantity
for quality exclusively,

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.414
and they're not
mutually exclusive.

00:16:00.414 --> 00:16:02.580
To use an example, I think
we could all in this room

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.940
agree that chicken
and broccoli or salmon

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.850
and asparagus-- they're both
relatively healthy meals.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:12.390
The problem becomes if you
eat 500 calories of chicken

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.255
and broccoli, you're
going to starve.

00:16:14.255 --> 00:16:16.380
And you're going to end up
in metabolic adaptation.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.480
You're going to find out
what that is later today.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.210
If you eat 5,000 calories
of chicken and broccoli,

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.260
you're going to be fat.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.030
Right?

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.190
It's factual.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.290
They're numbers.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.260
Your body, it always
comes down to calories.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.140
So when we get into
quality versus quantity,

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.520
it's really clear, in
terms of metabolism

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.520
that quantity is number one.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.790
But I would argue
that quality is 1A.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.120
I believe the gap has closed
a lot in our awareness,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.180
but to sit here and say,
well, Shakeology works.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.354
If you look at somebody that
had a prior diet to Shakeology,

00:16:48.354 --> 00:16:50.520
you're probably talking
about somebody overconsuming

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.186
calories, right?

00:16:51.186 --> 00:16:53.340
3,000, 4,000
calories as somebody

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.347
with a BMR around 2,000.

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.430
Well, all of a sudden, you
put them on Shakeology,

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:57.500
and they're restricted to--

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.000
I don't know what
it is, truthfully,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.770
but it's three shakes a day and
a meal or something like that.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.065
They're probably coming
down to like 1,500 calories.

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:05.940
There was nothing magical
about those shakes,

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.689
except for the BS that
they're selling you

00:17:07.689 --> 00:17:11.430
in their $100 shakes and the
30 people getting paid on it.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.547
But what happened is
the calories came down.

00:17:13.547 --> 00:17:15.630
And as the calories came
down, well, what happens?

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.069
Now you're in a calorie deficit.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.020
Your body's going
to spit off energy.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.579
It's actually going to burn fat.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:21.680
Well, that's fat loss.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.540
You could have done
that without the shakes.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:23.760
Right?

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.500
You could've done that with
whole foods across the board,

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.791
and you probably could have
gotten more micronutrients.

00:17:27.791 --> 00:17:30.600
So I think that's
the big debate here.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.850
In terms of paleo, right?

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.580
In an athletic setting, if I
were to be in a CrossFit gym

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.650
today, I would be bashing paleo.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.400
Because there's big
problems with paleo.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:39.899
Right?

00:17:39.899 --> 00:17:43.486
There's no quality
control over that diet.

00:17:43.486 --> 00:17:44.610
And somebody asked Whole30.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.780
Who was that?

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.070
Whole30, right?

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.260
That's the biggest
problem with Whole30.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.430
There's no quantity control.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.130
So they're telling
you, don't eat this.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.210
Don't eat that.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:54.920
Eat this.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.620
Eat that.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.790
But how much?

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.630
Right?

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.840
Oh, well, put half your
plate protein, a tiny portion

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.920
carbohydrate.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.180
But how does that--

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.360
if you and I were to do that,
and 5% of your plate is carbs,

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.860
and 5% is mine,
I don't know what

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.130
you're doing after work today.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.410
I don't know if
you're going to train.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.060
That diet doesn't know
if I'm going to train.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.890
I don't know the intensity
at which you train.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.180
They don't know the
intensity at which I train.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.470
I don't know your life stress.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.010
I don't know your
metabolic history.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:18.510
Right?

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.520
So every diet has to
start with some sort

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.370
of previous background
on the individual.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.970
So I think the
concepts of Whole30,

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.660
I think the concepts of
food quality are fantastic.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.210
But I think that they're missed
by not addressing quantity

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:33.930
first.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.310
And I actually think--

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.680
mark my words, I'm glad
this is being recorded--

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.270
I think in five to
six years, you'll

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.700
see a really big
diet fad come out

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.920
that merges these two together.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.530
Somebody will hack the
way to put that out there,

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.030
and will say, well, these
are the foods you should eat,

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.196
but this is how you should
figure out your quantity.

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:52.500
I'm not sure how it's
being done because, again,

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.110
an individual recall is needed.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.570
And all of these macro
calculators on the internet

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.220
are the worst things to
ever hit the internet.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.068
But does that answer
both questions?

00:19:04.068 --> 00:19:07.070
AUDIENCE: For the most part,
what I'm thinking about now--

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.320
JASON PHILLIPS: Does that
answer the Whole30 question?

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:09.944
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:09.944 --> 00:19:11.910
JASON PHILLIPS: OK.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.171
Go ahead.

00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:13.920
AUDIENCE: Testing.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.290
So what I'm thinking about
now is, in context of my wife,

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.370
she did Shakeology.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.750
She lost a bunch of weight.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.400
She went off Shakeology.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.270
She gained some weight back.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.250
It just happened.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.170
And I'm just trying to
figure out without--

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.150
obviously, working with someone
like yourself would be the best

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:30.710
way to go to take
all of those inputs

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.910
that you just said into
consideration to design a diet

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.440
plan to address that.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.230
But I'm just thinking in my
head, what's an easy approach

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.350
to try and do, I guess, a
calorie deficit environment?

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:43.921
JASON PHILLIPS: For sure.

00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:45.920
The first thing I would
recommend to everybody--

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.587
if you take nothing
else away from today

00:19:47.587 --> 00:19:50.253
but this next statement, this is
the single most important thing

00:19:50.253 --> 00:19:51.320
to take away.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.100
Go home.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.130
Track your food
intake for five days.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.980
99% of people do not
have an awareness

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.600
of what they currently take in.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.730
So right now, the situation
you just explained

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.340
is Shakeology, not Shakeology.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.760
I don't know what this number
of calories and macros is.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.260
I don't know what the number
of this calories and macros is.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.630
I guarantee you there's
a very big discrepancy

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.290
and that's the singular reason
for the weight loss and regain.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:19.280
So let's create an awareness
here, minus Shakeology.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.470
Let's call it 3,000
calorie baseline.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.900
It's probably not, but
let's use semantics.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.780
Let's sit here and have a
baseline, hypotheticals.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:27.560
OK?

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.600
Let's create a
deficit from that.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.410
Let's go in.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.290
Let's spend 20 minutes at
night and let's build a plan.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.700
Let's say 20% caloric
reduction, 15%.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.740
450 calorie reduction.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.240
Great.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.040
Make a meal plan that's
sustainable to you

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.300
with 25, 50 calories, right?

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.230
Simple.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.690
Now adhere to that
for a couple of weeks.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:49.710
Did you lose weight?

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:50.270
Great.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.320
It wasn't the
shakes that did it.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.600
See how it becomes
relatively simple?

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.910
But first you have
to have awareness.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:00.042
Almost every single person
operates without awareness.

00:21:00.042 --> 00:21:02.250
I don't know the types of
problems you guys encounter

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.790
here at Google.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.870
When my head goes to
IT, it's like, OK,

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.290
I have a computer issue.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:08.340
They're not going
to get on and start

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.214
telling you things to
fix before they ask you

00:21:10.214 --> 00:21:11.387
what the problem is.

00:21:11.387 --> 00:21:13.470
Well, we need to address
what the problem and what

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.720
the current need state
of an individual is.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.100
Everybody should know
their need state.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:18.699
Make sense?

00:21:18.699 --> 00:21:20.240
Does that answer
the question better?

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:20.820
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.820
JASON PHILLIPS: Awesome.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.030
As we dig into that,
we're going to dig

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.340
into things like the whole
flour, gluten argument,

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.320
and then the dairy thing.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.810
The dietary trends I talked
about are the Whole30s.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.120
They are the paleo
diets of the world.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.980
And forgive me if
I'm wrong, because I

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.680
don't read a lot of Whole30
because it is such crap.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.304
They tell you not to
have gluten and dairy.

00:21:43.304 --> 00:21:45.720
I'm pretty sure those are two
things that are not allowed.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.219
Awesome.

00:21:46.219 --> 00:21:49.240
So for 25, 30 years, you
had gluten and dairy.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.610
It never gave you bloating.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.341
It never-- it didn't
mess up your skin.

00:21:52.341 --> 00:21:54.090
You really didn't have
any issues with it.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:54.750
You lived fine.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:55.800
You had energy.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.239
Some book and some
group of people

00:21:57.239 --> 00:21:59.280
just told you it was the
devil so you cut it out.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:21:59.780
Great.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.200
You cut it out for a year.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.910
You really didn't like
the results of it.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.710
Then you go back, and
you try to put dairy in,

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:05.880
or you try to put gluten in.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.671
All of a sudden, you
have dairy, and you're

00:22:07.671 --> 00:22:09.020
running to the toilet.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.610
But for 25 or 30 years,
it didn't affect you.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.120
Why after this one
year is it not--

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.657
is it basically affecting you?

00:22:14.657 --> 00:22:16.740
What happens is when you
stop consuming something,

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.490
the enzymes responsible
for processing it,

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:19.971
they down regulate.

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:20.970
You're not consuming it.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.553
Those enzymes don't
need to be active.

00:22:22.553 --> 00:22:23.940
They're gone.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.860
The problem is those are what's
called non-resilient enzymes.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:30.370
So when you go to put it back
in, they may never come back.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.460
So a large segment
of our population

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.530
that is complaining
about dairy and gluten

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.650
right now probably created
their own lactose and gluten

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.230
intolerance.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.860
Thank you, paleo and
Whole30, because that's

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.069
what we're getting from that.

00:22:46.069 --> 00:22:48.651
So the people that are cutting
those things out of their diet,

00:22:48.651 --> 00:22:50.500
they better be ready
to do it for life.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.226
Any dietary change
you make, you better

00:22:52.226 --> 00:22:53.350
be ready to do it for life.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.537
If you're not, don't make it.

00:22:55.537 --> 00:22:58.120
No diet-- I don't care if it's
sustainable for a year, if it's

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.210
sustainable for the next
50 years, 100 years,

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.570
however long we're
alive, don't do it.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:05.880
Make sense?

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.530
Somebody had asked about dairy.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.460
Does that make sense?

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.743
Does that answer some of
the question that you had?

00:23:10.743 --> 00:23:12.159
AUDIENCE: Well, I
was just curious

00:23:12.159 --> 00:23:14.472
if you had other thoughts on--

00:23:14.472 --> 00:23:15.930
JASON PHILLIPS:
There's no research

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.540
that says dairy is
good or bad, right?

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.310
A lot of dairy has
live active cultures.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:21.730
It has great probiotics in it.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.570
There's no reason
not to consume it.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.020
I think a lot of
paleo and Whole30

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.570
is founded on very
specific applications.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.310
Rob Wolfe is a super smart dude.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.740
He brought the paleo
diet to the forefront.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.920
He also brought the paleo diet
to the forefront in the sense

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.290
that he said, hey,
this is a great diet

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.700
for autoimmune application.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.490
So if you have an
autoimmune disease,

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.280
perhaps you should stick
to paleo-friendly foods.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.470
You should not consume dairy.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:53.100
If you don't have it, why are
we living in a diet specialized

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.050
for that population?

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.760
It doesn't make
much sense to me.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.260
At the risk of potentially--

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.540
I would hate to eliminate
dairy for a year.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.040
And then you're telling me
for the rest of my life,

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.956
I can't have desserts
that have dairy in them.

00:24:03.956 --> 00:24:05.160
No, thanks.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.451
That's not a very good
quality of life for me.

00:24:07.451 --> 00:24:08.076
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:08.076 --> 00:24:09.659
I think there's just
a lot of research

00:24:09.659 --> 00:24:12.423
around the Mediterranean
diet and vegan diets

00:24:12.423 --> 00:24:14.595
and how it's good for
your heart and there's

00:24:14.595 --> 00:24:17.011
a lot of-- there's a ton of
different books and things out

00:24:17.011 --> 00:24:18.230
there you can read.

00:24:20.332 --> 00:24:22.290
JASON PHILLIPS: Remember
that books are written

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.580
to sell, first and foremost.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.080
Right?

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:25.704
I wrote a book.

00:24:25.704 --> 00:24:27.450
I sold it, made
some money on it.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:28.970
Great.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.720
A lot of times,
publishers will go to them

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.300
and be like, how can
you frame this to sell?

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.520
And when you start
looking into--

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.830
if you actually dug
into the studies

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.560
and you looked at the
limitations of the application

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.311
of the studies cited
in those books,

00:24:42.311 --> 00:24:44.310
the best one I can think
of is carb backloading.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.600
I'll address that in a second.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.790
You start seeing it was a
very selective population.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.100
It was a very small
sample size and it really

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.290
hasn't been tested
year in, year out.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:54.840
Now also remember, those
people were largely unhealthy

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.100
before they got on this diet.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.110
So was it that
specific dietary change

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.880
that created that
next level of health?

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.230
Possibly.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:02.580
Was it exclusively that?

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.810
We don't know.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:05.820
So there's a lot of
ambiguity in the space.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.130
My answer to you would be this.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:09.720
If you feel really
good off dairy,

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.270
and that's sustainable for
you for the rest of your life,

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.832
absolutely do it.

00:25:13.832 --> 00:25:15.540
If you don't feel like
that's sustainable

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.040
for you the rest of
your life and it's not

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.248
a single thing holding you
back from that next level,

00:25:19.248 --> 00:25:21.640
don't start there.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.171
See how there's always an "if"?

00:25:23.171 --> 00:25:25.170
And that's the one thing
that's the hardest part

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:26.552
about doing seminars like this.

00:25:26.552 --> 00:25:29.010
I would love to be like, yeah,
there's a definitive answer.

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:30.676
99% of the stuff we'll
talk about today,

00:25:30.676 --> 00:25:32.280
there's no definitive answer.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.610
It's what's going to
suit you long term.

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.344
Does that makes sense?

00:25:37.344 --> 00:25:39.280
AUDIENCE: Could you
talk about the enzymes

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.490
as they relate to sugar?

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.870
When you start to reduce
your sugar intake,

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.580
over what time horizon
does your body [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.170
JASON PHILLIPS:
Yeah, so sugar should

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:51.670
be less about
enzymatic production

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:53.590
and more about blood
sugar regulation, right?

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:55.390
And so the extreme
example of that

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.040
would be going super
low carbohydrate

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.670
into a ketogenic state.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.240
You're basically
lowering-- you're basically

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.367
decreasing your insulin
sensitivity long term,

00:26:03.367 --> 00:26:05.200
because you're living
in a state of ketosis.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.390
You don't really have to learn
how to take in carbohydrates.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.150
So if you decrease
carbohydrate intake

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.160
for a super long
time, especially

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.980
the female population, you
decrease insulin sensitivity,

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.180
you're actually going
to a really hard time

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.346
reintroducing carbohydrates.

00:26:17.346 --> 00:26:20.320
It has to be done
in a systemized way.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.860
That's why you see a lot of
females, specifically, whose

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.529
metabolisms are very less
resilient than males.

00:26:26.529 --> 00:26:27.445
It's just unfortunate.

00:26:27.445 --> 00:26:29.200
It's the way it is.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.080
They have a hard time
going low carb back

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.020
to normal calorie, normal
carbohydrate intake,

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.620
especially if that low carb or
ketogenic state was prolonged.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.690
So all these diets out
there that are like,

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.910
well, go super low
carb for three months,

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.326
and then we're
going to go through

00:26:44.326 --> 00:26:46.570
this carb reintroduction stage.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.445
I was just in
Louisiana and they had

00:26:48.445 --> 00:26:50.950
one called the Ideal Protein
diet or something like that.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.450
And they were telling
me about that,

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:54.910
where it's all this protein,
and then at some week,

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:56.290
you reintroduce carbs.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.240
For the male population, great.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.980
Male metabolisms, male
hormone profiles--

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.330
they're built for that.

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:02.170
That's not an issue.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:04.210
Females-- you're not.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.150
Females have a greater degree
of metabolic adaptation faster.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:08.760
It just is what it is.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.180
There are statistics around it.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.962
We don't know why, internally.

00:27:12.962 --> 00:27:14.170
Does that make sense, though?

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:15.753
So it's not really
an enzymatic thing.

00:27:15.753 --> 00:27:18.490
It's an insulin
sensitivity thing.

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:21.970
So reducing sugar, assuming
carbohydrate intake stays

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:22.570
normal--

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.220
fantastic idea.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.080
Now we're reducing inflammation.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.790
Now we're reducing--
we're keeping

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:30.430
blood sugar more stable for
a prolonged period of time.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.430
When blood sugar is stable,
energy levels are higher.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:35.800
You also have less
propensity to store fat.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:36.814
That's a great idea.

00:27:36.814 --> 00:27:38.230
So if we're reducing
sugar intake,

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:39.910
keeping carbohydrate
intake high,

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.310
or keeping it moderate or
relative to where it was,

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:43.240
awesome idea.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.940
Reducing sugar intake plus
reducing overall carb intake--

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.000
not a great idea.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.300
Make sense?

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.850
Question came up on the Dory
that had to do with this.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.620
"What if you have cut something
out for several months?

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.420
Are you basically out of
luck to reintroduce it?

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.670
How long does it take to
totally lose those enzymes

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:58.690
and never be able
to get them back?"

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:00.910
The question on the
duration is I don't know.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.157
It's going to be relative
to each individual.

00:28:03.157 --> 00:28:04.990
But let me reiterate
that I was specifically

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.066
talking about gluten and dairy.

00:28:07.066 --> 00:28:09.820
Dairy and gluten are the
non-resilient enzymes.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.720
Let's say you cut it out
for other food groups

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.640
or other types of things.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.610
The literature
isn't super clear as

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.250
to the rate at which
it's going to come back,

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:22.309
if you can get it back.

00:28:22.309 --> 00:28:24.100
And even on gluten and
dairy, not everybody

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.641
is going to be
non-resilient forever.

00:28:25.641 --> 00:28:27.970
Some people are going
to get those back.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:31.300
But just being aware of the fact
that they are non-resilient,

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.720
some population will
never get them back.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.940
That's the takeaway of what I
was trying to get out there.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.080
Hopefully, that answers
your question, Anonymous.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.860
On that, we'll go to glycemic
index versus glycemic load.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.550
Obviously, I think
10, 11 years ago,

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:52.200
glycemic index was super hot.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.822
They said, got to
eat brown rice.

00:28:53.822 --> 00:28:54.780
Cannot have white rice.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.240
Got to eat sweet potatoes.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.680
Can't have white potatoes.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.161
Got to eat oatmeal, can't
have cereal, et cetera.

00:29:00.161 --> 00:29:00.660
I'm sorry.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.550
That's complete BS.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.230
The reality is a
calorie is a calorie.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:05.550
A carb is a carb.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.250
It might impact your
insulin a different way.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:09.727
That is the truth.

00:29:09.727 --> 00:29:12.060
But we have to know what the
outcome we're talking about

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.520
is if we're even
talking about it.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.340
There's this whole
popular movement

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.520
of if it fits your macros,
flexible dieting application.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.405
It all actually started in
the bodybuilding community.

00:29:23.405 --> 00:29:25.530
And so remember that the
bodybuilding community has

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.380
one goal, and that's
to look really good

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.310
on a specific date on a stage.

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:34.620
They don't get tested for health
markers when they're on stage.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.940
We don't look internally.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.200
We don't do blood work.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.090
We don't ask them how they feel.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.800
We judge them strictly
on aesthetics.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.190
So in terms of glycemic
index, in terms

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.590
of sugar versus
fibrous carbohydrate,

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:50.160
a carb is a carb, in
terms of aesthetics.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.960
Now we get into the
health side of things.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.370
It's completely different.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:55.407
Insulin response matters.

00:29:55.407 --> 00:29:57.240
We don't want a super
high insulin response,

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.310
or you're going
to feel like crap.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:59.430
Energy levels are
going to go real high.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.010
They're going to crash.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.620
You're going to feel
real bad, right?

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.700
They're going be all
over the place all day.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.560
That's where some of
that fatigue comes from.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.450
But when we're looking at
glycemic index versus glycemic

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.550
load, how many people in
here-- show of hands--

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.670
eat a bowl of white rice by
itself or a bowl of brown rice

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:15.120
by itself on a regular basis?

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.640
Those of you guys that can't
see the room, that's zero, OK?

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:22.020
You're always going to
pair that with a food--

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.440
white rice with steak,
brown rice with chicken,

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.040
whatever, sweet potatoes
with some sort of meat,

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.700
or if you're a vegan, even
with another carbohydrate.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.040
That's going to change
the overall impact

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.660
of that food on your
body, and that's

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.700
what's known as glycemic load.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.370
So earlier, we referenced--
glycemic load of two

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.490
paired foods versus one food
by itself is the same, right?

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:47.220
The number is the number.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.860
So if we were to even
be taking into account

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.190
some sort of glycemic
variable, index or load,

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:55.170
we should take into
account the glycemic load.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.600
But even that is going to be
secondary to what we first

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.080
talked about, which is
the quantity of the food.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.000
The overall quantity
of the macros

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.505
relative to the overall
calorie intake for the day.

00:31:06.505 --> 00:31:07.380
Does that make sense?

00:31:10.782 --> 00:31:12.730
AUDIENCE: Can you
explain what a macro is?

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:14.434
JASON PHILLIPS: Yes, a macro--

00:31:14.434 --> 00:31:15.600
I should have started there.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.070
I apologize.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.700
So that's actually really good.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.866
I don't know why
I didn't do that.

00:31:23.866 --> 00:31:26.410
A macronutrient-- it's a
protein, a carbohydrate,

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.480
or a fat.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.610
When we start and we look
at any dietary protocol--

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:32.720
I mentioned earlier,
to this gentleman,

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.050
Shakeology versus
non-Shakeology, total calorie

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.870
intake versus a
lower calorie intake.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:39.940
It's one thing I
explained in that.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.130
It's calorie control
that determines

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.080
weight gain or weight loss.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.850
That's always how
it's going to be.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.310
However, when we're
looking at fat loss,

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.890
we're looking at composition
of those calories

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:52.630
that we're now controlling.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.990
Perfect example of that
is the McDonald's study.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:56.761
I think I cited that
last time I was here.

00:31:56.761 --> 00:31:57.760
There's a guy out there.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.176
He said, I'm going
to lose weight.

00:31:59.176 --> 00:32:01.220
I'm going to eat
nothing but McDonald's

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.430
in a calorie-controlled manner.

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.620
He ate nothing but McDonald's
in a calorie deficit.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.640
He successfully lost weight.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.900
They looked at the body
composition that he lost.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.400
He lost muscle
and kept body fat.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.420
So when you put two and two
together, he lost weight,

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.930
but he got fatter.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:21.960
Is that anybody's goal?

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.470
OK, good.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.730
So when we look
at two things, we

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.270
try to create a calorie deficit.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.686
We try to create
a calorie deficit

00:32:28.686 --> 00:32:31.165
with an appropriate
macronutrient composition

00:32:31.165 --> 00:32:32.790
because I don't know
anybody that wants

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.280
to lose muscle and gain fat.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.630
And if so, that's cool.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:40.200
We can have another
conversation or we

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.440
can take you somewhere else.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.390
So that's what a
macro is and that's

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:47.160
why we worry about
macro composition.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.160
In fact, every single client
I work with, I don't even

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.230
tell them their calories,
because what I get

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:55.380
is, I get the macro
manipulation game.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:56.950
So they come to me
and they're like,

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:59.310
oh, I can have 2,500 calories?

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:02.580
Cool-- I wanted cake tonight, so
instead of all that protein you

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.800
told me to eat, I
had more calories

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.410
from carbohydrates
and fat, cool.

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:09.780
You're going to be like
that McDonald's dude.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.534
So macro manipulation
doesn't work out, long term.

00:33:13.534 --> 00:33:15.450
On that, we'll go to the
protein-carbohydrate,

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:16.980
the calorie balance.

00:33:20.344 --> 00:33:22.510
The biggest thing, when
you're in a calorie deficit,

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:25.720
is understanding there has to be
enough dietary protein, right?

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.220
So when you're in
a calorie deficit,

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.305
the single goal of
any dietary phase

00:33:29.305 --> 00:33:31.510
is preserve the
lean muscle tissue--

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:32.620
strip the body fat, right?

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.620
That's what we're after.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.480
We're trying to get leaner.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.450
The lean muscle
tissue is actually

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.526
your most metabolically
active tissue at rest.

00:33:39.526 --> 00:33:40.900
So the more lean
tissue you have,

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.980
the more calories
you're burning at rest.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.813
We don't want to put
ourselves in a position

00:33:44.813 --> 00:33:46.600
where we're going to lose that.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.504
That's where protein
intake comes into play.

00:33:48.504 --> 00:33:50.920
You have proteins, and you
have protein-sparing nutrients.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.960
When the protein-sparing
nutrients are lower--

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.030
i.e. carbs and
fats being lower--

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.470
the need for protein goes up.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:57.886
So when you're in
calorie deficit,

00:33:57.886 --> 00:34:00.280
your protein intake's always
going to be at its highest.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.130
Take somebody that's
trying to gain weight,

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.130
now we could potentially
bring that protein down

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.620
and bring the carbs and fats
up because they're already

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.000
in a calorie surplus.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.030
There's really no need to worry
about sparing that protein.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.110
You have plenty of
calories to go there.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.239
Does that make sense?

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:14.670
So are they interchangeable?

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:16.960
The answer is no.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.784
Make sense?

00:34:17.784 --> 00:34:20.409
From a calorie perspective, you
might still see the same result

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:21.489
on the scale.

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:24.111
But you're not going to see
the same result in the mirror.

00:34:24.111 --> 00:34:24.860
And I have never--

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:25.130
AUDIENCE:
[? Because you didn't ?]

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:26.510
increase your protein?

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:29.690
JASON PHILLIPS: Correct--
well, if carbs come down--

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.330
so you're talking about if carbs
come down and proteins go up.

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:35.570
The problem there--
in some instances,

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:39.757
that's fantastic, assuming a
normal functioning metabolism.

00:34:39.757 --> 00:34:41.840
And so I'm sitting here
knowing our work together.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.449
Assuming metabolically
adapted, no,

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.819
that's not going to work
because carbohydrates

00:34:46.819 --> 00:34:49.630
have the most impact on
the metabolism, right?

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:53.690
So if somebody has a previously
non-functioning metabolism,

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:55.250
we have to have
carbohydrate intake

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.970
to spike those metabolic
hormones-- that leptin,

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.612
that ghrelin, that
T4 to T3 conversion.

00:35:00.612 --> 00:35:02.570
And so if we're actively
reducing carbohydrates

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:05.660
in favor of protein, you will
eventually create glucose

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:10.040
in your body, but in
a very non-efficient

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.710
metabolic pathway.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.320
Does that make sense?

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:19.650
OK, within that is
the meal frequency.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:22.520
How many times you eat
a day does not matter.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:26.450
There is actually more and
more evidence coming out

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:30.290
that a less frequent meal
schedule is actually better,

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:33.140
in terms of muscle
gain and fat loss.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.350
Now, does that mean we should
go to intermittent fasting?

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:37.580
And the answer is no.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.080
There is absolutely
nothing magical

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.520
about intermittent fasting.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.505
I have one time that
I will give somebody

00:35:42.505 --> 00:35:43.880
an intermittent
fasting protocol,

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.520
and that's if we're seeing
really poor digestion.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.990
There are studies that show an
uptick in digestion and ability

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:54.990
to digest based on a
prolonged fasting period.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.290
So that's really where
that application comes in.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:59.210
In terms of fat loss,
there's zero research

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.250
that supports it,
especially in terms

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.980
of maintaining lean tissue
or adding lean tissue.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.100
There's actually research
that supports it's awful

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:10.560
and that it should never
be used in that protocol.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.450
So a certain website
out there, "Lean Gains,"

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:15.700
is completely full of crap.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.100
And that's just evidence-based.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.720
The science is out there,
so that's not conjecture.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.930
However, this being said, if you
look at intermittent fasting,

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:27.350
like I said with our
argument on the Shakeology,

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:29.350
you see a lot of
people-- if I told you,

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:31.760
and you're not aware of what
your caloric intake is now,

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.301
that your feeding
window is shortened

00:36:33.301 --> 00:36:35.630
to five hours versus
12 hours, you're

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.270
going to consume less calories.

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:39.180
Well, why did you lose fat?

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.680
Not because of any
fasting protocol,

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.305
but because you ate less food.

00:36:43.305 --> 00:36:44.680
If I told you that
you had to put

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.305
all those calories
in that same window,

00:36:46.305 --> 00:36:47.920
nothing's going to be different.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:52.320
So if it's more convenient for
you to eat five to six hours,

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.450
if it's mentally more
controllable to keep

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:57.060
your calories under
control by limiting them

00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:01.440
to a five-to-six-hour window,
there's no risk for any issues,

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.000
assuming you're not
starving yourself.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.210
And if that's what's going
to lead you to compliance,

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:08.160
then I would encourage
you to do it.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.020
At the end of the
day, it's whatever

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.410
is going to yield
compliance, whatever

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:15.420
is going to allow you to
comply to a successful setup

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.860
for yourself, long term.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.290
That's what's going to matter.

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:20.040
But I think that
everybody looks at, well,

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.180
should I do
intermittent fasting?

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.221
Should I do carb cycling?

00:37:22.221 --> 00:37:23.520
Should I do carb back loading?

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.810
Should I do paleo?

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:26.370
Should I do Whole30?

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.380
None of them matter
unless it's something

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.930
that you can stick to long term
and unless the application is

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.110
to you, specifically.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.140
Does that answer the
interment fasting question?

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:35.640
Yeah?

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:40.940
Meal frequency--
who had that one?

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.690
I feel like it was a
little more in-depth.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.115
Does that answer the question?

00:37:44.115 --> 00:37:44.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.750
JASON PHILLIPS: So
there's definitely

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:48.460
no research-- the whole reason
on meal frequency, that you say

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:50.876
you've got to eat every three
hours to keep the metabolism

00:37:50.876 --> 00:37:53.004
elevated-- that was the
whole crux behind it.

00:37:53.004 --> 00:37:55.170
They've actually found that
that's completely false.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:59.880
And there's so much science
coming out now to back that up.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.530
Along those same
lines would be, well,

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.134
don't eat carbs after 6 o'clock.

00:38:04.134 --> 00:38:05.800
I would actually
argue, flip the script.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.460
Eat all your carbs
after 6 o'clock.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.019
If I had to give
you one option--

00:38:10.019 --> 00:38:12.060
all your carbs before 6,
all your carbs after 6--

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.670
I would take after 6.

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:14.550
AUDIENCE: Why?

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.620
JASON PHILLIPS: There's
significant evidence

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.280
on, basically, the
stimulation of the metabolism,

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.020
the thermic effect of
having that feeding

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.750
at night on actually having
the metabolism elevated later

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.510
in the day through the evening.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:29.790
Also, getting an insulin
response at night,

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:32.580
getting a big insulin response
from the carbohydrate feeding--

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.621
think about what happens.

00:38:33.621 --> 00:38:36.240
Insulin's here-- after that,
it comes back down, right?

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:36.810
It falls.

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:39.750
When insulin levels are low,
cortisol levels increase.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.311
HGH levels increase.

00:38:41.311 --> 00:38:42.810
With high cortisol,
with our ability

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:44.720
to wake up with a
normalized cortisol curve,

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.040
with our ability to wake up
with elevated HGH levels,

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.960
guess what we're
using at that time?

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.940
Elevated cortisol equals
mobilization of fat.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:53.712
Make sense?

00:38:53.712 --> 00:38:55.170
AUDIENCE: In general,
would you say

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.152
there's a certain
period [INAUDIBLE] you

00:38:57.152 --> 00:38:58.360
should eat after [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.820
JASON PHILLIPS: No, no--

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.320
I think last time
I was here, I said

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.275
I get into bed with a Skinny
Cow ice cream sandwich.

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:05.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:09.870
And I lost my man card,
so I never said it again.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.204
AUDIENCE: Just make sure that
you're repeating questions

00:39:12.204 --> 00:39:13.328
if they don't have the mic.

00:39:13.328 --> 00:39:15.134
JASON PHILLIPS: Oh
yeah, sorry about that.

00:39:15.134 --> 00:39:17.016
AUDIENCE: For meal
frequency, I hear less

00:39:17.016 --> 00:39:18.618
about keeping
metabolism high and more

00:39:18.618 --> 00:39:21.006
about keeping your blood
sugar levels [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:21.006 --> 00:39:22.922
You're less likely to
snack and graze and pass

00:39:22.922 --> 00:39:24.900
the [? day target. ?] Is
there a truth to that?

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.080
JASON PHILLIPS: The question is,
in reference to meal frequency,

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.510
it's not so much about
metabolic rate being elevated,

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.210
but in terms of blood
sugar being stabilized.

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:36.720
I would actually say there
is some truth to that.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.990
But again, that's
going to come down

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:41.610
to eating the right
amount of food

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:42.720
throughout the course
of the day, right?

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.790
If you wake up and
you're like, all my carbs

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:45.900
are going to be at
breakfast, that's

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.024
probably going to necessitate
another meal in three

00:39:48.024 --> 00:39:48.660
to four hours.

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:50.490
Because obviously,
your blood sugar levels

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:51.750
are going to be all
over the place, right?

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:53.190
You're going to get a
really high insulin spike.

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.930
It's going to come back down.

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:55.221
You're going to feel like crap.

00:39:55.221 --> 00:39:57.120
You wake up-- you
have a balanced meal.

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.590
There's no set
intervals that are

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:00.090
going to keep that blood
sugar more stabilized.

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.131
It's really going to come
down to metabolic rate,

00:40:02.131 --> 00:40:04.410
overall calories being taken in.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:05.490
Does that make sense?

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.680
Because if you only had
500 calories for breakfast,

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.110
and you're consuming 5,000
calories in a day, absolutely.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:12.526
Your blood sugar's going to
start to drop in an hour, hour

00:40:12.526 --> 00:40:13.080
and a half.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.360
And yes, that would be an
appropriate time to eat.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.940
But relative to
fat burning, it's

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.750
not going to do anything more
beneficial or less beneficial.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:24.790
That comes down to energy and,
like you said, mental clarity,

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:25.950
focus, things like that.

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:29.130
And absolutely, keeping blood
sugar levels stable all day--

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:32.900
100%, and that's where I would
look into meal frequency.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:33.880
Make sense?

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.960
Does that answer your
question on meal frequency?

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.596
The best tool I
can give anybody,

00:40:38.596 --> 00:40:40.470
in terms of meal
frequency-- eat at the times

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:42.522
it's going to be most
consistent, day to day.

00:40:42.522 --> 00:40:44.730
So one of the questions I
ask a client right away is,

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:47.230
how many times can you routinely
commit to eating every day?

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.780
Is it 3, is it 2, is it 5?

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.010
Is it 10?

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:52.290
If you want to eat five
times every single day,

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:53.771
great-- commit to
those five times.

00:40:53.771 --> 00:40:54.270
Why?

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:56.644
Because when you travel, you're
going to say to me, well,

00:40:56.644 --> 00:40:58.140
how do I count when I travel?

00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.670
Well, I really don't want
you to count when you travel.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:01.410
But can you eat at
those same five times

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:02.700
the approximate things
that you'd be eating

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.840
when you're at home, right?

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.970
If you're waking up and you're
having eggs and oatmeal, great.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:07.470
When you're out at
a hotel, when I'm

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:09.450
on the road 200-plus
days a year,

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.542
I can find eggs and
oatmeal in a hotel

00:41:11.542 --> 00:41:13.500
because that's what I'm
used to eating at home.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.290
At lunch I can find some sort
of protein-carbohydrate combo.

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:18.104
I eat four times
every single day.

00:41:18.104 --> 00:41:19.770
I know how to find
that everywhere I go.

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:22.144
That's how I'm able to maintain
my shape everywhere I go.

00:41:22.144 --> 00:41:23.200
Does that make sense?

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.630
So there's a lot
of deeper things

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.840
that you have to go into and to
individual application there.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.702
But the science, the
evidence, supports

00:41:30.702 --> 00:41:32.160
that there's no
increased fat loss,

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.984
in terms of meal frequency.

00:41:33.984 --> 00:41:36.450
AUDIENCE: Are you supposed
to be hungry in the morning?

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:37.170
JASON PHILLIPS: The question
is, are you supposed

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:38.336
to be hungry in the morning?

00:41:38.336 --> 00:41:39.540
The answer is yes.

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.690
Hunger is a very good
sign of metabolism,

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:44.410
of metabolic activity.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:46.920
So people that are like, oh,
I'm hungry-- good, right?

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.253
If you actually came to me
and you said, I'm not hungry,

00:41:49.253 --> 00:41:50.040
I'd be scared.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.859
It's usually indicative that
you're not eating enough.

00:41:52.859 --> 00:41:54.900
Mind you, if you're eating
10,000 calories a day,

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:55.733
that's not the case.

00:41:55.733 --> 00:41:58.260
But most people
that come to me that

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.810
complain of lack of results,
and they're not hungry,

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.540
it's very indicative
that they're overstressed

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.830
and not eating enough.

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:06.950
So hunger is a very good
physiological response.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.700
AUDIENCE: You said you mentioned
eating carbs late at night,

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:15.380
after 6.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.448
JASON PHILLIPS: Yes, yes.

00:42:16.448 --> 00:42:18.573
AUDIENCE: If I work out
first think in the morning,

00:42:18.573 --> 00:42:21.320
I usually try to have most
of my carbs in the morning

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:26.150
and then taper it
off over the day.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.834
JASON PHILLIPS: So what time
do you work out in the morning?

00:42:28.834 --> 00:42:29.780
AUDIENCE: 7:30.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:30.680
JASON PHILLIPS: Do you eat
before you go to the gym?

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:34.004
JASON PHILLIPS: OK, what do you
think your pre-workout meal is?

00:42:34.004 --> 00:42:35.296
AUDIENCE: It's a cup of coffee.

00:42:35.296 --> 00:42:37.754
JASON PHILLIPS: What do you
think your pre-workout meal is?

00:42:37.754 --> 00:42:39.710
Where do you think your
body's getting fuel?

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.220
AUDIENCE: Oh, from the
dinner the night before.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.594
JASON PHILLIPS:
OK, so that would

00:42:42.594 --> 00:42:45.170
be another really good reason
to have carbohydrates at night.

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:46.010
AUDIENCE: That makes sense.

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.550
JASON PHILLIPS: Make sense?

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:47.360
JASON PHILLIPS:
Your body's always

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.109
going to go back to
the last thing it had.

00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:51.495
In fact, a lot of people
in here, or in general,

00:42:51.495 --> 00:42:53.870
are like, oh, I'm going to
the gym and have a protein bar

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:56.161
or I'm going to have a banana
or I'm going to have this

00:42:56.161 --> 00:42:57.686
or that to get me fueled, right?

00:42:57.686 --> 00:42:59.060
Unless you're
using a super carb,

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.560
a high molecular-weight
carb, you're

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.768
really not getting usable
fuel for four to five hours

00:43:02.768 --> 00:43:05.450
out of your food.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:07.310
So it's one of those
types of situations

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:09.601
where your body is--
you definitely should

00:43:09.601 --> 00:43:10.850
be having more carbs at night.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.516
However what you're
doing in the morning

00:43:12.516 --> 00:43:14.960
and having carbs post-workout,
fantastic, right?

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.660
So for you to maximize your
day, to maximize blood sugar

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.910
regulation, I'd be stacking
your carbs in the morning,

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:21.740
stacking them at night, more
of your proteins, and fats,

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.156
and vegetables
throughout the day.

00:43:23.156 --> 00:43:24.810
It would make a lot of sense.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:25.310
Make sense?

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:26.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:27.950
JASON PHILLIPS: Cool--
any other questions

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:30.350
on meal frequency
or meal timing,

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:33.038
relative to different
times of day?

00:43:33.038 --> 00:43:33.538
Cool.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.370
What is a macro?

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:43.770
We did that one.

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.230
Healthy fats-- who
asked that one?

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:47.920
What was the question, again?

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.060
AUDIENCE: So much of what
I hear is the 180 of fat

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.642
is evil to fat's good now.

00:43:51.642 --> 00:43:54.100
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah, fats are
the best thing in the world,

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.860
if you look at the media.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.235
AUDIENCE: But a
lot of that comes

00:43:57.235 --> 00:44:01.878
down to healthy fats, like whole
fat, dairy, avocado, olive oil,

00:44:01.878 --> 00:44:03.480
[INAUDIBLE] animal protein.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.830
I'm not really clear
what the bad fats are.

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:08.710
If I'm cooking at home, as long
as I'm not getting fried crap.

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:09.790
JASON PHILLIPS: Correct.

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:10.290
Yeah.

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:12.462
And that's, honestly--
the oversimplification

00:44:12.462 --> 00:44:14.670
of what you just said-- and
I know that wasn't heard,

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:16.711
but I don't know how to
restate that whole thing.

00:44:16.711 --> 00:44:20.319
Basically, he said
animal fats, oils, nuts--

00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:22.360
how do we draw the line
between good and bad fat?

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.568
And he said, as long as
you're not eating fried crap,

00:44:24.568 --> 00:44:25.660
is he not eating bad fat?

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:28.022
And that's very oversimplified,
but the answer is yes.

00:44:28.022 --> 00:44:29.480
If we were to go
even deeper and we

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.063
were to look at
inflammatory response,

00:44:31.063 --> 00:44:33.840
anti-inflammatory response,
you've got omega-3, 6, 9.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.000
Those are the three
that we really look at.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.290
The problem is that the Western
diet is very high in omega-6

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:41.040
and it's lower in omega-3.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.720
Omega-6 is pro-inflammatory.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.400
Omega-3 is anti-inflammatory.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.880
So we deal with a
population that's

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.380
very inflamed because our
diets are rich in omega-6.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.050
So the reason everyone's big on
this whole take in healthy fat

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:54.690
thing-- what they're really
saying is, get more omega-3's.

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:57.242
Increase your ratio
of omega-3 to omega-6.

00:44:57.242 --> 00:44:58.950
That can be done
through supplementation.

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.630
That can be done through
things like coconut oil

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:02.796
that are a medium-chain
triglyceride that supposedly

00:45:02.796 --> 00:45:05.010
provide energy for fat burning.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:08.760
That's really skewed science,
but the better statement

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.490
would be, get more
omega-3's in your diet.

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:12.480
Does that make sense?

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.000
That's really what people
are pushing you towards.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.437
But again, that explanation,
that's not super sexy, right?

00:45:17.437 --> 00:45:19.770
So people are going to be
like, well, just eat your fats

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:21.240
because everyone loves bacon.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.060
AUDIENCE: What are examples
of omega-3's and omega-6's?

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.520
JASON PHILLIPS: Omega-6 is
primarily found in chicken.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.130
That's the one big mistake
that everyone's making.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:31.230
Salmon's really good
in omega-3, omega-9.

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:34.469
Omega-3-- eggs are a
really good source.

00:45:34.469 --> 00:45:36.510
It's not so much that we
have a hard time finding

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:39.010
omega-3's because usually when
you're getting omega-6's, you

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:40.710
are getting some omega-3's.

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:43.440
It's that we're over-consuming
things like chicken

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.749
that are super high in
omega-6, void of omega-3.

00:45:46.749 --> 00:45:48.540
But supplementing with
things like fish oil

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.860
is obviously very
beneficial, because you're

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.720
going to get a high ratio
of omega-3 to omega-6.

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.230
Go ahead.

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:55.280
She's got the mic so
that they can hear you.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:46:00.100
AUDIENCE: Is chicken high in
omega-6 because of the farming

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:00.600
quality--

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:00.760
JASON PHILLIPS: No, no.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.220
AUDIENCE: --or just because
that's naturally how it is?

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.865
JASON PHILLIPS: In general, just
the naturally occurring fats.

00:46:04.865 --> 00:46:06.990
The farming quality has
nothing to do with the fact

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:08.710
that it's primarily omega-6.

00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:09.210
Yeah.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:13.870
Does that make sense?

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:17.620
Does that make
sense on the fats?

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:19.927
We've got, by time
standards, seven minutes.

00:46:19.927 --> 00:46:21.760
I think a lot of people
are prepared to stay

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.429
30 minutes after, so I
just want to make sure

00:46:24.429 --> 00:46:25.720
that I try to cover everything.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:28.095
Is there anyone that has to
leave, that's time sensitive,

00:46:28.095 --> 00:46:29.690
with their question
on the board?

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:30.405
OK, cool.

00:46:33.741 --> 00:46:34.240
Cleanses.

00:46:36.855 --> 00:46:37.446
Yeah.

00:46:37.446 --> 00:46:38.695
I could go on for days, right?

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:40.720
Cleanses are an absolute way
to go about things, right?

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.940
It's basically, you're not
going to stay on a cleanse.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.950
One statement I made earlier is
something you should be doing

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:47.033
should be something you're
prepared to do forever.

00:46:47.033 --> 00:46:49.010
Cleanses are never a
way to achieve anything.

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:52.270
They're super low
calorie by nature.

00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:54.550
Recently, I think that
they're done with green shakes

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:57.670
and they're very micronutrient
rich, which I think is great.

00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:00.310
But it implies an
extreme calorie deficit,

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:02.590
which is usually going to
yield rapid weight loss.

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:03.887
But that's never sustainable.

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:05.470
So you get people
that go on cleanses.

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:07.120
They lose 10, 18 pounds.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.690
They're like, oh, this is
the best thing in the world.

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:10.439
Then the weight comes
back on, inevitably.

00:47:10.439 --> 00:47:13.870
You cannot sustain
500 to 800 calories,

00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:16.570
reintroduce those calories,
and expect yourself to not gain

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:18.110
weight.

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:19.360
I don't care what you've done.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.910
I don't care if you've gone
on a three-week bender.

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:23.840
You should not come back
and go on a cleanse.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.140
A, from a psychological
perspective--

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.074
and 90% of dietary
compliance is psychological--

00:47:29.074 --> 00:47:30.490
you're teaching
yourself that it's

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:32.680
OK to drastically mess
up because, hey, there's

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.920
this fix right afterwards.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.520
That's a really
bad feedback loop

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.880
to get into, long term, right?

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.200
So if you do go on
a three-week bender,

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.690
come home and get back on track.

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:44.380
It's the best thing you can do.

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:47.470
But to use a cleanse
is the worst thing

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:48.320
you can possibly do.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:52.150
Now, people are like, what about
a liver cleanse or something

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:53.920
to help your gallbladder?

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:57.010
If you have borderline
diseased liver,

00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:00.280
if you've got kidney stones,
or you've got problems

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.190
somewhere
physiologically, perhaps

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:05.587
look into a cleansing
protocol to help with that.

00:48:05.587 --> 00:48:07.420
But that's completely
different than saying,

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:09.211
I'm going to go on the
latest juice cleanse

00:48:09.211 --> 00:48:10.552
to lose 20 pounds.

00:48:10.552 --> 00:48:12.300
Does that answer that question?

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:16.530
Is anyone not going to
do a cleanse, please?

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:18.095
Sorry if anybody does Isagenix.

00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:20.178
AUDIENCE: What if the
cleanse isn't about fat loss

00:48:20.178 --> 00:48:24.092
and it's about
digestive function?

00:48:24.092 --> 00:48:25.550
JASON PHILLIPS:
Give me an example.

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:28.008
The question is, what if it's
about digestive function, not

00:48:28.008 --> 00:48:29.024
fat loss?

00:48:29.024 --> 00:48:31.394
AUDIENCE: My girlfriend went
through a Candida cleanse

00:48:31.394 --> 00:48:32.857
and she's not fat.

00:48:32.857 --> 00:48:34.110
But she did it solely--

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:36.430
JASON PHILLIPS: But she
potentially had Candida?

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:39.530
AUDIENCE: I think she read
a few too many things.

00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:44.660
But she just put herself through
a prolonged cleanse period

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.420
and it was solely for
digestive purposes.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.390
JASON PHILLIPS: Sure.

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:49.790
If you potentially
have Candida and you

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:52.820
think that you're borderline,
that your GI is messed up

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:55.820
because of it, that would
be one of the physiological

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:58.280
applications that I
think would apply.

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.740
Because you're trying to
fix something internally

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.685
that's physiologically
messed up.

00:49:02.685 --> 00:49:04.350
Does that make sense?

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:05.750
It's not about weight loss.

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:08.390
And largely, those
cleanses, right--

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:11.390
largely, they're taking out
lots of different food groups

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:14.330
that potentially can create
an environment for Candida

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:15.440
to feast off of.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:19.200
But they're also not
super low calorie, right?

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.000
A lot of those are
still involving

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.177
what you would need to survive.

00:49:23.177 --> 00:49:25.260
And you're also not coming
out of that being like,

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:26.460
I'm down 15 pounds.

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:28.320
Oh, crap, I gained five
pounds the next week

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.340
and you freak out.

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.620
Because that was never the
mentality going into it.

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:34.230
So yeah, I would say
that's super appropriate.

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:37.071
I would have absolutely
zero issues with it.

00:49:37.071 --> 00:49:37.570
Make sense?

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:40.400
AUDIENCE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.820
JASON PHILLIPS: OK,
so moving with that,

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.430
going into supplements.

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:47.816
Supplements are exactly
what they say they are.

00:49:47.816 --> 00:49:49.690
They're a supplement to
an already good diet.

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:52.691
Anybody that comes to me
that says, OK, awesome,

00:49:52.691 --> 00:49:54.190
all that macro stuff
is really good.

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:56.620
All that timing
stuff is really good,

00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:58.260
but what about this fat burner?

00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:59.843
Is that going to
help expedite things?

00:49:59.843 --> 00:50:01.840
I get really, really worried.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.090
The chances are, they're not
going to follow the diet.

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:06.040
They think that by taking
that fat burner in the morning

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.706
that it's going to
expedite the results.

00:50:07.706 --> 00:50:09.187
It never is.

00:50:09.187 --> 00:50:11.020
Are there some supplements
that can actually

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:12.110
help with quality of life?

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:13.520
Absolutely.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.455
As somebody that
owns a company that

00:50:15.455 --> 00:50:17.470
works with thousands of
people at this point,

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:20.980
I think things like taking
vitamin D are very essential.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.190
If everybody in here,
especially being in Chicago,

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:26.900
were to go and get a 25OHD,
which is a blood test

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.250
to measure vitamin D levels,
I'd bet you 95% of us

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:33.046
would come back low
or sub-clinical.

00:50:33.046 --> 00:50:34.420
Now, vitamin D is
so powerful, it

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:36.160
could be classified
as a steroid.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.840
It's a precursor to
hormone function.

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.030
Obviously, it's going
to help regulate mood.

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:42.550
There's a host of benefits
of having adequate vitamin D

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:43.841
levels in your life.

00:50:43.841 --> 00:50:46.090
So I absolutely recommend
with supplementing something

00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:49.240
like vitamin D. A lot of
us are low in magnesium.

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.180
Magnesium helps us recover
from day-to-day work,

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.320
day-to-day stress.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.970
It's a precursor to
neurotransmitters.

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:57.190
It's going to help us
sleep, so I'd recommend

00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:58.780
supplementing with magnesium.

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:00.738
Those of you guys that
are resistance training,

00:51:00.738 --> 00:51:03.280
I think branch-chain amino acids
are a fantastic supplement.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:06.070
But the reality is,
supplements are not needed.

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:08.590
For us to survive,
for us to thrive,

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:10.330
we absolutely can
get away by eating

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:12.910
the right types of foods,
the right quantity of foods,

00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:14.770
the right quality
within that quantity,

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:17.290
and never need a supplement.

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:19.104
You asked the question
about spirulina.

00:51:19.104 --> 00:51:20.020
Is that going to help?

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:21.728
It's going to get you
more anti-oxidants.

00:51:21.728 --> 00:51:23.500
It's going to get you
more micronutrients.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:27.130
Do I think that creating a
more neutral, less acidic

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:29.410
environment in your
body is a good thing?

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:31.000
100%.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.560
We know that cancers,
diseases, they

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.991
thrive in an acidic environment.

00:51:33.991 --> 00:51:35.740
So if we can keep you
more neutral or more

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:37.750
on the base side, great, right?

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:40.015
The water I walked in
with today-- it's 9.5 pH.

00:51:40.015 --> 00:51:43.120
I think that's a fantastic
way of going about it.

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.640
Is it essential to survival?

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:45.640
No.

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.010
Does it help if you have some
extra money to invest in?

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:48.784
Sure.

00:51:48.784 --> 00:51:50.950
But remember, supplements
cost money above the food.

00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:52.330
And if you're going to
spend money on either side,

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:53.530
spend it on the food.

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:55.000
Get really high-quality food.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.280
Eat the right
amounts of your food.

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.250
I see 95% of problems
resolved in and of that.

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:02.150
So then the question
is THROWDOWN.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:05.050
And of course,
I'll talk about it.

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:06.550
The reality is that
nobody in here's

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:07.966
probably going to
benefit from it.

00:52:07.966 --> 00:52:10.460
How many people in
here do CrossFit?

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.200
One, two.

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.710
How many people in here
do aerobic activity?

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:16.180
OK, a decent amount.

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:17.620
So what's in THROWDOWN?

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:20.000
The typical
pre-workout product--

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.004
and this is for
everyone that trains.

00:52:22.004 --> 00:52:23.920
If you're going to take
a typical pre-workout,

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.995
it was designed
to enhance energy.

00:52:25.995 --> 00:52:28.120
So they put a stimulant in
there, lots of caffeine.

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.520
Back in the day, ephedra
was borderline legal.

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.250
But there was things like
synephrine or citrus aurantiaum

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:35.575
that were really popular,
that would mimic ephedra.

00:52:35.575 --> 00:52:37.312
So they put high doses of that.

00:52:37.312 --> 00:52:39.270
And then they would put
a vasodilator in there.

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:41.500
And what a vasodilator is,
is it increases blood flow

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.260
to the working muscle,
enhances that pump, enhances

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:47.740
that vascularity, makes you
look bigger at the moment

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.780
that you're training
that muscle group.

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.730
It feels really good, right?

00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:54.200
As that progressed, they started
putting mental components

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:54.700
in it.

00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:55.690
DMAE.

00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:57.245
It was a European party drug.

00:52:57.245 --> 00:52:59.620
They figured out that it made
you have that euphoric feel

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:02.680
and they actually put that
into American supplements.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.370
Shocker, people started
dying and it's now illegal.

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:09.820
So then you go over, and we
created our product to be,

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:11.260
basically, the opposite of that.

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:13.169
We deal with a
population that does not

00:53:13.169 --> 00:53:14.710
want blood flow to
the working muscle

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:17.140
because it's going to help
you fatigue faster, right?

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:19.100
Remember, in the gym, if you're
doing bicep curls, who cares

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:20.184
if you fatigue at 8 or 12?

00:53:20.184 --> 00:53:21.141
Your biceps are bigger.

00:53:21.141 --> 00:53:22.000
That's what matters.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.490
In a performance setting,
if you're fatiguing earlier

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:26.290
and you can't go
later in the rounds,

00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:29.230
or later in your endurance
ride, or whatever it may be,

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:30.310
your performance sucks.

00:53:30.310 --> 00:53:31.600
You lose.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.210
We've created a product that
delays the onset of fatigue

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:36.280
and delays--

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.070
it helps enhance that
muscular endurance.

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:41.590
Also, it gives you the ability
to breathe at higher heart

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:42.100
rates.

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:45.910
So as you go closer to red line,
you can breathe later in that,

00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:47.740
giving you that
extra potential five

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:49.530
reps before you
put the bar down,

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:52.330
and someone else puts
the bar down first.

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:55.000
Obviously, other ingredients--
cordyceps, citrulline, there's

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.551
really good studies on both.

00:53:57.551 --> 00:53:59.050
That's really what
it comes down to.

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:00.675
That's the difference
between THROWDOWN

00:54:00.675 --> 00:54:02.830
and other pre-workouts
out there.

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:05.792
He asked that, so I could
plug my company for free,

00:54:05.792 --> 00:54:07.000
which I'll do really cheaply.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.210
I own Mission 6 Nutrition
and Mission6Nutrition.com.

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:10.840
There you go.

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:11.860
Thank you for that plug.

00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:12.650
Go ahead.

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:16.480
AUDIENCE: You said your product
THROWDOWN delays fatigue.

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.410
JASON PHILLIPS: Yes.

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:18.199
AUDIENCE: How?

00:54:18.199 --> 00:54:20.740
JASON PHILLIPS: So when you look
at the studies on citrulline

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:23.810
and you look at the
studies on cordyceps,

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:26.980
we sourced an ingredient
called Peak 02.

00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:28.714
It's a unique blend
of cordyceps extract.

00:54:28.714 --> 00:54:30.380
There's really good
studies on cordyceps

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:31.963
that it actually
gives you the ability

00:54:31.963 --> 00:54:34.090
to breathe at
higher heart rates.

00:54:34.090 --> 00:54:36.360
As you go deeper,
closer to red line,

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.220
as your body inherently
gets to its red-line level,

00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:41.074
it will naturally
shut down output.

00:54:41.074 --> 00:54:43.240
However, if you're able to
keep your heart rate down

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.300
as you're getting closer to red
line, near maximal capacity,

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.800
you're going to
continue to work.

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:48.966
That's the delay of fatigue.

00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:55.110
You can do more work
closer to red line.

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:56.037
Make sense?

00:54:56.037 --> 00:54:57.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
have more questions.

00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:58.950
JASON PHILLIPS: There's
two specific ingredients.

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:00.619
And there's really--
no, keep going.

00:55:00.619 --> 00:55:02.160
But there's two
specific ingredients.

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.934
It's the citrulline
and cordyceps.

00:55:03.934 --> 00:55:06.350
The studies on citrulline are
more about aerobic capacity,

00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:08.180
but that wouldn't
enhance ability

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.286
to work at higher thresholds.

00:55:10.286 --> 00:55:11.278
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:11.278 --> 00:55:12.402
JASON PHILLIPS: Make sense?

00:55:12.402 --> 00:55:13.295
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:13.295 --> 00:55:14.420
JASON PHILLIPS: Keep going.

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:15.020
I see it.

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:15.770
You got questions.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:16.480
Keep going.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.771
AUDIENCE: Yeah, well, I'm
doing a few studies in school

00:55:18.771 --> 00:55:20.540
right now and they're
trying to figure out

00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:21.925
what really causes fatigue.

00:55:21.925 --> 00:55:25.220
So if you've got a product
that delays fatigue--

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:26.270
JASON PHILLIPS: OK.

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:29.720
I would love to know
what's causing it, as well.

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:32.000
But what we-- the
ingredient profile

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.980
was based on studies
showing these two products

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:37.220
delay fatigue, based
on statistical data.

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:39.350
We didn't necessarily
research why.

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:40.790
We just know they work.

00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:43.374
And then you're putting blends
of products that work together,

00:55:43.374 --> 00:55:44.456
creating that environment.

00:55:44.456 --> 00:55:46.347
AUDIENCE: And this was
in an aerobic setting

00:55:46.347 --> 00:55:47.180
more than anaerobic?

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:50.782
JASON PHILLIPS: Correct, yeah.

00:55:50.782 --> 00:55:51.680
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:52.640
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:53.155
Make sense?

00:55:53.155 --> 00:55:53.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:54.080
I got it.

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.220
JASON PHILLIPS: I
would love to know why,

00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:56.840
but obviously it's
still-- it's going

00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:02.360
to be, to some degree, build-up
of byproducts like ammonia,

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.530
lactate.

00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:05.732
There's going to be
something in there.

00:56:05.732 --> 00:56:07.940
But it's not something like
a carnosine, beta-alanine

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:08.820
response.

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:10.470
We don't even have
beta alanine, so--

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:11.263
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:56:11.263 --> 00:56:12.096
JASON PHILLIPS: Yep.

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.165
AUDIENCE: Given you said you're
on the road 200 days a year,

00:56:17.165 --> 00:56:19.200
and obviously everyone's
body is different,

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.406
what does your workout
schedule, roughly, look like?

00:56:21.406 --> 00:56:23.140
How do you maintain, obviously,
the fitness that you do?

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:25.056
JASON PHILLIPS: That's
a really good question.

00:56:25.056 --> 00:56:27.840
The question is, being that
I'm on the road 200-plus

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.180
days per year, how do
I maintain my physique?

00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:32.497
What is my workout
schedule like?

00:56:32.497 --> 00:56:34.080
That's actually a
really good question

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.720
and I'm going to lump it in--

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.970
someone asked about stress.

00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:41.670
I, for a long time, did
CrossFit at a very high level.

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:43.272
Three and a half
years ago, I was

00:56:43.272 --> 00:56:45.480
training to compete at the
highest level of CrossFit,

00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:48.840
doing two workouts a
day, seven days a week.

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.280
As I've gotten
busier and busier,

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.490
I now own three companies, all
of which, I'm proud to say,

00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:55.620
are very successful.

00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:57.150
My demands are huge.

00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:59.040
Not only am I on
the road, but I'm

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.550
on the phone from, usually,
5:00 AM till 8:00 PM, right?

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:04.050
I'm constantly
working with clients.

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:04.560
I'm talking.

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.130
It's very central
nervous system intensive.

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:11.590
I tried to sustain my CrossFit
volume for a very long time.

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:14.280
What I found out was
I was very tired.

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:15.840
My quality of work sucked.

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.520
My quality of sleep sucked.

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:20.760
I lost my sex drive and
my personal life sucked.

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:21.744
That's just the truth.

00:57:21.744 --> 00:57:23.910
So then you get in this
entrepreneurial environment,

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:24.750
and everyone's like, oh.

00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:26.360
Well, that's just what happens
when you're an entrepreneur.

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:28.020
You got to make
those sacrifices.

00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:30.060
The reality is I
was over-training.

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:32.970
So now my routine is
that I do power-lifting

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:34.110
three days a week, right?

00:57:34.110 --> 00:57:35.672
I still do the
movements that are

00:57:35.672 --> 00:57:36.880
the biggest bang for my buck.

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:38.720
I squat, I bench, I dead a lot.

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.650
I don't do a lot
of technical work

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:42.404
like power cleans
or power snatches

00:57:42.404 --> 00:57:44.320
because they're very
nervous-system intensive.

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:45.850
I don't want to do
the technical work.

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:47.266
And then I try to
get in some sort

00:57:47.266 --> 00:57:50.094
of anaerobic or aerobic piece
one to two times per week.

00:57:50.094 --> 00:57:51.510
That's what my
routine looks like.

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:54.120
So a lot of what I'm looking
at now is maintenance.

00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:57.630
I'm a competitive
dude, so I like

00:57:57.630 --> 00:58:00.420
to see if I can push the
limits on my lifting.

00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:02.880
So within the context
of squatting, benching,

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:06.330
and dead-lifting, I am always
trying to lift heavier.

00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:07.830
And so currently,
I would categorize

00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:10.200
what I'm doing as daily
undulating periodization,

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.070
but that's neither
here nor there.

00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:14.310
But the crux of it
is power-lifting.

00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:14.810
Good?

00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:20.450
In terms of stress, a lot of the
reasons that most people here

00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:22.580
don't see results--
they're overstressed.

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:24.330
If you think of
stress like a glass,

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:26.060
we've got a 14-ounce glass.

00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.490
Everybody wakes up
with that glass full,

00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:29.570
to a certain degree.

00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:33.260
For me, I'm probably filling 13
to 14 with my day-to-day life.

00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:35.750
I have very little
that I can add on top

00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:37.670
before I stop seeing results.

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:40.130
But as soon as that stress
glass starts to overfill,

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:42.920
your body will shut down
and go into survival mode.

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.630
What is survival
mode to your body?

00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:47.315
Hold onto body fat,
stop metabolic function,

00:58:47.315 --> 00:58:49.042
stop performance.

00:58:49.042 --> 00:58:50.750
Stop all of the things
that we're looking

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:52.640
at by going into the gym.

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.350
Decrease favorable
body composition.

00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:58.970
So if we're over-stressing
the body, over-training,

00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:03.080
not eating enough, not
sleeping enough, trying to take

00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:05.240
on too much work,
we're also setting back

00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:07.400
our physical goals.

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.620
So some people are like,
oh, you're doing too much.

00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:11.087
Well, sometimes
that's appropriate.

00:59:11.087 --> 00:59:13.670
You have to really look at what
your output versus your intake

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:14.170
is.

00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:15.740
How can we offset stress?

00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.270
Sometimes that's caloric intake.

00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:19.070
Sometimes we simply
need to eat more.

00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:21.270
Sometimes eating more
is not going to fix it.

00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:23.170
Sometimes we have to
stop doing so much.

00:59:23.170 --> 00:59:25.320
Sometimes we have to start
prioritizing our sleep.

00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:28.040
Sometimes we have to start
prioritizing our workouts

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.050
like I had to do.

00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:31.799
Pull back on the
intensity and the volume.

00:59:31.799 --> 00:59:33.090
Does that make sense on stress?

00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:34.881
It's really oversimplified,
but I recognize

00:59:34.881 --> 00:59:37.050
we're running tight on time.

00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:39.240
Does that make sense on
stress, whoever asked that?

00:59:43.002 --> 00:59:44.710
Metabolic adaptation--
that's the biggest

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:46.390
one that I want to touch
on, and I see somebody

00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:47.515
asked about sugar alcohols.

00:59:49.512 --> 00:59:51.220
Metabolic adaptation
is the biggest thing

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:52.600
I see wrong in
our society today.

00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:59.320
In most media, we're told,
eat less, eat less, eat less.

00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.150
That has resulted
in what we've all

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:03.790
read about in articles
where it says, well,

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:06.425
you're going to have
metabolic damage.

01:00:06.425 --> 01:00:08.050
And so we've all
heard, you're supposed

01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:09.335
to eat more to lose weight.

01:00:09.335 --> 01:00:11.710
The problem becomes, if we
live in this low-calorie state

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:15.050
for a super long time, our body
adapts to living like that.

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:17.920
So if we're eating 800,
1,000 calories per day,

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.510
your body learns
to function there.

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:21.259
Well, how does it learn
to function there?

01:00:21.259 --> 01:00:22.780
It learns to stop
burning fat, it

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.970
learns to stop burning
anything, and it learns

01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:27.010
to hoard everything, right?

01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:29.060
Think about it like
a bum on the street.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.310
How does a bum learn to adapt?

01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:31.894
It learns how to
survive on the street

01:00:31.894 --> 01:00:33.976
and it learns how to hoard
every single thing that

01:00:33.976 --> 01:00:35.470
comes to it because
it knows it has

01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:38.290
a finite source of resources.

01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:40.860
Well, your body looks
at it that way as well.

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:43.472
So your body-- in 800
to 1,000 calories,

01:00:43.472 --> 01:00:45.180
theoretically, it's
in a calorie deficit.

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.305
It should be losing weight.

01:00:46.305 --> 01:00:47.912
But instead, it's
adapted to living.

01:00:47.912 --> 01:00:49.620
Now we have to go
through a process known

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.151
as reverse dieting, and
that can really suck.

01:00:52.151 --> 01:00:53.400
I just wrote an article on it.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.470
There's three outcomes
of a reverse diet.

01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:57.750
One, you can gain weight.

01:00:57.750 --> 01:01:00.570
As you start adding calories
from a low-calorie state,

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:02.850
you absolutely can gain weight.

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:05.310
But I'm very blunt
with my clients that

01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:06.990
are in a reverse diet state.

01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:08.580
You did that.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.470
Nobody put a gun to
your head and said,

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:13.470
you have to eat 800 calories
a day for months and years

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:14.400
at a time.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:18.420
You decided to listen to the
media, albeit uninformed media.

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:20.550
And you made the
decision to only consume

01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:25.120
that amount of calories and
do X, Y, Z hours of cardio.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.010
Now we have to fix that.

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:30.010
You lost the right to lose fat.

01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:31.130
That's the truth.

01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:31.762
All right?

01:01:31.762 --> 01:01:33.220
Another option of
a reverse diet is

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:35.440
you really don't see
any weight fluctuation.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.050
And while that's great, I
know most people are like,

01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:38.675
oh, I wish I could
lose fat right away,

01:01:38.675 --> 01:01:41.039
At Least you're not gaining
weight in the process.

01:01:41.039 --> 01:01:43.330
The third option is we have
hyper-responders out there.

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:45.220
Those are those lucky
people that, you start

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.696
adding calories back in, boom--

01:01:46.696 --> 01:01:48.070
their weight
responds right away.

01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:49.900
The body's like, oh, I'm
finally getting what I need.

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:51.580
I can resume metabolic activity.

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.290
I'm going to start losing fat.

01:01:53.290 --> 01:01:56.200
The problem is, before we
get into that reverse diet

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.140
scenario, before we start
fixing metabolic adaptation,

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:01.980
we don't know which
one you're going to be.

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:04.530
But what we do know is you
have to get your calories back

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:05.850
to normal.

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:08.430
Until we get your calories
back to a maintenance level,

01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:10.680
until we restore
metabolic function,

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.600
you will never get
the results you want

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.150
from a dietary process, period.

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:17.262
Any questions on that?

01:02:20.384 --> 01:02:22.800
I don't know if that was one
on or if somebody asked that.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.350
But I hope that
answers that question.

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:26.000
[INAUDIBLE]

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:26.500
What's that?

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.919
AUDIENCE: If you're going to
be the type to gain weight,

01:02:27.919 --> 01:02:29.811
is that just a
period of time where

01:02:29.811 --> 01:02:32.685
you'll gain for a few
months and then probably--

01:02:32.685 --> 01:02:35.060
JASON PHILLIPS: I'll give you
the most-- the question is,

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:37.010
if you're the type that's
going to gain weight,

01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:38.218
is that just a couple months?

01:02:38.218 --> 01:02:38.780
Is it a year?

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.860
I'll give you the
most extreme case

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:40.580
that I've ever worked with.

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:41.600
I worked with a woman--

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.770
we had to reverse diet her.

01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:44.690
It took 20 months.

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:47.140
That's a year and 10 months,
or a year and 8 months

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:48.620
is what we went.

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:50.732
She gained weight
the whole time.

01:02:50.732 --> 01:02:52.190
Mind you, it was
very small, right?

01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:55.850
I think net gain in 20
months was 9 or 10 pounds.

01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:58.400
It wasn't a ton, but we
did it incrementally.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.950
We did it really, really small.

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:00.950
And my hat's off to her.

01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:03.710
She was super, super
patient with me.

01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:04.800
But we got to that point.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.680
We knew her metabolism
was fixed and we

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:08.307
started the downward process.

01:03:08.307 --> 01:03:10.640
As we started the downward
process, over the course of--

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.230
now we're 13 months--

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:14.870
we're a pound away
from her all-time goal

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:16.250
from when she started with me.

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:18.650
So I took her 10 pounds higher,
and now I've effectively

01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:21.530
taken her to a net loss, to
where she's almost where she

01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:23.147
wanted to be when she hired me.

01:03:23.147 --> 01:03:24.980
Now, had I never taken
her 10 pounds higher,

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:26.840
she never would be
where she is today.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.090
She could have tried
every fad under the sun,

01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:32.210
every cleanse under the sun,
every paleo, Whole30, carb

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:34.130
cycling, whatever, and
it would have actually

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:35.600
made her more broken.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.490
And it would have prolonged
that 20-month period.

01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:39.620
Does that make sense?

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:43.430
The problem is, it sucks to
go through that, and I get it.

01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:44.900
It's the worst
thing in the world.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.411
As somebody that gets
people results for a living,

01:03:47.411 --> 01:03:49.910
I wish I could say to you, hey,
I'm going to snap my fingers

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:51.710
and give you results tomorrow.

01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:53.800
It just doesn't work like that.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.020
I would argue 60% of
the population today

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:59.110
is slightly broken because
of the dietary protocols that

01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:02.080
have been put out there,
because of the lack of quantity

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.240
emphasis on people.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.240
Does that make sense?

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.490
Does that answer the question?

01:04:06.490 --> 01:04:08.024
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:04:08.024 --> 01:04:09.940
JASON PHILLIPS: The
question-- that, actually,

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:12.730
translating into
calorie spiking--

01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:15.820
basically, this was a reference
to a seventh day high calorie,

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:19.199
or non-tracking, or
cheat day of sorts.

01:04:19.199 --> 01:04:21.490
Actually, this is going to
prevent metabolic adaptation

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:22.720
to a large degree.

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.000
So even if you did eat the--

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.740
I've referenced 500 calories a
day, Monday through Saturday.

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.500
By going really
far over on Sunday,

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.340
you're sending the
signal to your body, hey,

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:31.900
there is an adequate
source of food intake

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.870
at least once per week.

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:35.200
I'm not going to go into
that starvation mode.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.820
Is this appropriate
right off the bat?

01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:38.050
No, I don't think so.

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:40.930
I also think it creates a really
poor mental state with food.

01:04:40.930 --> 01:04:42.670
What happens from
Monday to Saturday

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:44.560
is you start looking
forward to that Sunday.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:47.470
All of the social things, all
of your mindset around Monday

01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:49.300
through Saturday start going
out the window because all

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.400
you can wait for is Sunday
morning when you get to go

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.900
have pancakes,
Sunday night when you

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:56.620
get to have cheesecake,
whatever else it may be.

01:04:56.620 --> 01:05:00.340
So I really don't think it's
the best way to go about it.

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.260
I think that there are
certain applications

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:04.600
to cheat meals and cheat days.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.066
But it takes somebody
that's very mentally strong

01:05:07.066 --> 01:05:08.440
and you really
have to understand

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.835
the whole context of the person
before you get into that.

01:05:10.835 --> 01:05:12.043
That make sense to everybody?

01:05:12.043 --> 01:05:12.642
Yeah?

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:14.142
AUDIENCE: Calorie
spiking goes along

01:05:14.142 --> 01:05:16.340
the same lines as carb loading?

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:17.770
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah.

01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:20.920
The question is calorie
spiking and carb loading.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.350
It's really a
stimulation of leptin.

01:05:23.350 --> 01:05:27.190
We know that any dietary
protocol, any calorie deficit,

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:29.530
is going to create a decrease
in metabolic hormones.

01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:30.680
Leptin will down-regulate.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:31.840
Ghrelin will down-regulate.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.330
Active thyroid conversion from
T4 to T3 will down-regulate.

01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:37.830
That's just the facts of
living in a calorie deficit.

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:39.550
But by taking in
more carbohydrates,

01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:41.320
it will re-stimulate
leptin levels.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.480
It'll bring that
metabolic activity

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.350
back up to where it should be.

01:05:45.350 --> 01:05:50.190
And then you can resume
your calorie deficit.

01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:50.715
Make sense?

01:05:50.715 --> 01:05:51.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:52.780
JASON PHILLIPS: Now,
specifically, you

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:53.590
asked carb loading.

01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:55.510
There are studies that
show carbohydrates

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:58.150
are more impactful on leptin
than overall calorie balance.

01:05:58.150 --> 01:06:00.640
So that's why you start to
see high-carb days favored

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.218
more than high-calorie days.

01:06:02.218 --> 01:06:03.634
AUDIENCE: In terms
of performance,

01:06:03.634 --> 01:06:05.924
would you say, for
marathon runners,

01:06:05.924 --> 01:06:08.576
they go, say, six days
of eating regular food,

01:06:08.576 --> 01:06:11.020
and then they carb
load for the final day?

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:11.240
JASON PHILLIPS: Mm-hmm.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.656
AUDIENCE: In terms
of performance,

01:06:12.656 --> 01:06:14.350
wouldn't that be
pretty detrimental,

01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:15.950
because they're
not used to having

01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:17.950
such a high level of
carbohydrates to deal with?

01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:19.741
JASON PHILLIPS: The
question is, would that

01:06:19.741 --> 01:06:21.340
be detrimental to an athlete--

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:22.930
say, an endurance
runner-- six days,

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:26.960
normal carb, one day, high
carb for a loading principle.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.366
A, I would switch that load
to a 48-hour load that's

01:06:29.366 --> 01:06:30.490
a little bit more balanced.

01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:32.210
I don't think a
seventh-day, one-load--

01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:33.960
it's not going to give
you enough glycogen

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.440
to run on anyway.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.960
Glycogen re-synthesizes
at a 24-to-36-hour rate,

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.570
so that's really-- you would
need a 48-hour load for it

01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:41.837
to really be effective.

01:06:41.837 --> 01:06:43.420
The other thing
you've got to remember

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.280
is, assuming days
one through six

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.569
are not in a calorie deficit,
that seventh day is just

01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:48.610
keeping you in a surplus.

01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:50.526
You're not going to get
that same leptin spike

01:06:50.526 --> 01:06:51.910
because leptin's already high.

01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:54.243
You're not in a calorie deficit
Monday through Saturday,

01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:56.330
so we haven't
down-regulated leptin.

01:06:56.330 --> 01:06:57.996
You're not going to
get that same spike.

01:06:57.996 --> 01:07:01.174
AUDIENCE: What's the benefit
or purpose of leptin?

01:07:01.174 --> 01:07:02.590
JASON PHILLIPS:
Leptin regulates--

01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:03.640
it's a master hormone.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.140
It's a master
regulator in the body.

01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:08.380
It regulates all
metabolic function, right?

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.690
So if you think of your
body as a thermostat,

01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:17.230
we want you at 70 degrees
and you put it down to 65.

01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:19.240
Or it's 65 degrees
outside, rather.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.550
Your body fights to
heat up the room.

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:24.510
Leptin is your ability
to heat up the room.

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:25.055
Make sense?

01:07:25.055 --> 01:07:26.054
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it does.

01:07:29.330 --> 01:07:30.830
JASON PHILLIPS:
Question on fruit.

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:33.450
Fruit, the primary sugar
in fruit is fructose.

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:35.450
The problem is fructose
is stored preferentially

01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:36.020
in the liver.

01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:39.290
Fruit will never make you fat.

01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:42.170
The one time I would not choose
fruit as a carbohydrate source

01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:42.957
is post-workout.

01:07:42.957 --> 01:07:44.540
When you're training,
you're depleting

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:48.140
muscle glycogen. You want to
replenish that muscle glycogen.

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:51.060
That's going to come more
directly from glucose.

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:54.170
However, I've never seen any
substantial amount of fruit,

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:56.990
when calorie controlled,
that has made you fat.

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:58.520
Is it favorable for
body composition

01:07:58.520 --> 01:07:59.930
at high concentrations?

01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:01.997
Empirically, I can say no.

01:08:01.997 --> 01:08:04.330
I don't think anyone here is
trying to be a bodybuilder,

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.871
so I'm not even going to go down
that road and go super deep.

01:08:06.871 --> 01:08:09.200
But the myth that fruit
is going to make you fat

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.260
is just that, it's a myth.

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:12.250
Make sense?

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:13.500
Did you have a specific
question on fruit, or--

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.552
AUDIENCE: No, I
just want somebody

01:08:14.552 --> 01:08:16.210
to confirm what I always
felt when I heard that.

01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:17.090
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah.

01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:18.673
It's a great source
of micronutrients.

01:08:18.673 --> 01:08:22.227
Again, as we shift towards
the food quality spectrum,

01:08:22.227 --> 01:08:23.810
you're not trying
to be a bodybuilder.

01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:25.729
You're not trying
to get on a stage.

01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:28.340
There's health
benefits to fruit--

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:32.510
high antioxidant value,
high micronutrient value.

01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:35.102
I wouldn't make it your only
source of carbohydrates.

01:08:35.102 --> 01:08:36.560
I think that, at
that point, you're

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.367
getting one simple
chain of sugars

01:08:38.367 --> 01:08:39.950
and I think it should
be very diverse.

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:41.366
I also think that
you're not going

01:08:41.366 --> 01:08:44.180
to get enough fiber, unless
you're eating only raspberries.

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.910
But I think that there's
really nothing wrong,

01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:48.290
assuming it's all controlled.

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:52.310
I think, again, it's just fear
mongering in the media, right?

01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:53.310
But they have an agenda.

01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:56.750
They gotta sell
you something else.

01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:59.188
Let's see.

01:08:59.188 --> 01:09:02.180
Meal timing, pre-
and post-workout.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.800
Before you train,
for most people,

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.359
I like to see your
pre-workout meal--

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:07.100
I talked earlier,
eating something

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.100
on the way to the gym, it's
not really usable fuel.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:14.180
I like to see it closer to
90 minutes to 2 hours out.

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.060
It's really more about blood
sugar regulation at that point.

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:19.279
I like to see a relatively
balanced meal, primarily

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:20.510
protein-carbohydrate.

01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:23.450
If you're having fat, it
should be a super small amount.

01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:25.609
Most people are going to
do well with just proteins

01:09:25.609 --> 01:09:27.500
and carbohydrates,
no added fats.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.450
Added fats are going
to delay digestion.

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:31.370
They're going to sit a little
heavier in your stomach.

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:33.078
You want to be slightly
closer to fasted.

01:09:33.078 --> 01:09:35.108
That's going to allow
cortisol elevation.

01:09:35.108 --> 01:09:36.649
Cortisol, as we
talked about earlier,

01:09:36.649 --> 01:09:40.910
allows for mobilization of
stored protein, carbs, and fats

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:42.429
to help you burn fat.

01:09:42.429 --> 01:09:44.720
So it's going to create a
positive hormonal environment

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.640
for you to train in.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.779
Post-workout, it's very
dependent on what your training

01:09:50.779 --> 01:09:52.609
age is, what your level
of performance is.

01:09:52.609 --> 01:09:54.859
You're going to have anywhere
from something as simple

01:09:54.859 --> 01:09:58.100
as a protein shake, to a
protein-carbohydrate shake,

01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:02.270
to a high ratio of carbohydrates
to protein in your shake.

01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:05.040
That's going to
depend on who you are.

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.100
I would say 90% of
people should look

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:09.110
for some sort of
protein-carbohydrate

01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:11.027
within 30 minutes of
finishing their training.

01:10:11.027 --> 01:10:12.901
And that would be a
really general statement.

01:10:12.901 --> 01:10:14.660
If someone has more
specific questions,

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:18.267
they can feel free to ask me
and I will get that to them.

01:10:18.267 --> 01:10:19.850
But I know we're
running short on time

01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:21.749
so I'm trying to get
through that one.

01:10:21.749 --> 01:10:23.540
Someone asked me, what
about sugar alcohols

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.100
found in tons of protein shakes?

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.070
I don't know many protein
shakes that have sugar alcohols.

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:30.854
I know a lot of protein bars
that have sugar alcohols.

01:10:30.854 --> 01:10:32.270
I'm assuming that
is, do they need

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:34.580
to be counted in
carbohydrate intake?

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.710
The answer is yes, they do.

01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:39.140
They may not directly
impact your blood sugar.

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:40.460
They are still carbohydrate.

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:41.876
So if you're in a
ketogenic state,

01:10:41.876 --> 01:10:45.140
maybe you don't count them
towards your net carbs

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:46.907
for ketogenic balance.

01:10:46.907 --> 01:10:48.740
But in terms of overall
carbohydrate intake,

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:49.490
you absolutely do.

01:10:52.532 --> 01:10:53.740
AUDIENCE: Can you do organic?

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.450
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah, last
one, I think, is organic.

01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:55.665
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:10:55.665 --> 01:10:57.170
You talked about
quality already.

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:58.090
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah.

01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:02.240
Organic is relatively simple.

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.400
I think that it's--

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:06.340
because of the laws, I don't
think that the same application

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:09.160
today is like when the
conversation around it

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.720
first came out.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.250
If you look at this line
right here on the stage,

01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:17.590
this side could be
organic and this side

01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:19.090
could be non-organic
by what we're

01:11:19.090 --> 01:11:21.800
using, in terms of pesticides,
fertilizer, et cetera.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.019
But what's to say that it's
not windy this day, when

01:11:24.019 --> 01:11:26.560
I'm spraying fertilizers here,
and it doesn't over-spray over

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.220
here?

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:30.910
But by law, I sprayed this
side with no fertilizers,

01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:32.080
so it's organic.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.990
How do you really
know it's organic?

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.390
AUDIENCE: You don't.

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:35.473
JASON PHILLIPS: You don't.

01:11:35.473 --> 01:11:38.824
So my recommendation has always
been, if you have the money

01:11:38.824 --> 01:11:40.990
and it's something that you
can afford, buy organic.

01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:44.110
We always want to buy the
highest quality possible.

01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:45.490
Even if there's
some risk, and we

01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:47.272
don't have scientific
data that proves

01:11:47.272 --> 01:11:49.480
that there's risk on
fertilizers and pesticides yet--

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.070
we don't.

01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:51.700
It's just not out
there, empirically.

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:52.780
It really hasn't been around.

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:54.160
The conversation hasn't
been around long enough

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:55.787
for us to show
long-term effects.

01:11:55.787 --> 01:11:57.370
But even if there's
some risk, I think

01:11:57.370 --> 01:12:01.330
we should avoid it if
it fits into our budget.

01:12:01.330 --> 01:12:03.761
If it doesn't fit into your
budget, don't stress it.

01:12:03.761 --> 01:12:05.260
I haven't seen an
autopsy that says,

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:09.100
cause of death,
eating non-organic.

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.420
I haven't seen it happen yet.

01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:12.770
And if someone has,
please let me know.

01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:14.036
Does that makes sense?

01:12:14.036 --> 01:12:14.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:16.309
For me, it does.

01:12:16.309 --> 01:12:18.100
JASON PHILLIPS: Someone
else asked organic.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.450
Does that answer the question?

01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:20.440
Or perhaps they had to leave.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:20.939
I'm sorry.

01:12:20.939 --> 01:12:23.442
AUDIENCE: Are there
pesticides and stuff

01:12:23.442 --> 01:12:25.310
that can be used on organic?

01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:27.160
It's not just a
complete outright--

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.390
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah, I
believe that there are.

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:30.140
I haven't gone deep
enough in the research

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.350
to know exactly
what can categorize

01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:33.567
organic versus non-organic.

01:12:33.567 --> 01:12:35.650
That would be somebody
more in a clinical setting,

01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:37.126
a registered dietitian.

01:12:37.126 --> 01:12:39.250
That's not a route that I
really wanted to go down.

01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:44.200
It's not one, truthfully,
that I care enough about.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:48.509
I really-- I don't have any--
even my Olympic athletes,

01:12:48.509 --> 01:12:50.800
we try to eat organic because,
typically, their food is

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.910
provided for them.

01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:54.580
And we leave it at that.

01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:56.870
My average person, I'm not
advocating it for them.

01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:58.480
They're already spending
money on working with me.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.979
They're spending
money on a trainer.

01:12:59.979 --> 01:13:02.770
They're spending money
on whatever else.

01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:05.770
I think, first, let's dial
in total quantity of food.

01:13:05.770 --> 01:13:07.204
Then let's worry about quality.

01:13:07.204 --> 01:13:09.370
And then from there, if
that quality is really good,

01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:11.290
now let's get organic quality.

01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:17.170
But I think it's so far down the
list towards what the goal is.

01:13:17.170 --> 01:13:20.086
So I think that's
usually my hierarchy.

01:13:20.086 --> 01:13:20.710
Does that help?

01:13:20.710 --> 01:13:21.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it does.

01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:23.251
JASON PHILLIPS: And
then the last one

01:13:23.251 --> 01:13:25.090
is red meat and total quantity.

01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:26.880
I think, again,
that's fear mongering.

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.860
I actually think that-- we
talked about the omega-3, 6,

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:31.570
9 profile of chicken.

01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:34.210
I actually think-- the
fat profile of red meat

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:36.562
is favorable,
compared to chicken.

01:13:36.562 --> 01:13:38.020
I think that a lot
of people think,

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:39.894
oh, I'm going to get
really high cholesterol,

01:13:39.894 --> 01:13:42.460
or I'm going to get--
it's too much fat.

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:45.190
Really, unless you've
got prostate cancer,

01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:47.010
you shouldn't really
avoid red meat.

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:50.110
We do have studies that show
red meat exacerbates and creates

01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:53.041
an environment for certain
cancers to thrive in.

01:13:53.041 --> 01:13:54.790
Prostate's on the top
of my mind because I

01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:57.280
have a family member that
just was diagnosed with it.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:01.960
But I think that most of this
is very much fear mongering.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.270
I don't think it should be
your only source of protein,

01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:06.100
but I don't think there's any
protein out there that should

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.744
be your only source of protein.

01:14:07.744 --> 01:14:09.160
I think that you
should always try

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.451
to eat a wide variety of foods.

01:14:10.451 --> 01:14:12.250
So if you're going to
have red meat twice,

01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.954
then have chicken
or turkey once.

01:14:13.954 --> 01:14:15.370
If you're going
to have eggs once,

01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:16.870
red meat once,
white meat once, I

01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:18.280
think that's a really
good way to go.

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.654
Try to vary your
protein sources,

01:14:19.654 --> 01:14:22.120
but also try to vary your
starches, vary your vegetables.

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.580
Try to get an array of
amino acids taken in.

01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:26.557
Try to get an array
of carbohydrates.

01:14:26.557 --> 01:14:29.140
Then you're really going to get
a complete spectrum of aminos,

01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:30.111
micros, macros.

01:14:30.111 --> 01:14:32.110
Everything is going to
be taken in and balanced.

01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:35.530
And at the end of the day,
it's all about balance.

01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:37.600
Does that answer the
red meat question?

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.478
Good-- yeah, of course.

01:14:39.478 --> 01:14:41.186
AUDIENCE: Just generally
speaking, as far

01:14:41.186 --> 01:14:43.670
as preparation-- grilled
versus stir fried

01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:45.030
versus steamed or whatever.

01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:48.418
As far as red meat goes,
that's what we hear most about,

01:14:48.418 --> 01:14:52.492
where charred red meat is super
bad for you versus stir fried

01:14:52.492 --> 01:14:53.742
is less bad for you, whatever.

01:14:53.742 --> 01:14:56.660
So I'm curious to hear
your thoughts on that.

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:59.647
JASON PHILLIPS: The question
is the way it's prepared.

01:14:59.647 --> 01:15:01.230
In all fairness, I
haven't heard that.

01:15:04.086 --> 01:15:05.210
Where are you reading that?

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:07.335
AUDIENCE: Just whenever
you put a char on anything,

01:15:07.335 --> 01:15:09.890
it creates carcinogenic
properties or [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:10.010
JASON PHILLIPS: Sure.

01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:11.510
And that's potentially--
but I think

01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:13.730
that would be more on
char, in and of itself,

01:15:13.730 --> 01:15:17.450
not relative to red meat
being prepared that way.

01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:20.526
I think it's any meal
using char, right?

01:15:20.526 --> 01:15:23.150
And that's where they're saying,
because of the source of that,

01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:25.109
that there's potential
carcinogenic properties.

01:15:25.109 --> 01:15:26.108
I would agree with that.

01:15:26.108 --> 01:15:28.430
There's some research out
there that supports that.

01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:30.772
I don't think there's
enough to truly validate it,

01:15:30.772 --> 01:15:32.480
but I think that
there's some that people

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.897
have tried to prove it.

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:36.980
But I don't think, when
it comes down to red meat,

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:37.729
that preparation--

01:15:37.729 --> 01:15:40.700
I've seen any good or bad ways.

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.590
The same thing with temperature.

01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:44.294
We could argue that all day.

01:15:44.294 --> 01:15:46.460
I don't think that's as
important as a lot of people

01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:49.220
like to make it out to be.

01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:51.900
But remember, a lot of things
are written with agendas too.

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:54.320
I really make it a point
that everything I talk about

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.630
is science-backed
and evidence-based.

01:15:56.630 --> 01:16:00.140
I spend a lot of time
researching on things.

01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:03.410
All studies are
performed with an agenda.

01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:05.270
There was a study,
recently, on a supplement

01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:07.010
called HMB free acid.

01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:10.310
And it said it
would do everything,

01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:12.140
short of curing cancer.

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:15.280
It was like the golden thing
in the supplement industry.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.625
One of my buddies sent it to me.

01:16:16.625 --> 01:16:18.500
So I started looking at
it, and it was funded

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:19.984
by a company out of Canada.

01:16:19.984 --> 01:16:21.650
Well, that company
out of Canada happens

01:16:21.650 --> 01:16:25.370
to be the one company that uses
HMB free acid on the market.

01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:27.890
So of course they're going
to make the study look,

01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:30.960
and they set the study up to
prove all of these things.

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.960
So you look for multiple
studies that show that.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.700
It didn't happen.

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.200
Now you realize it's not truth.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.925
So when you start
looking into science

01:16:37.925 --> 01:16:39.710
and you start looking
at these things,

01:16:39.710 --> 01:16:40.910
make sure it's repeated.

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:43.680
Make sure that it's
truly supported

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.790
and it's actually happened
numerous times, not just

01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:48.060
one time.

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:49.074
Make sense?

01:16:49.074 --> 01:16:50.589
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:16:50.589 --> 01:16:52.880
JASON PHILLIPS: Cool, I think
that answered everything.

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.380
Sorry I got really
quick at the end.

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:54.890
Yeah?

01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:56.180
AUDIENCE: Alcohol.

01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:59.025
JASON PHILLIPS: Oh, alcohol.

01:16:59.025 --> 01:17:01.679
Damn, I thought I was going
to get away from that.

01:17:01.679 --> 01:17:02.720
Alcohol is really simple.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:06.030
I always like to say
we're all adults.

01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:07.940
We all make our own decisions.

01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:10.910
I recognize that,
for most people,

01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:13.400
alcohol fits into
their lifestyle.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:16.070
It's not my job to tell you
to drink or to not drink.

01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:19.850
But it is my job to let you know
how it's going to affect you.

01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:22.430
Alcohol delays what's called
priority of metabolism.

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:24.180
So when you go and
you have a drink,

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:27.350
your body recognizes
alcohol as a toxin.

01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:29.690
Proteins and carbohydrates
have four calories per gram.

01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:31.550
Fats have nine
calories per gram.

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:33.800
Alcohol has seven
calories per gram.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.960
Your body really doesn't
recognize the number seven

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:36.410
at all.

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:37.760
So it's like, oh my
gosh, what is this?

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.720
Get it out of me.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.420
And everything else shuts down
while the alcohol metabolism

01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:42.540
takes place.

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:44.030
However, while
that's taking place

01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:45.704
and everything
else is shut down,

01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:47.870
it's creating an environment
where that food is then

01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:48.950
stored as fat.

01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:51.950
At some point, it has to
be metabolized or stored.

01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:54.260
Instead of being metabolized
and used for energy,

01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:57.251
it's actually being
stored as fat.

01:17:57.251 --> 01:17:59.000
So it's not the alcohol,
in and of itself.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.550
It's the food prior to
consumption or the food

01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:04.820
during consumption of
the alcoholic beverages.

01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:07.010
So the question,
then, is asked, how

01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:09.680
do we have alcohol in
balance with lifestyle?

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.740
And the two hacks that I
give everybody are simple--

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:14.690
keep it to one night per week.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:17.960
And I've not seen one client,
when they keep it to one night

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.090
per week, that
cannot have results.

01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:22.130
So does that mean one
drink, one night per week,

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:25.730
or a whole liter
one night per week?

01:18:25.730 --> 01:18:27.320
The results will
be no different, as

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.169
sad as that sounds.

01:18:28.169 --> 01:18:29.460
I don't care if it's 10 drinks.

01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:30.410
I don't care if it's one drink.

01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:32.330
The reality is, the
calorie difference

01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:36.680
will be so negligible, relative
to the impact of one day,

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.310
that it really doesn't matter.

01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:40.850
It's that window of
time that is much more

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:45.450
impactful than the overall
consumption of the alcohol.

01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:50.060
The other is, don't consume
a lot of dietary fat

01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:51.474
when consuming alcohol.

01:18:51.474 --> 01:18:53.390
Because if you do get
that alcohol metabolized

01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:57.110
and your body does resume
metabolizing the food that's

01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:59.630
there, it needs
the items that are

01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:01.370
faster and easier
to metabolize, which

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:03.510
are proteins and carbohydrates.

01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:06.510
Fats are slower to digest,
as we talked about earlier.

01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:10.370
So eat lower-fat meals around
the times that you're drinking.

01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:13.010
I have several data
points to suggest that.

01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:15.250
And based on what I said,
people are like, oh,

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:17.192
so one drink every other night--

01:19:17.192 --> 01:19:18.150
that can't be that bad.

01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:18.950
It's just one.

01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:21.290
It's actually that
consumption so frequently

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:22.419
that is really bad.

01:19:22.419 --> 01:19:23.960
I would rather see
you get bombed out

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.870
of your mind on Saturday night,
not remember the night at all,

01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:28.870
and I guarantee you your
results would be better

01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:30.410
in a seven-day
window than if you

01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:32.618
had one drink every other
night throughout the course

01:19:32.618 --> 01:19:33.830
of the week.

01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:35.150
We could almost chart it.

01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:37.490
If you looked at
it, here's Sunday,

01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:40.400
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:43.950
If you consume alcohol here on
Sunday, what's going to happen?

01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:46.520
You're going to see the
scale go down on Monday,

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.260
and then the scale is going to--

01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:51.238
this marker's dying on me.

01:19:51.238 --> 01:19:54.570
You're going to see the
scale go back up on Tuesday.

01:19:54.570 --> 01:19:57.030
You're going to see it
go up again on Wednesday.

01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:58.170
We know this just--

01:19:58.170 --> 01:20:00.580
I have thousands of
data points on it.

01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:02.940
So if we have alcohol here,
and it goes down here,

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:04.614
and then we have
it here, while it's

01:20:04.614 --> 01:20:06.780
trying to go up, instead
of going down the next day,

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.220
it comes up again.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.870
But remember, alcohol
consumption here

01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:13.567
causes weight gain again
here, weight gain again there.

01:20:13.567 --> 01:20:15.900
And then alcohol consumption
here causes the weight gain

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:18.900
here and, subsequently,
again here.

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:22.180
You see why we're gaining
weight over time with alcohol.

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:27.070
Whereas, hey, you should get
it all in here, one night.

01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:31.780
Whatever happens here,
here, and here, no big deal.

01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:35.260
Because then here,
we can see the scale

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:39.591
go back down and achieving
net loss for the week.

01:20:39.591 --> 01:20:41.840
And if we start looking at
things on seven-day windows

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:43.930
and we're achieving net
loss on seven-day windows,

01:20:43.930 --> 01:20:46.932
in a 365-day window,
we're seeing weight loss.

01:20:46.932 --> 01:20:51.752
AUDIENCE: What if your goal is
maintenance, not weight loss?

01:20:51.752 --> 01:20:52.720
Sorry.

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.248
JASON PHILLIPS:
Two days per week?

01:20:54.248 --> 01:20:56.160
AUDIENCE: I could get
on board with that.

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.520
JASON PHILLIPS: Yeah?

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.830
That's probably what
I would tell you.

01:20:59.830 --> 01:21:01.090
There's probably a way--

01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:03.520
and again, without
knowing much about you,

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.895
there's probably a way we
could fit it in more than that,

01:21:05.895 --> 01:21:07.246
truth be told.

01:21:07.246 --> 01:21:09.020
AUDIENCE: Great.

01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:12.460
JASON PHILLIPS: It would take
an individual application.

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:17.530
But it's creating an environment
where fat gain is likely.

01:21:17.530 --> 01:21:18.920
I'll say that.

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.920
And that's what we would
have to circumvent.

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:22.390
It definitely would
not be an environment

01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:23.490
where fat loss is likely.

01:21:23.490 --> 01:21:25.180
Yeah, go for it.

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.290
AUDIENCE: Do you suggest
that all the alcohol

01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:30.345
is the same, as opposed to a
beer, to a wine, to a spirit?

01:21:30.345 --> 01:21:31.720
JASON PHILLIPS:
Emperically, I've

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.261
actually seen-- the question
is, is all the alcohol the same,

01:21:34.261 --> 01:21:36.790
from beer, to wine, to liquor?

01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:39.100
Empirically, I've actually
seen beer be the worst.

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:40.870
I don't have data as to why.

01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:43.522
If I had to guess, I would
look at what's already

01:21:43.522 --> 01:21:44.980
happening internally,
metabolically

01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:47.020
speaking, combined with gluten.

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:49.486
And when we look at a lower
metabolic response combined

01:21:49.486 --> 01:21:50.860
with something
like gluten that's

01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:53.025
not very tolerable
by most people,

01:21:53.025 --> 01:21:54.775
it's really creating
a gnarly environment,

01:21:54.775 --> 01:21:57.010
and we're seeing
more weight gain.

01:21:57.010 --> 01:21:58.660
Again that's purely conjecture.

01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:01.000
That's not science-based.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.966
That's just, again, what
I've seen over time.

01:22:03.966 --> 01:22:06.340
I think that the old adage of
clear liquors and red wines

01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:08.910
holds to be fairly true.

01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:09.410
Yeah.

01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:13.130
AUDIENCE: Can you talk about the
effects of diet soda, as well?

01:22:13.130 --> 01:22:14.595
JASON PHILLIPS: In terms of?

01:22:14.595 --> 01:22:19.727
AUDIENCE: Are there effects
besides the use of aspartame--

01:22:19.727 --> 01:22:21.560
JASON PHILLIPS: The
question is on diet soda

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.150
and if there's any effects.

01:22:23.150 --> 01:22:25.670
I think that what the media
is trying to say right now

01:22:25.670 --> 01:22:27.110
is that the
sweetener is creating

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:29.030
an insulin-type
response in your body

01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:30.804
and that because
your mind senses

01:22:30.804 --> 01:22:32.720
that something is so
sweet, that it's actually

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:35.770
increasing insulin levels, which
is an environment to store.

01:22:35.770 --> 01:22:38.040
Insulin is a storage hormone.

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.610
I have yet to see
that be true in

01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:42.540
true peer-reviewed literature.

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:46.869
Now, the people that support
the banning of sweeteners

01:22:46.869 --> 01:22:48.410
and the people that
hate sweeteners--

01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:50.340
those people, in
their fear mongering,

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.560
they're going to run
around and they're going

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:52.450
to publish all these studies.

01:22:52.450 --> 01:22:52.970
And they're going
to tell you it's

01:22:52.970 --> 01:22:53.760
the worst thing in the world.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.260
And they're going
to tell you you're

01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:57.025
going to die because of it.

01:22:57.025 --> 01:22:57.650
The same thing.

01:22:57.650 --> 01:22:59.150
I haven't seen an
autopsy that says,

01:22:59.150 --> 01:23:02.315
cause of death, pesticides.

01:23:02.315 --> 01:23:04.190
I haven't seen one that
says, cause of death,

01:23:04.190 --> 01:23:06.320
sweetener from soda.

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.910
So there's really
no studies that

01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:10.730
show that any sweetener
is super bad for you.

01:23:10.730 --> 01:23:13.550
I would argue there's just as
many studies that show that--

01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:16.136
because the two big ones
are sucralose and stevia.

01:23:16.136 --> 01:23:17.510
There's just as
many studies that

01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:20.636
show the negative effects
of sucralose, as are stevia.

01:23:20.636 --> 01:23:22.760
So you've got people that
jump on either bandwagon.

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.260
They're going to
vigorously support

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:25.340
their side of the fence.

01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:27.890
That's just what
people inherently do.

01:23:27.890 --> 01:23:31.010
The data doesn't support
or refute either one.

01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:33.240
So my recommendation to
clients is, don't stress it.

01:23:36.185 --> 01:23:37.810
AUDIENCE: Can you
briefly-- moving away

01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:40.410
from drinks in general,
can you talk a little bit

01:23:40.410 --> 01:23:43.340
about the best ways
to track your macros,

01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:44.560
track your calories?

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:47.520
I know MyFitnessPal
is a very popular one,

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:50.640
but it's also super annoying
because what you're eating

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.670
isn't really what you're
listing on MyFitnessPal

01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:56.030
unless it's literally
portioned out

01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:59.760
and you know the exact oatmeal
box you got it from, whatever.

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.305
What's the-- you travel a lot.

01:24:01.305 --> 01:24:03.180
I know you probably
eyeball it because you've

01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:04.221
gotten really good at it.

01:24:04.221 --> 01:24:06.636
Can you talk briefly
about some of the ways,

01:24:06.636 --> 01:24:08.760
for those of us who are a
little bit, I don't know,

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.085
maybe a little lazy to open up
MyFitnessPal three times a day

01:24:12.085 --> 01:24:13.710
and mark everything
you eat, et cetera?

01:24:13.710 --> 01:24:14.870
JASON PHILLIPS: Sure.

01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:15.870
Number one, are we good on time?

01:24:15.870 --> 01:24:17.670
Because we're-- since
we're already going over,

01:24:17.670 --> 01:24:18.753
are we good to keep going?

01:24:21.078 --> 01:24:21.970
Yeah?

01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:23.260
One minute, OK.

01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:24.430
One minute.

01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:26.221
The question is,
how do we track?

01:24:26.221 --> 01:24:27.220
How do we loosely track?

01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:30.160
How do we get away from
the neuroses provided

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.810
by something like MyFitnessPal?

01:24:31.810 --> 01:24:34.024
The reality is MyFitnessPal
should be a tool.

01:24:34.024 --> 01:24:35.440
It should not be
one that you plan

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:36.730
to use for your whole life.

01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:38.200
But I would say
it's one that you

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:39.850
need to use in the
beginning to create

01:24:39.850 --> 01:24:41.170
an environment of tracking.

01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:43.320
If I told you today
that you had to eyeball

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:45.520
and it had to be within
like a 1-ounce accuracy,

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.910
could you do it?

01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:47.910
The answer is probably--

01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:48.870
AUDIENCE: I think I could,
but I probably couldn't.

01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:49.650
JASON PHILLIPS:
Right, you probably

01:24:49.650 --> 01:24:51.691
could not, as much as you
would like to think so.

01:24:51.691 --> 01:24:53.940
However, after 60 to
90 days of tracking,

01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:55.650
I bet you probably could.

01:24:55.650 --> 01:24:58.260
So if you start thinking
of it as a tool where

01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.670
I'm going to build knowledge--

01:24:59.670 --> 01:25:01.670
I'm going to learn knowledge
so that, long term,

01:25:01.670 --> 01:25:02.610
I can have success.

01:25:02.610 --> 01:25:04.230
I would start
re-framing it like that.

01:25:04.230 --> 01:25:08.940
I would argue there's no way to
get around tracking initially

01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:11.820
because we're just not born
with the inherent ability

01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:13.830
to eyeball something and
know the exact weight

01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:16.080
or the exact portion size.

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.942
I also think, like
I mentioned earlier,

01:25:17.942 --> 01:25:19.650
it's a really good
tool to create habits.

01:25:19.650 --> 01:25:22.770
So for myself, being on the
road a lot, when I'm at home,

01:25:22.770 --> 01:25:24.750
I work on understanding
what my habits are.

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:26.970
My breakfast is
usually some sort

01:25:26.970 --> 01:25:29.220
of combo of protein
and carbohydrates.

01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:32.020
My lunch is some sort of combo
of protein and carbohydrates.

01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:33.210
So when I'm on the road,
I'm not necessarily

01:25:33.210 --> 01:25:34.876
concerned about the
portion size as much

01:25:34.876 --> 01:25:36.750
as pairing those
food groups together.

01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:40.500
I know by satiety what
I should be eating,

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:43.800
and I also do
eyeball, to an extent.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:44.690
Is it perfect?

01:25:44.690 --> 01:25:47.430
No, and I would argue that my
results from being on the road

01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:48.114
are not perfect.

01:25:48.114 --> 01:25:49.530
But they're a lot
better than if I

01:25:49.530 --> 01:25:52.800
didn't have any sort of concept
from having previously tracked.

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:55.450
And when I'm home,
I track vigorously.

01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:56.150
That make sense?

01:25:56.150 --> 01:25:56.800
AUDIENCE: Through MyFitnessPal.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.120
JASON PHILLIPS:
Through MyFitnessPal.

01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:58.620
Yep.

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:00.359
AUDIENCE: OK, so
there's no fist, hand--

01:26:00.359 --> 01:26:01.150
JASON PHILLIPS: No.

01:26:01.150 --> 01:26:01.490
No.

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:03.250
Because our fists
are a different size.

01:26:03.250 --> 01:26:04.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:05.820
But our bodies are
different sizes.

01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:07.260
JASON PHILLIPS: That's true.

01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:10.920
But I don't think that
the fist-sized protein--

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:15.560
my fist was this size
when I was 118 pounds.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:20.170
Does that mean it's appropriate
to me at 190 pounds now?

01:26:20.170 --> 01:26:23.530
So I just don't think
those arguments hold up.

01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:25.532
I think they're very
simplistic for general--

01:26:25.532 --> 01:26:27.490
again, if you take somebody
that's over-eating,

01:26:27.490 --> 01:26:28.660
and you tell them,
limit something

01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:30.320
to the size of their fist,
now what have you done?

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.779
You've created a
calorie deficit.

01:26:31.779 --> 01:26:33.820
But you're not at a point
where huge changes have

01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:34.960
to take place.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.850
You're looking for
smaller changes

01:26:36.850 --> 01:26:40.380
to move you closer to
a more precise goal.

01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:43.990
The more precision of your
goal, the more precision

01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.974
you have to act with.

01:26:44.974 --> 01:26:47.640
AUDIENCE: I think there's a good
business opportunity to come up

01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:50.515
with a way where it's like, no
matter where you are, no matter

01:26:50.515 --> 01:26:52.639
what food's served to you--
whether it's the Google

01:26:52.639 --> 01:26:55.440
cafeteria or the hotel
you're staying at,

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.920
somehow you know the exact
makeup of what you're eating.

01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.295
JASON PHILLIPS:
Yeah, it's called

01:26:59.295 --> 01:27:02.170
a-- it's a pocket-size
food scale.

01:27:02.170 --> 01:27:04.120
They look like little
drug dealer scales.

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:07.805
Maybe that's where they
started, but I can attest.

01:27:07.805 --> 01:27:09.430
I have several
high-level athletes that

01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:10.830
travel with pocket-size scales.

01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:13.526
AUDIENCE: But there's just
a lot of stuff [? in this ?]

01:27:13.526 --> 01:27:15.400
particular meal, so it's
hard to [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:16.550
JASON PHILLIPS: I
would actually argue--

01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:17.650
if we were really
having this conversation

01:27:17.650 --> 01:27:19.608
and you were a client of
mine, I would tell you

01:27:19.608 --> 01:27:22.240
that your head is letting it
go way deeper than it really

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:24.952
is, because it takes about five
seconds to weigh something.

01:27:24.952 --> 01:27:26.660
So if you actually
pulled that scale out,

01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:28.860
and you put the food on
there, and it said 10 ounces,

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:30.568
and you only needed
five, cut it in half.

01:27:30.568 --> 01:27:31.640
Boom, start eating.

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:32.390
How hard was that?

01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:33.770
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:36.290
I'm thinking of more
prepared things.

01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:37.910
Think about lasagna.

01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:41.060
It's got meat, it's got carbs,
it's got all that stuff.

01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:43.440
Just weighing it
isn't going to be--

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.440
JASON PHILLIPS: And that's
where you would use--

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:48.370
you would pull
something like lasagna

01:27:48.370 --> 01:27:49.700
from somewhere in MyFitnessPal.

01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:52.040
Use that same one
every single time.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:52.970
Choose one serving.

01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:53.930
It's all done.

01:27:53.930 --> 01:27:56.390
And that margin of error now
becomes a constant variable

01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:59.330
that you're always
operating with.

01:27:59.330 --> 01:27:59.840
Good?

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:03.985
I'm getting a flashing red
light, so I'd better stop.

01:28:03.985 --> 01:28:05.360
Thank you guys
all for coming in.

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.590
Everyone that did,
everyone that watched.

01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:08.090
Thank you guys
for having me out.

01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:09.465
I hope I answered
your questions.

01:28:09.465 --> 01:28:12.700
[APPLAUSE]
