&gt;&gt;Announcer Chris: Hello everyone.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.250
Thank you for coming to today's Authors @ Google
talk.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.640
I'm really excited to welcome Anthony Myint
and Karen Leibowitz here to talk about their

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.049
new book, Mission Street Food: Ideas and Recipes
from an Improbable Restaurant.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.540
They've been doing some of the most interesting
and exciting things in the food scene in San

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.540
Francisco for awhile.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.530
They're a husband and wife duo that seem to
have no lack of ambition for various restaurant

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.119
endeavors, some of which seem pretty spontaneous.

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.320
So anyways to hear about the genesis of all
these ideas, please join me in welcoming Anthony

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.740
and Karen.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.050
[applause]

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.700
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Thanks Chris and thanks
all of you for coming.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.000
Anthony is just finishing up some final prep.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.739
We're gonna give you some food.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.350
We actually are here in part because someone
came to another event that we did and invited

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.370
us along and I really think this program,
Authors @ Google, is so wonderful, so thank

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.290
you so much for having us.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.950
I guess we'll just say a little bit about
what we've been doing and give you some samples

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.229
of our book and then we'll hopefully have
a discussion.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:22.880
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: Our book is split into roughly
two parts, a narrative and a food section

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.229
with recipes.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.619
The narrative describes us a bit and then
covers our brief but eventful run in a taco

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.280
truck in 2008.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.899
We sold flatbread sandwiches which were surprisingly
popular forcing us to move into a restaurant.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.459
Here's a little excerpt from the narrative
of our first night in the restaurant.

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.469
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Can you guys hear?

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.549
[murmurs from the audience]

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.289
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: Sorry.

00:01:53.289 --> 00:02:00.439
So this is a little excerpt from the book
which is from the first night in the restaurant.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.999
"As soon as we opened, orders started coming
in five or six at a time, but the metal ticket

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:07.469
holder was broken.

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.500
We were stacking tickets on the only available
surface in the kitchen, which was the narrow

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.810
counter where we were also plating food.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.580
Tickets were sticking to dishes or getting
greasy and illegible.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.650
When duplicate tickets started showing up,
disorganization turned to utter chaos.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.310
Finally we decided to completely disregard
tickets and just make random batches of each

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.090
dish as fast as we could.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.040
I can only imagine what the dining room must
have been like, because I never even left

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.040
the kitchen."

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.620
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: And I should explain that
part of our book is structured as a dialog,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.500
so Anthony speaks and then I speak and we're
reproducing that effect for you now.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.489
"My memories of that night are hazy.

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.150
As I sprinted the two blocks from the BART
station, I was working at the time in Berkeley,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.329
I saw a crowd standing outside the restaurant
and wondered if they'd had to evacuate for

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.329
some reason.

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.159
I ran faster.

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.650
As I opened the door I saw a completely full
house and it seemed like everyone I knew was

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.650
there.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.409
Half a dozen of our friends had spontaneously
stepped in to help.

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:11.250
It was unclear who was a server and who was
a customer and even people I didn't know seemed

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.129
familiar, like in a dream, though I probably
recognized some of them from the truck.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.469
Then again, a lot of people in the Mission
look the same to me now that beards have come

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.659
back into fashion [audience chuckles].

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.799
The new MSF had been open for about an hour
and it was an utter shit show.

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.750
They had switched over to dim sum style service
and the tables closest to the kitchen were

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.450
gobbling up all the food, leaving the tables
farther away from the kitchen hungry and pissy."

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.370
And just as a side note, we learned after
the book went to the printer that one of our

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.270
friends who was a waitress was actually being
grabbed by the legs as she came out of the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.500
kitchen, people wouldn't let her penetrate
farther into the dining room.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.810
"The beer was warm, the cash register was
broken, so a friend was doling, doing all

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.489
the check calculations with pencil and paper
in the dark.

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.879
As a group we had no system, no table numbers,
no common language for the food we were serving.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.099
We were laughably inept.

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.840
No one wanted to wash dishes full time, so
we took turns randomly going back to clean

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.469
whatever we were desperate for.

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:19.471
At the end of the night, I worked that dishwasher
for what seemed like hours, wondering how

00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:22.280
I had arrived at this point in my life."

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.660
So my other job in Berkeley was as professor.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.290
"I could hear Anthony talking with the owners
of Lung Shan behind me in Cantonese, but I

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.900
couldn't understand a word.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.419
I thought, 'they better be talking about what
a good wife I am.'"

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:35.419
[laughter]

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.729
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: "When we got home, I was
exhausted to the point of despondency, but

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.310
I also felt a little bit sentimental.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.789
Anthony had become a chef.

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.990
I had become a dishwasher slash restaurant
manager.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.400
Our friends were pulling for us.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.650
We were incompetent.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.889
We were successful.

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.930
Nothing made any sense."

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:00.910
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: So I guess maybe it's worth
noting that we, we started in a taco truck

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:07.270
and we were selling flatbread sandwiches that
were kind of designed to make it, to take

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.220
advantage of the facilities the truck had
to offer, but they were in a sense sort of

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:20.780
just like gourmet tacos and before we had
even set foot in the truck for the first time,

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:27.000
I guess someone had blogged about it and there
was a line of customers waiting.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.520
And then each week things got more and more
kind of crazy and we were more and more popular

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:42.460
and then eventually we, for reasons you can
read about in the book, were forced to move

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.000
into a restaurant.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.060
But we only took two weeks off in that time
and we were still working full-time jobs so

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:57.750
we, I guess there were, there were a lot of
decisions to be made like what kind of food

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.330
we were gonna serve and who would be the staff
and would we even have table service or what?

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.070
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Would anyone show up?

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.330
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: [laughing] And so.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.330
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: I thought you were gonna
say a little bit about the first menu?

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:16.169
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: So 
the first menu that we served had one of the

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.810
signature dishes from the truck, which was
called a PB&amp;J.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:30.990
It was crispy pork belly, which is the PB,
marinated jicama and cilantro aioli, among

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:38.930
other things, and then also a dish that was
a Burmese soup called Ohn-No-Kauk-Swe, which

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:49.990
I enjoyed growing up and then two kinds of
fried rice, I guess mainly centered around

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:57.760
smoking the rice and frying the rice in duck
fat and serving it with crispy duck skin,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.300
which in part we're sort of trying to recreate
today with sort of like little Peking duck

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.409
hors d'oeuvres.

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:08.509
[pause] [inaudible]

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:11.680
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Ok.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.740
What?

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.129
So that flatbread sandwich kind of took many
forms over the course of Mission Street Food

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:24.020
and one of the most successful was kind of
a form of Peking duck with a duck breast confit

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.870
and a duck skin that had been made crispy.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.940
So we're gonna read a little bit about the
Peking duck in our book and then also give

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.379
you a version of that, but with chicken.

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:40.229
So, do you wanna?

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:41.229
[pause]

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:46.960
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: "I spent a month eating my
way around China, but my favorite Peking duck

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.080
is in an old strip mall in the suburbs of
Washington D.C. at Peking Gourmet Inn.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.939
The walls are chockablock with pictures of
politicians and celebrities, all smiling the

00:07:55.939 --> 00:07:58.650
same Peking duck induced smile.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.930
Ducks are carved tableside by lifelong professionals
who expertly unfurl broad swaths of crispy

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.990
skin and slices of tender meat.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.389
The restaurant owners serve the duck with
a special variety of yellow spring onion grown

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:15.600
on their own farm along with hoisin sauce,
soy-cured peppers, julienned cucumbers, and

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.830
crucially, thin flour wrappers.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.550
The entire ensemble is sublimely satisfying.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.719
It's a dish I could eat every day."

00:08:24.719 --> 00:08:29.400
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: "The traditional preparation
of Peking duck involves separating the skin

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.580
from the fat with a kind of bellows and actually
some friends of ours tried to simulate this

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.650
with a bike pump before resorting to the air
compressor at the gas station one time.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:43.330
The ducks are then air dried for one or two
days to remove excess water from the skin,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.222
then roasted by hanging over wood embers in
a brick oven so the fat can render and the

00:08:47.222 --> 00:08:48.830
duck can self baste."

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:54.480
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: "Unfortunately, this was
not even remotely possible in the small refrigerators

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.920
and half-broken oven at Mission Street Food.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.510
However, it's the crispy skin, hoisin and
cucumber combo that really brings the dish

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:06.220
home for me, so it's still possible to approach
that Peking duck epiphany without doing anything

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.760
the right way.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.590
We served variations of this flavor combo
in tacos, flatbread sandwiches and even something

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:17.620
we called a chineedo, a rice noodle wrapped
around a Chinese donut stuffed with the usual

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.620
suspects."

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:26.450
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: So this is what that section
looks like in our book and you can see that

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:33.620
the recipes are given photos step by step
and then each one has a little headnote.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:38.140
So you probably can't read the beginning,
but it says, "Peking duck is all about the

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.630
crispy skin, our alternative to roasting whole
ducks is to start with separate skins and

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.100
make crackling.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.750
Ideally you'd use duck skin, but chicken skin
is easier to obtain and is a more than acceptable

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.750
substitution.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.670
Your local butcher might be nice enough to
just give you their unwanted poultry skins,

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.810
but act quickly.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:59.160
Chicken skin is the new bacon and soon opportunists
will be selling novelties like chicken wrapped

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.230
in chicken skin."

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.230
[laughter]

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:07.970
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: And then this is the next
page where you get the end of the recipe for

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:14.560
the Peking duck and then a kind of background
on confit and then you can see on the right

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:21.010
Anthony is enjoying Peking duck with an old
woman who we work with.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.060
She'll eat anything.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.670
It's actually kind of our game to bring her
any kind of food.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:31.340
I mean it's not that Peking duck is hard to
get anyone to eat, but we have brought her

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:37.530
those enormous dosas or like food from all
nations and she loves it all.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.180
So it's very gratifying to watch her eat.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.390
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: But she likes cheeseburgers
I think the best.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.390
[laughter]

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.390
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Ok.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.820
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: So I guess maybe now we'll
just pass out some food and things before

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.040
we move on.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:11:01.490
[pause] So Mission Street Food was maybe one
of the earlier or first pop-up restaurants

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:11.350
and apart from just doing that we also kind
of had some other unusual things going on,

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:17.910
one of which is that we invited guest chefs
from around the city to join us and present

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.540
half of the menu each time.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:27.520
Part of us doing that was because we were
working full-time jobs and it was really hard

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:35.070
to prep enough food for everybody, but also
part of it was that like I was just a line

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:43.870
cook and felt a little bit, I don't know,
I guess humble at the fact that I was now

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:48.920
kind of chef of a restaurant, not necessarily
having like gone through the traditional route

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:55.130
or having paid traditional dues and so I kind
of wanted other cooks around the city to have

00:11:55.130 --> 00:12:01.540
that opportunity to, to come and present like
food that they were interested in making.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:09.250
And so we had guest chefs serving like all
kinds of different food and then we would

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:16.490
just do half the menu also in the same style
as they did, so some of the kind of themes

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:24.200
that we, themes or styles of food that we
served over the year and a half were Malaysian

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:34.610
food, breakfast for dinner, Jewish food, fancy
McDonalds, chaat, whole hog, and Mexiterranean.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:40.420
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: So when we first announced
this guest chef program, we had kind of big

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.420
ambitions.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:47.170
We thought it was gonna be like a revolution
in the American restaurant kitchen, which

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:53.130
the kitchens tend to be pretty hierarchical,
and we were planning some kind of collaborative

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.770
style.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:13:01.000
And so sometimes we did kind of have that
initial dream of a line cook who wanted a

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.790
chance to try out his or her own food.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:10.230
Sometimes we had more established chefs who
were, you know, maybe doing California cuisine

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.950
everyday and they wanted their chance to do
something else.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:18.430
Sometimes chefs would come to Mission Street
Food and do previews of restaurants that they

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.300
were opening.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:27.180
So like we had Wexler's try things out and
Baker and Banker tried out their food at Mission

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.180
Street Food.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:33.141
After a certain point, we did Mission Street
Food for about 20 months, and after a certain

00:13:33.141 --> 00:13:38.670
point we kind of ran out of people who wanted
to work really hard and give away any money

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.580
that they made to charity.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.050
[chuckles] It's weird.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.050
[laughter]

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:47.100
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: So we were sort of left
to our own devices.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:53.570
And out of that dearth of guest chefs came
this idea to do what we called the homage

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:54.570
series.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:59.760
And it was a way of bringing in a kind of
guest chef to give the menu some focus.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:07.750
So Anthony and his cronies would come up with
a chef, often one whose food they had never

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:14.380
actually tried, and try to make food in emulation
of that style.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:24.230
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: So my cronies at that time
were Danny Bowien, who is now the chef of

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:33.020
a restaurant that came from Mission Street
Food sort of, called Mission Chinese Food,

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:39.180
and Danny has earned a lot of accolades recently
and I think he's well on his way to becoming

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:44.370
a celebrity chef, but at that time he was
still just a jaded line cook.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:49.820
And then the other person working with me
at the time was Ian Muntzert who is now the

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:55.750
chef de cuisine at Commonwealth, but he had
just worked at Coi for a few months, which

00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:03.380
is like I guess for the past few years has
been one of if not the best like haute cuisine

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.030
restaurants in the city or in San Francisco.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:13.600
And so basically we had sort of too many cooks
in the kitchen and kind of a lot of different

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:20.310
ideas and stuff, but so we, I think Danny
actually had the idea to just make food in

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:27.070
the style of like world class chefs at Michelin
starred restaurants and, and there was something

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:32.390
you know sort of ridiculous about doing this
in a kind of run down Chinese restaurant with

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:37.330
Christmas lights on the walls and like loud
music and people essentially like sharing

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:43.060
tables huddled together in chaos in the dark
or whatever.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:50.370
But over that time we did menus in the style
of Noma, which is a restaurant in Copenhagen

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:55.630
that has become or yeah has since gone on
to become the worlds' number one restaurant

00:15:55.630 --> 00:16:07.640
and some other tributes like to all-time great
chefs like Escoffier but so I guess this second

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:16.240
thing that we'll be serving today is one of
the recipes that came from one of the homage

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.840
dinners which was a Noma tribute.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:29.290
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: So Noma is in Copenhagen
and the idea of the restaurant is to do Nordic

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:34.290
cuisine, really local ingredients for Scandinavia.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.930
Some of those ingredients are not available
to us.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:45.590
So in our, in our book we give a recipe for
the oyster tarragon puree that René Redzepi

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:50.670
invented and the headnote says, "This is my
version of a sauce they serve at Noma, the

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.420
number one restaurant in the world.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.860
We add oysters for depth and brininess and
to take off the, take the edge off of the

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:57.860
tarragon.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.780
It's a complex sauce that could be used with
elemental dishes like steak, fish, chicken

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:03.780
or omelets.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.299
I apologize to René Redzepi and his staff
as I'm sure our version doesn't do justice

00:17:08.299 --> 00:17:09.669
to Noma's.

00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:15.020
Serve with a musk ox tartare or wood sorrel
and juniper if you wanna bite Noma's style.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:19.510
Or go off on your own if you think that you're
better than René Redzepi.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:24.470
At MSF we couldn't get musk ox so we used
regular ox and AXE body spray."

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.470
[laughter]

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:34.440
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: So today we'll be serving
the oyster tarragon puree with a little bit

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:41.080
of mushroom and potato just as an appetizer/hors
d'oeuvre type thing.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.290
So I hope you didn't ruin your appetite with
chicken confit.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:50.290
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: One of the biggest advantages
of the homage series was giving us something

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.490
to blog about.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:56.110
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: [chuckles] So actually
we talk a little bit about the importance

00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:02.630
of our blog in these sections that we sort
of privately called sidebars.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:06.549
So as Anthony mentioned, about half of the
book is the story of what we did and then

00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:12.710
we have these colored pages which have sort
of particular things that we discuss.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.940
So this one is called Blogstaurant For Better
or Worse.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:24.200
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: "While the restaurant industry
has been pretty slow to adapt to the reality

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:29.250
of the internet age, Mission Street Food was
an early and enthusiastic adopter of new media.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.419
In fact, we could not have survived without
the internet.

00:18:32.419 --> 00:18:36.870
As a pop-up restaurant, we were only visible
to the public for about a dozen hours a week,

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.279
so we used our blog as a substitutes to our
front window where we could hang our little

00:18:40.279 --> 00:18:44.509
signs announcing upcoming events, warning
that we would be closed for a wedding, or

00:18:44.509 --> 00:18:46.480
just reminding the world that we existed.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.820
We tried to keep it simple.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.100
Most of our posts were just a paragraph on
the next guest chef or theme, a paragraph

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.419
on that night's charity."

00:18:53.419 --> 00:19:00.879
I guess I forgot to mention that we donated
all of our profits to local hunger-related

00:19:00.879 --> 00:19:01.879
charities.

00:19:01.879 --> 00:19:04.820
"And finally the upcoming menu.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.980
Can we all agree that we don't need any more
flash introductions, ambient electronic music

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:13.090
or close-up food photography before we get
to see a restaurant's address?

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.620
But the internet."

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.200
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.519
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: "But the internet is a
two-way street.

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:23.940
We had our blog and our Twitter account, but
we weren't the only ones talking about MSF.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:28.309
We were a hot topic on local sites before
we sold our first flatbread and as time went

00:19:28.309 --> 00:19:33.240
on we got more press from serious food bloggers,
who took meticulous notes on the dishes they

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.370
ate.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:41.100
Their prioritization of blogging over actually
eating was, on the surface, distasteful.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:45.720
But upon further consideration, we started
to see ourselves as equally responsible since

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.470
our menus were practically begging for documentation
and commentary.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.100
Even worse, we chose our themes with an eye
toward our blog.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.750
Yes, we were sell-outs."

00:19:54.750 --> 00:20:01.679
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: "In our defense, we behaved
no worse than a chef pandering to local food

00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:02.679
critics.

00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:06.789
It just so happened that our clientèle was
largely composed of food critics democratically

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:09.010
selected by themselves.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.629
Along with the food we served, we were part
of an online feedback loop of blog-driven

00:20:12.629 --> 00:20:16.960
satisfaction and 'critical acclaim.'

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.759
Looking back, our only regret is that we spent
so much time trying to make the food taste

00:20:20.759 --> 00:20:25.610
good rather than just crafting electronic
files replete with polished photos and pithy

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:31.320
remarks ready for 'consumers' to upload to
their sites.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.690
Or perhaps we shouldn't have involved the
customers at all and simply blogged about

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.580
an imaginary restaurant ourselves.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.759
Best of luck to any aspiring blogstaurateurs
out there.

00:20:40.759 --> 00:20:42.710
We're looking forward to not even eating your
food."

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:50.070
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: So I guess we were thinking
that it might be interesting to sort of talk

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:56.200
with you guys about the effect of the internet
on the restaurant business and I guess other

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.440
kinds of culture as well.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:07.820
We in some ways are blog-led to the book because
we spent so much time writing about the restaurant

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:12.269
that it sort of was natural to, to write further.

00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:20.460
And I think it does sort of speak to the importance
of I guess how people organize their lives

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:26.270
now so that if you can sort of tap into that
in terms of the menus and the marketing and

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:27.580
so forth.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:35.529
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: I think for us one of the
things that was pretty surprising was how

00:21:35.529 --> 00:21:43.649
like just how pervasive and just how intense
kind of press coverage by way of the blogosphere

00:21:43.649 --> 00:21:46.340
and stuff had gotten.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:54.100
Like one point in particular that that we
mention comes to mind is I think in the second

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:59.769
or third week when we were operating a food
truck, a website called Eater SF, which is

00:21:59.769 --> 00:22:04.600
like a pretty widely read and significant
media outlet.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.299
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: In the food industry.

00:22:06.299 --> 00:22:09.529
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: Right, in the food industry,
sorry.

00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:15.710
I guess like published a piece or an update
or something about how we were gonna be serving

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:22.620
brownies that week instead of cookies and
then like that is pretty ridiculous, but then

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:29.929
later they published a crucial update saying
that the brownies would be topped with Brie,

00:22:29.929 --> 00:22:36.909
Brie cheese and hazelnuts, and this is of
course in like San Francisco one of the major

00:22:36.909 --> 00:22:38.490
food cities in the U.S.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:43.752
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: But I mean so that's sort
of a more negative side of thing.

00:22:43.752 --> 00:22:49.129
But I think on the more positive side there's
a sense that Mission Street Food, which was

00:22:49.129 --> 00:22:54.360
a project done by people who had no funding
and in some ways no right to open a restaurant

00:22:54.360 --> 00:23:01.090
is like a mirror image of the kind of democratization
of a lot of culture that you see with the

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:07.320
internet where it doesn't cost much to just
start publishing a blog or something, so I

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:16.700
guess we were sort of interested in that sense
of being part of a larger breaking down of

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.440
these barriers to entry for all kinds of business.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.529
I mean in some ways we were like a startup
I guess.

00:23:23.529 --> 00:23:30.929
But I guess from there we're just ready to
take questions if you have any.

00:23:30.929 --> 00:23:35.330
&gt;&gt;male #1: I thank you so much for coming
and bringing food.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.330
It's great.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.570
I'm a big fan of the restaurant.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:43.440
One thing I always wonder about when I'm there
is what the relationship is like between Mission

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:49.409
Chinese Food and Mission Street Food, in general,
like as kind of a community of people and

00:23:49.409 --> 00:23:53.840
the Lung Shan, the people who work at Lung
Shan and how that relationship has developed

00:23:53.840 --> 00:24:00.110
and if there was sort of any tension with
or like, how do you balance that sort of in

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.309
the kitchen, I guess?

00:24:01.309 --> 00:24:03.700
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Well maybe I'll address
part and.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:10.730
So Mission Street Food was the name that we
gave this truck that we parked out on Mission

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:11.730
Street.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:16.279
And it seemed like a clever street food thing
and then we moved into a restaurant on Mission

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:21.639
Street and kept the name, where it was less
accurate but it was fine.

00:24:21.639 --> 00:24:26.470
[giggles] And we held on to that and then
changed the name to Mission Chinese Food.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.730
And it was mostly the same people, but just
a different business model.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:36.269
Mission Chinese Food is open every day, whereas
Mission Street Food was twice a week and it

00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:38.809
has a stable menu.

00:24:38.809 --> 00:24:44.019
So the relationship between those two restaurants
is sort of one of evolution.

00:24:44.019 --> 00:24:49.119
The relationship between Mission Chinese Food
or Mission Street Food and Lung Shan, which

00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:53.409
is the restaurant that we occupied is a little
more complicated.

00:24:53.409 --> 00:25:00.419
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: So I guess we initially started
Mission Street Food just by going door to

00:25:00.419 --> 00:25:06.059
door and kind of asking places if they would
let us use their dining room or kitchen or

00:25:06.059 --> 00:25:14.769
let us share the space and the people at Lung
Shan were the only people who were interested.

00:25:14.769 --> 00:25:21.090
So we started doing that and I think they
were pretty you know skeptical and curious,

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:28.860
but also like pretty I guess risk neutral
or risk seeking maybe even and just trying

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.779
to make a buck.

00:25:31.779 --> 00:25:36.850
But over time I think that we sort of like
developed a mutual respect for one another

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:44.240
like us learning from kind of their kind of
thrift and savvy in certain ways and them

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:51.110
sort of respecting our like different kind
of savvy, if you can call it that.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:57.289
But so, but so we operated Mission Street
Food the whole time and we were essentially

00:25:57.289 --> 00:26:04.919
just paying them rent, although to make things
kind of on the level from a legal prospective

00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:06.639
we had them hire us.

00:26:06.639 --> 00:26:14.730
But now that it's Mission Chinese Food, like
we are all still employees of theirs but we

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.610
share the profits with them.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:27.909
And it's been pretty, I guess pretty exciting
to kind of see how like it's like a real culture

00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:35.750
clash or like cultural experiment or whatever
where like this business is now very much

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:36.750
theirs.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:43.340
And like if you know if we didn't have like
their infrastructure of like kind of kitchen

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:49.890
staff and delivery and stuff things would
completely fall apart, like.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:54.750
We definitely couldn't handle it on our own
and you know it's fun to kind of like hang

00:26:54.750 --> 00:27:00.730
out with them in the off hours when they're
like eating watermelon and sitting around,

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:05.470
goofing around and like kind of grabbing each
other's asses and stuff, but.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:10.490
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: So Anthony is functionally
the only bilingual person in the group.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:16.590
So mostly people either speak English or Cantonese,
so it may be more fun for you.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:17.590
[laughing]

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:18.590
[laughter]

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:22.409
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: But I do enjoy seeing him
make a joke in Cantonese and I can tell that

00:27:22.409 --> 00:27:25.960
he has said something funny, even though I
can't understand it at all.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:32.210
But it is really a kind of, I guess, mixed
bag.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:36.779
But at this point everyone's incentives are
all lined up, so it's good.

00:27:36.779 --> 00:27:37.779
Go ahead.

00:27:37.779 --> 00:27:39.090
&gt;&gt;female #1: Ok.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:44.730
Yeah, I just sort of wanted to know maybe
what was next and what you were thinking about,

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:49.590
like what your goal was for the book or how
you, how you kind of came about making a book

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:53.269
out of this experience, which I mean it definitely
seems like not necessarily your traditional

00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:56.669
book, but where do you see, what's sort of
next on the horizon?

00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:59.619
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: So should I talk about
the book and you talk about what's next?

00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:00.960
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: Ok.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:06.840
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Yeah, so the book came
out of actually a friend of ours who had helped

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:12.789
out at Mission Street Food many times is the,
is an editor at McSweeney's and he really

00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:18.820
let us make any kind of cookbook we wanted
and so it did seem like just an outgrowth

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:23.739
of the Mission Street Food project of kind
of purposefully getting in over your head

00:28:23.739 --> 00:28:27.490
and making things up as you go along.

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:33.139
So that was, that was fun and I think also
the restaurant, because it was so weird, kind

00:28:33.139 --> 00:28:38.460
of raised questions that we wanted to address
more fully, so some of those essays, like

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:45.879
the Blogstaurant, are a way of addressing
the things like, what is a restaurant anyway?

00:28:45.879 --> 00:28:48.789
And in terms of actual next businesses.

00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:55.869
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: Well, it's also worth noting
that there's some kind of silly, silliness

00:28:55.869 --> 00:29:01.330
to start the book in the form of kind of a
fake business plan.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:05.600
Which is like we never had a business plan
because things were, things kind of just grew

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.840
organically.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:12.750
And then at the end there's kind of a, an
almost like manifesto of how to become a celebrity

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:18.230
chef, which is I think a little bit poking
fun also at kind of like celebrity chefhood

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:19.370
and stuff.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:25.429
And I think we just wanted to write that kind
of stuff for fun.

00:29:25.429 --> 00:29:34.119
As far as what's next, I am really heavily
involved at Mission Chinese Food, Karen, to

00:29:34.119 --> 00:29:42.029
a slightly less extent these days, but then
we I guess will be doing the food program

00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:45.559
at a bowling alley which will be opening in
the Mission soon.

00:29:45.559 --> 00:29:55.440
It'll be located on 17th Street I guess near
between Shotwell and Van Ness and so we're

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.529
kind of just getting ready for that.

00:29:57.529 --> 00:30:04.080
It figures to be technique driven comfort
food and you know I guess we're hoping to

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:10.230
actually make it a little bit technical and
not just put like truffle oil in macaroni

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:11.539
and cheese and stuff.

00:30:11.539 --> 00:30:18.211
&gt;&gt;female #2: I was wondering about when you
guys design the menu at Mission Chinese, how

00:30:18.211 --> 00:30:23.799
you kind of figure out how to balance authentic
Chinese dishes versus new technique and like

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:27.470
the thrice-cooked vegan bacon, how you even
think of something like that, so kind of your

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:33.610
approach to the design and where you want
to draw the line between authenticity and

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:34.610
creativity.

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:35.610
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Yeah, well, I think there's
no system.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:36.639
That's the main thing.

00:30:36.639 --> 00:30:38.600
That's sort of how we always roll.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:44.950
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: So Danny is the chef at Mission
Chinese Food, so at the very beginning he

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:48.760
and I worked like pretty closely on the menu.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:55.879
But he has since taken over and I think the
food has gotten a lot better, but we you know

00:30:55.879 --> 00:31:00.370
mostly he just has an idea and we kind of
work things out.

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:10.200
I think what, what the menu speaks towards
is definitely a complete disregard of authenticity.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:17.409
Like we're happy to kind of evoke certain
dishes or resonate certain dishes or flavor

00:31:17.409 --> 00:31:24.019
combinations that that people know and like,
but in a lot of ways I think that we use kind

00:31:24.019 --> 00:31:29.629
of like techniques that we've learned in fine
dining, or even from other cultures.

00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:37.030
Like Danny is an accomplished like sushi chef
and he's worked in Italian restaurants, I

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.030
think.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:43.330
In, as of a couple of years ago, he was the
reigning world champion of pesto.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:51.960
So I mean basically it's kind of like a different
kind of fusion where instead of just doing

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:59.879
like you know mango salsa or like different
ingredients, it's almost sort of like integrating

00:31:59.879 --> 00:32:05.830
techniques and approaches from I guess from
other cultures so like a more coherent fusion

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.679
if if you will.

00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:13.450
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: I think I've seen online
people debating whether it's like right to

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:18.539
use names like Hai nam Chicken Rice for something
that doesn't look like Hai nam Chicken Rice

00:32:18.539 --> 00:32:27.359
in China and our feeling is basically like
it's more like modern art where you can use

00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:32.210
a name to allude to a tradition and then break
away from it.

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:39.320
It doesn't have to be strict or kind of traditional
and in some ways it's more fun that way, more

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.250
individual.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:48.659
It seems like you can get authentic food in
other places but you can't get like Danny's

00:32:48.659 --> 00:32:55.110
intensely personal vision anywhere else, so
I guess we're not too concerned about authenticity.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:33:00.600
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: Actually just really quick
on the note of Hai nam Chicken Rice, that

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.539
was funny because there was a website called
Chow Hound and there were like, there was

00:33:04.539 --> 00:33:09.090
a long thread debating the Hai nam Chicken
Rice.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:13.779
And I mean for us it was hilarious because
there were like 80 posts where people were

00:33:13.779 --> 00:33:18.590
like just really saying harsh things and some
people were defending it.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:25.390
And I mean for us it's like a almost like
an afterthought, like it's a cheap dish, that's

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:26.390
like seven dollars.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:34.139
And you know if, if Danny wanted to make perfect
Hai nam Chicken Rice he, he easily could do

00:33:34.139 --> 00:33:35.139
that.

00:33:35.139 --> 00:33:37.390
But we just can't, given the circumstances
and different things.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:45.220
So I guess going back to the question, a lot
of like what determines these choices in a

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:52.679
kitchen or menus and stuff is just the resources
available and like kind of the, the capitalist

00:33:52.679 --> 00:33:56.390
aspects or the physical aspects, like the
practicalities.

00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:02.110
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: And then we all went to
China together this summer and we had Hai

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:05.130
nam Chicken Rice and I definitely prefer Danny's

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.130
[laughter]

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:11.850
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: And I mean I know that
I don't have a lot of credibility, but on

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:16.150
the other hand if you like eating it, what's
so wrong with that, you know?

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.000
But people can get very worked up about it.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.060
&gt;&gt;female #3: That's close to what I was going
to ask.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:27.150
The restaurant was closed over the holidays
because I understand everybody went back to

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.150
China.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:33.419
Was it, did you both go on that trip and can
you talk a little bit about the experience?

00:34:33.419 --> 00:34:36.960
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Yeah, you can.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:44.510
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: So we went to China where
the owners live, it's actually in a small

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:49.140
town called Lung Shan and them.

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:56.400
We went there with the owners and their children
and a few of the cooks and the children were

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.730
the only Americans anyone in that town had
ever seen before us.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:06.370
So I think that makes Karen the only Caucasian
to ever visit Lung Shan proper.

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:14.940
But it was a, I think, a great cultural experience
for us because they kind of came back in style

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:22.750
with a lot of, well I guess it's almost like
a family reunion when they go back, and so

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.190
the owner's brothers live nearby.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:30.150
So they all kind of came back from different
areas and they had a big banquet kind of in

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:39.180
the town square and they bought hundreds of
dollars of extremely dangerous fireworks and

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.370
kind of launched all these things and it was,
it was pretty exciting.

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:47.980
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Yeah, it was, it was really
wonderful for us to see where they came from.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:55.000
This was the man's hometown and his mother
was in her 80s and about this tall and held

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.850
my hand through the whole fireworks situation.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:00.760
We were both a little freaked out.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:05.000
And it was also interesting in terms of food,
because you know a lot of times in California

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.470
people talk about local and sustainable and
so forth, but when we arrived in the town,

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:19.700
they all went in to the garden and you know
grabbed some chickens and picked a lot of

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:25.470
vegetables and actually jumped in the pond
and fished for that night's dinner.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:30.880
I mean it was as local as possible, it was
about ten feet away from where we ate.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.740
And their whole method of fishing was pretty
interesting because two brothers would get

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:40.020
in the pond and two brothers were on the side
and they had this giant net and they hit the

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:46.250
water so that the fish would jump into the
net and it felt like we could have been in

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:48.960
any year in the last thousand years.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:56.570
You know it was so I don't know it was a completely
different world from where we were normally

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:57.690
cooking together.

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:03.400
And then we ate out on this courtyard and
everybody sort of cleaned up together and

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:07.140
it was, it was really amazing.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:12.450
And I think it made some of the tensions that
we might feel in the restaurant a little bit

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:15.680
muted, just to see where they were coming
from.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.680
Christine?

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:24.690
&gt;&gt;Female #4: I wanted to talk about the charitable
aspect of everything that you guys are doing.

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:28.870
How difficult is it first of all, how sustainable
is that to make that commitment to charitable

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:36.280
giving and additionally do you see that sort
of model progressing?

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:41.160
Like do you see other restaurants kind of
moving to that, do you see any kind of trend

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.160
in that?

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.910
And where might, where in other cities might
we see that sort of thing?

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.020
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: I'll just say a little.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:52.100
So when we first started Mission Street Food,
we took a small salary for ourselves, I think

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:59.240
we each took $400 a week and then everything
that we made beyond that we gave to charities

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.530
that fed the hungry.

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:06.340
These days Mission Chinese Food has really
focused on the food bank because as we got

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:11.760
to know more about the food delivery system
in the city we saw that as really the most

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.720
efficient way to make a difference.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.770
So 75 cents from every entrée at Mission
Chinese Food goes to the food bank.

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:26.330
And then at our other restaurant, Commonwealth,
$10 from every tasting menu goes to a charity,

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:29.800
and that rotates every month in a kind of
haphazard way.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:33.870
It'll be different issues, not necessarily
hunger.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:42.590
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: Well so I guess charitable
restaurants is sort of what got me into the

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:47.570
food business to begin with and I had always
imagined trying to open a place that was kind

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:54.280
of like completely scalable like Chipotle
or something but just with a small charitable

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.280
aspect.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:03.150
And when Mission Street Food started to become
very popular, we basically just thought why

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:09.240
not start now, so it was never our intention
really to do it that way, but things just

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.500
kind of progressed that way.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:20.220
And I guess as far as sustainability, I mean
so far it feels sustainable.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:26.600
It's hard to say whether the charity actually
drives business or whether it like creates

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:34.120
a predisposition for, you know, like a customer
to be like more receptive to it or not, but,

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:42.970
you know, so far I guess since those restaurants
have opened like just over a year ago in total

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:49.480
I think the two have raised over $100,000
for charity, so that I think there's like

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:54.190
a lot of room for you know sustainability
there.

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:57.780
&gt;&gt;female #5: Thank you guys for making the
trek down to Google

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.150
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Oh, our pleasure.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.800
&gt;&gt;female #5: during rush hour nonetheless.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.620
Can you talk about your inspiration or where
did you learn how to cook?

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.940
Where did this all come from?

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:15.110
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: I guess I probably first
sort of learned how to cook growing up just

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:21.460
'cause both my parents worked and my grandmother
lived with us.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:27.600
And she didn't speak English very well, so
she watched a lot of cooking shows and I kind

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.320
of just watched them with her.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:38.300
And I guess since then my first fine dining
job was at a restaurant in the Mission called

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.300
Bar Tartine.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:45.140
And they went through a lot of different chefs
early on, but then they kind of settled on

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.750
a really great chef named Jason Fox.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:53.800
And I feel like I learned a lot from various
people, but I probably learned the most from

00:40:53.800 --> 00:41:01.600
him and then also a lot from Danny Bowien,
who I work really closely with now.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:09.290
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Yeah, I think that cooking
school is overrated and so if anyone you know

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:12.400
is considering going, tell them not to.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.260
Yeah, Chris.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:19.820
&gt;&gt;Announcer/Chris: Thanks again for coming,
so on the one hand you guys embrace a lot

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:24.850
of sort of internet things like blogging and
Twitter and that sort of thing, but on the

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:29.510
other you're working with McSweeney's, whose
food writing of late has been this not so

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:35.830
much, I guess very offline, very long food
editorials, lots of photos and always on paper,

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:40.710
so in a sense I think it's unfair to call
them Luddites, but they're very much kind

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:43.710
of more traditionalists when it comes to books,
so could you talk a little bit about working

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:48.140
with them and the kind of decisions that led
to doing the book the way you did it?

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.270
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Sure.

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:58.570
You know I think that McSweeney's as a publisher
certainly loves paper, but they're actually

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:03.570
doing some interesting things online as well
and originally we were kind of thinking of

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:08.690
doing something more as an app, and that could
still happen.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:15.290
I think that cookbooks are definitely ripe
for that kind of innovation.

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:21.410
A lot of what we were doing was trying to
break out of the mold of traditional cookbooks,

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:27.650
so there's a kind of tradition or even cliché
of like a little headnote that says "I was

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:32.330
traveling in Portugal and I met an old woman
and she taught me this sauce" or something

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:38.220
and then the recipe and then a finished dish
photo and we definitely didn't want to do

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.220
that.

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:44.480
So a lot of our finished dish photos are almost
like jokes about finished dish photos.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:50.020
Like the pork belly dish is sitting on top
of a stack of diet books.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:56.490
[chuckles] Just because we sort of didn't
want to do it that way and McSweeney's definitely

00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:00.000
encouraged us to do that.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.970
I think what they want to do in general is
sort of push the boundaries of genres whatever

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:11.680
that is and so they do really interesting
things with paper to show how far you can

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.230
go with paper and I think that there's something
similar with the cookbooks.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:22.900
They're also, their offices are located kind
of around the corner from Mission Street Food,

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.430
so it was also just extremely convenient.

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:26.570
[pause]

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:34.870
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: To me also I feel like I've
read a lot of cookbooks and the part that's

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:41.210
the most interesting, just for me personally,
is like learning more about the people or

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:44.200
whatever like the story of the place.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:49.790
I mean certainly sometimes I really want the
recipe or whatever, but these days you can

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:52.290
pretty much like find every recipe online
anyway.

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:53.790
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Right.

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:56.940
So we emphasized the narrative a bit more.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:57.940
Yeah.

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:03.270
&gt;&gt;female #6: What is your favorite restaurant
in San Francisco besides your own and your

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:05.530
favorite dish at Mission Chinese?

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:10.450
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: What's our favorite restaurant?

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:20.790
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: Well, we have a lot of like
budget favorites, but I think currently my

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:28.660
favorite restaurant that I'm not involved
in at all is Atelier Crenn, I think the chef

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:37.130
there is really going for it you know in an
extremely elaborate and fanciful way that

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:45.890
I think some people think is kind of silly
or extraneous and I think is like very worthwhile

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:50.010
even though it's somewhat extraneous, but
the food is also really delicious.

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:57.570
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: We went there once, it
was definitely expensive, but very comfortable

00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:02.880
as an experience, the, it's one of those things
where the service is so good that it stops

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:09.930
being formal and starts being relaxed in a
way like everyone sort of anticipating your

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:17.380
needs perfectly, but the food was as Anthony
said a bit fanciful, but kind of delightful,

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:23.170
like you almost felt like you wanted to laugh
when you put it in your mouth.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:27.060
So it's a little bit embarrassing to say that
you know this restaurant that we've only been

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:32.040
to once is our favorite restaurant, but that
definitely made a big impression.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:43.180
We also, we live in the Mission, and we eat
a lot of burritos and I guess [giggles] we

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:49.830
also tend to like going to places where we're
friends with the chef and so this process

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:55.500
of having guest chefs was great because you
can go and people you know you worked with

00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:00.140
them and then they are very nice when you
come in.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:01.140
[laughing]

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.140
[pause]

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.450
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: I guess also Vietnamese food.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:04.480
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Yeah.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.520
&gt;&gt;female #7: Where?

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.550
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Where?

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:08.280
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: I don't know.

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.660
I like a place in the Sunset called PPQ.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:15.750
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: On Irving near 19th.

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:20.520
We also go to the Tenderloin for, at Turtle
Tower a lot.

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:26.820
They have a new outlet in Soma, which is kind
of exciting.

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.820
[pause]

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:35.030
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: And I eat the food at Mission
Chinese Food far too often, so my favorites

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:37.120
vary from day to day.

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:41.160
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: I feel like we're always
most excited about whatever is new.

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:46.380
Like the new thing comes on and I'll eat that
kind of without cease until the next thing

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:47.380
comes.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:59.540
But I think that probably the thrice-cooked
bacon might be my standby or the tiger salad.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:02.790
[pause] But in normal life I think we spend
a lot of time trying to eat vegetables just

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:04.720
to catch up.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.070
[laughter]

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:08.940
&gt;&gt;Announcer/Chris: So yeah, I guess we're
at time.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:09.940
Thanks again for coming.

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:10.940
&gt;&gt;Karen Leibowitz: Thank you.

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:11.940
&gt;&gt;Anthony Myint: Thanks.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:11.941
[applause]
