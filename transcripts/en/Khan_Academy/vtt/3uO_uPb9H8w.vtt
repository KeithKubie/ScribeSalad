00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.310
Let's solve another 2nd order
linear homogeneous

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.880
differential equation.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.050
And this one-- well, I won't
give you the details before I

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:09.760
actually write it down.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.750
So the differential equation is
4 times the 2nd derivative

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.160
of y with respect to x, minus
8 times the 1st derivative,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.540
plus 3 times the function
times y, is equal to 0.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.600
And we have our initial
conditions y of

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.490
0 is equal to 2.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:40.750
And we have y prime of
0 is equal to 1/2.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.710
Now I could go into the whole
thing y is equal to e to the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.790
rx is a solution, substitute
it in, then factor out e to

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.050
the rx, and have the
characteristic equation.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.530
And if you want to see all of
that over again, you might

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.550
want to watch the previous
video, just to see where that

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.320
characteristic equation
comes from.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.730
But in this video, I'm just
going to show you, literally,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.970
how quickly you can do these
type of problems mechanically.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.710
So if this is our original
differential equation, the

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.020
characteristic equation is going
to be-- and I'll do this

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:20.900
in a different color-- 4r
squared minus 8r plus 3r is

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.370
equal to 0.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.220
And watch the previous video if
you don't know where this

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.940
characteristic equation
comes from.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.340
But if you want to do these
problems really quick, you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.780
just substitute the 2nd
derivatives with an r squared,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.100
the first derivatives with an
r, and then the function

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.790
with-- oh sorry, no.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.330
This is supposed to
be a constant--

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.820
And then the coefficient on the
original function is just

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.830
a constant, right?

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.240
I think you see what I did.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.370
2nd derivative r squared.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.020
1st derivative r.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.100
No derivative-- you could say
that's r to the 0, or just 1.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.640
But this is our characteristic
equation.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.210
And now we can just figure
out its roots.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.980
This is not a trivial one for
me to factor so, if it's not

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.810
trivial, you can just use
the quadratic equation.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.690
So we could say the solution
of this is r is equal to

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.050
negative b-- b is negative 8, so
it's positive 8-- 8 plus or

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.630
minus the square root
of b squared.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.310
So that's 64, minus 4
times a which is 4,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.960
times c which is 3.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.850
All of that over 2a.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.810
2 times 4 is 8.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.530
That equals 8 plus or minus
square root of 64 minus--

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.250
what's 16 times 3-- minus 48.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.230
All of that over 8.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.430
What's 64 minus 48?

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.550
Let's see, it's 16, right?

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.880
Right.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.850
10 plus 48 is 58, then
another-- so it's 16.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.600
So we have r is equal to 8 plus
or minus the square root

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:13.020
of 16, over 8, is equal to
8 plus or minus 4 over 8.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.140
That equals 1 plus
or minus 1/2.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.060
So the two solutions of this
characteristic equation--

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.060
ignore that, let me scratch that
out in black so you know

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.990
that's not like a 30 or
something-- the two solutions

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.150
of this characteristic equation
are r is equal to--

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.220
well 1 plus 1/2 is equal to
3/2-- and r is equal to 1

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.590
minus 1/2, is equal to 1/2.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.380
So we know our two r's, and we
know that, from previous

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.445
experience in the last video,
that y is equal to c times e

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:51.160
to the rx is a solution.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.880
So the general solution of this
differential equation is

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.360
y is equal to c1 times e-- let's
use our first r-- e to

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.280
the 3/2 x, plus c2 times
e to the 1/2 x.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.290
This differential equations
problem was literally just a

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.209
problem in using the
quadratic equation.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.839
And once you figure out
the r's you have

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:20.980
your general solution.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.600
And now we just have to use
our initial conditions.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.630
So to know the initial
conditions, we need to know y

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.780
of x, and we need to
know y prime of x.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.720
Let's just do that right now.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.720
So what's y prime?

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.860
y prime of our general solution
is equal to 3/2 times

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:43.660
c1 e to the 3/2 x, plus--
derivative of the inside-- 1/2

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.730
times c2 e to the 1/2 x.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.930
And now let's use our actual
initial conditions.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.940
I don't want to lose them-- let
me rewrite them down here

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.860
so I can scroll down.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.345
So we know that y of 0 is equal
to 2, and y prime of 0

00:05:00.345 --> 00:05:02.690
is equal to 1/2.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.110
Those are our initial
conditions.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.480
So let's use that information.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.240
So y of 0-- what happens
when you substitute x

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.140
is equal to 0 here.?

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.530
You get c1 times e to the 0,
essentially, so that's just 1,

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.010
plus c2-- well that's just e to
the 0 again, because x is

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.070
0-- is equal to-- so this is,
when x is equal to 0, what is

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.780
y? y is equal to 2.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.150
Y of 0 is equal to 2.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.180
And then let's use the
second equation.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.930
So when we substitute x is equal
to 0 in the derivative--

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:45.740
so when x is 0 we get 3/2 c1--
this goes to 1 again-- plus

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:53.116
1/2 c2-- this is 1 again, e to
the 1/2 half times 0 is e to

00:05:53.116 --> 00:05:58.110
the 0, which is 1-- is equal
to-- so when x is 0 for the

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.080
derivative, y is equal to 1/2,
or the derivative is 1/2 at

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.230
that point, or the slope
is 1/2 at that point.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:09.680
And now we have two equations
and two unknowns, and we could

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.630
solve it a ton of ways.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.730
I think you know how
to solve them.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.060
Let's multiply the top
equation-- I don't know--

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.360
let's multiply it by 3/2,
and what do we get?

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.800
We get-- I'll do it in a
different color-- we get 3/2

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:37.970
c1 plus 3/2 c2 is equal to--
what's 3/2 times 2?

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.490
It's equal to 3.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.810
And now, let's subtract-- well,
I don't want to confuse

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.780
you, so let's just subtract the
bottom from the top, so

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.050
this cancels out.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.140
What's 1/2 minus 3/2?

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.810
1/2 minus 1 and 1/2.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.940
Well, that's just
minus 1, right?

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:02.970
So minus c2 is equal to--
what's 1/2 minus 3?

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.570
It's minus 2 and 1/2,
or minus 5/2.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.040
And so we get c2 is
equal to 5/2.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.570
And we can substitute back
in this top equation.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:23.570
c1 plus 5/2 is equal to 2, or c1
is equal to 2, which is the

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:30.380
same thing as 4/2, minus 5/2,
which is equal to minus 1/2.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.110
And now we can just substitute
c1 and c2 back into our

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.720
general solution and we have
found the particular solution

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:44.790
of this differential equation,
which is y is equal to c1-- c1

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:58.320
is minus 1/2-- minus 1/2 e to
the 3/2 x plus c2-- c2 is

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:10.920
5/2-- plus c2, which is 5/2, e
to the 1/2 x, and we are done.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.600
And it might seem
really fancy.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.770
We're solving a differential
equation.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.080
Our solution has e in it.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.670
We're taking derivatives
and we're doing

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.070
all sorts of things.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:24.660
But really the meat of this
problem was solving a

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.360
quadratic, which was our
characteristic equation.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.650
And watch the previous video
just to see why this

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.180
characteristic equation works.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.230
But it's very easy to come up
with the characteristic

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.039
equation, right?

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.770
I think you obviously see that
y prime turns into r squared,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.620
y prime turns into r, and then
y just turns into 1,

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.840
essentially.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.600
So you solve a quadratic.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.750
And then after doing that,
you just have to take one

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.880
derivative-- because after
solving the quadratic, you

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.410
immediately have the general
solution-- then you take its

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.410
derivative, use your
initial conditions.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.040
You have a system of linear
equations which is Algebra I.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.030
And then you solve them for the
two constants, c1 and c2,

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.680
and you end up with your
particular solution.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.950
And that's all there is to it.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.800
I will see you in
the next video.
