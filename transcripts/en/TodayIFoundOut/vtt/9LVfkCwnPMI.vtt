00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.549
Roald Dahl and James Bond... and 7 other Amazing
Facts

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:05.549
1.

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.169
Famed sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer was
once a sniper of the Israeli Defense Force.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:14.519
She was also a survivor of the holocaust,
but unfortunately the rest of her family was

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.519
killed.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.410
Dr. Ruth had this to say about her sniping
days: “When I was in my routine training

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.939
for the Israeli army as a teenager, they discovered
completely by chance that I was a lethal sniper.

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.300
I could hit the target smack in the center
further away than anyone could believe.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.300
Not just that, even though I was tiny and
not even much of an athlete, I was incredibly

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.649
accurate throwing hand grenades too.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.030
Even today I can load a Sten automatic rifle
in a single minute, blindfolded.”

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.260
(QF 696)

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.260
2.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.690
While many people fear flying, nobody seems
to fear sleeping in a bed.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.300
Yet in 2013, according to The Aviation Safety
Network, only 265 people around the world

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.090
who traveled via a commercial airplane holding
14 or more passengers lost their lives because

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.829
of a plane crash (out of about 31 million
flights), while in the United States alone,

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.800
according to the Center for Disease Control,
falling out of bed accounts for about 450

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.660
deaths, 400,000 hospital admissions, and 1.8
million emergency room visits each year.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.660
(QF 695)

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.660
3.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.440
While most people connect historical African
slave trade almost exclusively with the United

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.710
States, the truth is that the U.S. was third
in this sad statistic, importing about 400,000

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.710
slaves.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.850
Jamaica rang in at over a million and nearly
5 million went to Brazil.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.850
(QF 690)

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.850
4.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.580
While you know Roald Dahl for his best-selling
children’s books such as Charlie and the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.960
Chocolate Factory, Matilda, and James &amp; the
Giant Peach, you may not know that he also

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.800
wrote one of the most famous Bond films, You
Only Live Twice (1967).

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.980
(QF 688)

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.980
5.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.770
The largest employer in the world is the United
States Department of Defense with a little

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.600
over 3.2 million employees.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.970
Next up is the People’s Republic of China
with 2.3 million employees, then Walmart with

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:56.980
2.1 million…

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.990
(QF 680)

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.990
6.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.321
In 1990, Chuck Norris became the first Westerner
in history to be awarded an 8th degree Black

00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:06.170
Belt (Grand Master) in Taekwondo.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.649
In his life, he’s also achieved the rankings
of 10th degree black belt in Chun Kuk Do;

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.209
9th degree black belt in Tang Soo Do; and
black belts in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Judo.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.269
Apparently some rumors about Chuck’s supposed
superpowers might be true after all.

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.269
(QF 676)

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.269
7.

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.870
The record for the woman who’s had sex with
the most men in 24 hours is currently held

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.780
by adult film actress Lisa Sparks, who had
sex with 919 men in just under 12 hours on

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.049
October 16, 2004 at the Eroticon in Poland.

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.340
Given this, you might be surprised to learn
she’s been happily married to the same man

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.849
for over 18 years now, getting married when
she was 18 and he 20.

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:46.849
(QF 659)

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:47.849
8.

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.849
The two women behind “Ask Ann Landers”
and “Dear Abbey” were feuding twin sisters-

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.690
Esther Lederer and Pauline Phillips respectively.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.670
The source of their dispute was reportedly
the fact that after Esther took over the Ann

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.480
Landers column in 1955 (with the original
writer being Ruth Crowley from 1943-1955),

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.900
Pauline decided to start up her own competing
column with the same theme, “Dear Abby”.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:20.860
However, they supposedly settled their differences
shortly before Esther died in 2002.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:28.519
(QF 657)
