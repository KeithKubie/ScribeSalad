1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,540
Okay.
The Gospel of Matthew

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,490
from the second century on has been
pretty much the most popular famous of the

3
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:11,784
Gospels.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,110
That's probably why it's first in our
Bible simply because it was the most

5
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:18,390
popular,
the most popular.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,700
It certainly the gospel that's
most familiar to people nowadays.

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,750
And uh,

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,450
pretty much throughout history of people
were familiar with the text at all,

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,260
both Christians and non Christians often.
So for example,

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,970
you have the familiar birth story.
Joseph has a dream. He's warned,

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,960
uh, the star appears in
the east, the mad jai,

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,510
the wise men come and they go to
Herod first. This is not, yes,

13
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,350
this is Herod the Great.

14
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:46,350
So they're going to Herod the Great's
palace in Jerusalem and they say,

15
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:49,410
where do we find this new king that's
been born because we want to go and

16
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:50,580
worship him and bring him gifts.

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,450
Inherited gets all worried because he
doesn't want to lose his own throne.

18
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,180
So I remember this story.
He tells the Weizmann, well,

19
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,640
I think you have to go to
Bethlehem. He gets his, his uh,

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,950
Wiseman who's own Wiseman,
they look it up in the scriptures.

21
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:05,330
They say go to Bethlehem, but he's
come back and tell me once you visited,

22
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,080
because I want to go worship him too.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,490
And the wicked evil king does not want
to go worship Jesus, the baby Jesus.

24
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:13,620
He wants to go kill the baby.
Jesus.

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,320
The wise men are warned in a dream not
to go back. Do you know the story? Right?

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,350
The whole thing about that.
The Egyptian sojourn,

27
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:23,130
the holy family goes to Egypt
to escape the wicked king.

28
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,680
The slaughter of the innocence,
uh,

29
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,540
the beatitudes blessing are the poor
in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,030
Heaven. Blessed are those who
mourn for they will be comforted.

31
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,050
Blessed are the meek for they will
inherit the earth. All these blessings,

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,540
there are some in Luke,
but if you,

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,400
if you start saying them and somebody
starts picking it up after you and repeats

34
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:46,110
it and they shows that they
at least know it enough to,

35
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:47,640
they can kind of finish
one every now and then,

36
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,380
they almost always finish it in the
Matthew form, not the Luke form.

37
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,580
The be attitudes are slightly different
in Matthew and Luke and people are,

38
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,180
they're famous in their methy
inform, uh, turn the other cheek.

39
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,060
That's also in Luke six 29,

40
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,470
but most people know it from
Matthew Five 39 in Matthew,

41
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:11,550
the Pharisees are called over and
over again, hypocrites. And in fact,

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,200
if you look up the word Pharisee in
a dictionary in English dictionary,

43
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,700
hypocrite will be one of the definitions
you, you'll find for it. Now,

44
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:25,440
this is all part of this is long,
long tradition of Christian antisemitism.

45
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,490
Because of course the word Pharisee
doesn't mean hypocrite to most Jews,

46
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,050
the WHO trace back rabbinic Judaism to
the priest, 70 pharisees themselves.

47
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:39,060
Gamaliel in book of acts is considered
a pharisee and he's a famous rabbi in

48
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:43,890
rabbinic materials. So Jews don't think
of the word Pharisee as being a bad term,

49
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,120
but in a lot of English and
a lot of languages, it is
because Christians used it.

50
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:51,150
They took it straight out of Matthew
where the Pharisees are called hypocrites

51
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:54,210
over and over again, and they just
take that into their own language.

52
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,260
And then you have the Great Commission
that ends the Gospel of Matthew that

53
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:00,340
people might recognize.

54
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,490
Matthew 28 18 Jesus meets the
disciples in Galilee after his,

55
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,780
after his resurrection,
and he says,

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,480
all authority in Heaven and
on earth has been given to me.

57
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,970
Go therefore and make
disciples of all nations,

58
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,450
baptizing them in the name of the father
and of the son and the Holy Spirit and

59
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:22,150
teaching them to obey everything that
I've commanded you. And remember,

60
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:24,790
I am with you always
to the end of the ages.

61
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,020
So that's a very famous verse that is
called the Great Commission because this

62
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,570
is Jesus telling his disciples
after his resurrection,

63
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,980
go out and proclaim the gospel throughout
the earth, not just to the Jews.

64
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,900
So all these things make Matthew look
very familiar even to people who may not

65
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:45,040
know much about Christianity because this
stuff that you see in our culture over

66
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,900
again,
Matthew,

67
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:50,200
therefore is in at the same
time a unfamiliar to people.

68
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:55,201
If they start reading it carefully because
it's the most Jewish of the Christian

69
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,490
Gospels and the Gospel and
that are in the Canon. That is,

70
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:01,000
there are some other gospels from the
ancient period that are even more Jewish

71
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:04,660
than Matthew. Uh, but they didn't
make it into the new testament.

72
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,010
It's the most Jewish,
and yet it's also at the same time,

73
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:12,970
one of the most universals of the
gospels because you've precisely have an

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,990
ending with Jesus commanded the apostles
to make disciples of all nations.

75
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:20,320
That is all the gentiles too. So
Jesus, in the gospel of Matthew,

76
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,460
Jesus limits his ministry during
his lifetime, pretty much to Israel.

77
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,780
He's going to Jews and he makes this a
point of this and the gospel of Matthew.

78
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,900
But after his resurrection,
then the message is supposed to go out.

79
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,073
Okay.

80
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,440
So look also at the way that
Matthew begins, I talked about this,

81
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:39,820
the very first lecture of class.

82
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,770
Matthew begins with the book
of the Genesis of Jesus Christ,

83
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,110
son of David,
son of Abraham.

84
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,830
So notice he calls him son of David as a
descendant of the great king of Israel.

85
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,210
Son of Abraham is the father of the Jews.
And even the word, the Greek word there,

86
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,880
the book of the Genesis,
the genesis means the beginning.

87
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,740
And of course it's the Greek term that
was given for the first book of the

88
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,660
Hebrew Bible when the, when they
translated the Hebrew Bible in degree,

89
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,550
genesis just means the beginning,

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,180
of course in the Hebrew
Bible is the beginning of the
world, beginning of earth,

91
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:11,020
the beginning of history.

92
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,090
Matthew appropriates that term and he
begins his own text with that same word,

93
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,590
probably meaningful his readers to
recall the book of Genesis in a way.

94
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,750
And then you have what you,
what we call an Aga da on Moses.

95
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,910
The Term Aga is used in
rabbinic scholarship.

96
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,173
Okay.

97
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,020
Rabbinics, uh, work often divides up
a lot of event materials into Halakha.

98
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,670
And Aga Halaqah refers to the teachings
that are about how you should live.

99
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,370
A Aga though are stories that are about
the patriarchy and great figures and

100
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:58,180
they're meant to, to make a moral
lesson or something like, but uh, they,

101
00:05:58,181 --> 00:06:00,830
they don't give straightforward teachings.
They tell stories.

102
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,570
And that's how Matthew starts out.

103
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,220
All that stuff about the bay evil king
wanting to kill the baby Jesus because

104
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:09,720
he's afraid that it'll be a threat to him.
Uh,

105
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,430
people think of who does that
remind you of? Who does that
sound like? Uh, the, the,

106
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,110
the child that comes out of Egypt,
who does that sound like?

107
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,710
These are all meant to remind
you of Moses. And so Moses,

108
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,480
Jesus is portrayed over and over again
like Moses are like Joseph also from the

109
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,640
Hebrew Bible.
And then again,

110
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:31,670
you have the fulfillment
of scripture motif.

111
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:37,390
Now notice that in spite of the fact
though that Mo Matthew has throughout

112
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:43,511
Christianity been interpreted as
actually a rejection of the law,

113
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,940
the Jewish law,
or it presents Jesus as a new Moses,

114
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:50,840
but Christians so often taken that to
say that Jesus is not only the new Moses

115
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:54,320
who can fulfill his Moses,
he displaces the old Moses.

116
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,980
So Matthew's may have
been put first in the, uh,

117
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,660
Canon because it was read by Christians
as being sort of almost like the new

118
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,550
law,
the new Torah.

119
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,660
And so you have Jesus talking about
the law, the Jewish law Torah,

120
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,400
and also giving New Commandments.

121
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,550
Christian Christians have taken that
to mean the displacement of the Jewish

122
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,980
Torah with now a new Christian Torah.
And that's,

123
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,300
and that that actually then puts
Matthew in a very odd position.

124
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,400
It's the of the different
gospels in our Canon.

125
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,310
It's the most Jewish looking and sounding,

126
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:30,830
and I'll emphasize that
later in the lecture today,

127
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,650
but Matthew has also been the source of
some of the worst Christian antisemitism

128
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,370
precisely by portraying Jesus as rejecting
the law of Moses in much of Christian

129
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,260
interpretation and
substituting his own law.

130
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,850
That's a Christian antisemitism.
A notice it's from, as I said,

131
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:53,240
is from Matthew that you get the idea that
hip, the Pharisees are all hypocrites.

132
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,660
And then that gets transferred to
being that all Jews are hypocrites.

133
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,680
You get the idea in Christianity
traditionally that Jesus rejected the law

134
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:01,760
because that's legalism.

135
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,870
The Jews are all legalistic and we
Christians are awful of grace and truth.

136
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,730
So this idea that,
uh,

137
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,440
that the old testament represents a god
of anger and a god of strictness and a

138
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:16,790
God of judgment and the New Testament
represents a god who's a father and loving

139
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:21,470
and full of grace. So this dualism
that so much part of European history,

140
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:22,340
even common sense,

141
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,940
even people who are not religious will
often come up with this caricature that

142
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:28,160
the Old Testament God is the
god of anger and judgment.

143
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,100
The New Testament God is the god
of grace and forgiveness. Well,

144
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:35,660
that's just not true if you read either
testament with any care at all. But Matt,

145
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,630
the Gospel of Matthew has been one of
the texts. It's been used in this way.

146
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,480
And Remember it's in the gospel of Matthew
the that you get the most anti Jewish

147
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,950
and antisemitic line that's
been used throughout western.

148
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:47,930
His history when the Jews,

149
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,770
when pilot wants to release
Jesus from being crucified,

150
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,780
the people, the Jews say his
blood be upon us and our children,

151
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,310
that became the Christian
charge of Dia side.

152
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,810
The Jews were then accused of killing
God and especially in medieval Europe.

153
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,950
So that Matthew's in this very peculiar
place when it comes to the history of

154
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,420
the interpretation of the New Testament,

155
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,790
it is at the same time the most Jewish
of our canonical gospels in many ways.

156
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,420
And yet it's been used in Christian
antisemitism more than any other gospel,

157
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,930
possibly maybe with the gospel
of John being arrival for that.

158
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,180
So look at the structure of Matthew though
some people have even suggested that

159
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:40,980
Matthew is an intentionally structuring
his gospel to make it look like the

160
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,480
Torah,
the Jewish law,

161
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,340
because there are five speeches
by Jesus in Matthew. These,

162
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,730
these same sayings you learned about
the synoptic problem last week. Uh,

163
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:54,950
if you take a synoptic problem kind of
analysis of a lot of this stuff that are

164
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,450
in some of these speeches and Matthew,
they will, a lot of these sayings,

165
00:09:57,451 --> 00:10:02,451
my occurred in another context and Luke
are in Mark Mathieu seems to have taken

166
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:04,640
tradition mitten materials
that were traditional Tim,

167
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,000
that he found either in written sources or
an oral, uh, literally, uh, oral sources.

168
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,860
And he combines them into five
separate speeches and some people say,

169
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,160
maybe he meant he meant to
reflect the five books of Torah.

170
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,290
The PINTA Tuque is the, is the, uh,
genesis, exodus, Leviticus, numbers.

171
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,900
Deuteronomy Pinot took is just
the Greek word, meaning the five.

172
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,860
So the first five books of Jewish
scripture or called the pentitude,

173
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,050
and maybe Matthew was imitating that
in making five separate speeches for

174
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:38,040
Matthew, for Jesus and his Gospel.
First chapters five through seven,

175
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,250
you have Jesus giving with the
famous sermon on the mount.

176
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,260
Then chapter 10,

177
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,160
you haven't given a speech to his
disciples about the mission to Israel.

178
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,100
So all chapter fraternity is, here's
how you're supposed to do your mission.

179
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:53,640
When you go out to preach Israel, you'll
be persecuted. This will happen. Do this,

180
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:57,750
do that.
Chapter 13 and Matthew is all parables,

181
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,500
the parables that would, you'd find
in different places. In Marker, Luke,

182
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,990
Matthew kind of groups them
into one chapter and had,

183
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:08,010
and has Jesus kind of give it as one sort
of speech. He likes neatness like this.

184
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,330
If you look at chapter 18, it's another
speech by Jesus again to his disciples.

185
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,670
And this one is mainly about church rules.

186
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,630
Jesus talks about when your neighbor
does something that you don't like,

187
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,870
you go to their neighbor first,
try to settle it peaceably.

188
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,030
If you're neighbor won't
receive you or won't settle,

189
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,510
take it to the church and let the church
handled it, you know, that sort of thing.

190
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:31,350
So Jesus is giving instructions
about how the church should be,

191
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,510
should behave itself,
and what the Church would be like.

192
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,780
And then vert chapters 23 through 25,

193
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,840
you get a very long speech by Jesus,

194
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,870
which includes a big synoptic sermon.

195
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,130
Remember last time I talked about mark
13 and about Jesus's prophecies of,

196
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,820
of all this happening, uh, when
the end of time would come in,

197
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:51,300
the Messiah would swoop
down in the clouds.

198
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,180
Matthew takes over that speech
from mark where he finds it.

199
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,780
He adds a lot of materials on his own.
He also brings it up to date.

200
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,340
Cause remember I talked about last time,

201
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,540
mark didn't explicitly tell us about the
destruction of Jerusalem and his gospel.

202
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,340
You'll find that when we
get to Matthew and Luke,

203
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:10,720
they they put more stuff in there that
shows they were writing after the time of

204
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,810
mark and using mark as a source.
So that's all in that chapter.

205
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,810
But then there's all these long
woes to the scribes and Pharisees,

206
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:18,850
woe to the blah, blah,
blah, woe to you do this.

207
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,160
There's a whole section of that speech,

208
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,660
so five different speeches
that some scholars who even
suggested may be designed

209
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,720
to imitate the five
books of the Pentateuch.

210
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,240
But as I said,
the ending of Matthew is universalizing.

211
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,160
It takes this Israelite vision that you've
seen all the way through the book and

212
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:41,140
then university realizes
it to the whole world.

213
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,410
So it's a universalism to all that is
firmly anchored in Judaism and the Torah.

214
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,590
But what does the Torah,
the law mean in Matthew?

215
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,240
Look at five 17 I hope you
did bring your bibles member.

216
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,080
We're all bringing our bibles to class
all the time because you have to check me

217
00:12:59,081 --> 00:12:59,914
out.

218
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,210
Most Christians are taught and most
people just under the influence of

219
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:11,890
Christianity have the idea that what
Christianity is is the super session of

220
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,220
Judaism. The thing that makes
Jews and Christians alike,

221
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,690
they both worship the same God.

222
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,200
One of the things that makes them
different is not only the the worship by

223
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:24,280
Christians of Jesus, but also the
neglect by Christians of the Jewish law.

224
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,780
So Christians can eat shellfish. Bacon,
pork, don't have to keep the sabbath.

225
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,410
Is that the view of the law we find in
Matthew five 17 do not think that I have

226
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:40,630
come to abolish the law or the prophets.
I have come not to abolish,

227
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,960
but to fulfill. For truly, I tell you,

228
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,010
until heaven and earth pass away,
not one letter,

229
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,330
not one stroke of the letter will pass
from the law until all is accomplished.

230
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,220
Now,
in a lot of Christian doctrine,

231
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:58,600
what you're taught is that Jesus did
fulfill the law in his own person,

232
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,160
but that's not what he says here.
Notice until heaven and earth pass away.

233
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,970
That's what he's talking about,
the fulfillment of it. Therefore,

234
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,090
whoever breaks one of the least of these
commandments and teaches others to do

235
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:12,550
the same will be called least
in the Kingdom of heaven.

236
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,270
But whoever does them and teaches them
will be called great in the Kingdom of

237
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,230
Heaven.
For I tell you,

238
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,230
unless your righteousness exceeds
that of the scribes and Pharisees,

239
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,330
you will never enter the Kingdom
of heaven. So Jesus is not saying,

240
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,060
okay, I've come now you don't
have to keep the Jewish law.

241
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,160
He's actually teaching his
own disciples and member.

242
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,700
If Matthew didn't want this as a
message to the members of his church,

243
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:34,990
he wouldn't put it in his gospel.

244
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,830
One of the things that I'm trying to
teach you in my lectures is what does it

245
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:40,870
mean to do an exegesis of this text?

246
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,660
Because you're going to have to write
x Jesus of your own and there's Friday

247
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:46,870
your sexually is, we'll walk you
through how to write an x Jesus paper.

248
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,900
But there are a couple of
things that is not extra Jesus.

249
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,180
It is not exit to try to figure
out what actually happened.

250
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,610
Did Jesus actually say this?
Uh,

251
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,210
Digi is actually believe that that's
part of the historical Jesus quest,

252
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:02,450
which we'll talk about later
on in the semester too. ButX
, Jesus doesn't do that.

253
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,140
Extra juice doesn't assume you're trying
to read the text to get behind the text

254
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:09,980
for something that happened in history,
nor does x, x, Jesus tried to figure out,

255
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:12,710
is this true or not?
It's we don't care if it's true or not.

256
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,190
In an next Jesus class,
what we want to do is what did the writer,

257
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,500
what was the writer trying
to do with this text?

258
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,020
We have to imagine yourself
in an ancient context.

259
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,280
What would he have been saying to members
of his own Christian community in the

260
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:26,114
first century?

261
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,190
So this obviously means that we read this
text is not Jesus necessarily teaching

262
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:33,320
this. We don't know yet where the
judge has actually taught this.

263
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,380
Matthew could have gotten it from some
written source from some oral sores.

264
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,430
I could've just made it up.

265
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,950
We'll talk about that problem later
when we talk about the historical Jesus

266
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,410
right now, we're not going to concern
ourselves. We're just gonna say,

267
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:43,490
Matthew could have written this,

268
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:45,920
but we're trying to figure out what
did Matthew you want to do with it?

269
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,510
Woke this text,
admit to them,

270
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,430
and obviously it means this rider believes
that the proper Gospel and the proper

271
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:56,300
church should be a law abiding church.
He acts,

272
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,250
he's expecting people in his church not
to do away with the Jewish law. Look,

273
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,790
um, at the, uh,

274
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:10,030
antitheses we call these the
Mathian antitheses five 21.

275
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,360
You have heard that it was
said to those of ancient times,

276
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,550
you shall not murder and murder and
whoever murdered shall be liable to

277
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:20,384
judgment.

278
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,650
But I tell you that the time of the
law is over and it's okay to murder.

279
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,990
That's not what it says,
right? What does it say?

280
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,180
Just shout it out.

281
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,423
What?

282
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,580
Don't even be angry.
If you are angry with a brother or sister,

283
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:45,030
you will be liable to judgment. And
if you insult a brother, sister, do,

284
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:48,550
it'd be a lab to the council. If you say,
you fool, you'll be liable to hell. Fire.

285
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,840
A lot of us are in trouble.
A lot of us are in trouble.

286
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,150
He's not saying I'm not. I'm getting
rid of the law murders. Okay, now

287
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,350
keep going. Uh, to the next,

288
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,660
where am I?
Five 27.

289
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,860
You have heard that it was said you
shall not commit adultery. But I say,

290
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:14,520
that's okay. Adultery
just fine. No, he says,

291
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:18,600
but I say to you that everyone who
looks at a woman with lust has already

292
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:21,750
committed adultery with her
in its heart. Wait, what?

293
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,523
MMM,

294
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,510
well, I'm gay, so I'm okay about that.

295
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,070
But a lot of guys are in a lot of trouble.

296
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,740
He's basically saying, no,
not only is adultery not okay,

297
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:42,150
even desiring her if she
belongs to the man is not okay.

298
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,340
That's not getting rid of the law.
Look at five 38.

299
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,150
You have heard it was said an eye
for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

300
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:54,810
But I say do not resist an evil doer. If
anyone's strikes you on the right cheek,

301
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:57,630
turn the other. Also, if anyone
wants to sue you, take your coat.

302
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:00,900
Give your cloak as well. If anyone forces
you to go one mile, go the second mile.

303
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,990
Give it to everyone who begs from you
and you're not refuse anyone who wants to

304
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:04,980
borrow anything from you.

305
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:10,310
These antitheses had been read throughout
Christian history by many people as as

306
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:14,850
implying that Jesus is doing a way with
this bad strict legalism of the Jewish

307
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:19,740
law and he's teaching you a law
of grace instead and forgiveness.

308
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,190
But that's not what's going in here going
on here, right? What Jesus has done,

309
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:26,820
he's not doing away with the law here.
He's intensifying it.

310
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,080
If it's hard not to commit adultery,
and believe me, for a lot of people,

311
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:32,430
it is hard not to commit adultery.

312
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:38,040
It's even harder not to lust if
it's hard not to murder someone.

313
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,070
And if you knew some of the people
who I have to work with around here,

314
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:42,930
you'd know that it is hard
not to murder someone.

315
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,600
It's even harder not
to be angry with them.

316
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,580
And if it's hard not to retaliate,
when someone knocks you down,

317
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,200
it's even harder to let
them knock you down again.

318
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:01,190
Jesus has intensifying the Jewish Torah
and it making it almost impossible to

319
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:04,740
keep, but he's still expecting
his disciples to keep it.

320
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:10,340
So what Matthew presents Jesus is
doing is not getting rid at all of uh,

321
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,840
uh, the Torah, the Jewish law. He's
intensifying it. Now there is one place,

322
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,570
there are a couple of places where
it sounds like Jesus is going again.

323
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:23,160
So when the, you have a hand washing
incident. Okay, let's look at that.

324
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,670
And that's in 15 chapter 15,
verse 17.

325
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,990
[inaudible]

326
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,680
well, I think I have to
start getting a bit. Yeah,

327
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,443
yeah,

328
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,990
yeah.
We start being a little bit earlier.

329
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,650
Where is it? Yeah. The very
first part of the chapter,

330
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,160
the Pharisees scribes come to
Jesus in Jerusalem and said,

331
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,770
why do your disciples break the tradition
of the elders for they do not wash

332
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:05,540
their hands before they eat?
He answered them,

333
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,180
but why do you break the commandment?
And he goes on to this sort of thing.

334
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,840
And he basically says that they're not
keeping the law perfectly themselves.

335
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:15,830
That they should keep it a better.
Verse 10, he said to the crowd,

336
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,120
uh, he called the crowd to
him and said to them, listen,

337
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,550
understand it is not what goes into
the mouth that defiles a person.

338
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,040
It is what comes out of the
mouth that defiles the person.

339
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:29,240
Now in Mark's version of
this story right around here,

340
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,670
mark adds a little sentence.
I remember when I talked about Marquis,

341
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,500
he gives you little clues that you're
really supposed to pay attention and hear

342
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:39,320
mark is a little parents setical
comment. He says, by saying this,

343
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,730
Jesus declared all foods clean.
In other words,

344
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,790
mark does a good little
gentile Christianity move.

345
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,980
He takes this saying of Jesus and he says,
Jesus was declared all foods clean,

346
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:53,740
so we don't have to keep kosher.
Matthew doesn't do that.

347
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:57,700
He saw that sentence in mark, but you
eat this whole chapter, that sentence,

348
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,420
which Matthew News and mark is not
in Matthew. Matthew took that out.

349
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,470
Why? Because he didn't want Matt, uh,

350
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,690
Jesus to declare all foods
clean because in his gospel,

351
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,530
Jesus teaches that Christians have to
continue keeping the law. So he does.

352
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,760
Matthew has Jesus disagree with
the scribes? And Pharisees,

353
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,030
but what he says here is that
it's much more important. Sure.

354
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:20,320
Keeping Kosher may be important,

355
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,410
but it's much more important what's
going on in your heart and your mind.

356
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,020
It's much more important what you say. So
Jesus spiritualizes in a way or, or he,

357
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:31,150
he again, he intensifies the
law and he's saying, yeah,

358
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,940
it's important to wash your hands.
Perhaps that, but that's not a big deal.

359
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:37,450
It's important to pay attention to kosher,
but that's not a big deal.

360
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,560
He makes it a moral lesson that's not anti
Jewish. That's not at all. You kind of,

361
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,590
you have all kinds of Hebrew prophets
in the old testament doing that kind of

362
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:46,720
stuff all over the place
saying things like,

363
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,180
God doesn't want just your sacrifice.
He wants your heart.

364
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,250
This is the way Jesus is it preventative
Matthew is just like a Jewish prophet

365
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:57,700
and Israel like Prophet
whose intensifying the law,

366
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,690
who giving it a moral teaching, but he
never teaches anything about giving it up.

367
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,053
Then also,

368
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,493
mmm,

369
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,890
Jesus.
Though also,

370
00:22:09,891 --> 00:22:14,570
besides being the one who teaches about
Torah and he's being presented as Moses,

371
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,680
a Matthew presents Jesus more than any
other gospels as the founder of the

372
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:20,590
church. In fact, if you,

373
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:23,210
you'd look for the word Church and some
of the gospels is very hard to find it

374
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,290
because it's anachronistic.

375
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:27,320
Jesus didn't go around his own life
talking about the church the church

376
00:22:27,321 --> 00:22:28,550
developed after his death,

377
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,600
but Matthew Retro rejects that
conversation about the church and even the

378
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,140
foundation of the church and sort of
laws about the church into the mouth of

379
00:22:36,141 --> 00:22:36,890
Jesus.

380
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:41,890
Look at chapter 16 verse 17 and this is
one we already read very carefully in

381
00:22:42,651 --> 00:22:43,670
mark the same story.

382
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,893
Yeah.

383
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,200
Remember in Mark Jesus says to the
disciples, who do people say that I am?

384
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,440
And Peter says, well, so
they pitch to some of them,

385
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:56,580
say the Lij or some of them say
one of the profits or something,

386
00:22:56,581 --> 00:22:59,990
say John the Baptist and just said, but
who do you say that I am? And Peter says,

387
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:03,200
you're the Messiah. And
Jesus tells him, be quiet.

388
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,270
And then Jesus rebukes him.

389
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,400
When Peter tells him that he's
not supposed to be crucified.

390
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,020
Matthew takes that story again from mark,
but notice how Matthew changes it.

391
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,940
Uh, verse 13, when Jesus came up in
the district sensory of Philippi,

392
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,190
he asked his disciples,
who do you say that I am?

393
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,050
You get the story again and Jesus. But
when Simon Peter says, you're the Messiah,

394
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:26,990
the son of the living God,
look what Jesus says in verse 17.

395
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,440
Now in Matthew's version, remember
in March version, Jesus said, okay,

396
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:34,340
don't tell anybody. Jesus said
to him, blessed are you Simon,

397
00:23:34,341 --> 00:23:37,340
son of Jonah for flesh and blood
has not revealed this to you,

398
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,870
but my father in heaven and I tell
you, you are Peter. And on this rock,

399
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,530
I will build my church and the
gates of hades will not prevail. It,

400
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,250
I will give you the keys of the Kingdom
of Heaven and whatever you bind on earth

401
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:52,460
will be bound in heaven and whatever you
loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.

402
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,160
Then he started to,
uh,

403
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,030
ordered the disciples not to tell anyone
that he was the messiah. So between the,

404
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,870
the,
the command to silence,

405
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,350
which came right after the
confession in Mark Jesus.

406
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,750
Matthew puts all this
foundation of the church stuff.

407
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,280
Now this is a very famous text that has
caused all kinds of disagreement between

408
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,350
Roman Catholics and Protestants.

409
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,880
Roman Catholics take this text as
teaching that Jesus particularly selected

410
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:21,290
Peter as the first pope. And when he says,
I'm giving you the keys of the kingdom,

411
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:25,580
it means the pope or the Bishop of Rome
is the one who has the right to bind or

412
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:27,680
loose like that Jesus
is talking about here.

413
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,820
Protestants rejected that interpretation
and they said, well, no, he's talking,

414
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:33,100
he's sure he's talking to Peter wants,

415
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,290
but you're really talking to all
the apostles. And in fact the,

416
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:40,850
the issue of binding and Loosing is not,
is given to the apostles, not just Peter.

417
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,220
So there's a debate among
prop between Protestants,

418
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,270
Roman Catholics traditionally
over this, oh, this passage,

419
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,020
I think the debate kind of misses the
point because I think Matthew's point is

420
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:56,000
basically just to have Jesus be the one
who found the church and puts it into

421
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:58,040
the hands of his disciples.
But that's,

422
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,470
that's definitely one of
the thing that Jesus does.

423
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,870
And then in chapter 18 is
I've already pointed out,

424
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:07,460
you have a whole chapter where Jesus
gives rules to the disciples for how the

425
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:09,980
church should be run,
how it should be organized.

426
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:15,560
But the church is also this mixed
group over and over again. Matthew,

427
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,520
you'll have,
uh,

428
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,810
you'll see a phrase that's only in Matthew
where Jesus talks about little ones.

429
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,360
And they also talked about
people have little faith,

430
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,990
but when Matthew also has a parable about
the man goes out and he strose a field

431
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:34,661
with seed and during the night his
enemy comes and so's brambles and weeds,

432
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,990
seeds in. And when it all
comes up, the wheat comes up.

433
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:44,000
But it's all mixed in with brambles
and thorns and weeds. And so the,

434
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,420
the servants, the slaves of the man
come to the master and they say,

435
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,170
what should we do? Should we try to
weed out all the weeds stuff? Uh,

436
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:55,250
and so we can gather the wheat into, try
to trim it all out now. And Master says,

437
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,330
no,
don't worry about it now.

438
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:58,490
Because if you try to pull up
all the thorns and the brambles,

439
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,290
you're bound to pull up
some of the wheat too.

440
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,470
We'll just wait until the
end until it's all ready.

441
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:06,320
And then we'll harvest the whole
thing and then we'll separate it out.

442
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,333
And the wheat,

443
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:10,520
we will keep it in store houses and the
brambles on Darren's will burn in hell.

444
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,550
So you're getting to the last little
hellfire and brimstone sermon at the end.

445
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,920
But the main part of the parable is that
Matthew is saying is that the world and

446
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:23,420
possibly even the church is a mixed
bag. In other words, we're not.

447
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:25,970
Everybody you see around you is
truly who you think they are.

448
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,820
So there are good and there's
evil mixed together, but the,

449
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,920
and you just got to live with that.
So the church is a,

450
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:33,880
is an organization that has uh,
uh,

451
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,890
both people have little faith
and people of greater faith.

452
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,010
It has maybe even weeds and wheat in it.

453
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,010
So these are all concerns of what kind of,

454
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,770
there's a whole group of
parables in chapter 13, uh,

455
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,560
that would call the mixed
group parables of Matthew.

456
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,880
I know their particular to Matthew because
Matthew seems to be making the point

457
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:57,780
with these mixed group parables that the
church itself is sort of a mixed group.

458
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,260
Another important theme of Matthew,

459
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,280
and I'm giving you several different
major things in Matthew cause I'm going to

460
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,870
ask in a moment,
why are these things here?

461
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,390
What does Matthew tried to do with
these different things all together?

462
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,350
So for example,

463
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:15,210
why is is Jesus the law giver and
still Jewish and teaches the tea,

464
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:15,810
the tea,

465
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:20,340
the acceptance of the Jewish law and yet
this universalistic message at the end

466
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:24,210
of the gospel of going to all nations.
Another thing that exit Jesus is,

467
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:29,420
is finding problems in the text and then
using the text itself to try to find

468
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,700
answers to those problems.
That's what exit Jesus does.

469
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,170
So why I'm setting up some of these themes
of Matthew because these are going to

470
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,830
be the problems that then I as the
wonderful scholar and Xeg that I am,

471
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,280
I'm going to swoop in with my angels on
the clouds of Heaven at the end of the

472
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:48,420
lecture and give you the answers to
all the problems with Matthew and then

473
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:50,280
you'll do that with your
exit use papers later.

474
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,970
So one of the things that Jesus says,
and also Matthew is a teacher.

475
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Mark had told us in his gospel that Jesus
was a great teacher and people said,

476
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,100
wow, he's a great teacher. He teaches
not like the scribes and Pharisees.

477
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:04,320
He teaches as one with authority,

478
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,190
but mark didn't really tell
us much of what Jesus taught.

479
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,560
There are a few parables,
a few controversies,

480
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,610
but mark tells you that Jesus is a
great teacher without presenting Jesus'

481
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:18,240
teaching a lot. Matthew not only
tells you Jesus is a good teacher,

482
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,740
he presents a lot of teaching of Jesus.
And so you,

483
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,950
you get out a lot of that and then you
get this interesting passage in chapter

484
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:30,951
13 verse 51 turn in your hymnals to 1351

485
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,273
yeah.

486
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,570
Have you understood all this?

487
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,820
And this is toward the end of this
big long parable chapter member.

488
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:44,390
I told you that chapter 13 Matthew is
where Matthew puts a ton of parables.

489
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,350
So toward the end of this parable chapter,
Jesus asked them,

490
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,010
have you understood all
this? They answered yes and
he said to them, therefore,

491
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:57,011
every scribe who has been trained for
the Kingdom of Heaven is like the master

492
00:28:57,051 --> 00:29:01,400
of a household who brings out of his
treasure what is new and what does old.

493
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,090
When Jesus had finished these parables,
he left that place.

494
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,230
This is a parable that
Matthew is putting in there,

495
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:13,250
I think to give a hint to his readers.
This is what Jesus was.

496
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,870
Jesus was a good scribe.

497
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,410
That's why Jesus talks about
things like you have heard it said,

498
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,700
but I say to you,

499
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,650
Jesus is taking out of the
Jewish scripture and taking
out of the Jewish law the

500
00:29:24,651 --> 00:29:28,690
most important parts of it and emphasizing
those and then adding some move his

501
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:31,820
own teacher. So he's taking some
of the old and some of the new,

502
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,560
and that's what a good scribe is like,

503
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,630
but Matthew also believes that he and
his fellow disciples in his church should

504
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:39,590
be that way too.

505
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,800
He writes his Gospel to help people figure
out how to imitate Jesus and being a

506
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:45,664
good scribe,

507
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,320
how to discern what of the old you should
use and what are the new you should

508
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,154
use.

509
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:53,380
Yeah,

510
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,990
but then there's this really the one of
the last problem is I want to give is

511
00:29:55,991 --> 00:30:00,991
this really big problem in Matthew
because Jesus is also something,

512
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,310
well,
just read on the surface.

513
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,180
Jesus comes across as a bit like
a coward in the gospel of Matthew.

514
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,023
Look at

515
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Chapter Four Verse 12 in
Matthew Chapter Four verse 12

516
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:22,780
yeah,

517
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,530
first in the first part of this chapter
for you get Jesus going around preaching

518
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:29,440
the Gospel. Come in doing some
miracles in that sort of thing.

519
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,260
He becomes very famous so
that people hear about them.

520
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:37,450
But then you get to 12 now, when Jesus
heard that John had been arrested,

521
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,440
he got on his white charger and he rode
to the prison and he sprang his friend

522
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:49,540
John the Baptist out of
prison, Indiana. Jesus.

523
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,960
No, that's not what it says, right?

524
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,560
He withdrew to Galilee and
the word withdraw here is
the Greek word for retreat.

525
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,170
He retreated to Galilee because he
heard that John had gotten arrested.

526
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,881
He left Nazareth,

527
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:11,020
made his home in Capernaum by the sea in
the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali.

528
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,110
So that what had been spoken through
the Prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled.

529
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,340
And any quotes that first,
uh, 17 from that time,

530
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:21,940
Jesus began to proclaim repent for
the Kingdom of Heaven has come near.

531
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:27,340
In other words, Jesus retreats in the
face of danger. He doesn't go toward it,

532
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,710
but instead of retreating in hiding,

533
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,740
he goes to another place and then
he starts giving the message out.

534
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:35,350
This is when he really first
started his own preaching ministry.

535
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,940
After John the Baptist is arrested.
So notice what that happens there.

536
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:43,570
Look again at now look
at 1215 Matthew 1215

537
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,090
reading just a little bit above that.
Um,

538
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,543
okay.

539
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,570
Jesus is disputing with the
Pharisees and verse 14 says,

540
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:01,490
but the pharisees went out and conspired
against him. How to destroy him.

541
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,190
Another threat this time from
the farracies against Jesus.

542
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:09,350
Verse 15 when Jesus became aware of this,
he departed again.

543
00:32:09,351 --> 00:32:11,210
He withdrew.
There's that word again.

544
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,110
Many crowds followed him and he cured
all of them and he ordered them not to

545
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:17,870
make him known. This was
to fulfill. Notice again,

546
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:21,980
Jesus withdraws in the face of danger,
but they're withdrawing in a sense,

547
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:25,850
increases the ministry and an
and an odd paradoxical way.

548
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,840
And then look at 1413

549
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,320
well, I won't read that one.
1413 if you can look it up,

550
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,530
that's another case of
danger and Jesus withdrawing.

551
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:43,830
But now let's do spend a little more time
looking at chapter 12 because have you

552
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:48,380
noticed that the gospel of Matthew likes
to foreshadow things and fulfill things?

553
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:52,550
The Gospel of Matthew likes to have Jesus
do something and then he'll tell you

554
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:53,900
something that was not in mark.

555
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:59,240
He'll say this was to fulfill the
scripture that said, for example,

556
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:02,960
when Jesus and the holy family run off to
Egypt, he then quotes to the fact that,

557
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,950
and they come back, he says, out of
Egypt, I will call my son a prophecy.

558
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,170
So Matthew takes an old
testament reference,

559
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:10,770
a a Jewish scripture
reference cause members,

560
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,760
not the old testament yet is just Jewish
scripture and he takes a quotation on

561
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:18,320
that and saying, is fulfilled by
Jesus? So in the same way, um,

562
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:22,460
in Matthew two 13 and 14,

563
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,610
after they had left,
this is after the Weizmann left,

564
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,700
an angel of the Lord appeared to
Joseph in a dream and said, get up.

565
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,520
Take the child and his mother and flee
to Egypt and remain there until I tell

566
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:35,120
you, for Herod is about, so the fleet,
there's that word again, withdrawal.

567
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,250
Even Joseph with Jesus retreats
in the face of danger to Galilee.

568
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,950
And then when he hears they'd
come back, um, uh, in, uh,

569
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,700
verse 22 of the same chapter.
Now why is all this Jesus retreating?

570
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,580
The other thing is if you look at 10,
23 g,

571
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,880
we again get this same word when
you're doing an exit. Jesus,

572
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,550
you might want to use a concordance.
You'll learn on,

573
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,580
on Thursday or Friday in your sections
what a concordance is and you're learning

574
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,780
how to use it.
But basically you can,

575
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,860
a concordance is a word is a book that
takes all the words of the Bible of the

576
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:09,560
Bible and shows you where they occur.

577
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,070
And if you looked up withdraw
and an English concordance,

578
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,370
it would tell you every time in a
certain English translation that the word

579
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:19,220
withdraw occurred in Matthew, mark,
Luke, and you can test them out.

580
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,550
You'll also learn how to use an analytical
concordance even if you don't know

581
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:25,430
Greek, which will kind of give you
an idea once you learn how to use it.

582
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:29,810
What's the Greek word lying behind these
English words? And if you did that,

583
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:32,720
you could find out that these different
English words that I've been reading

584
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:37,721
from translate the same
Greek word withdrawal on a
[inaudible] on a car races.

585
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,050
And so this, this word is
here too. And in 10 23,

586
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:46,340
you have Jesus in his instructions to
disciples telling them that they also

587
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,800
should retreat in the face of danger.

588
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:52,620
Okay,

589
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:56,160
so what is all this going on? How do we
take these different issues? Jesus has a,

590
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:00,690
is almost a new Moses. Jesus teaching
the disciples should keep the Torah,

591
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,760
the law. Uh, but then Jesus,
when he faces trouble, he was,

592
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:08,700
he withdraws from trouble and he goes
off someplace. But when he withdraws,

593
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,810
he ends up preaching more and the Gospel
is expanding. And then to disciples,

594
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:17,250
Matthew believes will be the next version
of Jesus. They also will be threatened.

595
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,800
They also will be taught to retreat.

596
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,370
They also will then go preach and they'll
eventually go preach to the entire

597
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,080
world in the form of the gentiles.

598
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,340
So all of this is Jesus' first
functions as a model for the disciples.

599
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,840
The apostles and the apostles function
as a model for Matthew and the members of

600
00:35:36,841 --> 00:35:39,990
his church. So what is all
this doing here and why is it,

601
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:44,490
what's the context in which this kind
of picture of Jesus would make sense and

602
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:49,200
we're going to spend a bit more time
on one important passage. Matthew 1422

603
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,643
okay,

604
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,850
this is the famous story called the
stilling of the storm. Now you will have,

605
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:00,870
if you remember this,

606
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:05,640
you can look at mark six 45 and it has
the same story and if you took your

607
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:07,800
parallel caught your parallel columns,

608
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,940
one from mark and one from Matthew
and you dig your little colored Pencil

609
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,800
exercises you had last
week for your section.

610
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:18,330
It's very interesting to see what
does Matthew add to mark story.

611
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,680
And if you figure out what Marc
Matthew added to mark story,

612
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,040
you can really get an idea about what
was Matthew's own editorial interests.

613
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,130
Why did he take something out of mark?
Tell it differently,

614
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,730
add new stuff to it that gives you a great
clue for what Matt do you want to say?

615
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:33,630
Because remember,

616
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,510
each of these riders is not just telling
you stuff that happened because it

617
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:37,080
happened.

618
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,250
They each are writing a book intending
to put across a theological message.

619
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,810
And if you compare what Matthew says to
what he gets from mark and see what he

620
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:46,950
adds,
and when he takes out,

621
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,790
you have a really good idea of
what his editorial messages,

622
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,910
what his editorial concerns are.
And we call this redaction criticism.

623
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,040
Redaction is just a
fancy word for editing.

624
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,253
And why did,

625
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,150
why did scholars not call
it editing criticism?

626
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:11,870
Because we like two bit words when
one bit words would work just as well.

627
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,180
So it's redaction. Criticism is
Rod, you'll sit in the scholarship.

628
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,930
It just means paying attention to how the
gospel writers edited their sources to

629
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:23,500
get up their own message. So
look at 14, 22 how many end?

630
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,890
If you want,
you can flip over to Matt.

631
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,210
Mark six 45 and see that change.
Or if you have Throckmorton, uh,

632
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:33,260
you can look it up and Throckmorton
some time, but here's, I'll,

633
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:36,720
I'll indicate some of it
immediately.

634
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,370
He made the disciples get into the boat.

635
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:41,730
This is after one of the feedings of a
bunch of people and go ahead to the other

636
00:37:41,731 --> 00:37:44,670
side. While he dismissed the crowds,
after he had dismissed the crowds,

637
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:47,880
he went up to the mountain by
himself to pray. When evening came,

638
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:49,680
he was there alone.
But by this time,

639
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:53,220
the boat battered by the waves was far
from the land for the wind was against

640
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:56,760
them. Notice for the wind was
against them. The boat is battered,

641
00:37:56,761 --> 00:37:59,460
the wind is against them.
Some of these details won't be in mark.

642
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,170
The basic story will be there,

643
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,860
but this is this thing about the
bolt being battered by the wind.

644
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,160
The wind is against them. I don't think
that's in mark, if I'm remember right

645
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,570
and early in the morning he came
walking toward them out on the sea.

646
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,250
But when the disciples saw
him walking on the sea,

647
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:18,870
they were terrified saying it is a ghost
and they cried out in fear immediately.

648
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:22,200
Jesus spoke to them and said, take
heart. It is, I do not be afraid.

649
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,830
And Mark Jesus and gets in the boat,
stills the storm.

650
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:30,270
And there they all say that Markin's
it with his own a clue that they didn't

651
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:31,890
understand.
They still didn't understand.

652
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:34,620
So that's part of Mark's
theme about misunderstanding.

653
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,080
That's not the way Matthew isn't here.
Notice what he says. Peter answered him.

654
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:42,130
Lord, if it is you command me to come
to you on the water. He said, come.

655
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,760
So Peter got out of the
boat, started walking on the
water and came toward Jesus.

656
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,090
But when he noticed the strong, when he
became frightened and beginning to sink,

657
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:52,690
he cried out. Lord, save
me. Lord saved me. Hmm.

658
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,160
Now the Greek word for saved
me can mean just rescue me,

659
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:02,230
save me from illness. But it also can
mean save me like I need salvation.

660
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,300
Same Greek word means both.

661
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,320
Jesus immediately reached out his
hand and caught him saying to you,

662
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,580
you a little faith. Ah,
that methy include. So He,

663
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:14,760
Matthew likes this little faith thing.
So that's one of the things you see.

664
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,100
He's added here. Why did you
doubt when they got into the boat,

665
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:22,750
the wind ceased and those in the
boat worshiped him and sa saying,

666
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,260
truly you are the son of God.
Now if you compare this,

667
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:29,830
what you've got is some important
different changes. First for example,

668
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:33,460
I said the boat is beaten by the waves.
That's not in mark.

669
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,900
Why did Matthew add that?

670
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:40,070
And then you have this whole verses 28
through 31 the whole thing with Peter and

671
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,240
all that sort of thing that's not in Marc
Mathieu added that whole little chunk

672
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,320
and then in verse 33 it says they
worshiped him and they had this confession

673
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:50,500
truly are the son of God,
which is a Christian confession,

674
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,560
a famous German scholar, Gunther born
calm. You don't need to remember,

675
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,670
and one of his students wrote a very
famous article published in the fifties in

676
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:04,810
which they analyze this story and
they said, if you read this carefully,

677
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:09,100
this story is not about Jesus walking
on the water and stilling the storm and

678
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:12,730
that sort of thing. This is a story
Matthew intends for you to see the boat.

679
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,700
It's almost a, it's a, it's like an
allegory. It's almost like an allegory.

680
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,350
The boat represents the church and Matthew
sees the church as being persecuted.

681
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:23,350
We've seen that theme throughout
Matthew seven Jesus prophesized,

682
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:24,610
the disciples will be persecuted.

683
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:28,300
So the boat is persecuted and that's
represented by the storm and the winds and

684
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,900
the waves buffeting him and
they're afraid. And Peter,

685
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:36,580
who represents every Christian says,
I want to be like you,

686
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:40,300
Jesus, and I want to walk on water. I
want to overcome all these problems.

687
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:43,150
He gets out of the boat,
but he doesn't have enough faith.

688
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:46,150
He has a little faith and his
doubt causes him to start sinking.

689
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,880
When he does that,
what should he do?

690
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:52,060
He should cry out to Jesus
and Jesus will save him.

691
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,890
And then Jesus gets in a boat,
calms the storm,

692
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,300
and they worship him and confess him.
So born calm,

693
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,400
used this redaction criticism.

694
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:06,850
He was one of the first pioneers of
using this method and calling it by this

695
00:41:06,851 --> 00:41:10,300
term to say, compare Matthew
with what he gets from mark.

696
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,810
And what you do is you see that
what was just a miracle story?

697
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:19,050
Just basic story about the power of Jesus
has now become a moral story about the

698
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:24,871
church and it's now become something
that Matthew is writing to encourage his,

699
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,930
his own church.
They are small,

700
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,650
lonely people have little faith.
There are mixed group.

701
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:36,800
Remember just some people in the church
seem to have a lot more faith in other

702
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:37,640
people in the church.

703
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,510
Some people in the church may not
even be true disciples after all.

704
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,370
They're not yet perfect. One of the ways
that Matthew Chain Matthew has, uh, uh,

705
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,600
um, uh, saying that, uh,
is different from Luke.

706
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,930
They seem to both get it from queue.
Luke's version says,

707
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:58,370
you should be merciful as your
Father in Heaven is merciful.

708
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,510
Does anybody happen to know what that
comes out in Matthew in the sermon on the

709
00:42:02,511 --> 00:42:03,344
mount?

710
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,760
You should be perfect as your
father in heaven is perfect.

711
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,510
Matthew has perfect and Luke has merciful.
Again,

712
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,860
we see bitty little bitty
clues of how they write this.

713
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:20,330
But Matt, that's Matthew telling his
church, I know you're not perfect now,

714
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,720
but God,
Jesus calls you to perfection.

715
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:26,390
They need more faith and
according to Matthew's story,

716
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:30,920
they do it by focusing on Jesus and
worshiping him as the son of God as they

717
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:31,754
should.

718
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,790
What I've done is walk through several
different passages. In Matthew,

719
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,260
an exit. Jesus wouldn't ask you to
do all of those things together.

720
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:47,360
You could write an extra Jesus paper on
just one section of any of those things

721
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:49,910
that I talked about,
but notice what I've had to do.

722
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,690
I've had to compare
Matthew with mark and Luke.

723
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,970
I've tried to figure out why.

724
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,130
Why did Matthew include what
he included and what did he,

725
00:42:59,131 --> 00:43:03,550
why did any of that stuff,
why did he change things
from mark? I've also said he,

726
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,000
he probably used Q,

727
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:09,230
this a hypothetical document because we
find that we find that by comparing Luke

728
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:13,190
and Matthew and I might guess at how
whether Matthew has the more raw,

729
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,650
original version of Q or
where there Luca does,

730
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:19,880
and I might try to imagine what was in
queue and how Matthew May have changed

731
00:43:19,881 --> 00:43:20,750
that,
edited that.

732
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,800
That's all of course pure speculation
because we don't have cue as a physical

733
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:28,190
document to actually compare it with like
we've got mark as a physical document,

734
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,780
but scholars still do that.

735
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,560
But the purpose is to all the way through
to figure out what does this author

736
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:38,000
want to do. It's not concerned
with whether he's telling
us that correct history.

737
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,890
We'll leave that for another day. And
it's not to say whether it's true or not.

738
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,263
And notice this,

739
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:47,930
it's also not to come up with sappy
Sunday school kinds of readings.

740
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:52,490
This is the worst, the hardest
thing for people to, to learn.

741
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,850
And it notice it doesn't matter whether
people have grown up in churches are not

742
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,720
modern. People have just come to
think that when you read this book,

743
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,270
you're supposed to get Sunday
school type sappy answers out of it.

744
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:06,260
What does the meaning of this story while
Jesus is teaching us to be to love one

745
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:10,250
another? Well, okay, yeah,
maybe so, but dig deeper.

746
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,840
Try to figure out,

747
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:16,870
try to imagine a historical context in
which a human author is writing the story

748
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:21,740
this way. In order to do something
socially in his own early community,

749
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:25,910
we imagine an early Christian community
and we imagine what problems they had by

750
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:29,840
reading the text and then we see the
text as being written consciously by an

751
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:34,680
author to address those problems. And
with Matthew, what you get is this.

752
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:40,850
Matthew teaches that a Torah observant
form of discipleship to Jesus.

753
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:45,690
Now this will be very important because
one of the themes of this whole course

754
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:51,020
is that is that dye the dye who had
the diversity of different early

755
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:53,460
Christianity's.
It's all,

756
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:57,660
it's anachronistic in the first century
to even talk about Christianity as one

757
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:01,170
thing because as we'll show,
there were different views of Jesus.

758
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:03,240
There were different
views of the Jewish law.

759
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,230
And what you'll see very quickly
in this course is Matthew has one,

760
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:11,420
has a very different view
of what Christians should
do with the Jewish law then

761
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:16,461
does Paul or Luke or mark or John
or several of the other writers?

762
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,260
So one of the things that makes Matthew
present a peculiar kind of Christianity

763
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,780
when judged by the standards
of Paul's kind of Christianity,

764
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,310
is that Matthew teaches Jesus as
teaching and a Christianity that observes

765
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:33,630
Jewish Torah, even in, even if gentiles
come in, which the gentiles do come in,

766
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:38,320
gentiles must be expected to
keep the law also. So we're,

767
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:42,450
whereas Paul spent his whole career trying
to get gentiles to say, to understand,

768
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:45,720
no, you don't. You're not supposed to
keep the Jewish law if you're a gentile.

769
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,430
Jesus absolves you from keeping the
Jewish law. Matthew is not that way.

770
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,750
He sees gentiles coming into the church,
but still being Torah observant.

771
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,460
So he has a Torah observant form of
Christianity with Jesus as the recognized

772
00:45:59,461 --> 00:46:03,510
Messiah.
Gentiles are included in Israel.

773
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:08,210
They're not included as a separate church.
Gentiles are brought into Israel. Uh,

774
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:12,930
it looks like for Matthew and Matthew
presents a church that is in conflict with

775
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,320
other forms of Judaism,
whoever the,

776
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,030
I think Matthew was
written after step near 70,

777
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:19,860
certainly after the destruction
of the temple in Jerusalem.

778
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:24,030
That seems pretty clear. Most of the
scholars data to somewhere in the 80s,

779
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,670
maybe not earlier than the year 80,

780
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,230
maybe not let in the your 90
we're guessing on this, but the,

781
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,980
it seems to be it has to be after 70,

782
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,640
but he's in conflict with whoever
is there still pharisees around.

783
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:36,660
They're still scribes.

784
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:39,720
There are other people who are offering
a slightly different version of what it

785
00:46:39,721 --> 00:46:40,554
means to be Jewish.

786
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:44,550
And that's the last thing that I'll
say about this is that Matthew is not

787
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:48,630
presenting a new religion.
He thinks what,

788
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,680
what we would call Christianity is
simply the right way to be a Jew.

789
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:59,300
So what Matthew's presenting
is a different sect within
Judaism from the form of

790
00:46:59,971 --> 00:47:04,830
Judaism that's represented by
the Pharisees or the Sadducees,

791
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:05,640
perhaps some.

792
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,630
A lot of people think that this addressees
may have become extinct after the

793
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,540
destruction of the temple in Jerusalem
because the Sadducees were very,

794
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:16,440
their power base was the temple.
But if the Sadducees are still around,

795
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,290
Matthew's presenting a different form
of Judaism than they ex followed.

796
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,230
He's preventing presenting a different
form of Judaism represented by the Jewish

797
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:26,310
writer Josephus or Phylo.
But he is presenting a form of Judaism.

798
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,451
In fact,

799
00:47:27,451 --> 00:47:31,900
scholars nowadays say Matthew not
represent a new religion with his gospel.

800
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,710
He actually represents
a different Jewish sect.

801
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:42,380
Any questions?
Yes sir.

802
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,590
Does Matthew believe that
gentiles should be circumcised?

803
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:52,630
I think so because I can't
imagine him teaching, um,

804
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,420
uh, completely law observant.
You know, when he says not one.

805
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:59,800
Dot or tittle or jot of the law will pass
away until I have an earth passes away.

806
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:00,820
Well,

807
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,760
any Jew at the time pretty much would
have thought that circumcision was a very

808
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:06,670
important part of Jewish law,
not just a dot or a Tidel.

809
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:09,520
So I think so you'll find lots
of scholars who disagree with me,

810
00:48:09,521 --> 00:48:14,130
but of course they're all wrong.
Any other questions? Okay.

811
00:48:14,131 --> 00:48:14,880
See you on Wednesday.
