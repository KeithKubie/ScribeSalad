1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,810
Okay. So, um,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,110
the second part of the last lecture
introduced the idea of Alkenes and we were

3
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:14,430
talking about the stability
of Alkenes sis versus trans,

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,020
uh, and the effect of substitution. Uh,

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,860
we'll go on with that today and
then go on to addition mechanisms,

6
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:26,190
which is the characteristic
reactivity of alkenes.

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,160
So if we look at the, uh,
stabilities of these, uh,

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,000
c six alkene isomers that
we talked about last time,

9
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:40,950
we showed how you could get the numbers
for those from the Nis t website.

10
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,110
Uh, it's also possible, uh,
to get them from this, uh,

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,860
uh, book by Pedley. That's the
one that, uh, Professor Weinberg,

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,810
who's a big expert on this,
I recommended to me as a good source.

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,070
So here's the heat of
formation of the, uh, of the,

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,970
the, the, uh,

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,990
straight chain with the double
bond and that number one position,

16
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,610
uh, what does he to formation?
What's that? The heat relative to

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,960
the energy of this
molecule compared to what

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,870
the heat of formation
you read,

19
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,840
rehearse from last semester.

20
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,850
Mary,
it's not the heat of battle

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,960
causation.
How do you measure such things?

22
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,940
How do you measure the heat of a molecule?
Yep.

23
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,050
Yeah, yeah. No, that's, that's how

24
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,190
that was the way that you got the
heat of formation of carbon atoms from

25
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:46,440
graphite and Lebron,

26
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,960
but that only needed to be done once
to get where carbon atom is relative to

27
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:56,920
graphite.
Then you need to know the Ma,

28
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,300
the energy of molecules relative
to graphite. How do you do that?

29
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,980
But that's a very difficult
thing to do with them. Do to

30
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,900
break the bonds of graphite, Matt, do
you have an idea? Combusts graphite.

31
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,410
You burned them,
right?

32
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,450
You compare them to see oh two so
you take your molecule and burn that.

33
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:26,610
We talked about this last semester,
you burn graphite,

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,600
you also burn h two so you can
get a hydrocarbon. How much,

35
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,610
what's the energy of your
compound compared to the
amount of energy that was in

36
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,390
hydrogen and carbon of
graphite? Okay, so anyhow,

37
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:40,830
the heat of formation is,

38
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:46,130
is a minus a 10 or a little
bit more kilocalories per mole.

39
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,100
That means it's that much more stable
than the elements would be in their

40
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:55,020
defined standard state. Okay. Now,

41
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:58,620
if you'll look at it
for the CIS three Hex,

42
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:02,440
seen the double bond
beginning on the third carbon,

43
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,770
it's a little bit more stable.
Right?

44
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,110
And that doesn't surprise you because
we've talked about having a more carbons

45
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:15,820
as opposed to hydrogens on a,
on a double bonded carbon,

46
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,480
uh, makes the, makes the
compound more stable.

47
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,620
That is that the ch bonds are not as,

48
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,870
don't profit as much from the change in
hybridization to cc bond seemed to do

49
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,740
okay.
Now if you have the Trans Isomer,

50
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,000
it's still more stable by about
one and a half kilo calories.

51
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,210
I don't know whether you had a chance to
look at the problems yet. Probably not.

52
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:45,160
They were for Wednesday, uh, to look at
the generalities, but you find that, uh,

53
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,030
the Trans isomer is about one and a
half kilocalories more stable than this.

54
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:52,720
This,
can you think of any explanation for that,

55
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,283
Amy?

56
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,670
Right,
right.

57
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,980
That they run,
the groups run into one another.

58
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:06,630
It's a stearic effect when they're assist.

59
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:10,860
That's worth about one and a half
kilocalories per mole. Okay. Now if you,

60
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,540
if you make three carbon carbon
bonds from the double bond, uh,

61
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,930
incidentally there's a table
that has those in it too. In the,

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,880
in the Jones book, if you put
three carbons on the double bond,

63
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,840
then it's more stable still.
And obviously if you put four,

64
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,640
it's a little bit more stable still.
Now, if we come back and look at the,

65
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,410
at the, uh, at correcting
for strain, which would,

66
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,150
which was what we attributed the
difference between CIS and Trans, uh, two,

67
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,960
we find that there's 3.6 kilocalories
of molecular mechanics strain in the sis

68
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:53,160
and 2.5 and the trans. So it's
what you said Amy, that's the melt.

69
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,420
Like molecular mechanics explains
it in terms of a stearic effect.

70
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,010
Okay, so the average then
for those two is about there.

71
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,770
And now if we make strain corrections
for the other molecules as well,

72
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:10,200
calculate the strain
by molecular mechanics.

73
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,950
There's 2.8 kilocalories
of strain calculated there,

74
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,220
2.6 and 7.7 and the one that has
four carbons on the double bond.

75
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,880
And now you notice something
interesting about the trend.

76
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,640
Once you've corrected for strain,
what do you notice? All right,

77
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,020
it's almost exactly linear
according to the number of CC bonds,

78
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,700
right?
So you get,

79
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,710
you gain in stability about two and a
half kilocalories per mole every time you

80
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:45,630
substituted the Cah with a CC,
right?

81
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,640
Keeping the same number of carbons and
hydrogens in the molecule discussing

82
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,930
isomers of one another.

83
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:56,931
Cause of course it makes no sense to
compare heats of formation for molecules

84
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:01,520
that are not isomers from
one of one another, right?

85
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:05,140
You're comparing apples with
oranges. Okay? So you get,

86
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,660
so that could be due
to this hybridization,

87
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,990
it could in part be due to
hyper conjugation that we
talked about before the,

88
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,110
uh, and we'll talk a little
bit more about it later.

89
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,460
Now let's think about the thermo
chemistry involved in Alkie hcl reaction.

90
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:31,661
So here's Hcl plus and how keyed to give
the edition product where h is added

91
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,730
the one carbon and cl to the other.

92
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:41,260
So notice we've converted a single bond
and a double bond on the left into three

93
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:47,750
single bonds on the right. Is that
likely to be favorable or unfavorable?

94
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,490
What's the energy of a double
bond compared to two single bonds?

95
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,410
That's what we've done here.

96
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,890
Do you remember from our table and
we looked at in the first semester,

97
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,371
how much?

98
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:08,330
The second is the second bond of a
double bond worth as much as the first,

99
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,890
more or less, it's worth less. Okay.

100
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,960
So if we look back at that table
that we looked at last semester, uh,

101
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:21,920
and, and put actual numbers
to these, to these, uh,

102
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,420
bonds that we've drawn here,
uh,

103
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,680
we see that the hydrogen chloride bond
is worth 103 kilocalories per mole.

104
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,410
The double bond carbon carbon double
bond is 146 so there's 249 that we're

105
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:39,530
losing in the starting material.

106
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,580
So how much do we gain in the product
making the three single bonds?

107
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,500
So there's 104
and [inaudible] 83

108
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,270
and 81 okay,

109
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,580
so two 68 in other words,

110
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,200
it's profitable by 19 kilocalories
per mole to do this edition.

111
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,190
And we talked about this before when
we were talking about chain reaction,

112
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,320
addition of Hcl, right?
Or, or Hbr, Ahi and so on,

113
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:12,800
all of the war exothermic
by about that much.

114
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,100
So it's favorable by 19
kilocalories per mole.

115
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,673
Uh,

116
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,130
now we could also look more specifically
at these compounds by using that data

117
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:28,850
that's in a table that we access last
time from National Institute of Science

118
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:32,840
and technology to look at the
actual heats of formation of these,

119
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,450
of these particular molecules
in the gas phase. That is, uh,

120
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,420
before we were just looking at average
bond energies to get an order of

121
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:45,500
magnitude idea of what's going on or
better than an order of magnitude.

122
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,490
But these,

123
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,230
these now will give us the precise values
and where we said it was 19 before,

124
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,710
now we see that for this specific
set of compounds, it's 14 a half.

125
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,620
But we were about right,
it was a good guest before.

126
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,980
Now suppose that, uh, so this
reaction should go to the right,

127
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,290
but we've already talked about a
reaction that goes to the left.

128
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,020
What reaction would that be?

129
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,080
The one that starts on the
right and he goes to the left.

130
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,620
That's the elimination reaction. And he
two reaction goes from right to left.

131
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,780
What's the difference?
Why could we talk if this,

132
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,970
if this equilibrium lies to the right,

133
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,080
how could we have spent all this time
in the last quarter of the course?

134
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,270
Talking about reactions going the
other way is not uphill and energy.

135
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,410
What reagents do you use to
do the elimination phase?

136
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,770
A strong base, right? Like hydroxide.

137
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:54,640
So let's see what happens if
we put hydroxide into the mix.

138
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,920
Okay, so we had it acid,
we get addition, right?

139
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:04,240
And it's favorable by 14 kilocalories
per mole in this particular case.

140
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,370
But if we put hydroxide in there,
now what will it react with?

141
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,190
Well, it it, we,

142
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:15,610
we know we talked about how it pulls
off the Proton at the same time chloride

143
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:20,140
leaves and the two reaction. But if all
we're doing is study in Thermo Chemistry,

144
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,940
we could look at where it is in
the product, in the balance of the,

145
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,860
of the two sides of the equation.

146
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:31,630
So what it does on the left is take
the proton awaits wage away from HCL,

147
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,930
right? To give water and chloride. Now,

148
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,370
hcl is a much stronger acid than water is.

149
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,420
So that's a very favorable process to
take the proton away from hcl and to put

150
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:50,720
it on hydroxide. And
in fact, we could, uh,

151
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,430
find out how different it is by
looking up at that same table,

152
00:10:54,431 --> 00:10:58,840
the proton affinities of o,
h minus and chloride.

153
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,380
And we find they differ by
19 kilocalories per mole.

154
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,540
So adding hydroxides stabilizes the
left side of this equation by 19

155
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,890
kilocalories per mole,

156
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,080
and now it's favorable to go the other
way by four and a half kilo calories per

157
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,190
hole. Okay, so we had base,

158
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:20,470
you do elimination,
you go the other way.

159
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,060
Now are these really the
reverse of one another?

160
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,650
Do we just run the machine
backwards to get, uh,

161
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:34,690
elimination as a PA as or to get addition
as compared to the elimination we

162
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:38,140
talked about before?
Or is it a different mechanism?

163
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,120
Because the conditions are
different. This is done. The,

164
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:44,950
the elimination was done in
the presence of strong base.

165
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,590
The addition has done
in the presence of acid.

166
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,670
So you might not be able to run
the machine backwards. Right?

167
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,480
So incidentally,

168
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,500
here's a problem for you to look out for
Wednesday to use the PKA values for hcl

169
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:03,640
in h two o to estimate here.

170
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:08,641
Here I looked it up actually the
proton affinities and I s t and got 19

171
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:10,840
kilocalories per mole.

172
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:16,570
But you could have done the same thing
out of your head or out of a simple table.

173
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,660
Does anybody remember
what the PKA of Hcl is?

174
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,010
The exam is Friday. I
realize that. Scrub that now

175
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,210
anybody remember about what it is?
It's about,

176
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,180
I think it's minus eight, isn't
it? And how about the PKA of water?

177
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,410
Negative 16 so from that difference
you can calculate what the,

178
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,690
what the energy of that reaction would be.

179
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,990
So try it from that difference
and see if you can do it.

180
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:52,900
That's a good exercise for you.
But other than the rate,

181
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:55,120
we have the question of the
addition to the back of aneurysm.

182
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:58,960
Is it the reverse of the
two or Iwan mechanism?

183
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,090
Okay.

184
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,330
So we're going to talk about addition to
Alkenes and we've already done that to

185
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:07,750
a certain extent.
We talked about the SOMO mechanism,

186
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:12,400
the free radical chain edition of Hbr.
And you remember what that is,

187
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:17,380
that a bromine atom ads to
give the more stable radical,

188
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,040
which then attacks HBR taking off the
hydrogen atom to give the the product,

189
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,720
it gives that product and there's
a reference in the textbook,

190
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,860
gives that product not the one above.
Right.

191
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,970
And it doesn't give that one,
it's Riggio selective.

192
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,830
And remember we called this
anti Markovnikov, right?

193
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,000
Markovnikov had the idea as
we talked about last time,

194
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:50,470
that the carbon that has more
substituents gets more, right.

195
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:51,304
So if you had,

196
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,540
if you had two methyl groups already
on one of the double bonded carbons,

197
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,190
it would be the one that
gets the bromine that, uh,

198
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,320
that the hydrogen goes to the other one.
But this is anti Markovnikov.

199
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:06,160
It does the, does the opposite. Okay.

200
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:07,660
So we've already talked about that.

201
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:12,661
And the key feature in the regio selection
is getting the more stable carbon

202
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,020
radical.
Okay.

203
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,770
But it's also conceivable that there
could be a homo Lumo mechanism,

204
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,540
a concerted one where the new
group comes up to the double bond.

205
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,810
And the part the partners
just exchange like this.

206
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,760
Suppose you had h two to react with
with the carbon carbon double bond.

207
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:36,820
A very exothermic reaction,
right?

208
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,880
So you could just shift electron pairs
like that and perform the edition.

209
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,650
Right. Now let's look at the orbitals
that would be involved in that.

210
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,790
Uh, what's, what's the homo
of the CC? Double Bond.

211
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,260
Ellen. Hi. Okay.

212
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,300
And the,
and the Lumo is Pi Star now.

213
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:09,000
So let's try to bring the whole,

214
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,570
the Lumo in the homo of the
h two down on top, right.

215
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,360
Looked good to mix homo and Lumo.

216
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,470
What do you call that situation?

217
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,733
Ro.

218
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,350
They're out of phase. They're, in fact,

219
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:36,500
there's a specific word to talk about
things that don't overlap for this

220
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,800
cemetery kind of reason.
Remember what it is?

221
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,630
They're orthogonal on her access,
right? So there could be no,

222
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,350
there's no mixing of Homo, of one
with Lumo or the other. Of course,

223
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:52,190
you could shift them right?
So that they mix, right?

224
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,820
But then there's nothing to be gained
because on the left you're mixing,

225
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,810
filled with filled. That's repulsive.
And on the right, the orbitals are empty.

226
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:00,920
There's nothing that has that,

227
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,500
whenever energies are
available for those orbitals.

228
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,260
So you can't do this reaction,

229
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:11,261
you can't just bring a B signal bond
down on top of a double bond and change

230
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:15,950
partners cause the symmetry is wrong of
the orbitals. They won't mix that way.

231
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,950
You can't draw those two arrows.
However,

232
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,820
it turns out that if you use certain
catalysts in particular metals like

233
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,813
platinum,

234
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:31,450
they make it possible to do this
because the platinum gets involved,

235
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,330
it gets its orbitals involved in
there can be favorable overlap.

236
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,300
And we'll be talking about that pretty
soon. You see that in the Jones book?

237
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:42,710
That's in chapter 10.
Okay.

238
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,390
So that would be a concerted reaction
where you make and break bonds at the same

239
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:50,930
time.
But it's also possible to do it step wise.

240
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,130
That's why the reactions are called
electrophilic because you have, uh,

241
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,530
an acid,
for example,

242
00:16:57,531 --> 00:17:01,820
HBR and the homo attacks,

243
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:06,500
the sigma star Lumo attacks the
Proton to give off bromide, right?

244
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,560
And then the bromide can attack the,
uh,

245
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,180
can attack the intermediate cad I.
And so it's a two step reaction.

246
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,950
So the initial reaction is the
reaction of an electro file,

247
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:21,740
something that wants the
electrons a low Lumo.

248
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,800
The sigma star of Hbr is the reagent
that reacts with the Double Bond.

249
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:33,250
Okay. And notice that that one
works for any hydrogen. Hey,

250
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,370
do you remember all the hydrogen halides
where exothermic for their addition to

251
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:41,720
the double bond, but only HBR would
work by the top mechanism here,

252
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:46,610
the Somo because both steps are
exothermic to compete with termination,

253
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,430
right? Whereas any of the
hydrogen hail lights we'll do,

254
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,120
we'll do this step wise
electrophilic or reaction.

255
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,190
And notice in this case that it does
follow Mark Cuban to Coffs rule.

256
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:01,440
It's not that one.
It's the,

257
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,540
it's the Markovnikov where bromide goes
to the more substituted carbon and it

258
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,750
goes there because that carbon
is more stable in the inner,

259
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,890
that carbon cat die in this
more stable as an intermediate.

260
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,770
Okay. So that's stuff that
mostly we've mentioned before.

261
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,390
Now let's think about the orbitals
and where they should get attacked.

262
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:29,990
So here's ethylene and alkeen and we
can look at the surface potential to see

263
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,080
the energy of a proton on
the Vanderwall surface.

264
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,300
So a proton likes to be up above where
the double bond is and it doesn't like to

265
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:43,530
be around where the hydrogens
are, right? So this,

266
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:45,030
this electrostatic,

267
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,140
a feature of the surface of the
molecule is important in positioning the

268
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,650
fragments before they begin to react.

269
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,740
But new bonding requires mixing or,

270
00:18:55,741 --> 00:19:00,120
but also not just positioning
things electrostatically hey,

271
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,390
so we should look at
the homo and the Lumo.

272
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,840
So the Lumo is,
is this a Pi Star or a beetle?

273
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,980
And the homo is the Pi orbital,
right?

274
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,730
So the addition,
as we've said to alkenes is electrophilic.

275
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:20,940
It goes after the Pi electrons,
the high homo.

276
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,890
So the proton with its low vacant orbital
electrostatically likes to be up on

277
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:27,450
top.
That's the best place to be.

278
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:32,040
If you're on the surface of the molecule
and when it's there, it can overlap, uh,

279
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,850
with this, uh, uh, Pi Star
that, but this Pi orbital.

280
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,970
So in the various textbooks you have,

281
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,150
you can read about this
electrophilic addition to alkanes.

282
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:45,120
I guarantee you there are
all these sections in there,

283
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,410
one about hydrogen haylight
edition by our plus by the cat eye.

284
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:53,130
And intermediate what we just
talked about on the previous slide,

285
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,220
there'll be discussion
of the regio chemistry,

286
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,460
which end the h plus adds two to give the
more stable cad I and intermediate and

287
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:06,981
there'll be discussion of hydration
where instead of the x minus being the

288
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:11,980
things adds to the h plus it's
the solvent water, right? The,

289
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,650
the unshared pair on oxygen can attack
the cat eye on as well and then lose a

290
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:21,330
proton so that it's Oah that
goes on instead of x minus.

291
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,180
So you can be reading that in your texts.

292
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:28,590
And this just to show an
example is from the uh,

293
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:29,700
uh,

294
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,720
lecture that I mentioned was given by
Professor Siegel last year where he talks

295
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:38,721
about how you can do this Markovnikov
addition chloride going into the more

296
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:41,820
substituted hi.
Ooh.

297
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,350
Going into the more substituted are
going to the more substituted when it's

298
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:50,830
clean, right? That is when you don't
have free radical initiators there.

299
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,900
Okay. So all of these form
by Proton first going here,

300
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,890
right to get this more stable
cad on intermediate. Uh,

301
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,530
and in this case with
dilute sulfuric acid,

302
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,550
it was water that came on to do this.
Okay.

303
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,900
And that mechanism is
shown here incidentally,

304
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,660
a on the exam,
the,

305
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:17,650
remember the last question was to draw
very careful curved arrows and everything

306
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:18,461
I give,

307
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:23,461
I put this up in part to give you fellow
feeling because we graded that very

308
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:24,604
rigorously.

309
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,170
When you draw a curved Arrow where
due to denote electron pair shifts,

310
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:30,640
where do you start the Arrow,

311
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,270
where the electrons are in the starting
material and where do you end the,

312
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,830
the point of the Arrow,

313
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,550
where are those electrons
are in the product?

314
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,930
Sometimes they will be on and Adam
become an an eye on or become an unshared

315
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:47,764
payer.

316
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,510
Sometimes they will be between two atoms
because you're forming a new bond and

317
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,060
if you want to be thinking
really clearly about it,

318
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,430
you should draw those arrows clearly.

319
00:21:57,431 --> 00:21:59,620
That's why I asked it
that way in the question.

320
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,790
But notice that professor Siegel
here in drawing some of these arrows,

321
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,310
drew it going onto the hydrogen,

322
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,820
he drew the x minus going onto the carbon
where I would expect you to draw this

323
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:16,891
curved Arrow ending between x and the
carbon and to position those two things

324
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:20,320
that are going to react
with one another in the,

325
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:24,220
in your drawing such that they're close
enough to one another that that makes

326
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:25,900
sense to end the Arrow between them,

327
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:30,220
not to have it off here in the Arrow
terminating in space just because it's

328
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:35,020
halfway between. So that's a lesson
that I hope that will become clear.

329
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,900
Okay, so this shows the case
of water intervening. Okay.

330
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,540
So, uh, there,

331
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,030
there are sections of the books about
the addition to hydrogen highlights about

332
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,230
regio selectivity,

333
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,470
about the intermediate cat ions that
are involved about cad and stability and

334
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:56,440
about cad. I and rearrangements, and I'll
talk about a few of those things here,

335
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,860
but you can review them in
your book as well. Okay.

336
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,110
First about cad I and stability.

337
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:05,080
I took this from the text we use
a couple of years ago by Loudon,

338
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,830
so he shows primary,
secondary and tertiary cad ions.

339
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:14,250
How many carbons are substituted on them
and says of the stability of Carbo cat

340
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:19,591
ions that tertiary is more stable than
secondary is more stable than primary.

341
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,800
This of course is the explanation
for Markovnikov cough orientation.

342
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,070
Now we can look at the rationale for that.
A rehearse it once again,

343
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:32,860
hyper conjugation says if you have high,

344
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,890
it's better to have a carbon on the carbon
cad ion with its hydrogen or whatever

345
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:39,730
else it's bonded to.

346
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:44,930
Then to have just the hydrogen and the
reason it's better is that there's some

347
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,100
kind of Hobo,

348
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,350
it's in position to have its electron
stabilized by that unusually low energy

349
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,460
Lumo the one associated
with the positive charge,

350
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:59,630
the vacant orbital on carbon and in the
case of hydrogen there are no electrons

351
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:03,260
to be stabilized. Those are our thoughts
funnel to this. But in this case,

352
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:06,650
the bought the sigma electrons
that are in the bond,

353
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:08,360
even though they aren't particularly high,

354
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,840
can interact with a really
unusually low orbital and,

355
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,560
and get some stabilization.
So we've talked about this before,

356
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:16,880
this hyper conjugation.

357
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,410
And it can be denoted by
writing a resonance structure,

358
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:26,411
which has a double bond
between the carbons and an h
plus or are plus if it's an

359
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:28,550
art group out there.

360
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:34,210
The other rationale for this order of
cad ions stability is bond energies.

361
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:36,500
And we've talked about this several times,

362
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:41,300
changing ch to CC bonds when they,
when you have this specially,

363
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,310
uh, advantageous sp square
hybridisation of the carbon.

364
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,060
But those are theory
and it's different to,

365
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,930
to know what the evidence is that they
actually have that order tertiary more

366
00:24:56,931 --> 00:25:00,950
stable than primary.
So the first part is the rationalization.

367
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,720
Now we have to say,

368
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,850
where do we actually get the evidence
that their stability is that way? Right?

369
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,990
And several people on the exam,
uh, when asked for evidence,

370
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,880
provided theory,

371
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:18,350
rationale like this rather than
actual numbers they have where,

372
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,300
where the evidence comes from.

373
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,630
So to get evidence you
have to compare something.

374
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,060
So you could compare, uh, products or,

375
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,430
or transition states that is,

376
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:36,431
you could look at reactivity if you have
a very unstable cat die and you would

377
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:39,530
expect it to be more reactive.
Right?

378
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:43,730
So that would be one way that you
could do it. Another way would be,

379
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,810
uh,
compare with the starting alkene you,

380
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,870
if it's easier to put a proton on that
will for that would indicate that the cat

381
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:55,880
died and you're leading to is more stable,
right?

382
00:25:55,881 --> 00:25:58,130
The cat ions uphill and energy typically.

383
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,720
But if it's a more stable cat eye
and it should be easier to form.

384
00:26:02,721 --> 00:26:07,721
So the reactions where you protonate the
alkene and should be easier or in the

385
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:12,710
reactions, we were just talking
about the, the sn one substitutions,

386
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,970
the ease of losing the anti in
order to generate the leaving group.

387
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:19,510
That is to say in order to
generate the carbon cat eye,

388
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,550
it should be easier when
the cat ion is more stable.

389
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:27,790
So we could do either of those
or we could compare directly,

390
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:32,180
compare the cat ions with one another,
right.

391
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:33,860
To see which one is more stable.

392
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,170
Now here's a table taken
from the textbook, uh,

393
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:44,970
which gives a table of the heats of,
of carbon cad ions,

394
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,910
uh, in the gas phase. So they're very
hard to make in the, in the gas phase.

395
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:56,750
And it says secondary vinyl cad ions
are more stable than primary vinyl cat

396
00:26:57,451 --> 00:27:00,180
ions.
Now what's the basis for that here

397
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,211
in the table?

398
00:27:04,211 --> 00:27:08,320
What's the basis for saying that secondary
vinyl cat ions are more stable than

399
00:27:08,321 --> 00:27:10,000
primary vinyl cad ions?

400
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,043
Yeah,

401
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:14,761
well,

402
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:19,761
we look up there and we see a primary
vinyl cad ion is in fact that the highest

403
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:22,770
energy of any of these right.

404
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,600
And the secondary vinyl cad iron is
also pretty high. I mean, it's, it's,

405
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,600
it's substituted, which, you
know, it's, it's secondary,

406
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:33,840
which should make it better
and indeed it is better. Okay.

407
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,610
So it says it's better by 54
kilocalories per mole in the gas phase.

408
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,560
Okay.

409
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,490
No, there's a problem with this,
with using this table in this way.

410
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,610
And the problem is compared to what?

411
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,550
Yeah.

412
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:54,550
Is this really saying that a primary
vinyl cad ion is more stable than a

413
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:59,000
secondary vinyl cat on compared to what

414
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,050
these heats of formation?
What are they compared to?

415
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,573
Yeah,

416
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:15,490
so this is the energy of the vital
cat eye and compared to what?

417
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,160
Yeah,

418
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,660
what's the heat of formation?
Hello?

419
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,120
Th th that's the heat of combustion.
It could have been heat of combustion.

420
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,790
We would add something to these
to get heat of combustion. Right.

421
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,910
But it's actually what's
given as a heat of formation.

422
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,243
Perfect.

423
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:39,110
Yeah. Compared to carbon and graphite
and hydrogen and h two gas at standard

424
00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:40,550
temperature and pressure and so on.

425
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,760
That is compared to the elements
in their standard states.

426
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,590
But notice that there are different
numbers of atoms in these things.

427
00:28:48,591 --> 00:28:50,480
They're not ice of one another.

428
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,860
So it's not that you can convert
one to the other and say that that,

429
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,450
that the heat, that this heat difference
shown here takes one to the other.

430
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,470
There you're comparing apples and oranges,
they're just not the same thing.

431
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,770
If you want to compare
with heats of formation,

432
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,150
they have to be things that are ice
verse of one another where you know their

433
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:15,020
energy relative to one another rather
than relative to something completely

434
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:18,170
different. Different
numbers of Adams. Okay,

435
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:23,470
so this particular table doesn't help you
at all directly in figuring out except

436
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:28,070
that there might be some
cases here like this one.

437
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:33,250
Notice that this was is a c four h nine
and this one is also c four h nine so

438
00:29:35,511 --> 00:29:40,370
here's a primary and a secondary which
differ by 20 kilocalories per mole in the

439
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:41,204
gas phase.

440
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:46,210
And that really does show that
secondary is more stable than primary.

441
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,560
But this table definitely doesn't show
that secondary vinyl cat ions are more

442
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:52,690
stable than primary vinyl cat ions.

443
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:57,040
So you have to think carefully about
compared to what here you're comparing two

444
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:59,950
different numbers of Adams
in their standard states,

445
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,200
not relative to each other,

446
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:07,480
nor are relative to their
respective starting materials
or products as we talked

447
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:08,350
about last time.

448
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:13,590
So this table in general is irrelevant
to the question of I and stability in the

449
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:16,870
sense that we were talking
about it in the previous slide.

450
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,410
Now on the other hand,

451
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:24,411
and it allowed near table 4.2 gives
the heats of formation of ISO Merrick,

452
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,430
butyl cad ions,
right?

453
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,310
So the same atoms they're being
compared to the same thing.

454
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,600
So differences between them now do
tell us the difference between primary,

455
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:39,190
secondary, and tertiary cat ions.
So here are the, here are the,

456
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,010
they got it from the same numbers,
heats of formation,

457
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,940
although in fact you'll find that these
numbers are slightly different from

458
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:48,940
those in the previous table. So one, one,

459
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,870
neither books says what the source
of these numbers is. So, uh,

460
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,580
these NIST values have been pretty
carefully gone through. So if I,

461
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,780
if push comes to shove, I often look
at those or ask Professor Weinberg,

462
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:04,030
what's the best value is okay.

463
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,930
But here you see that that uh,

464
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,940
the relative energy of the
tertiary beautiful cat ion is,

465
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,520
is taken a zero,

466
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:17,521
the most stable and now the others
are 16 or 32 or 37 kilocalories,

467
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,200
a less stable,
right?

468
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:25,030
So tertiary is more stable than
secondary is more stable than primary.

469
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:29,900
And here are two different primaries.
Now if we look at that too,

470
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,783
those two,

471
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,140
we see that going from primary
to secondary is a heat of,

472
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,200
is a difference of 21
kilocalories per mole.

473
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,680
37 to 16 primary is,

474
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:46,780
is less stable by 21
kilocalories per mole, okay?

475
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,500
Now remember that the reason for this
could be things like hyper conjugation or

476
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:59,290
the number of carbons bonded to
the SP squared carbon, right?

477
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,790
The same factors that we talked about
in the case of alkenes making more

478
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:06,810
substituted owl Keaton's more stable here,

479
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,190
more substituted cad ions are more stable,

480
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,590
but the difference is much bigger here.

481
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,510
21 kilocalories per mole versus two
and a half kilocalories per mole.

482
00:32:16,511 --> 00:32:19,930
From the slope of that plot we made
for the alkenes at the beginning of the

483
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:20,740
lecture.

484
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,740
So it's ever so much more important for
cad ions than it is for alkenes whatever

485
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:30,700
the factor is that's doing this. Okay.
So it could be hyper conjugation.

486
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,040
Would you expect that to be more stable,

487
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:38,110
more important for the cat ions shown
here or for the alkenes where the carbon

488
00:32:38,921 --> 00:32:40,640
is carbon carbon double bond.

489
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:45,350
You have the same factor that the carbon
carbon double bond here would have a

490
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:48,760
low Lubo. This has, uh, that, uh,

491
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,920
p orbital on carbon that has a Pi star,

492
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:55,850
orbital Alo Lumo and the same deal here.
Right.

493
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,230
Would you expect the, the, uh,

494
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:03,370
effect of that mixing Homo Lubo mixing
in hyper conjugation to be the same as,

495
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,960
as when you have a double bond,

496
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,850
which would be if one is bigger than the,

497
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,230
once that stabilization as bigger than
the other, which, so here we have,

498
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,433
uh,

499
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,640
here we have the electrons in a sigma
bond and here we have a vacant orbital.

500
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,550
In the case of the cat aisle,
we have just a vacant p orbital.

501
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,810
In the case of the double bond,
we have Pi star orbital,

502
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,790
right plus minus,

503
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:37,440
which one's going to give more
stabilization of these electrons?

504
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,230
What determines that?

505
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,730
What determines how much stabilization
you get out of mixing horribles there you

506
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:51,420
good
overlap is one thing now,

507
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:57,050
so it's a p orbital on carbon in either
case here in one case that p orbital is

508
00:33:57,061 --> 00:33:59,220
also associated with another PR battle.

509
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,990
So each of them is one over the square
root of two, so it's smaller in one case.

510
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,280
So there deed would be less
overlap in the case of of uh,

511
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:12,780
of the carbon carbon double bond rather
than just a full fledged p orbital.

512
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,420
So that's one factor. How
about another factor, Reagan?

513
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:20,700
How about the energy match
when you have a positive,

514
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,300
think about that carefully.
Say that again. Yeah.

515
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,840
The positive charge,

516
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:34,820
it makes the energy fabulously low
for the cad ion. The Pi's stars is,

517
00:34:34,821 --> 00:34:36,890
is low compared to sigma star,

518
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,730
but it's not really all that low
compared to the vacant orbital.

519
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,810
So both on the basis of overlap
and on the basis of energy match,

520
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:49,000
you expect a much bigger factor for
the cat I and the data for the alkene.

521
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:53,430
And in fact, that's what you see. It's
worth a heck of a lot more, right? Uh,

522
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:58,490
and but the bond energy factor might
be more or less similar between the two

523
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:02,570
because in both cases you're
changing c h DSCC single bonds.

524
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,600
But this is the one that should
make a really big difference.

525
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,390
But there's another
factor as well actually,

526
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,440
which is that these are
measured in the gas phase.

527
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:14,610
Alright?

528
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:19,020
So we have this positively charged
carbon in the gas phase in,

529
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,580
so we saw when we talked about the
ionization of water, how much difference,

530
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:28,610
how much of a effect salvation
has on the ability to form ions.

531
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,970
So here we're trying to form an
eye and on this carbon, right?

532
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,050
Could you see something that,
another difference among

533
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:44,040
about stables, about stabilization
by this positive charge,

534
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,920
other than hyper
conjugation and bond energy

535
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,893
haven,

536
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:01,240
it's the other stuff in the molecule.
The other three carbon atoms in there,

537
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:04,060
hydrogens are polarizable.

538
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,140
But remember that there's a
very strong distance dependence.

539
00:36:08,141 --> 00:36:11,710
You have to be really close to get
a lot of advantage out of that.

540
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,510
So with t butyl,

541
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,340
you have all the other atoms really
close to the positive charge to be

542
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:22,300
stabilized by polarization here. Uh, here,

543
00:36:22,301 --> 00:36:25,180
you have that one much further away.

544
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,600
Here you have two of them
significantly further away.

545
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,420
And here you have this one
significantly further away.

546
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:34,600
And this one off in left field,
right?

547
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,660
So we can see that there's
going to be in trauma,

548
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:42,220
molecular salvation that you might call
it, that nobody else calls it that.

549
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,660
But this effect from polarizability that's
going to in the gas phase is going to

550
00:36:46,661 --> 00:36:51,400
be very important. But if you go
into solution, it's just the reverse,

551
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,540
right? Because the, the,

552
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:58,541
the one that the primary one up
here has the positive charge,

553
00:36:59,141 --> 00:37:03,760
very exposed. So neighboring
molecules can get very close to that.

554
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,360
So in the gas phase,
it's the molecules within,

555
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:12,100
that's the Adams within the molecule
that are solid aiding the positive charge

556
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,510
and are electrons being stabilized.
But if you go into regular solution,

557
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,560
it turns around. So, so these, these, uh,

558
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,800
so these differences in the gas phase
are much bigger than the effects that you

559
00:37:26,771 --> 00:37:31,771
would actually see in a solution reaction
where the primary car cad ions are

560
00:37:33,371 --> 00:37:38,080
more stabilized by the surrounding
molecules. So for example, if you do sn,

561
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:43,081
one reaction t beautiful bromide is
only about five kilocalories per mole,

562
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,460
easier to ionize than ice appropriate
bromide that we saw in that,

563
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,270
that,
uh,

564
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,680
remember where a methyl ethyl
ice appropriate t butyl,

565
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:54,311
right?

566
00:37:54,311 --> 00:37:59,311
T butyl was unusually easy to do to
substitute because it went by sn one,

567
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:05,270
right? But if you looked at
the ice of propyl, it also, uh,

568
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,480
was going partly by sn one.

569
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:12,130
And it turns out that it's about five
kilocalories harder for ice appropriately.

570
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,720
But here,
the difference between a t butyl and,

571
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,830
and ice and the ice of the,

572
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:25,120
the equivalent of ice
appropriately is, uh, is,

573
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:28,540
is 16 kilocalories per mole,
right?

574
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,550
Or even more so.

575
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:35,320
So it's very strongly
attenuated and solution. So, uh,

576
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,380
people often talk about gas phase being
intrinsic values for four things you

577
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:46,360
could measure like the heats of formation
of these things that that's the ideal.

578
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,650
The reason it's ideal is you could
compare it with calculation, right?

579
00:38:50,651 --> 00:38:54,400
But it's not an ideal reference if
what you're interested in is predicting

580
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:58,840
reactions and solution where
that salvation is going to
make a lot of difference.

581
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,330
Okay. Now here's addition of, uh,

582
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,720
of Hcl to an Alkane.
Okay.

583
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:11,740
So is this mark off in the car
for Anti Markovnikov addition?

584
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,250
Natalie, what? Do you remember
what mark called [inaudible]?

585
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,740
Have you mark off the cough means?

586
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:29,750
Okay.

587
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,750
Does the an eye on the non hydrogen thing
go to the more substituted carbon in

588
00:39:36,621 --> 00:39:40,130
this case? Yeah, it
did. And why? Of course,

589
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,000
what we would expect is that
it would be attacked. Right?

590
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,110
And this would give the more substituted
cad I on rather than attacking the

591
00:39:48,111 --> 00:39:52,590
central carbon and having the primary
cad I is the intermediate, right?

592
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,440
Then chloride goes over and forms a
new bond and you have the product.

593
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:02,090
So that's Mark Hoffman a
cough edition by however,

594
00:40:02,091 --> 00:40:04,490
that's only 17% of the product.

595
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,020
The 83% of the product is that.

596
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,570
Can anybody see what's funny about that
product is that the anti Markovnikov

597
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,030
addition,
Natalie,

598
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,430
awesome.
Right?

599
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,670
I can't hear very well that part
of it is equally substituted.

600
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,533
Ah,

601
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:38,680
the, the substitution of the carbons
is different. What has happened,

602
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,240
we saw this before,

603
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,640
Chris will shit,

604
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,120
a vessel is shifted.
It's rearranged. In fact,

605
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,880
what shifts is a muscle group,

606
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:58,280
but it's a methyl with its electrons.
It's a meth.

607
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:03,140
I'd shift that. What you're talking
about, cad ions as you will see here.

608
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,750
So it's,
it's shifted the methyl across.

609
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,490
So what's happened is that
those pair of the electrons,

610
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,590
it's like hyper conjugation,
right?

611
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:17,790
That those sigma electrons are stabilized
by the vacant orbital on the carbon,

612
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:22,310
but they're stabilized so much
that the methyl with its electrons,

613
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,350
with those bonding electrons,
the method shifts across. Right?

614
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,910
And often if you want
to have fun when you,

615
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,100
sometimes when you a rearrangement,

616
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:38,780
you pro draw a little loop in the
Arrow in that cute. Okay. So the,

617
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:42,830
the meth I'd has shifted across
to give this more stable cat I,

618
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:47,000
and this was secondary.
This one is tertiary. Okay.

619
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,300
And then that gives 83% of the product.

620
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,440
So what this says is that
the rearrangement, the Meth,

621
00:41:54,441 --> 00:41:59,441
I'd shift competes with reaction
with the collapse of the ions,

622
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:04,040
chloride attacking the positive carbon.
So both things happen,

623
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,160
right?
And they have similar rates.

624
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,690
Now suppose you didn't have,

625
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,560
suppose you had a lot of
some other nucleophile.

626
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,330
They're like water right now.

627
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:22,331
The unshared pair of water could fill
the role that chloride filled here and

628
00:42:22,611 --> 00:42:27,611
then lose protons that you've got h o t
a h two o plus than it loses a proton.

629
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:33,290
So you could get this alcohol or
you can get the rearranged alcohol.

630
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,530
So the fact of this
rearrangement is of course,

631
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:41,930
additional evidence that you had the cat
eye and intermediate as it was in a sn.

632
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:44,630
One reactions where, where the, uh,

633
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,900
rearrange skeleton showed that there
had been a cat eye and intermediate.

634
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:54,550
Uh, so when you do, uh, uh,

635
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,960
acid catalyzed hydration of a double bond,
addy,

636
00:42:58,961 --> 00:43:01,070
h and o h,
uh,

637
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,970
you have to be aware that there's
the possibility of rearrangement.

638
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:09,550
If the skeleton is one where you
would form one cat ion, but then, uh,

639
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:12,080
uh,
some of method shift could get,

640
00:43:12,081 --> 00:43:15,160
or a hydride shift could
give a more stable one.

641
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:21,560
Now let's look at the influence
of Halogen in, in these, uh,

642
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,760
cat ions.

643
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,500
So here we start with
a settling and at Hcl,

644
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,173
right?

645
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:33,820
So we've started to give the
more substituted vinyl cad ion.

646
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,960
Remember the table we talked,

647
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:41,030
it said primary vinyl cat ions are less
stable than secondary vinyl cat ions,

648
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:45,230
even though the data didn't, was not
the appropriate data to support that.

649
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,880
It's absolutely true that vinyl
cat ions are very hard to make,

650
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:55,220
right? So this is not such an easy
process, but then it can add chloride.

651
00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:00,170
So you have, uh, this, uh, this product,

652
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:03,010
which is the Markovnikov product,
the,

653
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:08,390
the Proton added to the terminal carbon
to make the more stable secondary rather

654
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:12,260
than adding to the central carbon to
make the less stable primary cad. I,

655
00:44:12,261 --> 00:44:17,200
and so the chloride ends up there and
this is perfectly reasonable. Okay.

656
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,570
But it went by way of
this unstable vinyl cad I,

657
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:25,040
and so it turns out that this,
that audition, this kind of, uh,

658
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,460
electrophilic addition to alkenes is a
hundred to a thousand times slower than

659
00:44:33,251 --> 00:44:38,251
it to alkanes is 102 party to al kinds
is a hundred to a thousand times slower

660
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:40,620
than to alkenes.

661
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,650
It's much harder to add to triple bonds
the double bonds because you get these

662
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:49,890
unfavorable vinyl cat high
and intermediate. Well, fine,

663
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:56,040
but now we have a double
bond. Okay, so you could do,

664
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:59,570
and we had Markovnikov for ego chemistry,
but you,

665
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,580
if you have excess hcl you can,

666
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:07,560
you can add it again and yet
a second Markovnikov addition.

667
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,840
Okay.
Uh,

668
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:15,360
now suppose you didn't
have an excess of HCL.

669
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,020
Suppose you just had
one equivalent of HCL.

670
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,950
What products would you expect?
What products would you expect to get

671
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,510
Jack? Pardon? It's still bad.

672
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,380
Why still that
double bond?

673
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:35,430
The double bond is easier to
attack from the triple bond.

674
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,340
So if you didn't have enough hcl,

675
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:42,780
still this would be much more reactive
than this. After you formed any of that,

676
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,640
it will be reacting a hundred
to a thousand times faster
per molecules and that

677
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:52,590
did, so you're still going to get
this product Jack's right. Okay.

678
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:57,780
Uh, now these were on under certain
conditions. These are the, uh,

679
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,550
the yield you got.
It was 56% and 44%.

680
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,270
I suspect that if the reaction
had been carried on longer,

681
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:10,500
you would get do what Jack did. You
get, well, you'd go all the way there,

682
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,040
but under certain conditions at least
the reaction was interrupted and that was

683
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:17,880
the product distribution.

684
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,040
Now it went obviously by way of
this cat eye and intermediate.

685
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:27,880
The second step protonated
to give this substituted cat.

686
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:29,970
Now we have a question.

687
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:36,050
Is the halogen as a substituent favorable
or unfavorable for purposes of forming

688
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:39,834
the cad?
I am.

689
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,773
Okay.

690
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:55,580
Jack helped us out again here.
What does this say was this seconds,

691
00:46:55,650 --> 00:47:00,000
was the second step what you
expected it to be in terms of rate?

692
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:10,830
Is it usually faster, unusually
slow compared to what you expected?

693
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,810
Fast slow.

694
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:21,120
What did you say before you
said the product that this
should react to a hundred

695
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,350
to a thousand,
be in a double bond,

696
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,590
should react to a hundred to a
thousand times faster than this.

697
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:30,400
Did it react to 100,000, a
hundred to a thousand times? No,

698
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:35,290
it didn't react any faster at all.
Right? Or roughly the same. Right.

699
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:40,180
So for some reason this was
slowed down by, you know,

700
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:45,160
some, several powers of 10, right?
What could have slowed it down?

701
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:47,803
Exploring?

702
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,890
It could be because of the chlorine.
It could be hard to stay to get a cat.

703
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,050
I did that.
Would that make sense to you?

704
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:58,940
Why? Cause the, uh, has a lecturer.

705
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:05,600
Now the question is how hard is
it going to be to form this cat?

706
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:10,020
I'd write that which was was, which we
did by putting a proton on that carbon,

707
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,650
right? The alkene carbon gets
a proton, gets that cat eye it.

708
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:17,970
So is it harder that Sebastian,
what do you say?

709
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:25,180
What effect do you think the chlorine,
sorry.

710
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,560
The sigma bonds is electron withdrawing,
right?

711
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:35,930
Fewer the electrons around the carbon
are lower in energy because they've been

712
00:48:35,931 --> 00:48:39,740
sucked away by the chloride,
so it's harder to form the cad ions.

713
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:44,540
So that's what we, that that would
explain why we get this ratio here.

714
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,360
Okay.
That this second step,

715
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:50,960
even though it's an alkene and
should be enormously faster,

716
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:54,920
is not any faster because this chlorine
slowing it down by pulling electrons

717
00:48:54,921 --> 00:48:59,210
away. It can't provide electrons
to the Proton. Now Sebastian,

718
00:48:59,211 --> 00:49:02,570
keep going for us.
How about the regio chemistry?

719
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:08,730
So the second step is slow, right?
That's what we were just talking about.

720
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,940
How about the regio
chemistry of the second step,

721
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:17,740
and this isn't Markov in
the Coffer Anti Markovnikov

722
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:24,170
that is the proton could have added here
to give this cat ion or it could have

723
00:49:25,261 --> 00:49:29,550
added to the central carbon to give
the other cat island, which did it do.

724
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,590
Did the new chlorine go on?

725
00:49:31,591 --> 00:49:36,050
The more substituted or the less
substituted other more substitutes.

726
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,180
So it,
the chlorine slows it down,

727
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:45,590
but it's still Markovnikov this cat die
and is better to get than the other cad

728
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:46,894
I am,

729
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,570
yes.
Right now you might

730
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,540
say,
Aha,

731
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:00,200
the choice here is between a secondary,

732
00:50:00,201 --> 00:50:03,830
whatever the chlorine is and a
primary and primaries are bad to get.

733
00:50:03,831 --> 00:50:06,890
You don't want to protonate the set in
the center of one cause it'd be a primary

734
00:50:06,891 --> 00:50:07,724
cad ion.

735
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:12,970
But notice here with Hbr when
it the outlet symmetrical,

736
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,420
right? Still the two bro
means go to the same place.

737
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:24,730
So the, it looks like the chlorine
is welcoming the formation of a cad.

738
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:29,731
I am or the at least bromine in this case
as welcoming formation of that cad ion

739
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:35,540
rather than cat I in it then that cat
ion and add in the second proton. Right?

740
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:40,220
So the answer is yes.
Right?

741
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:44,900
Is it favorable or
unfavorable? It's both, right?

742
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:49,100
It's hard to make the cat eye and
because of the single sigma electron

743
00:50:49,101 --> 00:50:53,840
withdrawal, but if you form the cad
ion, where do you want to form it

744
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:59,690
next to the chlorine? Why
Chris? Do you have an idea?

745
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:04,050
If you're going to get a car,
if you're forced to make a cat eye.

746
00:51:04,051 --> 00:51:08,030
And he say in this case when you put that
second bromine and you could have made

747
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,650
the cat eye on either here or here,

748
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:14,450
both of them with respect to the carbon
would be secondary. But this one,

749
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,710
the one you actually form where the
bromide comes in has a bromine on it.

750
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:23,150
Why? It's hard to form it, right?

751
00:51:23,151 --> 00:51:25,790
Because of the sigma bonds
or electron withdrawing.

752
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,820
But if you form it format
next to the bromine, why

753
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,291
it makes it even more.

754
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:35,090
The polarizability is a good point and
that wasn't what I was thinking of,

755
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,040
but it's a good point.
What else?

756
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:43,190
Lone pairs on the halogen can be
stabilized by overlapping, right?

757
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:47,000
So you get resonance stabilization.
So if you're going to make it,

758
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,400
make it where you can get
help in the Pi system. Okay.

759
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:55,310
So that's really I think interesting about
about the halogens that they could be

760
00:51:55,311 --> 00:52:00,311
deactivating but still want to have the
cat eye and next to them because of the

761
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:04,790
different role of the sigma electrons
and the pile electrons. Okay.

762
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,320
Thanks for sticking around here.
