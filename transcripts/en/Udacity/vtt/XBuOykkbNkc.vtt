00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.719
At this point, you know how to graph
a line if you know its slope and

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:05.900
one point that exists on that line.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.540
Now we're going to talk about
a common representation

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.498
of the equation of a line and
that's called the slope intercept form.

00:00:11.498 --> 00:00:14.180
And before we dive into the details,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.600
let's start with the question
to get us thinking.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.760
Which of the following graphs
has a slope of two-thirds and

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.050
goes through the point 0, 4?

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.070
Choose the correct graph.
