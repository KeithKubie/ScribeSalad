00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.639
Our perception of the world around us is
strongly linked to our vision.

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.759
But how do you know what you're seeing
is real? Can you really trust your eyes?

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.870
Take for example these two grey
rectangular columns,

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.040
both of which are different shades of
grey. Or are they?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.100
It turns out that they're the exact same.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.600
And yet, even after knowing the illusion is there

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.000
your eyes refused to see them as the
same.

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.640
Introducing colors produces the same result.

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:26.970
I promise no trick photography or
editing effects have been applied.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.600
In fact, if you look up the Munker-White
illusion,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.829
you'll come across many more examples.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.920
Examine them in Photoshop and you can
see that the colors are the exact same.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.490
A similar effect can be seen with this
checkerboard illusion.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.960
Tile A clearly seems darker than tile B.
But you know better by now, right?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.490
Even though your eyes can't see it, you
know when I removed the surrounding imagery

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.780
the tiles will be the same color. So
what's going on here?

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.270
The truth is that scientists don't fully
understand this phenomenon,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.310
and there are many complex biological
and neurological factors taking place.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.910
Ultimately, our brains judge color and
brightness in context.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.700
In other words, our brains compare the
surrounding environment

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.660
in order to create our perception.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.359
The purpose of our senses or eyes in this case,

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:14.350
is not to provide us with an absolute
color or physical property of our external reality,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.520
but to interpret what we see as
efficiently as possible

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.560
in order to interact with the
environment most appropriately.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.490
The tile illusion takes advantage of this
phenomenon.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.659
Our brains know that shadows make
objects look darker,

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.219
as a result the brain compensates by
interpreting the tile as being lighter

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.359
than it appears until we take the shadow away.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:35.859
Perhaps, the most blatant example

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:37.079
is this gradient.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.680
The middle bar is simply one color.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.990
Remove the background gradient and it
becomes obvious. Once again,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.600
the darkness of the background has
affected our perception of the bar's color.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.740
Our perception is relative.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.980
So do you still trust your eyes?

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.370
Got a burning question you want answered?
