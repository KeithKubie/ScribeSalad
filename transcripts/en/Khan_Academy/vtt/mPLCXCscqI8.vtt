00:00:00.287 --> 00:00:02.771
- Grandma Millie is shrinking.

00:00:02.771 --> 00:00:07.771
Her height decreases by a
quarter centimeter each year.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.026
She want to predict the
total change in her height

00:00:12.687 --> 00:00:15.040
over the next three years.

00:00:15.228 --> 00:00:16.842
Which of the following equations

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:19.162
matches the situation above?

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.068
Her height is decreasing.

00:00:21.068 --> 00:00:23.808
We can view that as either
changing her height each year

00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:26.222
is a negative fourth of a centimeter.

00:00:26.222 --> 00:00:27.963
That's going to happen for three years.

00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:30.703
We multiply negative
one-fourth times three.

00:00:30.703 --> 00:00:33.049
Which is exactly what's
happening in this first choice

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:34.139
right over here.

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:38.202
Her height is decreasing by a
quarter centimeter each year,

00:00:38.202 --> 00:00:40.048
that's this part right over here.

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:43.397
She's doing this for three years.

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:44.371
After three years,

00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:47.081
her change in height would
be negative three-fourth

00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:48.218
of a centimeter.

00:00:48.218 --> 00:00:49.448
You just multiply this out,

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:53.382
which means that she lost
three-fourths of a centimeter.

00:00:53.628 --> 00:00:55.404
The second choice would evaluate,

00:00:55.404 --> 00:00:57.983
if you multiply positive
one-fourth times negative three,

00:00:57.983 --> 00:00:59.700
you still get negative three-fourths,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.102
but this doesn't seem
to follow as naturally

00:01:02.102 --> 00:01:03.658
from this statement up here.

00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:05.318
We're decreasing by a fourth.

00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:06.805
I like putting the negative
in front of the fourth,

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:09.601
and then we're going in
forward in time by three years.

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:12.144
It feels weird to put a
negative on the three.

00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:14.850
We're not backwards in time here.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.682
Even though this expression
evaluates to the same

00:01:17.682 --> 00:01:18.843
things as this first one,

00:01:18.843 --> 00:01:20.619
the first one seems to better match

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.440
what this statement is describing.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.147
I wouldn't pick none of the above

00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:27.225
just because I found one that I like,

00:01:27.225 --> 00:01:29.500
that I think that describes
the equation that matches

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.240
the situation above.

00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:32.946
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:33.783 --> 00:01:37.009
A zombie lost three limbs
each day for four days.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.276
He's going to lose 12
limbs, three times four.

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.984
It's not a human zombie.

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:45.433
It's an alien zombie that has
at least 12 limbs to lose.

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:47.929
The following equation
describes this situation.

00:01:48.713 --> 00:01:51.590
The zombie lost three limbs each day.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.769
Lost three limbs.

00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:54.291
A negative three could represent,

00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:56.763
hey I'm losing three limbs.

00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:58.109
The negative is going ...

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.235
my number of limbs is going down by three.

00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:02.699
This is negative three.

00:02:04.114 --> 00:02:06.166
It's dong that for four days.

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:07.441
For four days.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.697
We have negative 12,

00:02:08.697 --> 00:02:11.820
which is the total number of
limbs that our zombie loses.

00:02:13.035 --> 00:02:14.222
What does negative 12 tell us?

00:02:14.222 --> 00:02:15.187
Well, I just said it.

00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:19.482
The zombie lost a total of 12
limbs over this time period.

00:02:19.482 --> 00:02:20.630
That looks right.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.070
Now, let's see what are these other one.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.450
The zombie has negative 12 limbs.

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:25.868
Well, no.

00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:27.339
To have negative 12 ...

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:29.801
I don't even know a
negative limb would be.

00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:32.296
We don't know how many limbs
the zombie started with.

00:02:32.296 --> 00:02:33.261
The zombie, I don't know,

00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:35.792
it might be some type of
centipede zombie or something.

00:02:35.792 --> 00:02:37.811
It might have had a hundred limbs,

00:02:37.811 --> 00:02:39.692
and if it lost 12 of them,

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:43.059
it would now have 88 limbs.

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:44.695
The zombie might have had 12 limbs,

00:02:44.695 --> 00:02:46.298
and now it has a zero limbs.

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:48.932
In fact, I don't even know
how you get to negative limbs.

00:02:48.932 --> 00:02:50.778
I don't think this makes sense.

00:02:50.778 --> 00:02:51.917
I'm not going to pick none of the above,

00:02:51.917 --> 00:02:53.832
because I agree with this first choice.

00:02:53.832 --> 00:02:55.734
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:58.492 --> 00:03:01.993
All right, a certain reality TV show

00:03:01.993 --> 00:03:04.013
lost, so we're losing,

00:03:04.013 --> 00:03:07.135
so a negative might be a nice
way to represent the lost,

00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:10.467
lost a total of 9,000 viewers over

00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:12.625
the past three months.

00:03:12.987 --> 00:03:14.021
Over three months.

00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:16.319
It lost the same number
of viewers each month.

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.778
The following equation
describes the situation.

00:03:20.654 --> 00:03:23.215
It lost a total of 9,000 viewers,

00:03:23.215 --> 00:03:25.360
and it did it over three months.

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:27.287
What they're figuring out here is,

00:03:28.347 --> 00:03:30.066
what was the change in viewership.

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:32.840
What was the change in
viewership per month?

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.780
It tells us ...

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.705
the negative 3,000 tells us
that they lost on average ...

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.752
it actually tells us they
lost the same number.

00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:40.832
This is actually ...

00:03:40.832 --> 00:03:42.051
it's the same number every month.

00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:45.707
They actually lost 3,000
viewers every month.

00:03:45.707 --> 00:03:48.411
Let's see which of these
choices match up to that.

00:03:48.587 --> 00:03:51.245
There are 3,000 fewer
people watching the show

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:53.207
compared to three months ago.

00:03:53.207 --> 00:03:55.855
No, they lost 3,000 every month.

00:03:55.855 --> 00:03:56.852
That's what this is telling us.

00:03:56.852 --> 00:03:58.431
Every month for three months.

00:03:58.431 --> 00:03:59.872
There's a same number each month.

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.764
They lost 3,000 every
month for three months

00:04:01.764 --> 00:04:03.307
for a total of 9,000.

00:04:03.307 --> 00:04:04.410
This isn't right.

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.539
The total change in the number of people

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:09.940
watching the show is negative 3,000.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.647
Over a month that would be true,

00:04:11.647 --> 00:04:13.481
but the total change was 9,000,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.149
or a negative 9,00 I guess I could say.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.419
They lost 9,000.

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.716
I would say none of the above.

00:04:20.847 --> 00:04:22.657
Well, the negative 3,000 tells us

00:04:22.657 --> 00:04:24.003
that there was a choice that said,

00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:27.416
each month they lost 3,000 viewers.

00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:29.227
That's the choice that I would pick.

00:04:29.995 --> 00:04:33.139
I would say none of the above.
