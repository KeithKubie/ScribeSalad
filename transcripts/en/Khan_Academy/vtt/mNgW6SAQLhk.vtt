00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.290
Let's say we we're told that
the position of a particle

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.630
can be figured out
from, or the position

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.370
of a particle as
a function of time

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.959
is given by this
crazy expression.

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:11.750
The position could be
positive or negative.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.400
And this expression is t minus
a, times a minus t, times

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.700
t minus a, times t
minus b, all of that

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.580
over the square root of
a squared plus b squared.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.230
And they also tell
us that c is greater

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.540
than b, is greater than
a, is greater than 0.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.900
So given that information,
we have two statements

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.850
right over here.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.820
We have the position at times
c on the left hand side.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.330
And over here, we have
the number of times

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.550
that our function is equal to 0,
the number of times that p of t

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.900
is equal to 0.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.270
What I want you to do is
pause the video right now

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.800
and think about which
of these statements

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.420
provides a larger value.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.970
Is p of c greater than or less
than the number of times p of t

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.010
equals 0?

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.640
And I guess a third and fourth
option would be that you maybe

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.640
don't have enough information
to figure this out

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.140
or maybe that these are equal.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.490
So I encourage you to
figure that out right now.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.630
Which of these are larger?

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.213
Or do you not have
enough information?

00:01:09.213 --> 00:01:11.170
Or are they equal?

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.630
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.630
So let's think
about each of them.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.530
So let's think about
what p of c is.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.520
So p of c is going to
be equal to, right here

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.480
p-- I don't want to
arbitrarily switch

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.260
colors, which I sometimes do.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.680
p of c is going to be
equal to, let's see.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.440
It's going to be c minus a.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.810
I'll do this all
in this one color.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.880
It's going to be c minus
a, times a minus c, times

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.700
c minus a, times c
minus b, all of that

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.860
over the square root of
a squared plus b squared.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.774
So what do we know
about this quantity?

00:01:56.774 --> 00:01:58.940
What do we know about this
quantity right over here?

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.315
Let me highlight
all the Cs here.

00:02:00.315 --> 00:02:05.860
So c minus a, a minus
c, c minus a, c minus b.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.199
Well, they tell us that
c is larger than a and b

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.209
and that they're all positive.

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.000
So maybe we can come
up with some statement

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.550
about whether this thing
is positive or negative,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.650
whether this expression is.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.930
So what's c minus a going to be?

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.300
Well, c is greater than a.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.790
So this is going to be positive.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.280
What about a minus c?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.100
Well, a is less than c.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.010
So this is going to result
in a negative number.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.130
c minus a, well, this is
going to be a positive again.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.170
And then c minus b is also
going to be a positive.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.487
c is greater than both b and a.

00:02:41.487 --> 00:02:43.320
And what do we have
here in the denominator?

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.028
Well, the square root
of a squared plus b

00:02:45.028 --> 00:02:49.370
squared, well, this is just
going to be a positive value.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.850
So what do we have
going on here?

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.040
Here in the numerator, I have
a positive times a negative,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.580
times a positive,
times a positive.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.200
So what's that going to be?

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.242
Well, that's going
to be a negative.

00:02:58.242 --> 00:03:00.700
A positive, times a positive,
times a positive is positive.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.450
And then you throw
that negative in there.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.840
So you're going to get a
negative over a positive.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.290
And what's a negative
divided by a positive?

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.560
Well, that's going
to be a negative.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.470
So we don't know what
the actual value is.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.790
But all we do know is
that this provides us

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.240
with a negative value.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.872
So this ends up being
a positive value.

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:27.330
Then we could make a statement
that this, we just say, hey,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.770
this is a negative
value as well.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.478
But we might not have
enough information.

00:03:30.478 --> 00:03:34.190
So let's think about the number
of times p of t is equal to 0.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.600
Well, p of t is
equal to 0 whenever

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.840
the numerator right
over here is equal to 0.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.190
And when would the
numerator equal 0?

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.940
Well, I have the product of
this 1, 2, 3, 4 expression.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.640
So if any one of these
expressions is 0,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.570
then the entire numerator
is going to be 0.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.740
So let's think about how you
can make these expressions 0.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.100
So the expression could be 0.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.340
This will be 0 if
t is equal to a.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.880
This would also be 0
if t is equal to a.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.440
And this would also be
0 if t is equal to a.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.450
And this would be 0
if t is equal to b.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.860
So there's two values
for t that will

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.180
make this numerator equal to
0, t equals a or t equals b.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.589
So there's two times.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:25.345
So the number of times that
p of t is equal to 0 is two.

00:04:25.345 --> 00:04:26.720
So now let's answer
our question.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.110
What is larger, the number
2, is the number positive 2,

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.230
versus some negative number?

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.000
Well, 2 is larger than
any negative number.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.630
So this is the larger quantity.
