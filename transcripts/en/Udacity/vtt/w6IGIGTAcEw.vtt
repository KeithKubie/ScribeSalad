00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.170
Student Trupp asks,

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.610
"What are some of the ethics and responsibilities involved

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.670
with knowing how to program--

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.450
and empowering yourself the knowledge of computer science?"

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.810
&gt;&gt;So, this is a great question

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.610
and it is something that is very important to think about.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.850
I don't know if it was Batman or Spiderman who said this,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.120
"With great power, comes great responsibility."

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.890
&gt;&gt;Spiderman. &gt;&gt; Was it Spiderman? Okay. I'm a little rusty. &gt;&gt; It wasn't him, Alright...&gt;&gt;

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.260
&gt;&gt;Anyway, it's true, that as you gain more power,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.230
and as you learn more about computing,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.660
there's a lot of responsibility that goes along with that.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.600
And, one concrete example of that I'll give you from building a web crawler--

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.040
The web crawler we're building is focused on simplicity.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.470
If you build a web crawler and you run it on the Internet,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.940
there's a lot of things that you need to do to be ethical and responsible.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.880
One is, every time you encounter a new site

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.680
the web crawler should look for this file called robots.txt

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.790
which says whether or not the site wants to be crawled.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.490
If you are an ethical web crawler, you don't index a site that says---

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.760
in the roblox.text "don't crawl this site."

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.130
Those things make the web crawler more complicated.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.130
Our goal is to understand computer science,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.530
and make the web crawler code as simple as possible,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.600
so we're not going to do that in our web crawler,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.440
and when you run them on our server--

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.810
we're not going to allow your web crawler to make arbitrary requests

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.310
to other sites on the Internet.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.840
But certainly, if you run it yourself, these are things that you should worry about,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.910
and make sure to behave responsibly.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.550
We're definitely going to talk about this more

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.680
towards the end of the class.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.000
This will be one of the things that we get in to in unit 7.
