00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
[GAVEL POUNDING]

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.550
 Welcome back, everyone.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.370
After a very exciting
first session,

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.410
I can tell you that the
regents collectively

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.990
have expressed a great
deal of excitement

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.230
about what they've heard here.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.840
We've had quite a
few looks at this

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.230
thanks to President Robbins'
senior team checking in

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.160
with us.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.890
So seeing it all come
together and being

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.130
presented in the
way it was presented

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.220
has really been
rewarding for us.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.690
Many of our questions
were answered

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.730
before we got here today.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.490
So don't misread our
lack of questions

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.980
as our lack of support or
a lack of true excitement

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.630
about what we're seeing.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.130
Quite the contrary.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.900
This group is not shy.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.030
And if we see things that
we have questions about,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.530
President Robbins, you
know you'll hear from us.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.500
I think you can take
the fact that you've

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.390
become a student-centered
plan and the exciting new

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.910
initiatives that you outlined
are quite exciting for us

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.410
as well.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.720
And we support the
pillar one and two.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.711
So, please.

00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:09.210
 All right.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.820
So we're 15 minutes behind time.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.240
I know I'm focusing on time.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.120
But I want you to be able to
get to where you need to be.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.600
Is today Friday?

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.620
I think it is Friday.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.570
Yeah.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.190
Friday, you know, we need
to stop by 1:00 on Friday.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.260
So this third pillar gets us
into our people, our place,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.650
but it's reimagining
the land grant

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.740
university in the Fourth
Industrial Revolution.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.060
And we've talked about President
Crow's the New American

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.745
University, and
what's our tag line.

00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:49.260
I think that it would
be the Land Grant

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.600
University in the Fourth
Industrial Revolution,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.180
and to be able to do all the
things that we talked about

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.050
in the first two pillars.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.410
This one really focuses on our
service to the state of Arizona

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.630
through our land grant mission
to our people, to the place,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.750
to the soul that is
in southern Arizona,

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.240
and all of the
connectivity that we have

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.500
across all of those assets.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.130
So here are the goals.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.700
We've talked about
earlier on in pillar 1

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.640
the graduation and
retention goals.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.090
You'll see that we've called
out our Hispanic Serving

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.460
Institution
initiative, our service

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.710
to our Native American students.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.390
And then we'll end on
economic development

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.170
and how we think that we can
do even better than we're

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.260
doing currently, which
is actually much better

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.490
than I thought we were doing.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.750
So we'll get there.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.320
So what's the idea around
this new land grant

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.800
university for the fourth
Industrial Revolution?

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.480
If you go back, we talk
about the moral act

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.360
in serving around agriculture
and the mechanical arts,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.830
engineering.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.700
But now, as things are
changing very rapidly,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.970
we need to apply
those new principles

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.330
to what it means to be a
new land grant university.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.870
And how we can continue
to foster development

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.580
of the entrepreneurial spirit of
this university and the state.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.090
Increase our innovation in
economic development resources

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.260
and investment.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.740
And then another point
that I was alluding to

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.240
in the first phase was how
can we, as an enterprise,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.260
collaborate across our
three universities?

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.500
So this shows one of
the great strengths,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.230
as I was talking
about earlier, is

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.600
the enormously diverse makeup
that we have at the university.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.890
Students from every state in
the union and many countries

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.410
from around the world.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.040
And I would say that
we have dedicated sites

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.680
for each one of these
centers to operate.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.620
But they are
woefully inadequate.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.500
I would like to see
a separate building

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.710
for each one of
these interest groups

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.250
so that they can have their
own living and learning space,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.620
and they can be more successful.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.025
And I think it's a
competitive advantage for us.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:37.140
It makes us stronger.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.210
And it will also, investment
in these different diversity

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.390
and inclusion
centers will help us

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.110
with retention and
graduation rate.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.690
The fact that this last year,
we received the designation

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.570
of a Hispanic
Serving Institution--

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.180
you'll see Marla Franco
on a video later, who's

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.080
been elevated to a
associate vise provost

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.520
role for Hispanic initiatives.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.840
And I think that shows
how important this

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.550
is to the institution.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.190
We're only the third
AAU University.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.790
And remember, there are
only 60 AAU universities

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.260
in the United States--

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.630
Harvard, Princeton, Yale,
Stanford, University

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.260
of Arizona.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.200
We're the only third AAU to
achieve this designation.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.050
It's a sense of great
pride for the university.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.850
There was a lot of work
put into this over decades.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.250
And it allows us to recruit
better students, better faculty

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.230
that are focused in the
areas of advancing our Latino

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.420
and Hispanic missions,
and it also opens us up

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.660
to new funding at
the federal level

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.170
that we didn't have
access to earlier.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.680
Additionally, we have Rebecca
Tsosie that was at our table

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.680
this morning with Regent
Heiler and others,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.330
and talking about the
incredible opportunity

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.600
for our Native
American students.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.040
And I think that unlike
other states where

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.930
we have the largest
concentration

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.710
of Native American students
than any other state,

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.520
we have programs that
are already in place.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.120
We've got we've got a
long and rich history

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.770
at the University of Arizona of
educating our native students.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.780
But we must do better.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.260
We need to go to
the tribal lands

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.980
and develop deep and meaningful
relationships and partnerships

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.060
to help them in their
K through 12 education.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.940
And as I said before, even the
community college at the Tohono

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.740
O'odham Nation, to help
them to get students to us,

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.310
and provide programs, and
understand their needs so

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.670
that they can be successful
and either go back

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.510
to lead in their
tribes, or to go out

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.300
and be leaders across
all of society.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.360
I think there's a great
opportunity for us

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.090
to have an annual
summit, probably

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.640
in this ballroom, where we bring
all 22 leaders of our Arizona

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.870
nations together.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.770
And I would even say other
nations outside of Arizona

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.950
in the southwest.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.320
It could be a
national conference

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.250
that could show our
leadership, and how

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.780
we have best
practices in educating

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.100
our native population.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.060
So this next video, you're
going to see Rebecca talk

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:01.520
about our efforts around
inclusion and excellence.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.220
Rob Williams, who's
on this video,

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:11.780
is one of the eminent and
probably the most accomplished

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.720
attorneys and law professors
on indigenous people law.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.760
And I appreciate
them and Marla Franco

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.560
being part of this video.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.060
These are very important
initiatives to the university.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.250
These things make us
stronger and give us

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.073
a competitive advantage,
as I've said before.

00:08:31.073 --> 00:08:31.980
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.140
 Here at the
University of Arizona,

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.289
we're here to affirm
that diversity

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:41.520
is who we are as
a human community

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.990
and as a university community.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.365
We love each of our students.

00:08:46.365 --> 00:08:48.300
And I can't even
tell you how happy

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.080
it makes me to go into a group
and see students from here,

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.970
students from
around the country,

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.690
and students from around the
world who have chosen to study

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.630
at the University of Arizona.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.900
 One of the things that
HSIs across the nation

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.490
continue to ask themselves
is what does it mean to be

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.170
a Hispanic Serving Institution?

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.970
And one of the things that I'm
most proud about in the work

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.660
that we have just only begun
at the University of Arizona

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.510
is I'm proud to say that
we certainly are committed

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.360
towards putting the S HSI.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.310
We are going to put serving in
Hispanic Serving Institution.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.990
 Having been here 30 years--

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.870
and actually, this is my
third strategic plan--

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.042
I have to admit,
this one's different.

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:37.500
The people that
we're working with.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.140
The teams that have
been assembled.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.630
The input that's been gathered.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.240
Building support
among stakeholders.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.040
Talking to tribes,
and excitement

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.150
in our communities
about this process,

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.400
about the possible outcomes.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.694
This makes me very
optimistic, and very excited

00:09:52.694 --> 00:09:53.610
to keep working on it.

00:09:56.556 --> 00:09:58.029
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.605
 Another thing that permeates
across the entire plan

00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:06.280
are the arts.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.920
We're blessed-- I think
President Schaefer had

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.180
to leave.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.770
He probably didn't
want to see what he

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.625
looked like in a younger age.

00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:14.857
Oh, are you still there?

00:10:14.857 --> 00:10:15.440
There you are.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.770
Do you recognize that guy?

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.870
This is a young
President Schaefer.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.330
As I said, he
started in his 30s.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.780
And I've told him that
if he wants to come back,

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.620
I'll take a sabbatical, and
he can go back to the job.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.850
But there he is with
his friend Ansel Adams.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:37.120
And he was key of bringing
Ansel Adams' collection here,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:42.070
and making the Center for
Creative Photography one

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.040
of the worldwide
international treasures

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.410
in the field of photography.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.320
But we have a new
Dean, Andy Schulz.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.150
I thought I saw
Andy here earlier.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.570
And we're incredibly
lucky to have him.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:00.880
And we're going to have him
be more than just the dean

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.830
of fine arts, but
the vise president

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.820
for fine arts across
the university,

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.120
emphasizing that the arts
needs to permeate everything

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.120
we do across the curriculum,
across the culture

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.770
of the university.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.010
Of course, we've got
a great dance program.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.560
You can see at the bottom
there I got to go to rehearsal.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.380
They call it
practice in football,

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.780
but this was rehearsal.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.850
And I told them--

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.250
don't take this the wrong
way, Coach Sumlin-- but I

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:35.410
said if our football players
executed as flawlessly

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.930
as those ballet
dancers, we would

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.520
be going to the Rose Bowl.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.920
So we have a lot to learn
from our dance program.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.790
But we need to invest.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.310
We need to invest in the arts.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.430
And we have aging
infrastructure.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.650
Craig T Nelson was
here recently helping

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:58.490
us try to raise money to redo
Moroni Theater, our black box

00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:58.990
theater.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.900
And it's such an important
part of Tucson, our culture.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.850
As I keep saying, this
place has a soul to it.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.930
And part of it is
the creativity that

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.160
helps our students become better
at what they're going to do

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.850
as they go out in the world.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:21.520
So I've included a picture of
the Mondavi Center at UC Davis,

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.080
and the Bing Center for
Performing Arts at Stanford.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.950
These centers in
this district that we

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:39.940
need to invest in with a new
art museum, a new Fred Fox music

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.960
school--

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.890
these are facilities that need
to be invested in and updated.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.920
And certainly, as part of this
plan, we're going to do that.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.590
LARRY PENLEY:
President Robbins, when

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.140
you talk about the
HSI designation,

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.800
or you talk about the focus
on Native American issues

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.130
at the university, you
clearly are dealing

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:04.000
with leveraging place when it
gets to those particular groups

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.510
of students and faculty.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.610
But in the arts, tell me how
you're going to leverage place

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.570
through the arts.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:18.430
 Well I think that certainly,
we've got to have facilities.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.950
I don't know that
Jory and his wife

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.850
could have built the dance
program that they have here

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.379
without having great facilities.

00:13:27.379 --> 00:13:29.170
Certainly you've got
to have great programs

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.400
to go in those facilities.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:36.340
But I believe that these
performing arts centers--

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:41.620
we have, in my opinion, two
front porches or front doors

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.080
to the universities,
portals into the university,

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.430
with the community.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.060
And that's through
athletics and the arts.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.060
And I think that
it's a time when,

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.660
other than JP Jones, who
has his great seminar

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.810
series down in the Fox Theater,
and engages the community.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.620
And certainly, Joaquin's
science lecture series

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.380
in Centennial Hall
packs the place.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.290
But the community
doesn't really,

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.900
except in rare
occasions, come in

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.650
and go to English classes,
or physics classes,

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:15.640
or things like that.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:21.160
But they get to come and
enjoy performances or games.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:26.650
So I think having facilities
that people will come to,

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:30.190
that will attract students,
that will attract faculty

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.940
to build those programs
which do attract students,

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.390
is going to be really important.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.600
So I'm not sure if that's
answering your question,

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.950
but it is one of our
portals and front porches

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.640
to the university.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.620
I think we need to
invest in other areas.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.500
Obviously in Tucson--
and this starts

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.840
to get into the
economic development

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.680
mission of the
University of Arizona

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.500
being the land grant
university for the state.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.250
And what we are
tasked with in terms

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:10.250
of our stewardship of being
the land grant university.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.960
And that's to build
out the tech parks that

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.980
started many years ago.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.260
We've had this ground
between the airport

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.370
and the university
called the Bridges.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.260
And I was reminded, as
I kept driving by there,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.520
that this was a
bridge to nowhere.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.810
But finally we're going
to move forward and start

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.450
breaking ground on the
bridges, and build out

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:39.910
what Bruce Wright and
others conceived as a plan

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:44.590
that I think will be
beneficial in that intersection

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.680
of fundamental discoveries
being translated

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.050
into commercializable products.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:55.150
We're going to develop an
incubator at the old Walgreens

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:59.140
downtown that the
county has provided us

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.370
for a long term lease.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.335
And we're building that out.

00:16:02.335 --> 00:16:05.890
And Joaquin and Paulo are going
to have programs in there,

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.540
an incubator accelerator.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:14.010
But we need to also build out
the Phoenix Biomedical Campus.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.700
The board has charged
the EEC, which

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.170
are the three
presidents in addition

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.050
to John, to come together and
develop a plan for the Health

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.470
Sciences Center.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.750
And I'll say a little
more about that later.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.490
We also need to build out
our presence in Phoenix,

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.970
because the state
legislature is there.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:38.350
It's the largest alumni base
of any of our alumni worldwide.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:42.760
And I get up there as much
as I can, but I haven't

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.270
done as good a job of having
a presence in Phoenix,

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:52.630
and speak at public gatherings
there like President Crow gets

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.010
to do, because he lives close.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:58.510
So we need to build out
our presence in Phoenix

00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:59.890
more than we're doing.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.840
And just like ASU,
for those of you

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.579
who've seen their beautiful
building in Washington DC,

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:12.910
right out the West Side
entrance into the White House.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.920
We need a presence.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.800
I've kind of
provocatively called

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.030
them embassy's at these
different locations.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:26.560
It turns out that Duke does
call their DC office the Duke

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.089
embassy.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:31.900
But this could be a
site for us to focus

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.700
a lot of the
important activities

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:39.070
around federal relations with
the agencies in particular.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.720
It'll be a place
for our students

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.910
to go and do internships
and study abroad

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.090
programs that could be in DC.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:54.130
We also have an incredible
Institute of Civil Discourse

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:58.690
that I think that most people
don't even realize we have.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.900
But it's a phenomenal
program, and we certainly

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.560
need civil discourse
in this day and age.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:10.930
I was reminded watching the
TV this morning, and it said,

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:14.500
the nation has been even more
divided than we are today,

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.690
but that resulted
in a civil war.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.310
Do you have a question,
Regent Athena?

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.060
AUNDREA DEGRAVINA: I do.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:19.559
Yes.

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:20.790
Thank you, Dr. Robbins.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:21.290
Oh.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:22.870
There we go.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.960
I guess, with speaking
about all this expansion,

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.240
I was hoping maybe you
could also touch on,

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.750
what does the financing of
expansion for the university

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.590
look like?

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.750
As a part of this
discussion, how

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.570
do we make this
feasible with this

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.880
going to DC, going to
northern California, which

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.630
are all important?

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.430
How do we look at that from
a financial perspective?

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.930
 Yeah.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:47.300
We kind of covered that
with you guys yesterday,

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.010
but I'll expand on
what I said yesterday.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.930
Obviously, there
are resources that

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.140
are available for strategic
investment currently.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.870
And we're going to put
those things to work.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.410
And parenthetically, there are
already things in this plan

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:05.350
that we're doing currently.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.320
And there are things that we
will implement very soon that

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.780
will require no investment.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.330
As I get to the fourth
pillar, actually,

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:17.830
some of our global
programs are making money.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.180
Unheard of.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.510
Our online program has
been developed, set out.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.670
That's going to be
revenue positive,

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.910
because a lot of the upfront
investment has been made.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:32.410
We're also going to look
at our budgetary process

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.020
and see if there are
some changes that

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.750
could be made that would free
up some of the money for more

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.850
strategic investment.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:46.270
And then finally, we
think that if we execute

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:49.900
on these strategies, we'll win
more grants and more contracts,

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:54.220
and we'll grow our
student body, and we'll

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.610
have more students to be
able to have more tuition,

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.500
and do more things.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:03.610
So that would be
sort of the outline

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.950
of how we would pay for this.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:10.480
And the final thing, of
course, would be JP--

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.860
I don't know if
JP is still here,

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.619
but we talked about
it on the break.

00:20:14.619 --> 00:20:15.910
We're going to have to get out.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:21.890
We raised, as I said before,
over $300 million last year,

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.910
the largest amount in the
history of the university.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.810
We've got to do almost $400
million a year for eight years

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:32.154
to hit our goal of
between $3 and $4 billion.

00:20:32.154 --> 00:20:39.040
So as we were talking about
when Regent Ridenour asked JP,

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.270
how much money have
you raised today?

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.160
Just think about it.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.620
Every day when
you wake up, we've

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.380
got to raise a million
dollars every day.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.910
Every day.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.502
And that'll be a big part
of funding this plan.

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:53.960
Make sure there's
a defibrillator--

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.418
AUNDREA DEGRAVINA:
No pressure, JP.

00:20:55.418 --> 00:20:58.160
 --if JP has a cardiac arrest.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.595
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:05.300
Yeah.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.910
We had hoped to avoid
that funding question,

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.650
but it's good to
get it out there.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:16.220
We can go into more detail
about exactly how we're

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.240
going to pay for it.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.750
So back to our regularly
scheduled programming.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.910
So I think there's
another opportunity for us

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:26.960
in the Presidio.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.660
And why do I pick the Presidio?

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.070
President Crow picked LA, and
he moved from Santa Monica.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.500
Now he's in downtown
LA, and he's

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:42.170
announced that he's in
town to compete on par

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:45.110
and to dominate USC,
UCLA, and Caltech.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.250
I like that.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:49.040
I have roots in
northern California

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.610
so we thought about northern
California and the Presidio,

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.420
because there's something
interesting going on there

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.760
that the World Economic
Forum, for the first time

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:04.790
in their nearly 50 year
history, has a branch campus.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:08.420
Marc Benioff from Salesforce
has had a lot of influence,

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.560
I believe, in establishing
this campus there.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.390
And it's an opportunity for
us to have a presence, much

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:17.060
like we would have
an embassy in DC,

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.960
to have one in Silicon Valley
in northern California.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:27.530
So that we can help to expand
the tech transfer capabilities,

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:31.070
the companies that we spin
out, to have partnerships

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:34.160
with Silicon Valley
tech companies,

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.130
but also get capital
investment from venture

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:38.960
capitalists in that area.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:44.270
And it puts us in the mix
of being able to have access

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:47.990
to the Pacific Rim,
China, India, Korea,

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.860
where we are going to
build micro campuses

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.250
and get students from.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:56.310
So this would be our outreach.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.490
And we think that
this will help us

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.640
in our quest for economic
development for the state,

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.900
but also help us to make
money for the university

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.250
so that we can
invest in this plan

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:10.070
and do the great things
that we want to do.

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.460
So when I got here,
President Crow

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.150
and I started talking about
what can we do together?

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.210
And we've had a series of
meetings that were primarily

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:24.410
led by George Post and Mike
Dake that are really focused

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.290
around biotech and
health sciences,

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:27.542
and what can we do together.

00:23:27.542 --> 00:23:29.250
And there are many
things that we can do.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:33.110
We already have partnerships
with NAU in the Phoenix

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.070
Biomedical Campus.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.150
And as I said before,
the board has charged us,

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:42.140
all four of our
leaders, with coming up

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.440
with a plan for the
biomedical campus.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:51.330
So I think we can be a
player in that arena.

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.780
But as I started to think
about this presentation,

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.400
and as I started
to think about what

00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:01.880
we could do as a university and
my prior experiences in Texas--

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:07.070
by the way, I was actually
hired because 59 institutions

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.010
said we need someone to come
in and help organize us.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.690
We want to work together.

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.540
We need a forcing
function to set up

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.020
research collaborations,
and innovation,

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.550
and economic development
type things we

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:26.100
could do as multiple
institutions together.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:26.990
And it struck me.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.530
I've got three examples here.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:32.420
The top one is that TMC3.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.880
Multi-institutional--
University of Texas,

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.480
Texas A&amp;M, Rice,
Baylor, MD Anderson--

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:43.400
coming together to have a
meaningful, translational

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.080
research campus.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.830
The one in the bottom
right is Research Triangle,

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:51.590
where University of North
Carolina, North Carolina State,

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.480
and Duke have come together--

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.670
years ago, decades ago now--
to build out an infrastructure.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.760
And it really put their three
universities on the map.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.940
And most recently, under the
investment of Mayor Bloomberg,

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.700
the development of
Roosevelt Island

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.910
in New York where Cornell
and the Technion have

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:11.870
come together.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.840
I think we can do the same
thing at the Phoenix Biomedical

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.650
Campus.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:19.490
But I, as we talked
yesterday, think

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:23.660
that it doesn't need to just
be health sciences and biotech.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.880
I think we've got a
unique opportunity

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.820
with all of our
assets coming together

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:33.800
to be the world leader in the
business of space and space

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:39.800
exploration, in astronomy,
and in those domains.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.080
A lot of it has
to do with having

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.450
the expertise to go into space.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:47.630
But a lot of it also has to
do with technology development

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:52.150
and data management that will
help both health and our space

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.120
programs.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.050
So I think this is a
big opportunity for us

00:25:56.050 --> 00:26:01.120
to do something really big, and
to plant a flag in the ground

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.970
to say, we are going
to be the leaders.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.670
Finally, the
governor, in dealing

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:09.580
with the Governor of
Sonora and the possibility

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:14.440
of having a launch site
for rockets like Vector

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.760
is producing.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.150
The idea is that Vector is
producing these rockets that

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:22.900
can be fired inexpensively--

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.590
relatively inexpensively--
at the rate of one a day.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:32.230
And so if you think about this
whole corridor from Arizona

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:36.260
through Sonora, I think we've
got a great opportunity there.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.530
And the University
of Arizona is poised

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:42.100
and ready to work with the other
universities to develop this.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.130
So that's the end of pillar 3.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:48.340
More questions before
we go to global?

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.520
By my check, we have 50 minutes.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.470
And I think we're
doing well here.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:55.970
 Questions?

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:56.470
Comments?

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.490
RON SHOOPMAN: I want to
once again acknowledge

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.560
this last slide.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:08.190
In my view, one
of the real values

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.570
that this board with three
universities working together

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.150
bring to the state
is the opportunity

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.390
to take the talent
that exists not only

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:21.410
here, but at ASU and
NAU, and find ways

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:27.710
to put those talents together
to accomplish greater things

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:29.430
that we can do individually.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:34.100
And I think that's an attitude,
and it's an intent to do that.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.810
Let's leave the competition
for the athletics,

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:40.340
and let's work together in
ways that are good for Arizona

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.070
and the people of Arizona.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:45.050
And I think we will
find that we're

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:48.860
successful beyond anything
we could do individually

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:49.910
if we can join forces

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:54.380
So I do believe that one of
the reasons we selected you

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:58.400
as a leader is that you took
59 different organizations that

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.740
wouldn't even talk
to each other and got

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.480
them to collaborate and do
wonderful things in Texas,

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.480
so we know it's possible.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.720
 And I think, as we discussed
yesterday, we're too small.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.720
I mean, we're
three universities.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.070
But I think we punch
way above our weight.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:23.345
When it comes to assets like
space, both ASU and U of A

00:28:23.345 --> 00:28:26.120
are true world
leaders in this area.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.940
Just look at the awards
that are being given

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.340
from NASA and NSF and others.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:37.700
And then on the health side,
we've got two medical schools.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.720
We've got the partnership
that ASU has with Mayo.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:46.010
We've got NAU with the
health sciences schools

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.650
that they have that
are located in Phoenix.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:51.290
I just believe this is
an incredible opportunity

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:55.280
in both space and
health, and also

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.920
the health of space travel.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:03.380
Because one of the tag lines,
our students go to Mars.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.330
Literally and figuratively.

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.900
It's great.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.610
I think we can get
people to Mars.

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:11.630
But can we get them back
safely and without cancer,

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:12.720
for instance?

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.980
So there are a lot of
opportunities here.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:21.320
But the competition is not
up and down I-10 and 17.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.200
The competition is in
Boston, and San Francisco,

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.350
and San Diego, and
Singapore, and London.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.740
And there's no reason,
no reason in the world,

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.710
that we can't have
the right mentality

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:36.000
to think-- we don't need
to go to those places.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.040
We can do it right here.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.770
As a matter of fact,
they're going to come to us.

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.440
Especially around
the space sector,

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:48.450
I believe, because of all the
unique assets that we have.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:49.520
 Thank you.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.380
What else?

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.000
 Mr. Chairman, I
want to just take

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.360
advantage of the opportunity to
talk about the inflection point

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.520
that we are at.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.610
We put the word
collaboration up there,

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:03.320
and we talk about it with
the other two universities.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:08.310
But historically, this
is groundbreaking.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.460
Having lived-- and I
said this yesterday,

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:14.720
and I and I'm repeating myself,
but it's worth repeating.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.850
It wasn't that long ago
that the three universities

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:20.430
wouldn't talk to each other.

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:22.490
And I will tell you
that 30 years ago,

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.040
when I was in student government
at Arizona State University,

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.696
I was part of that problem.

00:30:26.696 --> 00:30:28.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.370
I took my role as student
body president quite serious.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.110
And at every
opportunity, would do

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:36.860
whatever I could to
compete with U of A

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.470
and try and come out on top.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:43.670
But we have moved far
in the last 30 years.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.640
And I think with Dr.
Robbins' leadership,

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.890
and his work with Dr. Crow and
Dr. Chang, is really historic.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:55.490
And it is an inflection
point for our state.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:57.590
I said yesterday
that our competition

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:02.520
isn't ASU, or NAU, or U of A.
It's the Research Triangle.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.460
It's these other states
that have learned

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.470
long ago to work together.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:07.580
That's our competition.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.940
And we are stronger together.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:12.500
And so for a
lifelong Arizonan, it

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.300
is very refreshing to see this.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.960
And I think it bodes very,
very well for our future.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.630
So thank you.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.380
 Absolutely.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.740
 Just a quick comment back
on Regent DeGravina's question

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.240
about financing.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:33.650
I am just very impressed and
appreciative that Dr. Robbins

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.570
and the University
of Arizona has not

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:40.920
made this plan contingent on
investment from the state.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.130
And in fact, have not really
talked about investment

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.760
from the state.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:48.470
However I think the plan
does a great job articulating

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:51.260
the fantastic and
unbelievable benefits that

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.650
can come to the state
and to the universities

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:59.280
if the state was willing
to invest in this plan.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.880
And I think gives us
a great opportunity

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.300
to go and articulate with the
legislature and the governor's

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.350
office the benefits of
the 50/50 funding model,

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:13.040
and how we would put those
additional resources to work,

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.320
should they become available.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.210
RON SHOOPMAN: Thank
you, Director Arnold.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.230
President Robbins?

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.030
ROBERT ROBBINS: OK.

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:21.070
Fourth pillar.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:23.830
Sorry global and
international activities.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:30.170
And I have to thank Brent
White for really converting me.

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:33.960
I'll talk about our micro
campuses here in a minute,

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.270
but these are our goals.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:39.290
Currently, we really
haven't focused

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:43.130
on trying to procure
resources FROM

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:49.250
the World Bank, or the
Gates Foundation, or USAID.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.890
Some of these
funding agencies that

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:55.970
fund big international
development or projects.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.730
And so we have a
goal to, by 2025,

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:00.390
and I'm very confident
that we could

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:03.770
HIT this goal, to procure
new resources that would

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:06.470
help to pay for this plan.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.560
And it's modest, in my
opinion. $10 million.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.780
I think we can outperform that.

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:16.670
We want to be a top 10
national research university

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.220
for students studying abroad.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.940
Right now, we have less
than 5% of our students.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.810
We need to double that.

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:32.200
We think that we can be a big
performer in attracting more

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.450
students to the university.

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:37.190
International students,
currently single digits.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:40.900
We need it into the
15% to 20% range.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:45.070
And then finally, I'll talk
more about the micro campuses.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:50.950
The micro campuses, as I said,
I was skeptical when I came in.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:55.570
And after sticking with
it, and investigating,

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:57.970
and multiple hours
of discussions

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:01.450
with Brent, and Marc
Miller, and others.

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:05.380
A recent trip to one
of our newest partner

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:09.880
micro campus universities
in Lima, Peru.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:14.199
People just came back excited
about the opportunities there.

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:17.300
And then their team
came here, and they

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:23.260
have a young, very aggressive,
visionary president.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:26.500
And I thought, you
know, this is starting

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.940
to make a lot more sense to me.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.280
And as we went through
and pressure-tested it

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.730
through this rigorous
planning process,

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:37.659
I think the micro
campus differentiates us

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:41.010
from any other
university in the world.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:45.310
And the key is that our faculty
developed the curriculum.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:49.870
Then we train their faculty
at our partner institutions

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:51.520
to deliver the curriculum.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.290
And we give a joint degree.

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:59.030
And most importantly, we split
the tuition with them 50/50.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.420
And so this is one
of the few things

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:06.380
in this plan that generates
resources to pay for itself.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:11.950
And I think it's a really
remarkable, differentiating,

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.170
and competitive
advantage for us.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:16.330
You can see a picture
of one of our buildings

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:19.480
there in Cambodia.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.770
One of our universities.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:24.190
And the one that's
been around the longest

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:25.990
is with Ocean
University, which is

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:28.210
one of the top
universities in China.

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:31.900
It gives us a ability
to deliver our brand out

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.760
to all these campuses
in the world.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:41.260
It provides their students with
a US education and a degree.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.860
It gives us the opportunity to
develop research collaborations

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.480
with these universities.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.350
And as a launchpad, a natural
launchpad for our students,

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:54.250
as we try to grow our
study abroad programs.

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:57.070
We already have
infrastructure in place there.

00:35:57.070 --> 00:36:00.880
And they're interesting
places, and stimulating places

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.560
that we have partnerships with.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.890
Yes, Regent Manson?

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:07.720
LYNDEL MANSON: So this
generates revenue at this point.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.990
So it's a profit
center, as it were.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:13.720
What, outside of
generating revenues,

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.350
what do the numbers look
like in terms of our students

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:20.470
using these
facilities currently?

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:23.440
And what kind of
return, if any, do we

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.900
have of students coming
from the American

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:30.220
University of Phnom Penh, and
studying at U of A for a year?

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.290
And one of your
goals is to increase

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.030
the international
student population

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.220
at the U of A campus in Tucson.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.060
Do those flow together?

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:38.616
 Right.

00:36:38.616 --> 00:36:39.490
Well that's the hope.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:41.830
These are all very
nascent programs,

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:45.820
and others could answer those
questions more accurately

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.730
than me.

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.360
But I do know there are
a couple of examples

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:55.730
of law program with the
University of Hanoi,

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.520
which is one of
the top law schools

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.560
in the country of Vietnam.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.190
That before we started
the program there,

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:04.870
we essentially got no students.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.680
And I think over
the last few years,

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.460
we've gotten 10 law students
that have come from there.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.550
The idea is that
students could complete

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:15.970
their undergraduate studies
at these micro campuses,

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:19.240
or even transfer
during their time,

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.850
or they could come here
from graduate school.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:25.170
So I don't think the numbers
are really high right now.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.700
And we only have
about 500 students.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.330
One of the goals was to
beat 10,000 students.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:34.780
We only have 526 students today.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:38.740
So it's early on, and there are
only four operating campuses.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:42.580
But I know Brent and
his team is out and hope

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:47.710
to develop 20 of these campuses
with the number of students

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:51.280
per campus that will get
us to 10,000 students.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.470
And at that point, it
should be matured enough

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:59.470
that we'll see our students
going to these campuses.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:01.360
But I think there have
been students who've

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:07.560
gone to Ocean as part of, if not
a complete semester of, study

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.060
abroad.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.710
But at least go there
on a trip and understand

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:15.670
what the resources are that we
could develop a program there

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:16.420
eventually.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.220
That's the hope, but
I don't think we've

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:21.160
gone very far with it today.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.140
 I'm under the
impression, maybe

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:26.860
mistakenly, that not
a lot of universities

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:33.700
are focusing on micro
campuses or partnerships

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:34.840
with other nations.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:38.830
And I know there's a
lot going on in China.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:43.180
Possibly India, Southeast Asia.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:47.060
Do you plan to be in
the forefront of this?

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.260
And what is the planning?

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.150
I mean, what resources
are you going

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.850
to put to this immediately?

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:58.330
And where do you expect this--

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:04.090
I know you have the
statistics, but do we

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:10.660
need to make inroads in this
quicker than down the road,

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:13.840
since other universities
may well start getting

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.890
into this type of thing?

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:19.270
Because everyone's out for
the international student now.

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.770
 Yeah.

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:22.330
I think this is
one of the things

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:24.310
that we highlighted
for you yesterday.

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:26.230
And I don't have
those numbers with me,

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:29.260
but I think we
left them with you.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:34.630
This initiative calls for
about a million dollar,

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:38.060
million and a half dollar
investment in the next year,

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.970
which we're happy to do.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.470
But Brent is out there.

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:46.810
I mean, you know, if he's
not global service on United

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:50.510
and whatever it is on
American, I would be shocked.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:53.650
He's probably premier
status on multiple airlines,

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:56.320
because he's constantly
out there looking

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.390
for opportunities.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:01.480
Now as to other
Institutions, of course

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.520
they've been at it
for a long time.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.950
I mean, NYU does this very well.

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:09.520
You know if you go to NYU,
it's marketed very well,

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.400
there are 14 sites in the
world that you can go.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.250
And it's a big part of
the experience there.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.490
And others have tried it, too.

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:21.100
They've, in my opinion,
been the most successful.

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:25.990
But most places choose to invest
bricks and mortar, and programs

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.870
in their people on the ground.

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:30.940
And that just has not
been as successful.

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:34.030
And you've seen places
like Johns Hopkins

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:37.180
and Duke and Harvard
and Stanford retreat

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.350
from those models.

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:41.050
Sanford still has a
program in Beijing,

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:45.440
but not as big as the
idea that we had before.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.110
And I think Brent
is on to something,

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:51.190
because you can do
multiple of these campuses

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:53.080
without a big investment.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.270
And it's about
relationship building,

00:40:55.270 --> 00:41:01.870
and getting the right fit for
their needs with the programs

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:02.900
that we have.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:03.850
So we're on this.

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:07.150
He's very aggressively
going after this.

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:09.530
I think it's going to
be a minimal investment.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:12.310
But we outlined that
this is one of the--

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:15.820
as we go through, and as
we talked to you yesterday

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:19.510
about the triage and
prioritization of projects--

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.110
this would be one of them.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:23.000
And I think it's about
a million and a half,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.310
$2 million investment that
we're eagerly putting that money

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.620
to work, because we think
the return on investment

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.337
is going to be good.

00:41:31.337 --> 00:41:33.670
 President Robbins, before
you go onto the next section

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:36.460
of this one, I apologize.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.170
I'm just curious.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:40.990
What are the implications
for your general education

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:42.890
and the changes to
general education?

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:43.780
That's one question.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.130
If you could deal with that one.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:47.110
I have a related one, though.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.279
 For the international program?

00:41:49.279 --> 00:41:50.070
LARRY PENLEY: Yeah.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:53.590
You talk about
your global goals,

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:56.750
and what you want out of the
students in this section.

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:58.390
So how does general
education change

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:01.010
as a consequence of this?

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:05.320
 So I think it's a great
opportunity for our students.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.540
We talk about wanting--

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:13.630
at one point, we said we
want 100% of our students

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:15.940
to have an international
experience.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.220
I still believe that
that's embedded somewhere

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:22.380
in this plan, but I kind
of got push back on that.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:26.140
And the fact is, we
could put them in a bus

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:29.260
and drive a few
hours south, and they

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:33.100
could do meaningful work along
the border and in Sonora,

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.120
and that counts.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.760
And so I think that
that is a great part

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.670
of the general
education process.

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:44.836
There is a--

00:42:44.836 --> 00:42:47.602
I don't have enough time
to put it all in here,

00:42:47.602 --> 00:42:49.810
and some of these things
are a little controversial--

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:53.980
but there is a pilot project
that we continue to talk about

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:58.450
with Minerva to introduce
their curriculum

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:02.410
into our general education
projects, pilot projects,

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:04.050
for next fall.

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:07.030
Brent has looked at
Minerva's platform and said,

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:09.700
this is going to be
a great way for us

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.710
to deliver general
education across all

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:14.000
of our micro campuses.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.230
So I think that
they fit together.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.730
Obviously--

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:17.960
BOARD MEMBER: Bobby,
would you explain

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.180
Minerva for everyone benefit?

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:19.930
 Ooph.

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.310
That's going to be a long--

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.590
the most successful
university in the world.

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:24.850
Minerva.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:26.030
You want a tag line?

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:27.250
That's a tag line.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:30.430
And so they've only been
around about four years,

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:35.710
and they have a very
aspirational goal

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:41.185
to change the way that
education is delivered.

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.630
We've been talking to
them now for about a year

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.970
about their offerings,
particularly

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:51.340
around the software
and platform that they

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:54.880
use to deliver their offering.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.640
They only take 100
students a year.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:01.070
And they have multiple
thousands of students applying.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:07.150
And it's really an online
educational platform.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:08.920
But the students start--

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.100
there are eight different
locations, I think.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:14.560
And I'm not an expert on
giving the Minerva pitch here,

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.450
but I'm going to
do the best I can.

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:20.010
And I'll say you can
find them at www.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:21.310
Whatever It is, Minerva.

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:22.630
Just Google.

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:26.740
But the idea is, they've
got an incredible software

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:31.690
platform and data analytics.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:36.900
They film every
class, and they're

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.580
the ultimate in collaborative
and active learning

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.470
in the classroom.

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.800
And we just think
that that's going

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.380
to be a potentially
interesting pilot for us

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:51.040
to pilot in our general
education curriculum.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.900
Above and beyond
that, Brent thinks

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:56.770
this is a great way for us
to disseminate our curriculum

00:44:56.770 --> 00:45:00.130
around to our micro campuses.

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:01.680
A related question
though, President

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.880
Robbins, before you go on.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:06.000
And by the way, it's
minerva.kgi.edu,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.450
if you want the address.

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:14.040
But with regard to the
languages, you talk about 75%

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:15.660
of students being multilingual.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:20.150
Now having studied both German,
Spanish actually, and French.

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:24.510
I'm probably only useful
in about one of those.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:26.049
And it had to do
with the pedagogy.

00:45:26.049 --> 00:45:27.840
So how are you going
to change the pedagogy

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.360
in languages taught here at
the University of Arizona?

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.660
 Well I think--

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.250
I thought you were
going to ask me--

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:39.090
this is why I didn't want to
put this one on here, because it

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:41.190
says not measured today.

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:45.810
We don't know how many
students are multilingual.

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:46.570
The idea is--

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:48.611
LARRY PENLEY: Well, if
they're typical Americans,

00:45:48.611 --> 00:45:50.010
they're monolingual.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:52.710
But I recognize there's probably
more multilingual people

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:55.420
in the southwest than there are
in many parts of the country.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:56.419
ROBERT ROBBINS: Correct.

00:45:56.419 --> 00:46:00.810
And this is Duolingo for all.

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:04.440
I could pull it out and show
you how you can get multilingual

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.940
on your phone.

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:11.250
But the idea would be that you
would have a proficiency test

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:13.290
that you could give people.

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:15.690
The fact is that--

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:18.720
I'm forgetting now which
university it's a requirement.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.360
That in order to
finish, you have

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.590
to be proficient
in two languages.

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:31.620
So the idea is that
because of our HSI status,

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:38.700
because of our desire to grow
and be an international leader

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.510
in students from
outside the US, we

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:45.840
think that this is something
that we can achieve.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.010
The question is, how
do we measure it?

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:49.890
And that's always problematic.

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:54.510
I guess this one is maybe
not as metrically based

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:59.354
as it is spiritually
and aspirational based.

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:05.230
 Regent Myers.

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:07.440
 Just stepping aside
just one second,

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.080
I just wanted to
suggest, Mr. Chair.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.080
You know, we had some discussion
on these micro campuses.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:17.250
We talk about online
education opportunities.

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:20.310
The whole branding outside
of the United States.

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.710
And we know how
important our of students

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:25.800
are to the learning
experience for our students,

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.260
the opportunity for
residents students in Arizona

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.450
to go to other countries,
and the money that

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:33.930
comes here from other countries
to help support education.

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:35.610
I was going to
suggest, at some point,

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:38.760
this board should maybe look
at this a little bit more.

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.760
Because I don't know, in
my history on the board,

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.320
that we've really had
a discussion about what

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.370
out of country education
means to Arizona.

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:52.650
And I don't know
that ABOR should

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:56.790
be doing more advertising
for Arizona schools.

00:47:56.790 --> 00:48:00.040
You know, there are just so
many open questions here.

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.700
But I think we all
recognize it's becoming,

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:06.360
and it's going to continue to
be, a more and more important

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:10.380
part of our overall student
body and our student experience.

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:12.720
So separate from this
U of A presentation,

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.640
I was going to suggest
that this board, maybe

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.870
in academic affairs, should take
this subject on at some point,

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:21.660
and have more of an intellectual
discussion about what

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.720
are all these platforms, and
how do they fit together,

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.727
and what is the opportunity?

00:48:26.727 --> 00:48:27.810
 Thank you, Regent Myers.

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:30.410
Thank you.

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:33.940
 This just is a slide
to remind me to come back

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:36.730
to, we've just not
done a lot of work

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:39.850
in developing the procurement
of resources that help us

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:45.820
to go out and marshal our
resources around hydrology,

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:49.570
water expertise for arid
environments, engineering

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:55.029
prowess, public health, and
natural resources assets

00:48:55.029 --> 00:48:56.320
that we have at the university.

00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:00.910
To go out, and partner, and
help solve some of the world's

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:02.480
global challenges.

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:06.820
I think we do a really good
job, especially with water,

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:10.180
in terms of going
across the state,

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.960
partnering with the
native communities.

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.820
But also with the Middle East.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:21.130
There are a lot of partnerships
Ben-Gurion University was here

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:24.640
recently signing a research
agreement, because they

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:28.570
live in a similar type
environment as we do.

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:30.520
So there are a lot
of opportunities.

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.370
And we really, until Brent
brought this forward,

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:36.010
and the group started
to think about what

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:39.100
we could do around
having global impact,

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:43.120
and procuring resources that
would pay for us to go and do

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.200
these type of research
partnerships and studies.

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:49.690
That this is how
important this is for us,

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:53.500
and made it into the plan.

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:57.160
As we get these students
on campus, right now,

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.040
we don't do as good
a job as we could

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.040
in terms of making
them feel welcome,

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:07.210
providing them with
the necessary resources

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:08.420
to retain them.

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.930
It turns out that our
international students are

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:14.320
retained at a fairly
high level, but we'll

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:18.520
have to increase that if we're
going to hit our 91% retention

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.300
goal.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.220
And we make it
difficult. We make

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.080
it difficult for
all of our students

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:28.660
to have a joyful
existence as they navigate

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:30.230
through the university.

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:34.720
So the idea would be to
take the Park Street Union

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:39.940
and repurpose it and renovated
into an international center

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:43.780
for students so that they don't
have to run all over campus,

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:50.740
and many times, out into the
city miles away from campus,

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.960
when they may not have a car.

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.820
Most of them don't have a
car when they come here.

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.720
So the idea that we would
have different services

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.520
for passports.

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:03.610
I really like the idea that
every one of our students

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:05.290
needs to have a passport.

00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:07.360
And if we had an
office there that made

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:10.890
it easy to go to
get that passport,

00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:13.670
then I think more of our
students would have them.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:17.200
You know, when our basketball
team went to Barcelona

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.010
last year, I think
probably 9 out of the 12

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:22.800
didn't have a passport.

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:31.540
So to process visas, to be
able to get their financial aid

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:35.140
and support from their
country of origin,

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:40.810
and to provide a cultural
center for events.

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:43.090
Watching World Cup soccer
games, for instance.

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:46.240
Or having food
services that could

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.450
be the best in the region.

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:51.050
Could be right here
in this center.

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:54.220
So we're pretty excited
about repurposing

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:58.810
this, and the modest
amount of resources

00:51:58.810 --> 00:52:00.110
that we required to do that.

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:06.421
So that's the end of
our international story.

00:52:06.421 --> 00:52:06.920
 Excellent.

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:07.840
 Thank you.

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:08.910
OK.

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:10.990
We're coming down
the homestretch here.

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:14.190
Pillar 5 talks about, how
can we run this university

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:18.180
in a more efficient manner?

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:21.250
Not only with
business operations,

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:25.320
but also with processes that
simply make everyone's job

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.690
easier to do every day.

00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:31.770
I remember an encounter
with the deans

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:36.840
early on, where we were talking
about the need or lack thereof

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.470
of doing a strategic plan.

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:42.840
And many of them told me that
you don't need a strategic plan

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.550
to do x y, and z.

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:47.400
There are things that drive
us crazy every day that we

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.960
have to put up with, and you
don't need any strategies

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:50.460
for that.

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.260
You just need to change them.

00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:53.040
So I said, OK.

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:56.250
Go home and write
down the 10 things

00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:59.100
that make your job difficult
every day, and come back.

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:01.680
And we'll collate them, and
slice them and dice them,

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.500
and analyze them.

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.610
And many of the things
showed up in this plan.

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:11.180
And Jeff was kind enough
to take on the job

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:15.390
of going through and analyzing
many of these things.

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:18.300
But most of them make sense.

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:24.870
And most of them, such as, we
don't have a common platform

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:26.040
that ties us together.

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.730
So a new CRM system is
going to be very important,

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:31.740
and will be part of this plan.

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:34.890
We want to focus
on sustainability,

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:41.040
and we've got some plans to
outsource some of our utility

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:44.700
requirements that
would reduce our carbon

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:46.770
footprint and our
scope 2 emissions that

00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:51.810
will cost us nothing, and
result in a 33% reduction.

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:56.340
And then finally,
require, make it where--

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:59.370
I think every student now
has to have a CAT card.

00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:01.710
We would make it where
every student has

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:06.480
to have some digital
access to what we're

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:09.600
calling digital you, which would
be a platform that would help

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:15.570
everyone run through their
university experience

00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:19.950
with a much more joyful
and purposeful experience.

00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:25.140
I use the idea of, if we go
next door to the administration

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.450
building, there are a
bunch of seats out there.

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:31.104
And I kept asking for a picture
to put in this presentation.

00:54:31.104 --> 00:54:32.520
I should have just
gone over there

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.010
and taken the picture
myself and put it in here.

00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:38.460
But there an old
computer there that I

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:41.850
think people are lining up
to sign into this computer

00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:47.710
so that they can get
financial aid, or access to.

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:52.530
And it shows you what a second
Industrial Revolution-type

00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:54.330
operation we have going on.

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:58.770
And how that, by putting
us on one common platform,

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:02.280
that we would make people's
life easier every day.

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.930
And we could actually,
even though it

00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:09.300
requires some upfront, sizable
investment, over the long term

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:10.890
it'll make us run
more efficiently,

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:14.394
make us more productive,
and cost less.

00:55:14.394 --> 00:55:15.060
One other thing.

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:18.990
I just put this slide
in here to emphasize

00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:22.980
that, at the start of every
strategic planning process,

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:27.990
usually you go through missions,
mission statements, vision

00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:31.110
statements, and
develop core values.

00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:34.770
And we chose not to
do that in this case,

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:37.240
because we felt we
had limited time.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.900
And we thought--
this was already

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:42.510
adopted from the
last strategic plan,

00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:45.420
and we thought these
were pretty good.

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.400
I don't think
anybody could argue

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:50.340
with any of these core
values or this mission.

00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:52.060
But as we went
through the process,

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:56.400
we realized that they're
not commonly shared.

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.340
Most people don't
know about them.

00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:03.300
If you're from ASU, you can
give the guiding principles

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:05.280
of the new American University.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:09.810
And I'm not sure that
anybody can really

00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:14.160
recite for you what are our core
values and purpose are here.

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.970
So as a postlude
to this process,

00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:23.640
we're going to engage in
a process with the Purpose

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:29.670
Institute out of Austin, Texas,
and go from a grassroots level,

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:34.180
all stakeholder, alumni from
around the world, all students,

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:38.640
staff, faculty, and go through
this process of developing

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:46.890
a shared set of goals,
purposes, and values

00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:50.550
that everybody would buy into,
and would know, and would

00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:54.540
be part of who we
are in our true North

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:55.890
Star as a university.

00:56:55.890 --> 00:56:58.350
So we're looking
forward to that.

00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:01.570
As part of analyzing
our current culture,

00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:05.740
I alluded to earlier an
organizational health

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:08.310
initiative and
survey that we did.

00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:14.860
Send it out to 15,000 students,
employees, and faculty members.

00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:18.730
And got about a
33% response rate.

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:22.060
And I talked about things
that we have strengths in,

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:27.940
in terms of talent and passion.

00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:31.730
But the things that we
lack were role clarity,

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:36.490
a strategic vision for
the future, holding people

00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:39.470
accountable, defining
what their jobs are,

00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:44.200
giving them performance reviews
to either help them improve

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.860
or to reward them.

00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:48.250
And that's one of
the things that we

00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:50.020
haven't done as good a job of.

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:52.780
And I hope that if this
plan is successful,

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:57.550
we can find the money
to execute on the plan,

00:57:57.550 --> 00:58:00.280
that we'll have
resources so that we

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:05.320
can give financial incentives
to our higher performers.

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.560
Because we haven't done as
good a job of that as we

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:12.190
probably could do, or should do.

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:17.170
And then finally, just having
more central organizational

00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:17.960
leadership.

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:22.840
Or just the idea of not
having a common CRM.

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:25.360
It has implications on
business operations,

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.800
makes us more efficient.

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:30.440
Should help us with
saving some money.

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.830
But the other thing
it allows us to do

00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:35.470
is to have better
cyber security.

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:39.700
And not have 250 different,
separate servers,

00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:43.400
but have everybody
on the same platform.

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.370
So those are some
of the things that I

00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:49.810
think will be not
as glamorous as some

00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:54.310
of the other parts of the plan,
but certainly practical, helps

00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:58.330
people live their daily
lives, and helps them

00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:01.150
be more excited about coming
to work because they don't have

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:04.270
to fight all the red
tape and bureaucracy.

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:06.460
Of course, there's always
going to be some of that.

00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:11.360
But we give this example here
about, we've already started.

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:14.620
And as part of this strategic
planning process, had this--

00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.680
which seems to be small--

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:21.210
initiative, but we just couldn't
resist going ahead and getting

00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:22.360
it going.

00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.810
It used to take for
travel authorization,

00:59:24.810 --> 00:59:29.450
if I said I have a meeting
at the NIH tomorrow,

00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:30.940
and I need to leave tomorrow.

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:33.952
Well, I needed to start planning
that about a week in advance.

00:59:33.952 --> 00:59:35.410
Obviously, you're
going to plan it.

00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:39.190
But getting
authorization to even go

00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:41.650
in the second
Industrial Revolution

00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:44.980
that we were operating
in a year ago,

00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:49.000
it would require about a
week of getting five or six

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.650
different signatures
on paper that

00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:56.050
made its way around
the university,

00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:57.730
and then you would
get your approval.

00:59:57.730 --> 01:00:02.620
Now, today, I'm told that
we can just hit a button

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.660
and do it electronically.

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:08.420
Small example, but you
start to get the picture.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:11.780
When we have this
infrastructure,

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.930
it can make us work
more successfully.

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:17.500
And then, this is
the digital you.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.620
Think of this as
the Amazon offering

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:24.910
for students where they can get
access to their core selection,

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:30.250
manage their financial
aid, and other things that

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:32.230
will make their life
easier so that they

01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:38.710
can spend more time studying
and improving their performance.

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:40.900
We think it'll help
with retention.

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.400
Certainly on financial aid.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.880
If we can get it to them sooner.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.960
The two main reasons that
we don't retain students

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.760
are mental health issues
and financial issues.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.190
So if I have to wait three
months to get my financial aid,

01:00:57.190 --> 01:01:00.130
then I'm at a high
risk of dropping out

01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:05.110
because I have to get a job and
it delays me from graduation.

01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:07.840
So we think that some of these
technological challenges,

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.600
if we're going to
be the land grant

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.420
university in the fourth
Industrial Revolution,

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.600
we've got to be able to practice
what we're espousing we're

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:21.070
going to give to our students
and to the outside world.

01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:23.050
So we're almost at the end here.

01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:26.370
One of the things
to get back to.

01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:27.940
What are we going to do?

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:31.720
Is this the end of the process?

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:35.170
And I've said this now, I
think, three or four times.

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:38.650
It's the end of the beginning.

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:40.472
This is the structure
that we'll have.

01:01:40.472 --> 01:01:43.540
We'll have a strategic
implementation group.

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:48.340
We have sent out
an advertisement

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:52.180
to hire someone
to run this plan,

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.950
to oversee the whole thing.

01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:57.580
We'll have accountable
pillar owners for all five

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:00.100
of the pillars, and
then initiative owners.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:07.910
And there will be weekly check
ins on each of the initiatives.

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:09.560
And this would be--

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:14.060
its not really intuitive,
but I wanted an example

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.440
that I could show you.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.040
So these are the five pillars.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:21.780
And each one of these blocks
represents an initiative.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:25.959
And so we'll come back
to you, and show you.

01:02:25.959 --> 01:02:27.500
If we show you that
there-- and we'll

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.030
do this on a quarterly basis.

01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:31.224
Not only to report
to the regents,

01:02:31.224 --> 01:02:32.640
but we'll have it
on our web site.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.130
And we'll be very transparent
about which initiative

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:40.362
we're actually executing on,
and what the results are.

01:02:40.362 --> 01:02:42.320
So you probably won't
hear a lot about the ones

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.530
that are in green.

01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:45.470
But if they are some
issue, and they're

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:47.840
in the cautionary
yellow part, or if we

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:53.450
need to have a SWAT team go
in and help on an initiative

01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:56.510
because it's just not
going, then this kind

01:02:56.510 --> 01:03:00.740
of tracking system and reporting
system and metric system

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.680
will help us as we
go out and execute.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.090
We've got to get the resources.

01:03:05.090 --> 01:03:07.910
We've got A, B, and C tranches.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:10.670
A is the one that
we're already doing.

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:12.110
We're already invested in.

01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:15.020
B is the one that we've
committed to invest in.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:18.170
C would be the ones that
we'll go and raise money

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:20.040
for and invest in.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:23.930
As we go out and
inspire people to invest

01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:29.340
in these programs, that'll help
us to be a better university,

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:31.850
and in many ways,
improve the world.

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:37.440
So we will report back
to you on several things.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:41.750
One, the values and
purpose work that we're

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:44.660
going to do over the
next two or three months.

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:48.710
The update on where the Banner
Health Sciences strategic plan

01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:50.630
is as it starts to roll out.

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:54.570
And I've mentioned RCM.

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:57.770
We'll come back and talk to
you about what our ideas are

01:03:57.770 --> 01:04:04.460
about our budgetary
process, and what changes we

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:06.980
need to make to RCM.

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:10.340
I think there are going to be
some changes that are being

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:12.260
discussed by the task force.

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:16.250
And as I've said, I look
forward to hearing those.

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:20.330
The final thing on this
slide is, we obviously

01:04:20.330 --> 01:04:24.950
have three important hires that
we're searching for right now.

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:28.280
All of these searches
are underway.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:31.970
The provost, the CFO and
chief business officer,

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:35.210
and the senior vice president
for Research and Innovation.

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:39.680
And I think this plan
will be a good way for us

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.780
to engage candidates.

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:46.730
I think it'll be something
that will excite them.

01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:50.090
It will give them
tangible evidence

01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:52.310
about what this
university is about,

01:04:52.310 --> 01:04:57.260
and where we see ourselves going
over the next 5, 10, 15 years.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.890
And it'll be sort
of the litmus test

01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:01.690
that we can use to
engage people about,

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:04.730
what do you think about
the direction of the plan?

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:09.440
Could you see yourself being
part of this leadership team

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.870
to help implement this plan?

01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:15.830
So I think these hires
are going to be incredibly

01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:17.400
important going forward.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.910
And they're three of
the most important parts

01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:21.800
of the university.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.930
And over the next
six months, we'll

01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:25.910
have these people in place.

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:27.720
So I've given you.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:30.850
Now almost four hours of this.

01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:35.630
And it's just a very small
part of the tens of thousands

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:39.410
of hours that we spent
putting this plan together.

01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:46.190
So as we seek to raise Arizona,
to ascend our mountain peak,

01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:52.010
to make the state of
Arizona the future state,

01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:57.230
I'm drawn to these words by
our alum Alison Levine, who

01:05:57.230 --> 01:06:02.210
I think is one of the first
and maybe only women to summit

01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:06.530
all of the world's tallest
peaks and ski to the North

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:09.170
Pole and the South Pole.

01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:10.710
While working at Goldman Sachs.

01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:12.860
I don't know how
she did all that.

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:14.270
But I love this.

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.970
And we wanted to have
her here, but she's off

01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:18.590
climbing some mountain.

01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:20.450
But I love this quote.

01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:23.390
"You don't have to be the best,
the fastest, strongest climber

01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:25.350
to get to the top
of the mountain.

01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:27.620
You just absolutely
have to be relentless

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:30.600
about putting one foot
in front of the other."

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:34.100
And that's what's going
to happen with this plan.

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:39.050
We will have to every
day, step by step,

01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:41.630
do the hard work of
recruiting those students,

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:44.240
and getting them
here, and helping

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:47.960
them be successful, in
the long hours of writing

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:53.240
grants and winning those
grants to advance our research.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.600
There's no magic bullet.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.160
There's no magic formula.

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.710
There's just a lot of hard work.

01:06:57.710 --> 01:07:00.920
And I think Allison
summarized it very well

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:04.860
So thank you for putting
up with my rambling

01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:07.800
through and bumbling and
stumbling along here.

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:13.340
But I'm really very proud
to be the representative

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:18.860
to give you at least a
snapshot of the incredible work

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:23.380
that the people around
us have put together.

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:28.170
And I think this is a start
to a great roadmap for where

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:30.550
the university is going to
go over the next five 10,

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:31.380
15 years.

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.390
So thank you for your attention.

01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:35.181
RON SHOOPMAN: Thank
you, President Robbins.

01:07:35.181 --> 01:07:37.943
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:45.610
I'd like to offer the
opportunity to the regents

01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:49.030
to make any comments
or ask any questions

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:51.310
at the end of the presentation.

01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:54.460
Regent Krishna.

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:56.470
RAM KRISHNA: Thank
you, Mr. Chairman.

01:07:56.470 --> 01:08:01.090
There'll be so many naysayers
from this group, I think.

01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:02.840
Faculty especially.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:06.730
We wanted to tell Dr. Robbins
that we are behind him

01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:08.150
on everything he has said.

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:09.850
He has a great vision.

01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:12.484
I want to support him
on this all the way.

01:08:12.484 --> 01:08:13.650
 Thank you, Regent Krishna.

01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:15.711
RON SHOOPMAN: Thank
you, Regent Krishna.

01:08:15.711 --> 01:08:16.210
 Others.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.870
LAUREN L'ECUYER: So
thank you Dr. Robbins,

01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:24.790
for that presentation.

01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:28.380
So I think personally,
being one of your students

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.630
now here at the U of
A, I'm proud to know

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:33.930
that this is the direction
that the university is headed.

01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:38.490
I'm excited and inspired by
what you've presented here.

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:42.060
And I think the most
exciting part for me,

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.670
and maybe for Regent
DeGravina, too,

01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:48.300
is that student success is
such a clear thread between all

01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:49.294
of the pillars.

01:08:49.294 --> 01:08:51.210
And it's something that
you drew attention to,

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:54.240
and something that is
really important to us,

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:59.020
and to your student body
and your student population.

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.680
And so I hope that you'll
continue that as you go forward

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:04.229
and implement each of
these things, which

01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:05.520
I'm sure you will.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:09.410
And specifically with the
general education conversation,

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:12.899
it's something that we've talked
a lot with the students about.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:16.680
And they're super interested
in where general education is

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:20.979
going, and how they can
participate in that formation.

01:09:20.979 --> 01:09:26.520
And so I hope that you'll call
on them as the real grassroots

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.000
kind of people to tell you
what general education means

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.380
to us as students, and how
it can be best utilized

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:35.430
in our education.

01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:38.050
But overall, I'm really excited.

01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:43.950
And I think the student success
part is vital and very clear.

01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:46.439
And I think people will be
excited to see that this is

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:48.358
where the university is headed.

01:09:48.358 --> 01:09:49.649
 Thank you for those comments.

01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:53.220
And as I keep saying,
the medical system

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:55.680
wasn't necessarily
designed for patients.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:59.940
But the leading
institutions are now

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:04.390
formulating patient-centric
delivery of care.

01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:06.510
And I think the same thing
about higher education.

01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:10.290
We don't necessarily
have set this up

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:13.900
to be the most student-friendly,
or the most student-centric.

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.870
And it's an opportunity
in this point

01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:18.420
in time for the
University of Arizona

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.280
to be a leader in this area.

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.920
So I appreciate
both of your inputs

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.260
in this planning process.

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:28.890
And all of our students,
particularly Natalynn,

01:10:28.890 --> 01:10:31.140
our student body
president, and Marie,

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:34.860
our graduate and professional
student body president.

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:37.470
And others like
Anthony, and people

01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:39.720
who've helped us and
sat in, particularly

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:43.680
on these general
education discussions.

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:45.870
It's been enlightening to me.

01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:48.300
It's been invigorating.

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.390
And I think we're
to a place now where

01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:56.370
we've got a common set of shared
values around learning outcomes

01:10:56.370 --> 01:11:01.720
and skills, and things that we
need our students to achieve.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.530
And I think it's going
to be exciting for them.

01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:07.890
Instead of just picking
from 400 different courses,

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:10.470
and trying to find the
easiest A they can get,

01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:16.786
and not having any themes or
any structure to go through.

01:11:16.786 --> 01:11:18.660
I think this is going
to be a much better way

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:21.840
to impart general education.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.520
And it's going to
help them, as I

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.474
said before, in any discipline
they choose to go into.

01:11:27.474 --> 01:11:28.640
RON SHOOPMAN: Other regents?

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:29.831
Regent Penley.

01:11:29.831 --> 01:11:31.830
LARRY PENLEY: Thank you
very much, Mr. Chairman.

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:35.250
President Robbins, I really
appreciate what you've done.

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:38.310
As we said earlier, all
of us have had a chance

01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:43.200
to really be a part
of this along the way.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.140
But I would just
say, I especially

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:49.080
appreciate the
plan's sensitivity

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:52.350
to the culture of the
University of Arizona.

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:56.400
As well, the challenge that it
presents to this institution.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.170
Because it is both
sensitive to the culture,

01:11:59.170 --> 01:12:02.340
but it presents the
institution with challenge.

01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:05.250
I think you've done a
really outstanding job

01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:09.840
of embedding this plan in
the place that we have today.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:10.830
Arizona.

01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:11.840
Tucson.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.920
The southwest.

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.610
I think that's
admirable as well.

01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:20.190
The engagement, as I already
indicated, that is so broad,

01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:23.220
I think helps to move
this plan forward.

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:26.730
The fact that you've
established a roadmap, in a way,

01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:30.120
for the future, and that
you've committed yourself

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:33.320
to persistence
and accountability

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.330
in the last slide or two
that you've presented.

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:40.620
But what I hope we'll also begin
to see, and I think we will,

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:44.110
is these sequential
imperatives that

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:47.940
are going to be so basic to
getting this plan implemented

01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.350
along the way.

01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:51.990
And the clarity with
which those imperatives,

01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:55.740
those strategic imperatives,
have to be articulated.

01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:57.810
That's going to be an
essential part, too.

01:12:57.810 --> 01:12:59.140
And I look forward to that.

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:02.370
But I know you understand that.

01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:06.180
But it's really a
great beginning.

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:08.880
And all of us who watched
you undertake this

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.260
knew it would not be easy.

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:14.490
We knew it would present you
with a lot of work ahead.

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:16.830
And I just laud what
you've done so far,

01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:19.650
and look forward to
the future with you.

01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:22.350
 Thank you, Regent Penley, and
thank you for all your help.

01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:26.550
Having been through this before,
along with President Schaefer

01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:28.670
and President Lichens,
as I said before,

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:30.810
you've been of great help to me.

01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:35.430
And we'll continue to have
good exchange of ideas.

01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:38.540
And I know that you will
hold my feet to the fire.

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:41.130
And you know, I
get to run around

01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:45.130
and see the incredible stories
of this university every day.

01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:52.810
And so I simply steal their
slides and brag about them.

01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:55.120
RON SHOOPMAN: Regent Heiler.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.930
JAY HEILER: Thank
you, Mr. Chairman.

01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:02.380
Dr. Robbins and Dr. Robbins'
team, thank you very much.

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:07.020
This was very interesting,
and engaging, and promising.

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.060
But I have to say
you probably had me

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:11.263
when you quoted the New
Radicals at the beginning

01:14:11.263 --> 01:14:12.096
of the presentation.

01:14:12.096 --> 01:14:15.012
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:19.556
And there's another
song on that same album,

01:14:19.556 --> 01:14:21.930
which was the only album they
ever had that was any good.

01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:23.340
And there were only
two songs they ever

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:24.298
had that were any good.

01:14:24.298 --> 01:14:27.638
And the other one is called
"Someday We'll Know."

01:14:27.638 --> 01:14:29.783
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:29.783 --> 01:14:36.900
Equally pertinent
to the presentation.

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:40.860
And I'm glad that you put your
distinguished Wildcat alumnus

01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:43.020
up here at the conclusion.

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:47.490
As you know, she makes her
way in life quite a bit

01:14:47.490 --> 01:14:51.270
these days going around
and speaking to leadership

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:53.640
groups, groups of leaders.

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:57.450
And another quote
from her, which

01:14:57.450 --> 01:15:01.350
I was able to quickly identify,
as I had heard it before

01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:03.330
is that, "we tend to
think that progress

01:15:03.330 --> 01:15:06.360
has to happen in one
particular direction,

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.410
but that's not the case.

01:15:08.410 --> 01:15:11.130
Sometimes you're going to
have to go backwards for a bit

01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:14.700
in order to get where you
eventually want to be."

01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:17.610
Which she absorbed from
returning to the base camp

01:15:17.610 --> 01:15:23.070
on ascent of Everest
before she got there.

01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:25.410
And so finally, the other
point, she also made

01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:30.420
in those same remarks is
that leaders must bear pain

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.610
with grace and vigor.

01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:34.690
So I wish you the best in that.

01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:36.520
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:38.561
ROBERT ROBBINS: I'm
bearing the pain.

01:15:38.561 --> 01:15:40.220
I'm working on the
grave and vigor.

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.510
JAY HEILER: And you have
already demonstrated

01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:47.430
that in your short time
as president at U of A,

01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:49.950
as you have so many other
distinctive qualities

01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:50.740
of leadership.

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.880
And so we're very
fortunate to have you here,

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.390
to have the team
you've assembled.

01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:58.650
And we're very excited
about the future

01:15:58.650 --> 01:16:01.670
of the University of Arizona.

01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:04.420
 We played Tears for
Fears at every meeting,

01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:07.900
because the song "Everybody
Wants to Rule the World"

01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:08.800
seemed applicable.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.150
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:11.275
RON SHOOPMAN: Regent Myers.

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:15.940
RICK MEYERS: Dr.
Robbins, in the spirit

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:18.700
of the arts that you've
brought up a number of times,

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.950
just for you and the entire
team, I just want to say,

01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:22.360
bravo.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.680
ROBERT ROBBINS: Thank you.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.200
RON SHOOPMAN: Anyone else?

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.319
Regent DeGravina?

01:16:27.319 --> 01:16:29.110
AUNDREA DEGRAVINA:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:31.870
Something that I wanted
to save for the end

01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:36.010
is, I'm really impressed with
how the strategic plan also

01:16:36.010 --> 01:16:39.910
has not only the
student-centric focus, but also

01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:43.120
the global approach
as we are entering

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.550
a more globalized world.

01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:47.590
Every day, the
world is changing.

01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:49.990
And the fact that the
University of Arizona

01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:51.970
wants to stay on
top of that I think

01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:54.730
is a key component to
this strategic plan.

01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:57.190
And that's what's going to
keep higher education relevant

01:16:57.190 --> 01:16:59.181
moving forward.

01:16:59.181 --> 01:16:59.680
 Thank you.

01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:05.040
RON SHOOPMAN: So
President Robins, I

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.730
want to echo the comments of
everyone that has spoken here

01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:12.810
today in their support for
you, and for the faculty

01:17:12.810 --> 01:17:15.240
and students and everyone
in this community that

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.440
will need to get behind this.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:20.460
So from the board,
I hope that you all

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:22.740
see this as a call to action.

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:25.140
This is not just a plan
that will sit on the shelf,

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:29.040
but rather, a plan that each
of you have to commit to.

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:32.580
Each of you have to be a part
of finding that path forward,

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:33.840
and doing what you can.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:36.690
Providing the leadership at your
level that's necessary for it

01:17:36.690 --> 01:17:38.660
to succeed.

01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:41.310
As was said earlier,
this was really

01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:43.770
an inflection point
for this university

01:17:43.770 --> 01:17:45.600
and southern Arizona.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:48.060
University of Arizona
under means everything

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:50.190
to Tucson and southern Arizona.

01:17:50.190 --> 01:17:54.730
You have so much
influence on our future.

01:17:54.730 --> 01:17:56.880
So we're counting on you
to do the things that

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.940
are necessary to make
this plan a reality.

01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:02.520
I really liked pillar
5, because while it

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:05.610
isn't very exciting,
maybe, compared

01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:09.360
to some of the other things, it
talks about your understanding

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.750
that the amount of resources
this is going to take

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:17.220
will require finding
efficiencies and effectiveness.

01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.560
So as we execute,
we have to find

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:23.430
ways to do more in the most
efficient way possible.

01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:26.280
That will resonate
with the legislature

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:29.630
and the governor, who hopefully
will fund part of this.

01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:31.380
But it also resonates
with everybody who's

01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:33.360
watching what happens here.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:36.960
Being efficient and
effective and excellent

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.240
is a combination
that's hard to beat.

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.670
And I think we're on
the doorstep of that.

01:18:41.670 --> 01:18:43.680
So I'm truly excited.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:48.480
I congratulate you for
a job well done today.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:52.680
And it is the beginning,
now, as we roll up

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.550
our sleeves to start the work.

01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:59.670
So I'm going to save the final
comment to our esteemed--

01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:00.870
ROBERT ROBBINS: Wildcat.

01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:05.010
 --Wildcat and previous chair.

01:19:05.010 --> 01:19:08.460
So I do have to do
one bit of business.

01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:10.440
I move that the board
accept the University

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:13.140
of Arizona's operational
and financial review.

01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:14.130
Do I have a second?

01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:15.320
 Second.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.690
 I have a second.

01:19:16.690 --> 01:19:18.090
All in favor, say aye.

01:19:18.090 --> 01:19:18.810
 Aye.

01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:20.900
 Any opposed?

01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:22.760
Any abstentions?

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:24.920
Motion carries.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.120
Your plan is approved.

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:26.800
Congratulations.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.630
And now to our
immediate past chair.

01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:30.620
Final comment.

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:35.420
 Well, from this grateful
Wildcat, I only have two words.

01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:35.930
Bear down.

01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:37.430
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:39.580
RON SHOOPMAN: We are adjourned!
