BUT WE JUST CALL IT THE COLONY,
STAR WIPE.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.508 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:34.627 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE POINT IS, BOTHERING YOU,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.267 align:start position:0% line:91%
AROUND IN THIS INCREASINGLY
SOCIALIST CESSPOOL OF A PLANET.

&gt;&gt; WHAT? NO WE GOT RID OF THE
MARTIANS -- THEY WERE

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.978 size:88% position:44% line:85%
TANKING OUR PROPERTY VALUES.

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:55.681 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M JUST A VERY WEALTHY HUMAN
WHO SUMMERS OFF PLANET.

00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:57.884 align:start position:0% line:91%
JON, WE .01%-ERS HAVE HAD A
SPACE COLONY FOR YEARS.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:59.018 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHY?

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.954 align:start position:0% line:91%

PARADISE-- NO TAXES NO,

00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:06.592 align:start position:0% line:91%
PLUS THERE'S INFINITE ROOM FOR
OUR LAVISH ORGIES.

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:09.662 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE STILL HAVE TO WEAR OUR
SPACESUITS, THOUGH.

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:10.396 align:start position:0% line:85%
SAFETY FIRST.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.530 align:start position:0% line:85%
( LAUGHTER ).

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:12.565 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  SO YOUR ORGIES ARE JUST
MOSTLY JUST DRY HUMPING

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:14.667 align:start position:0% line:85%
IN SPACE?

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.173 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:37.590 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. OF
COURSE.

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:42.195 line:91%
WHY DO YOU THINK WE BILLIONAIRES
ARE SO OBSESSED WITH COMMERCIAL

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.496 align:start position:0% line:85%
SPACE TRAVEL.

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:50.770 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS BRAGGING RIGHTS FOR
PEOPLE WHO CAN SPEND A QUARTER

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.573 align:start position:0% line:91%
MILLION DOLLARS FOR ABOUT FIVE
MINUTES OF WEIGHTLESSNESS.
