00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
 From literature to plays and movies around the world, 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.680
 Human obsession with love is strongly our obsession with broken heart / heartbreak. 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.200
 But is heart fracture simply a simple concept, or does it have a real effect on the body and brain? 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.300
 Whenever you experience physical pain, such as injury or injury, the frontal cortex stimulates. 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.040
 Surprisingly, it is the same area of ​​the brain that is activated when you feel you've lost or lost a social relationship. 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.360
 Perhaps physical pain and emotional pain are not as different as we thought before. 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.800
 Think about the ways in which love is missing ... 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.080
 "I tore my heart," "It was like a slap on the face," "I am emotionally wounded." 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.240
 This use of physical description 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.720
 It draws a clear relationship, at least in language, between emotional and physical pain. 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.840
 In fact, studies have shown that humans prefer 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.440
 To be physically hurt to feel socially excluded. 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.960
 But why these two different experiences 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.120
 Do you feel the same feeling in our bodies? 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.860
 Obviously our bodies are using physical pain to prevent 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.320
 Threat any imminent danger. 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.300
 But, from an evolutionary point of view, 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.740
 Anything that increases our overall survival and physical fitness as a family 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.240
 Are likely to continue. 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.960
 And the formation of relationships and social ties between lovers and friends alike 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.260
 Has become an important part of the survival of many factions. 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.480
 You are paying attention to me, and I will pay attention to you. 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.820
 Just like your desire not to burn by hot coffee again, 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.740
 Animals do not want to be socially alone. 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.140
 The pain of both cases increases our chances of survival 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.460
 By avoiding unwanted results. 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.860
 You have chances to survive and reproduce 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.800
 If you are not alone. 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.860
 This can be seen in monkey studies 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.580
 Which when separated from the one you love, 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.580
 Her body is experiencing an increase in cortisol 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.440
 A decrease in the secretion of Norepinephrine, 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.660
 Causing a high response to stress. 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.180
 Eventually, this led to depression, anxiety, and closer crying out loud. 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.680
 For humans, separation, a family member is lost, or isolation 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.340
 Can lead to a similar reaction, 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.480
 Create a sense of physical pain. 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.740
 So, how can we alleviate this pain? 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.880
 Especially as the plasters and creams are dedicated to physical wounds! 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.780
 Studies have shown that high levels of social support 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.760
 Associated with low levels of pain, 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.460
 While socially isolated individuals show little recovery 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.940
 So if you feel a broken heart, 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.780
 Surround yourself with friends and family, 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.160
 Despite this difficulty .. 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.380
 If someone you know is suffering emotionally, 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.960
 He was next to him to provide social support. 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.060
 Because scientifically - we humans - we all just want to belong somewhere. 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.240
