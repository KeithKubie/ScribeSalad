00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.380
Can you hear that?

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.899
Yeah, me either.

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.310
But apparently the Earth is humming right
this very moment!

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.620
Hey listeners, Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.680
In the 1970s an inexplicable hum plagued thousands
of people in the city of Bristol, England.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.840
While some people brushed it off as nonsense,
others claimed it caused headaches and nosebleeds.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.200
Eventually the noise was blamed on local factories,
but not everyone was satisfied with this explanation.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.589
In the spring of 1991 a similar low frequency
buzz annoyed residents of Taos, New Mexico,

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:35.390
attracting lots of media attention.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.649
It’s never been fully explained.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.620
Other cities around the world have heard the
hum.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.840
It’s estimated that only 2% of the population
can hear it.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.820
Some hear a constant hum, others hear a noise
like an idling diesel truck somewhere in the

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.859
distance.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.170
Some suggest a government conspiracy a-la
the episode “Drive” of the X-Files, where

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.649
extremely low frequency sounds were being
emitted from a U.S. Navy antenna.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.809
Others think it’s some sea creature, similar
noises heard by residents living in houseboats

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.170
were traced back to large schools of fish.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.549
While most officials are quick to point a
finger at industrial sources like factories,

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.659
it doesn’t explain away the hum all the
time.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.300
Especially when it’s a world wide hum.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.060
Seismologists, scientists who study the mechanical
properties of the Earth, noticed some strange

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.620
readings in the 90s.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.250
Unexplained low-frequency readings showed
up on seismographs.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.030
Too low for human ears, in the range of 0.01–10
Hz.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.619
Early explanations for the noise pointed at
variations in atmospheric air pressure.

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.710
One study published in the journal Nature
found that the Earth undergoes constant oscillation.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.829
The daily energy of this oscillation is about
the same as a magnitude 6.0 earthquake.

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.940
Yet it happens on days when there are no earthquakes
to blame.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.710
WHAT IS GOING ON.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.439
Now science is one step close to finding an
answer.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.469
In a recent study published in the journal
Geophysical Research Letters one possible

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.060
source of the noise: ocean waves.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.470
The researchers used computer modeling to
examine wind and waves.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.450
They found that its the movement of giant
slow moving waves that cause the Earth to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.870
constantly vibrate.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.270
These giant waves put enormous pressure on
the sea floor which makes seismic waves.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.730
These waves could create vibrations with a
frequency of 13-300 seconds, or as long as

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.730
it takes for it to reach the ocean floor.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.720
The hum is far too low for human ears, but
one of the leading scientists of the study

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.180
told the Huffington Post "If you played it
at 10,000 times the speed you could hear 'white

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.360
noise' like an old TV set between channels."

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.150
So that’s what the Earth sounds like.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.690
Speaking of hearing things…. ever wondered
if you can hear sound in space?

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:58.900
Check out this great video where Trace finds
the answer.
