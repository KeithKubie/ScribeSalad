00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.540
 

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.350
We're asked to prove
that if the orthocenter

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.420
and centroid of a given
triangle are the same point,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.052
then the triangle
is equilateral.

00:00:09.052 --> 00:00:10.760
So I have a triangle
over here, and we're

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.910
going to assume that it's
orthocenter and centroid are

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:14.860
the same point.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.030
Just as a review,
the orthocenter

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.860
is the point where the three
altitudes of a triangle

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.070
intersect, and the centroid is
a point where the three medians.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.546
So we can do is we can
assume that these three

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:26.920
lines right over
here, that these

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.590
are both altitudes and
medians, and that this point

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.400
right over here is both the
orthocenter and the centroid.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.590
So if we assume that
these lines are altitudes,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.930
and that tells us that they are
perpendicular to the opposite

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.950
sides-- so that is
a 90 degree angle,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.610
those are both 90 degree angles.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.650
These are both 90 degree angles.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.485
These are both 90 degree angles.

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:48.860
And the fact that
it's a centroid

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.880
means that each of these lines
bisect at the opposite sides.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.460
So it tells us that this
length is equal to this length,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.210
that this length is
a different color,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.490
this length is equal
to that length,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.740
and it tells us that
this length-- this length

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.260
is equal to that length.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.230
And you might also
say, well, gee.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.690
Each of these lines
are also, then,

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.540
the perpendicular bisectors
of each of the sides.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.150
So not only is this the
orthocenter in the centroid,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.092
it is also the circumcenter of
this triangle right over here.

00:01:19.092 --> 00:01:21.300
But with that out of the
way, we've kind of marked up

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.830
everything that we
can assume, given

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.581
that this is an
orthocenter and a center--

00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:27.205
although there are other things,
other properties of especially

00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:28.300
centroids that we know.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.980
But now let's
prove that this has

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.670
to be an equilateral triangle.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.900
So the first thing that
you might see-- and let me

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.580
label some letters
here, so we can

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.080
refer to things a
little bit better.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:46.820
So let's call that A, B,
C, D, E, and F-- and we

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.930
could label the centroid
right over here, G. So

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.250
the first thing, let's
look at triangle AFG

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.670
and triangle-- with
E-- and triangle EFG.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.730
So let's compare triangle
A, F-- triangle A, F,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.540
G-- Let's compare
that to triangle EFG.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.830
Triangle E,F,G.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.800
So they definitely
have one side-- side

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.540
EF is congruent to side AF--
these are both the same.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.790
And we have angle EFG is
the same as angle AFG,

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.190
they're both 90 degrees.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.520
And then they both
clearly share this side

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.540
FG-- they both share this
side right over here--

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.310
they both share that over there.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.100
So they have a congruent
side, a corresponding angle

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.690
in between another
congruent side,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.620
and they're all--
So congruent side,

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.180
congruent corresponding
angle, and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.500
another congruent
corresponding side.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.810
So by side, angle, side,
these two characters

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.690
are going to be congruent.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.750
By side, angle, side congruency.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.390
Now can you make that
exact same argument

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.790
to say that all of
these pairs that

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.340
have the kind of share-- that
both have these 90 degree

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.730
angles next to each other
are going to be congruent.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.320
By the same exact argument, we
can say triangle EDG triangle

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.900
E,D,G, is going to be
congruent to triangle CDG.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.810
Triangle C,D,G. Same exact
thing-- side, angle--

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.869
and then we have a
side right over here.

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:20.660
And then we can use
the exact same argument

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.618
for this one over here.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:28.300
Triangle C-- that looks
like an A-- triangle CBG

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.694
is congruent to triangle ABG.

00:03:31.694 --> 00:03:36.510
A, B, G. That by
itself is interesting.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.660
But we know that if two
triangles are congruent,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.120
all of their corresponding
sides and angles

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.230
are going to be congruent.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.790
So for example, if we know the
measure of this angle is blue,

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.740
the corresponding
angle on this triangle

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.440
is also going to have
the same measure.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.870
I'll just make it with
that same blue angle.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.580
And we know if this angle
right over here is magenta,

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.094
the corresponding
angle on triangle AFG

00:03:58.094 --> 00:03:59.760
is also going to have
that same measure.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.220
And I'll just mark it
with that magenta again.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.030
Now we also know from our
properties of vertical angles,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.860
that whatever angle
measure AFG is,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.630
DGC is going to have the
same measure, because they

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.650
are vertical angles.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.520
But we know whatever
angle measure

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.769
this is, this
triangle, triangle CDG,

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.990
is congruent to triangle
EDG, so corresponding angles

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.940
have to be congruent.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.230
So this angle is
this magenta measure,

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.985
then this angle also has
to be the magenta measure.

00:04:27.985 --> 00:04:29.860
And then once again,
you see vertical angles.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.490
If this is magenta,
then this is also

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.840
going to have that same measure.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.340
And if this has a
measure, then that

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.131
is also going to have
the same measure.

00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:37.630
So by using a little
bit of argument

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.960
of congruent triangles,
corresponding angles

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.130
are going to be congruent,
and vertical angles,

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.520
we can see that all of these
inner angles right over here

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.640
are going to have to
be the same measure.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.910
And I'm using that with
this little magenta arc

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.250
right over there.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.690
Now all of these triangles, that
we split this triangle into,

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.280
they all have a 90 degree angle,
they all have a magenta arc.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.110
So whatever's left over is
going to be 180 minus 90

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.110
minus magenta.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.304
Or it's really 90 minus this
magenta angle right over here.

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:06.970
And that's what this
blue angle must be.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.890
This blue angle is essentially
90 minus the magenta angle.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.470
The blue angle is 90
minus the magenta angle.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.420
And so that angle must be the
third angle for all of these.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.616
So once again, this
blue angle, there's

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:19.240
going to be 90 minus
the magenta angle,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.150
or 180 minus the
magenta minus the 90.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.200
So that's going to
be a blue angle.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.970
Essentially what
we're saying is,

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.511
if you know two
angles of a triangle,

00:05:26.511 --> 00:05:29.652
it forces what the other
angle is going to be.

00:05:29.652 --> 00:05:31.610
We already know that all
six of these triangles

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.680
have two angles in common--
the 90 degree angle

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.950
and the magenta angle.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.390
So the third angle must
be the same as well.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.700
And we're specifying that
with this blue angle,

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.700
this blue angle right over here.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:48.050
And now you see if we
were to look at angle EAC,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.290
so angle E,A,C. We see that
that's just two of these blue

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.790
angles.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.470
That is congruent
to angle ACE, A,C,E,

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.250
which is just two of
those blue angles,

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.840
which is congruent to angle CEA.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.250
Angle C,E,A. Which
is once again,

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.200
just two of those blue angles.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.290
So we have a triangle here
where the three angles

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.990
in that triangle
all are congruent,

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.910
so it is an
equilateral triangle.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:17.930
It's a 60 degree.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.690
We've proven before if all three
of your angles are the same,

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.840
then the lengths of all three
sides are the same as well.
