00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.019
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic guy remember it so you don't have to we mentioned Tom and Jerry a lot on this show

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.080
It's one of the funniest cartoons that were made

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:55.039
They had brilliant comedic timing and they've been ravished more times than a dog owners leg. We've also mentioned the Wizard of Oz Island

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.709
It's one of the great movies and for a film that's over 80 years old still being referenced and enjoyed by all ages

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.620
It's truly the definition of the term timeless

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.719
I also love Chippendale in Jurassic Park, but just because two things are popular doesn't mean they belong together

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.620
Okay, that one kind of does but this one does it

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.300
Before meeting Willy Wonka, Robin Hood and Jonny Quest. Alright question tears to the question

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.229
Tom and Jerry had one of the most popular crossovers with the Wizard of Oz so much so that even

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.589
spawned a sequel which I'm sorry to say has no headless mom be

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.350
homage

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.370
These totally unnecessary spin also have gotten so much attention that people started making their own random crossovers

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.599
They're almost taking on a life of their own but this one was arguably the most popular

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.989
Showing there is for whatever reason an audience for this

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.819
So I guess it only makes sense to take a look and see if the attention was warranted at all

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.989
Is there anything of redeemable value to this or is it the worst what servoz adaptation since 90% of the other ones?

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.409
Well, let's see the crossover that launched a million crossovers. This is Tom and Jerry and The Wizard of Oz

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.060
once again

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.190
They do the classic Tom and Jerry intro mixed with the intro of whatever movie they're doing a crossover with

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.259
Because they always go so well together yet Disney try that too, and it worked great. I

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.010
Believe in America

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.409
Few people know these three were really good friends as much as Matt Stone and Trey Parker and Leo Tolstoy you really liked mr. Hankey

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.639
Looks like a good voiceover cast but the credits quickly segue into the madness

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.540
We're about to experience through most of this for years. This story has given faithful service to cat mice go home movie. You're drunk

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.570
We then see the opening animation of our main lead

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.180
Go home Dorothy you're drunk

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.160
At first it seems to run the same course as the original Wizard of Oz except everybody looks like a cup head boss

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.959
Something you'll notice very quickly is the animation well, it looks expensive

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.700
Also looks rushed

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.700
Everyone kind of moves like they're on

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.519
Fast-forward though. There's clearly a lot of technique in the color and line work. They still never quite move, right?

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.570
It's oh, how does one say how shall one say director?

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.090
Too many frames your majesty

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.609
Exactly very well put I know that sounds silly as Disney uses a lot of frames and in between animators

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.970
But they also know how to keep them mostly still so while they're not moving much they still seem alive here

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.450
They look hyper alive

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.190
like they want to look natural and flowing but don't know how to do it on such a

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.870
I'm crunch not Dorothy dear. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing now

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.560
You just help us out today and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble, you know

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.909
Most people don't move like this all the time always with some sort of hand movement or moving the head this way and talking over

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.459
And over and over because if you do you look like you're modeling a new collar

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.179
No wonder the farms in trouble they have a mouse for an accountant

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:18.809
Thanks Jer these answers to everything is always government cheese, the answer is not always government cheese

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.449
For a farm concerned about that shit cows sure flexible with killing their unhatched ones. Will you promise me something

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.499
Promise me you'll be friends and work together to keep an eye on Dorothy

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.538
Ex-navy adding a long gay a germ a bullshit Bay

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.619
I'm sure this song will be just as powerful here as in the original

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.530
Yeah, it sounds nice but you know what's missing excessive violence, yeah, no joke all throughout the entire song

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.649
Tom and Jerry bicker fight and trip over themselves because the song really had no emotional weight without it

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.929
It's like the ultimate kind of meet me in st. Louis when they drop a piano on her head

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.880
Even if the violence was taken out

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.489
I don't like the way this horse is looking at her his eyes seemed to be saying. Oh, yeah

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.090
Dorothy

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.090
I'll take you the rainbow

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.420
jollywood way up high really means

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.590
But the mean-spirited I don't think they give her a name in this version comes to take Toto away. I love that

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.299
This is actually so rushed then not only does she put up little to no fight keeping him

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.200
But she accidentally calls the labia him and nobody ever fixed it

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.119
You have to admit she is rather mannish

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.170
How's the total was seen as the most dangerous came down on the farm when there's a bolt-on named butch that lives there too

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.070
Also, come on. You couldn't have droopy as toto

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.140
Ppyou

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.169
Tom and Jerry helped rescue toto in this version with actually some pretty inventive slapstick and

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:12.080
You know where they go from here Dorothy tries running away and comes across a fortune teller who tells it to go back home who?

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.960
Will eventually end up being the wizard in her dream or they cut all that

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.859
I guess their subconscious made up this guy three times

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:35.280
Whores actually why you here? You told me what's up with this guy? I'll mend your troubles like lemon drops

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.720
So Dorothy Tom and Jerry all get knocked out and somehow share the exact same dream

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.439
So either this is going on or this is going on

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.209
They of course wake up in the colorful Land of Oz as it turns out the munchkins are pretty hardcore

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.030
Bats think about that the munchkins carry bats

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.959
Is the lollipop guild gonna have to cut a bitch

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.939
This munchkin of course is Tuffy who explains what happened to Dorothy

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.619
And you know if you never saw the Wizard of Oz before and this was your introduction to it

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.180
How would you react to this?

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:30.930
I was you and Dorothy came and landed on the Wicked Witch of the East and then Glinda the Good Witch of the North

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.240
gave Dorothy the ruby slippers

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.349
The Wicked Witch of the West showed up to take the magical Ruby's

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.590
You are insane this is all insane and I am never doing edibles again

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:51.629
Here's a fun game. See if you can spot any innuendo and Tuffy offers to come with them

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:01.319
Well, you're only a munchkin, okay that makes it worse

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.860
So he sings about his

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:11.099
Hmm sighs problem as Tom and Jerry agreed to let him tag along to see the Wizard to get some height

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.120
You know, there's something so funny

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:23.090
Just knowing that all the other munchkins are in their home sleeping the witches defeated Dorothy as often

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.139
they kind of just call it a day with no more celebrating and then they're like oh

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.420
What's all the commotion?

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:36.020
Oh other visitors from the sky. Okay, we did like five song numbers for that. Redneck girl. We are not doing this shit again

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.679
We'll just give it to that Easter egg Mouse to perform with no backup

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:45.110
I'm busy trying to figure out why our flowers are looking so flat. Maybe it's that new fertilizer. We've been using

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.980
So admit it is a little funny that even miles later

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.400
Tuffy is still singing that song and they try to shut him off

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:17.389
But I took of my collar when I see black crows in an animated adaptation of an early 40s film. Oh wait, I forgot

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:23.480
It's Tom and Jerry they've had years of experience with this kind of stuff. What are you nuts? No one goes that way

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.000
What do you mean? Lots of people go both ways

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:26.870
Okay

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.259
The internet already has this clip to play with I don't think we need any more innuendos

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.940
The girls give them the wrong directions and they stumble across a much more dangerous path

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:41.000
Tell me if you think Tuffy's persistence to keep going is sounding less optimistic and a little more cultish

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:56.629
Never stray from the path Vanessa, that's right. Your name is Vanessa now SMI

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.680
They come across the Wicked Witch though who finds Dorothy and a lot of cutscenes easing on down the road

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:09.140
The witch tries to figure out how to stop them. Of course. We know she's gonna use the flowers to put them to sleep

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.450
For smash them into oblivion

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.070
I'll get credit that is much more of a Tom and Jerry way of doing things

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:24.530
it actually makes me wish there's a little bit more Wizard of Oz logic to this cartoony logy because you know

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.530
The witch would be able to survive this

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.400
Look it's raining our body parts

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.000
I

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Hoped I would never see you again

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.759
I'm hoping the wizard will give me some brains

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:46.699
I want a heart I made some courage and I'll todo and I want is to get back home to Cannes

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.449
We're clip noting what was already a heavily cliff noted story

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.690
Then I'm sure to get a brain. Aha

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:01.429
Well, I guess my noise doesn't mean dick anymore it shouldn't die your great tone fifl knockoff

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:08.900
Anyway, they want to be more honest the lyrics should be this if I only had a script my balls hurt, right?

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.620
They make their way to the Emerald City

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.939
Look, there's the penis room a little mermaid poster and like the original they come across a horse-drawn carriage

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:27.680
Unemotionally scatterbrained driver, do you trim your beard trim my beard?

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:34.940
I'm gonna cut your head off and bury you but yes, I've never seen a horse like that before no and never will again

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:41.270
I fancy I'm gonna chew it it shines purple when it's depressed. So I'm just gonna drop it off at the swamp of sadness

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.410
The people in the city look one step away from drinking the green kool-aid

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:53.059
We'll see the Wizard - once we give him our souls. Ah

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.930
Could you put a little more hay in the crotch area for me?

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.389
It gets a little cold in Oz if you know what I'm saying

00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:11.208
So is one of the chicks from the farm having this dream - how does any of this work

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:19.880
Before the which appears to threaten them only this time she holds the broom in a very, um clips for sale manner

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.120
Okay, that's just funny

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:35.299
As before they visit the wizard and I was gonna make a Skeletor melting into a Mars Attacks Martian joke

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:40.909
But the more I look at the top of that head it's looking a little um a tiny

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.769
Uh-oh. How does one say how shall one say director to clitoris your majesty exactly very well

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:54.709
put as in the original they had to get the witch's broom before the wizard will grant any of their wishes and as before the

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:56.709
Scarecrow is still packing heat

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.659
I love all the things that kept out of this version they chose that to leave in

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.880
Don't worry I'll shoot him

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.539
I'll fill them with more fall from the stubble on script

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.880
What's happened to you?

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.950
They took my legs off and then threw them over there

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:20.470
Then they took my chest out and threw it over there then they took my penis and said they were saving it for a lonely

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.500
night

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.450
Tom and jerry break loose and run into an aza gator or is it an oz a dial?

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.450
I have to look at the note. Let me run into a wall

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.700
Should I roll the credits?

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.150
Welcome back

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:53.499
The witch tries to get Dorothy slippers like in the original but they up the zapping powers of her slippers. Just a tiny bit

00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:00.039
You know first point with this this all is I will give credit

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.800
it feels less like a Tom and Jerry cartoon stuck in The Wizard of Oz and more like The Wizard of Oz stuck in a

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.100
Tom and Jerry cartoon

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:14.320
The comedic slapstick still gets a good chuckle every now and then do you see that? It's how long you've got to live

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.070
I'll come back for you justice those fans run out

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.769
We'll still keep it vague how that's going to kill you

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:25.150
But see how it's Tom and Jerry, I guess we'll just say death by bowling ball. I don't know

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.829
We get a pretty funny cameo from Butch and droopy as the guards

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:35.259
He still should have been toto you could have called him troupe. That's Tom and Jerry over here. That water can kill the witch

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.650
So they go to an unguarded unlocked well on her property

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.200
That's all levels of odd

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.100
Isn't that the equivalent of like?

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:48.670
Popsicles being the only thing that can kill you and the only secure do you have is a sticker on your freezer that says now?

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.460
Eating popsicles. It could kill me. So keep them out of sight

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.009
I mean, you know, I know that yeah, that's weird, but it's come on

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:56.710
Don't be a dick. Come on

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.440
They break in and stop the hourglass. I

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:06.579
Think it just kind of cuts away from it. If she suddenly dies in a few moments, we'll know why they come across the guards

00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:14.489
Don't make me do my willy wonka tunnel monologue

00:15:18.699 --> 00:15:23.159
It works for a bit, but the witch catches up with them as tom and jerry tried to get water

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.490
Tuffy's got some rage issues. He's what angry bastard

00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:35.248
That's right a munchkin invented scotch tape in this reality

00:15:35.889 --> 00:15:38.159
Somehow it still makes more sense than that Franco movie

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.370
ring-around-the-rosy a pocket full of spears

00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:44.248
Thought you were pretty foxy, didn't you?

00:15:45.579 --> 00:15:51.179
Can I really make fun of a word for almost sounding like another word the last to go? We'll see the first

00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:58.409
That was like five different Tim Curry masks from the movie legend and somehow Tim Curry was still more feminine

00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:05.389
How about a little fire scarecrow

00:16:06.149 --> 00:16:10.039
You know what never forgot that part, isn't that kind of like setting your car on fire?

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.639
Tom and Jerry splash the water on the witch though and

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.790
Even though it's animated. It's still shot from a distance

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.549
So you can't make out the effects that aren't they're confusing

00:16:19.679 --> 00:16:26.209
You know the rest they get the broom returned to the wizard and remember that's adjusted door from the GI Joe movie

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.419
It's along the same

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:28.220
Yeah

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.379
And they find out here was a phony the whole time

00:16:30.449 --> 00:16:34.969
But he finds a way of giving them the gifts they were looking for making them realize they had them all along

00:16:35.339 --> 00:16:37.518
Some of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles

00:16:37.679 --> 00:16:39.949
Triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side

00:16:40.049 --> 00:16:43.249
Still a right triangle if it gotta be dummy you might as well be smart

00:16:43.889 --> 00:16:46.339
Look, he even gave Tuffy some stilts

00:16:49.739 --> 00:16:51.739
Do I even need to say anything

00:16:52.019 --> 00:16:53.899
The balloon takes off without Dorothy

00:16:53.899 --> 00:16:56.508
But he says he can't bring it back because he doesn't know how it works

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:01.969
How the hell is he gonna get her home then questions, but Glenda appears via Hawking bubbles

00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:08.298
Can you send me home? You don't need to be helped any longer? You've always had the power to go back to Kansas

00:17:08.299 --> 00:17:13.668
Am I the only one that thinks they look like Peter Lorre caricatures and drag. Can you send me home?

00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:18.859
Celia forth you always handy power to go back to Kansas Rick

00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:24.589
She taps her heels three times ends up back home, and it was all a bad dreams

00:17:24.899 --> 00:17:28.518
Yeah, plural plural bad dreams. You've just had a bad dream

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:39.649
The local habitation if it was a dream how a mouse and dogs still talking and what is that horse looking at me?

00:17:39.899 --> 00:17:41.959
Can wish up all my stuff?

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.519
Tom and Jerry believed Dorothy story though and tried to act out that they went through it, too

00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:55.219
and if you didn't know the story they were acting out you look at them like someone lobotomized your best friend -

00:17:58.919 --> 00:18:01.219
Tom and Jerry meet awkward silence

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.480
Something happened

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:17.199
They'd fight some more the end credits roll and everybody who never heard of The Wizard of Oz thinks they're stoned out of their minds

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:23.770
so there it is Tom and Jerry and The Wizard of Oz and awful Wizard of Oz adaptation, but

00:18:24.529 --> 00:18:26.529
Tom and Jerry cartoon

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.250
The special is forgivingly short clocking in at under an hour

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:35.289
it focuses more on trying to tell a funny Tom and Jerry adventure rather than a faithful Wizard of Oz

00:18:35.419 --> 00:18:37.370
adventure and when it does that

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:42.130
Surprisingly. Alright, the slapstick has an understanding of making them feel solid

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:47.289
So the pain seems harsher and funnier Tom screams sound eerily close to his original scream

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:56.029
And the timing for the most part is pretty damn good where it fails not surprisingly is the Wizard of Oz

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:01.820
It's just not a good adaptation because most of what made the story so special is kept in the background

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:07.369
But that's kind of what makes it an amusing Tom and Jerry special. There's not much focus on The Wizard of Oz

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.879
Especially when compared to something like the Willy Wonka crossover

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.739
So, yeah, I guess it's not good as it is pointless and the Oz stuff falls flat

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:21.710
But it still got a few laughs out of which after this is a ton more than what I was expecting

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.879
So it's not technically good but it's not nearly as bad as you would think

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.379
Take it for what it's worth and find out if this acid trip over the rainbow is for you

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.369
And we can hope there won't be any more random crossovers from what the hell are you doing at OU Barbera

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.740
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.080
Esily ones are there

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:53.440
Hey Doug Walker here doing the charity shout out Helen Keller International is this week's charity?

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:58.209
Helen Keller International saves and improves the sight in lives of the world's

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:04.179
Vulnerable by combating the causes and consequences of blindness poor health and malnutrition

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.440
They envision a world where no one suffers from preventable or treatable

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.310
blindness or low vision

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:17.950
No one suffers from malnutrition and fewer people suffer laws of they're productive years due to disability and premature death

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:24.519
To accomplish this they build a capacity of local government nonprofit and private sector systems

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:32.110
Promoting the development of sustained large-scale programs that deliver effective solutions to preventable blindness and malnutrition

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:33.770
If you look at their website

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:40.960
you can not only see all the places they travel to but also all the good people they help at those places making sure they

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.050
