00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.140
Hello You Tube I'm Ian Bremmer and I'm taking
about whether or not Obama is going to make

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.440
a difference for the better in 2009. He certainly
isn't going to make a difference for the worst,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.710
but the question is how much he can really
do. No one here at the world economic forum

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.840
really thinks that the economy is going to
improve significantly before 2010. So there

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.080
are limitations there. And secondly there's
a question of just how much time and effort

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.599
the Obama administration is going to be able
to actually put outside of the United States.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.870
And I'm sitting here at Davos, I was actually
asked the other day on CNBC, about whether

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.710
I was sad that there weren't any Americans
here. I said well I'm an American I should

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.160
be making you happy. Of course they're talking
about the Obama administration. In fact there

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.440
are just no foreign policy officials. The
Obama administration is going to be focused

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.890
almost exclusively on dealing with the domestic
economy. And that's the reason why Gates was

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.190
reappointed as secretary of defense. You have
a lot of great special envoys with a lot of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.180
experience, but at the end of the day you
really wanna make it better. The president

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.920
would have to spend an awful a lot amount
of time on the ground, on the road. And in

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.490
2009 I don't expect that's gonna happen. So
long term I think there's going to be a honey

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.030
moon. Obama is going to be more multi lateral
in form and in content. We already saw in

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.750
Aljezera that he's reaching out to modern
Islamic communities around the world. I thought

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.600
that was very effective. This is a guy who's
going to ask the Europeans for more trips

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.020
in Afghanistan. We'll probably have some success
there. I think the world in generally rooting

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.610
for Obama with very few exceptions. But in
2009 do I think he's going to make a fundamental

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.630
and structural difference in the world? I'm
balanced no. Thanks a lot.
