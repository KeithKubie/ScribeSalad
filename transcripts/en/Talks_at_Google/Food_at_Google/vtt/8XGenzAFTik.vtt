OLIVIA: Welcome to Kitchen Sink.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.480
This is Kitchen Sink
the cafe, and this

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.400
is Kitchen Sink the
teaching kitchen,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.080
which I hope you'll come
and visit and learn about.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.650
We have a lot of cooking
classes going on.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.380
But today, it's my pleasure
to have our first guest

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.540
from San Francisco, an author,
a food writer, and a chef.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.390
Carolyn Jung was a
former colleague of mine.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.960
She's a food writer,
an award-winning food

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.450
writer for the San
Jose Mercury, and she

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.300
hit upon this idea of writing a
book about the very best chefs

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.670
in San Francisco and getting a
recipe from each one of them.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.650
And she chose for us
today Chef Bill Corbett

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.290
of Absinth, which is a noted
San Francisco restaurant.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.485
And he's got some treats
for us to taste afterwards.

00:00:56.485 --> 00:00:59.010
CAROLYN JUNG: Thank you,
guys, for taking time out

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.710
on your very, very busy day.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.310
I know you have
work to do, but this

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.069
is so much better, isn't it?

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:09.160
I mean, we have an afternoon
of talking about sweets

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.360
and then eating dessert.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.670
So I think that
beats work any day.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.740
So as Olivia was so kindly
enough to introduce me,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.050
I'm a long-time Bay
Area food writer.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.620
I was at the Mercury
News for many years,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.490
and now I freelance for a
number of publications locally,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.660
nationally, even
sometimes internationally.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.060
And I do my own blog
called foodgal.com,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.730
and I was lucky enough to
be approached last year

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.150
to do this book, "San
Francisco Chef's Table,"

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.190
which is a compilation
of about 50

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.590
or more restaurants
around the Bay

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.610
Area with their stories and
their signature recipes.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.580
So it's sort of
fell into my lap I

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.210
like to say or
actually into my inbox.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.350
Here I was, just working
away on my computer at home,

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.540
and this email came over
from the publisher, who

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.220
does this chef series
books around the country,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.650
asking me if I wanted to do
the San Francisco one which,

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.260
shocked as I was, there was not
a San Francisco one already,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.440
and I was thrilled.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.990
But then I had a heart
attack when she said,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.350
we can only give you
three months to do it.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.220
Which yeah, if you've ever
worked on a project like that,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.930
is not a whole lot of time.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.660
So I was really
grateful that I was

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.930
able to sweet-talk
a number of chefs,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.240
including the one
sitting next to me,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.710
into being a part of this book.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.930
Because really, they are the
ones that made this such,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.464
I think, a really remarkable,
usable, and fun book.

00:02:48.464 --> 00:02:49.880
And what I looked
for in the chefs

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.740
that I chose was restaurants
that represented San Francisco,

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.990
either they were iconic
ones like Swan Oyster Depot,

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.150
or hot, hip, happening
restaurants of the moment

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.420
like State Bird Provisions in
San Francisco that most of us

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.870
can't even get into,
even if we wish we could.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.740
And recipes that
were actually doable,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.740
because I don't want
the book to just

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.270
be sitting pretty
on a coffee table.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.190
I want people to actually
try and cook from it.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.830
And granted, there are
some dishes in there

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.940
that are more
challenging than others.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.650
There are others that are
very, very straightforward.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.140
So I would like to
introduce you to a pastry

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.460
chef who I so admire.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.950
And if you have not had the
chance to try his desserts,

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.120
you will this afternoon,
and I guarantee

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.440
that it will put a
smile on your face.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.470
So Bill Corbett is the executive
pastry chef of the Absinthe

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.510
Group in San Francisco, which
consists of Absinthe Brasserie,

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.540
the Boxing Room, Comstock
Saloon, Harlequin,

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.580
and a soon-to-be-named
new restaurant in Soma.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.800
BILL CORBETT: Yeah, it's
a soon-to-be-named Spanish

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.065
restaurant in Soma.

00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:11.450
CAROLYN JUNG: And you are
responsible for the dessert

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.160
programs at all of
those restaurants.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.430
BILL CORBETT: Yeah,
that's correct.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.260
I do desserts for all
four of the restaurants

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.730
we have currently, and soon I'll
have a fifth one on my hands.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.490
CAROLYN JUNG: So
you're a busy man.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.823
BILL CORBETT: We're pretty busy.

00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:28.490
We have it pretty organized, so
it doesn't each my whole life

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.210
up, but it works out OK.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.850
CAROLYN JUNG: So one thing
you might not know about Bill

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.250
is that, if given his druthers,
he would have actually not been

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.180
a pastry chef but a heavy
metal musician, right?

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.350
BILL CORBETT: Just rock
and role in general, yeah.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.050
If I could play guitar
and that well, then maybe.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.940
But definitely music is
a big passion of mine.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.580
But cooking is a little
more realistic, I think.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.870
CAROLYN JUNG: So I
had the pleasure also

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.400
of interviewing one of
your colleagues and friends

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.800
recently, Brooks
Headley, the pastry chef

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.220
of Del Posto in New
York, and he used

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.132
to be a heavy metal drummer.

00:05:13.132 --> 00:05:17.400
BILL CORBETT: Yeah, he's
the real-deal drummer.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.260
I actually listened to his bands
long before I ever met him.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.690
And so he's been in a lot
of really great punk bands

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.247
in the '90s.

00:05:24.247 --> 00:05:25.830
CAROLYN JUNG: And I
know there-- and I

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.790
know they're probably other
few pastry chefs out there

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.030
with this fondness for
that type of music,

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.730
so I just have to
ask-- on one hand,

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.100
you have these very
dark lyrics in music

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.630
and on the other hand in
what you do in your day job,

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:46.830
you have this very sweet, frilly
spun-sugar type environment.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.755
So what is up with that?

00:05:48.755 --> 00:05:51.344
BILL CORBETT: I don't know if
the environment's so sweet,

00:05:51.344 --> 00:05:53.010
if you actually hang
out in the kitchen,

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.220
but I think there's a certain
level of precision, maybe, that

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.300
goes along with both
sides of things.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.925
When you listen to
heavy metal, there's

00:06:01.925 --> 00:06:04.980
a lot of precision in the
drums and the guitars.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.299
So I think there's-- and
with pastry, it's all about--

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:09.840
there's a lot of precision that
goes into everything from how

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.890
you weigh the ingredients
to how the dish looks.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.410
And so I think it
might have more

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.730
to do with that, that
kind of appreciation.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.100
And punk rock and
heavy metal are

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.160
sort of the underdogs
of the music industry,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.860
and we're also the underdogs
of the culinary scene.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.230
We're always the ones
in the background.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.420
So I think it all
works out well.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.635
It makes sense, I think.

00:06:31.635 --> 00:06:33.900
CAROLYN JUNG: Do
you listen to metal

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.490
while you're cooking and baking?

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.160
BILL CORBETT: Yeah, I
torture my cooks a lot.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.950
They have to listen
to-- but they--

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.412
it's not like they don't get to
listen to their music, either.

00:06:44.412 --> 00:06:46.120
So there's a good
balance in the kitchen.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.560
But definitely I listen to
a lot of more aggressive,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.670
faster music.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.050
I think it keeps me going more.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.794
It keeps me excited, and I
don't get bored that way.

00:06:57.794 --> 00:07:01.150
CAROLYN JUNG: So I know
you grew up in Canada.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.470
And yeah.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.180
So you grew up in Canada, and
you left Canada for Florida

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.850
with $800 in your
pocket following

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.680
some friends who were in bands.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.310
And you took, I guess,
your first job, actually,

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.019
in the restaurant industry
at the Psychic Cafe.

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:25.060
BILL CORBETT: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.315
So I worked in-- back in,
I think it was around 99,

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:31.790
I moved to Florida.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.020
I had met all these amazing
people in punk bands,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.669
and they were all touring and
living this inspiring life,

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:38.960
and I thought, this is awesome.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.900
I want to go live
with these people.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.280
So I had about $800 in
my pocket and moved down.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.885
I sold tons of extra records
I didn't want any more,

00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:49.510
things like that just
to get some money

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.960
and just moved to Florida
with no real plan.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.030
I ended up living
there for two years.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.752
Met my wife now.

00:07:56.752 --> 00:07:58.210
CAROLYN JUNG: So
maybe it was fate?

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.970
BILL CORBETT: Yeah, I
think it might have been.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.750
And then I ended up
working at a cafe,

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.630
working in the kitchen and
kind of running the kitchen.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.777
And you could go in and get
a psychic reading and lunch

00:08:09.777 --> 00:08:10.360
kind of thing.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.191
It was really-- it was an
odd place, that's for sure.

00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:14.940
CAROLYN JUNG: And how
long were you there?

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.481
BILL CORBETT: I was
there pretty much

00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:20.420
the whole two years
I lived in Florida.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.270
So it was interesting.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.110
It's an interesting
culture, let's just

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.140
say, with all these psychics
running around and then.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.245
Yeah, it's very Florida almost.

00:08:30.245 --> 00:08:32.500
CAROLYN JUNG: Did you ever
have a psychic reading done

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.030
yourself?

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.480
BILL CORBETT: No, I didn't
really, I don't know.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.787
They would always try to
tell me things about my life

00:08:37.787 --> 00:08:39.370
and what I should
be doing and things,

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.419
and I would always just
take it with a grain of salt

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.570
and get back to making a
sandwich or something, whatever

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.660
I was doing at the time.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.820
CAROLYN JUNG: So now
it kind of was fate

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.750
that you met your wife there,
because you then followed her

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.360
to New York, where
she was studying.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.120
And it was in New
York where you met

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.380
someone who was very pivotal all
in your career, Lincoln Carson.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.200
BILL CORBETT: Yeah, so after--

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.550
CAROLYN JUNG: Who is
the corporate pastry

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.030
chef for Michael
Mina restaurants.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.630
BILL CORBETT:
Actually, not anymore.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.270
He just left.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.223
CAROLYN JUNG: Did see?

00:09:10.223 --> 00:09:10.626
Where is he now?

00:09:10.626 --> 00:09:12.042
BILL CORBETT: He
just moved to LA.

00:09:12.042 --> 00:09:14.500
He just helped open a place
called Superba Food and Bread

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.000
in LA.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.930
CAROLYN JUNG: OK.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:21.060
BILL CORBETT: But I ended up
moving New York after my wife

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:21.945
and I got married.

00:09:21.945 --> 00:09:23.320
She was going to
art school there

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.000
and ended up wanting to
work in real kitchens there

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.545
and fell in.

00:09:28.545 --> 00:09:30.670
Basically I didn't have
culinary school background,

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.503
and I hadn't worked on
the line in New York,

00:09:32.503 --> 00:09:34.070
so nobody would hire me.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.910
And then I luckily
met this person

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.480
who was working
for Lincoln Carson,

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.515
and she said, why
don't you come try out?

00:09:39.515 --> 00:09:41.790
So I went and tried out, and
he saw that I wanted to learn,

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.500
so he hired me.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.070
And then from then on, he
took me under his wing.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.520
And for my career, it really--
I don't think my career

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.060
would have gone where it
has gone without having that

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.810
kind of encounter.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:56.180
CAROLYN JUNG: Because actually,
you started on the savory side,

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:56.965
right?

00:09:56.965 --> 00:09:57.910
BILL CORBETT: Sort of.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.670
I started on savory in really
weird places like the Mongolian

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.890
Grill Buffet and like,
and then in Psychic Cafe,

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:08.369
and then I was working
at a bar in Brooklyn.

00:10:08.369 --> 00:10:10.660
When I first moved to New
York, I worked in the kitchen

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.370
at a bar.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.120
And so I did all the
savory food in there,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.550
but-- So sort of
on the savory side,

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.240
but nowhere in a real
serious cooking environment

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.680
until I got into pastry.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.680
CAROLYN JUNG: So what's
the most important thing

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.362
Lincoln taught you?

00:10:25.362 --> 00:10:30.160
BILL CORBETT: To be methodic
about things when it comes.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:36.040
Everything from even zesting
an orange, making sure you're

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.010
doing it in a methodical
way so it's more efficient

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.020
and time sensitive.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.290
And he taught me
so much, though,

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.260
that's just like one
of the major things.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.530
He was a very methodical
worker in the way

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.370
he prepares a dish and
the way he executes it.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.660
And so he taught me a ton
about how to execute dishes

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.020
from start to finish and how
to produce them at high volume

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.470
and be able to still maintain
consistency and quality.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.460
CAROLYN JUNG: And then you
went to go work at wd-50

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:08.570
with Wiley Dufresne, the
madman of molecular gastronomy.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.950
So in an environment like
that, do all the rules go out

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.375
the window and anything
is fair game to try?

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:18.332
BILL CORBETT:
There's a definite-

00:11:18.332 --> 00:11:20.290
I wouldn't say all the
rules go out the window.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.290
I would say Wiley's a big
believer in a solid foundation

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.055
and understanding
your technique.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.069
But then it's like once
you understand the rules,

00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:33.860
then you can break the
rules kind of thing.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.547
And that was one of the
most incredible learning

00:11:36.547 --> 00:11:37.880
experiences, working with Wiley.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.180
Because I worked under the
pastry chef, Sam Mason,

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.260
there at the time,
and then he left

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.200
and Alex Stupak came on board.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.517
And just seeing how you
threw everything out

00:11:49.517 --> 00:11:51.600
and just you were able to
try anything you wanted.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.970
And Wiley, you could
come to him and say,

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.720
what if you did this
with this ingredient?

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.980
And he would say, try it.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.180
He wouldn't just try to
give you the answer of it

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.270
why it wouldn't work
or why it might.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.345
He would say try it.

00:12:01.345 --> 00:12:05.960
CAROLYN JUNG: Can you describe
a couple of the really out there

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.754
desserts that you did there?

00:12:07.754 --> 00:12:09.170
BILL CORBETT: Some
of the desserts

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.810
we were doing
there were-- we did

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:16.910
a manchego cheesecake with
quince and pineapple, which

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.780
I think today maybe doesn't
sound as crazy as it did maybe

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.900
10 years ago, but
it was kind of-- it

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.840
was a bigger technical
trick, I think, then.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.950
And so much, the
flavor was so mind--

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.670
it's not something that
maybe blew people's minds,

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:32.490
flavor wise.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:33.990
When you ate it,
it was really good.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.990
But what I'm saying,
like the thought process

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.323
or when you see that on a
menu, you don't go oh, my god,

00:12:38.323 --> 00:12:39.940
manchego in a dessert.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.170
But it was more the
technique of how

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.280
do you get manchego into a
cheesecake sort of thing.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.470
Because if you just throw
manchego in a cheesecake,

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:48.650
it's very hard cheese.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.710
It doesn't really break down.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.920
When it melts, it
gets kind of oily.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.360
And sometimes it was
just trying to figure out

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.850
the almost dumbest
way of going about it.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.050
So we ended up just pureeing
the cheese with water

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.550
and making this
thick puree that was

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.260
kind of the consistency
of cream cheese

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.930
and then folding it into
the cake, and it worked.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.510
But so there'd be
desserts like that.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:14.052
I try-- they don't-- I guess
now it was weird because they

00:13:14.052 --> 00:13:15.760
don't seem like they
sound so outrageous,

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.134
but we were doing things, I
guess, at the time that were.

00:13:18.134 --> 00:13:20.530
We were doing things
with a butternut squash

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.630
sorbet with chocolate.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.780
And Sam Mason was doing things
like soy caramel and parsnip

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.160
cake.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.730
And really-- but exercising
a really great balance

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.280
between sweet and savory.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.710
The dish, it was
still a dessert.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.380
It I wasn't a savory dish
with some sugar added to it.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.130
It was still a
dessert, and I think

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.635
that was the important thing.

00:13:43.635 --> 00:13:45.070
CAROLYN JUNG: So
then, of course,

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.630
you went on to work at Qua
in San Francisco, Daniel

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.010
Patterson's famed restaurant.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.890
Now, Daniel, I know, is known to
be quite the taskmaster, quite

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:56.190
the perfectionist.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.445
So what was it like
working for him?

00:13:58.445 --> 00:14:02.400
BILL CORBETT: It was great,
because it really taught

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.580
me to boil down
the things I knew

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.740
and strip away the
nonessential things,

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.760
like the things that
were maybe fluff

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.890
and didn't really need
to be in the dish.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.890
It's taking a dish and boiling
it down to it's essentials.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:20.387
It was-- the dishes--
yeah, there's

00:14:20.387 --> 00:14:22.220
this whole perfectionist
thing going around,

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.640
but there's also just
incredible ingredients

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.020
and using the best ingredients,
and that was what it was about.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.270
And then having the food
not interfere with itself.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.950
But still, I don't know, the
combination seemed so simple

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.122
at the time, and my
dishes got simpler

00:14:36.122 --> 00:14:38.330
and simpler and simpler,
almost, the way they looked.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.372
But the technique behind
them was still the same.

00:14:41.372 --> 00:14:43.080
I was just stripping
away a lot, I think.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.288
CAROLYN JUNG: I think that's
true with a lot of chefs

00:14:45.288 --> 00:14:47.550
as they mature.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.410
Can you just tell by
looking at a plate

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.000
if there's like everything
plus the kitchen sink on there

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.920
that it's a younger chef
who probably made it?

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.378
BILL CORBETT: Yeah,
I think there's

00:14:55.378 --> 00:14:58.140
a lot of times you can look
and say OK, this person

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.287
has a lot of ideas,
and they're trying

00:15:00.287 --> 00:15:01.870
to fit all these
ideas into one plate.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.510
And it's not a horrible thing.

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.900
It's part of the
learning process.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.080
But you start to, as
you grow and mature,

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.120
you definitely learn what's
necessary, what's not,

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.680
and how you can
actually just make

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.766
the dish greater by almost
simplifying a little bit.

00:15:18.766 --> 00:15:21.180
CAROLYN JUNG: So
where does inspiration

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.200
come from when you set about
creating a new dessert?

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.970
Is it an ingredient
that you spy?

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.690
Is it something
from your memory?

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.226
What triggers it?

00:15:30.226 --> 00:15:34.360
BILL CORBETT: It's just
everything that surrounds me,

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:34.860
almost.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.530
It's not like I'm inspired by
everything in some hippie way

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.130
like oh, look at the
leaves out there.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.760
Now I'm going to make a desert
based on that bush over there.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:48.380
But it's more like, for
me, it's just inspiration

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.860
comes either from at the market.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.030
I see some really great
product, and you just

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.030
can't turn away from it.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.950
Like meiwa kumquats,
are an example.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.550
From Brokaw Farms at the San
Francisco ferry building.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:01.294
You get these kumquats, and
you just eat them whole.

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:02.085
They're not bitter.

00:16:02.085 --> 00:16:02.765
They're sweet.

00:16:02.765 --> 00:16:04.640
They're really well
balanced Just enough acid

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.310
and you're just like I can't
not use this ingredient.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.940
And so you build
a dish around it.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.680
And then sometimes
it is a combination.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.390
Sometimes it's, like the
beet cake in the book,

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:22.006
it's my take on the salad you
find at every San Francisco

00:16:22.006 --> 00:16:24.970
restaurant, which is
roasted beets, goat

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:25.886
cheese, and walnuts.

00:16:25.886 --> 00:16:28.260
And then maybe it's got some
orange segments or something

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.281
or some fennel involved,
but generally there's

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:31.030
three ingredients.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.564
So I thought they
all work in desserts,

00:16:33.564 --> 00:16:35.230
so why don't I make
a dessert with them?

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:39.740
So I did the beet cake with
a goat fromage blanc frosting

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.350
and then candied walnuts.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:42.828
So it'll be like that.

00:16:42.828 --> 00:16:44.536
I'll see something,
and I'll want to riff

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:46.180
on it a little bit.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.940
Or it's just this great
combination of herbs and fruit,

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.730
like strawberries go
so well with things

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:54.440
like tarragon or
basil or fennel.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.626
There's so many
different things.

00:16:56.626 --> 00:16:59.285
And I pull lot of that from
the savory side, I think.

00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:02.570
CAROLYN JUNG: And when
you start experimenting,

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.790
how long does it take
to perfect something?

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.950
Is it many, many, many
tries, or sometimes

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.224
is it just bang on
right from the start?

00:17:11.224 --> 00:17:12.890
BILL CORBETT: It's
pretty rare that it's

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.099
bang on right from the start.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:18.069
When that happens, it's
amazing, but it's pretty rare.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:21.280
I would say it's
usually-- at this point,

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.252
I feel like I have a better
understanding than I've ever

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:26.252
had in the past, where I
can put together a dish

00:17:26.252 --> 00:17:28.550
and be close on the first try.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.770
But then it usually
takes two to three

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.120
tries before I tweak
out what I need

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.210
or what I think the dish needs.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.620
So yeah, it's never
usually the first try.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.090
It usually takes a little while.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.310
CAROLYN JUNG: And is there any
ingredient that you could never

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.760
envision in a dessert,
or is everything

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.330
pretty much up for
grabs in your mind?

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.430
BILL CORBETT: I think
just, like, onions.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:53.305
CAROLYN JUNG: Onions?

00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:53.805
OK.

00:17:53.805 --> 00:17:56.959
BILL CORBETT: Onions and
garlic for the life for me.

00:17:56.959 --> 00:17:58.250
CAROLYN JUNG: Garlic ice cream?

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.860
No?

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.000
BILL CORBETT: I know some
people have done things

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.440
with black garlic, and maybe.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.440
But I don't know.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.319
I just can't see it.

00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:11.860
But there are other
ingredients maybe

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.470
I would have thought
the same thing.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.890
I had a dish from Brooks
Headley, speaking of him.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.450
Probably about
two years ago now,

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.295
for a year and a half ago, where
it was [? acento ?] carpaccio

00:18:22.295 --> 00:18:26.120
and yeast ice cream and
just really nice olive oil.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.370
So it was raw sunchokes
and yeast ice cream.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.380
And I thought, OK,
this is out there.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.650
This is not going to work.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:34.940
And then I ate it,
and it was amazing.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.660
And he said it was
his version of dipping

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.500
your fries in your milkshake.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:43.120
And so but it was one of
the biggest surprises.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.720
And when I get those
surprises, those

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.950
are what really
excite me and make

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.960
me want to explore further
and maybe past what I'm

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.546
comfortable with or
what I think is--

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:53.650
it makes you think maybe
this, maybe I'm totally wrong.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.884
Maybe the ideas
that I have formed,

00:18:56.884 --> 00:18:59.050
I need to throw them out
the window and start again.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.690
CAROLYN JUNG: So I know we've
talked about this because I've

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:04.390
written about this for
Food Arts magazine,

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:07.710
but I know there are times
where you come up with a dessert

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.130
and you think,
oh, this is a hit.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:14.960
And you wait and you wait, and
nobody, or very few people,

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.020
order it in the dining room.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.000
Has that happened
rarely, often, sometimes?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.600
BILL CORBETT: It
happens once in a while.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.240
I always think I
can predict a hit,

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.650
and I feel like
I'm always wrong.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.700
Every time I think I've
got a hit on my hands,

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.130
I'm almost always--
I might enjoy

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.907
the dessert, the staff
might enjoy the dessert,

00:19:37.907 --> 00:19:40.240
and the guest who orders it
probably enjoys the dessert.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.070
But it's getting
the guests to order

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.840
the dessert is the
trick sometimes.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.670
But there's been
really obvious ones,

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.790
like I think the one
Food Art's referring

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.070
to was a peanut [INAUDIBLE]
with Concord grape jelly.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.070
And I was like oh, it's
peanut butter and jelly.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.820
What can go wrong?

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.890
And no one ordered it.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.520
And then I don't know if
maybe peanut butter is maybe

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.729
too low brow for people
to pay $10 for a dessert

00:20:01.729 --> 00:20:02.520
with peanut butter.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.090
I don't know.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:07.630
But like I think that
might be just it.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.825
Sometimes you think you've got
it, and you totally do not.

00:20:10.825 --> 00:20:12.950
You think oh, I'm just
going to slam-dunk this one,

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.187
knock it out, and
no one orders it.

00:20:15.187 --> 00:20:16.770
But then you do
another dish sometimes

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.300
that people really surprise you.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.910
I did a parsnip dish.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.670
It was actually the parsnip
cake that Sam Mason taught me.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.160
I served it with it was
just a buttermilk ice cream.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.939
It was really simple, and
it was a parsnip milk jam.

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:32.480
And I thought no
one's going to order

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.700
this parsnips for dessert.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.655
I'll put it on the
menu because it'll

00:20:34.655 --> 00:20:36.446
be fun for a little
while, but I'm probably

00:20:36.446 --> 00:20:38.500
going to take it off
in a week or two.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.530
And it ended up being a big
hit, and people loved it.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.000
Or the beet cake, for instance.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.262
I thought the beet
cake, I'll put it on.

00:20:45.262 --> 00:20:45.970
We'll sell a few.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.720
It's not going to be crazy,
but it was a big hit,

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.550
and we actually ended
up making, I think,

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:50.800
almost a wedding cake a month.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.860
CAROLYN JUNG: Oh,
really, wedding cake?

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.360
Wow.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.070
BILL CORBETT: Beet
cake for wedding cakes.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.650
It kind of--

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.290
CAROLYN JUNG: Kind of a new
thing instead of red velvet?

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.580
BILL CORBETT: Kind of, yeah.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.830
I think, sometimes I think
just go with your gut

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.080
and what you're excited about.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.871
Then you're kind of
cooking from this place

00:21:05.871 --> 00:21:07.330
that you're actually excited.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:12.042
And it's almost like it
always comes out better.

00:21:12.042 --> 00:21:14.500
CAROLYN JUNG: Now, you would
think a pastry chef is someone

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.460
who goes out, orders
dessert all the time,

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.670
but that's not you, right?

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.430
BILL CORBETT: No.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.050
The only time I
think I order dessert

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:27.000
is when I either know
who be pastry chef is

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.820
and I know they have an
actual pastry chef in house.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.692
Then I'll probably
order dessert.

00:21:31.692 --> 00:21:34.150
But if I'm going to most, your
neighborhood restaurant that

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.858
doesn't necessarily
pay for a pastry chef

00:21:35.858 --> 00:21:38.432
and doesn't have a
pastry chef, I'll

00:21:38.432 --> 00:21:40.140
take an extra potato
course or something.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.850
I'm like I'd rather
have-- I crave salt.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.210
I eat sweet all day long,
I'm tasting it all day long,

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.980
and I crave salt at
the end of the day.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:53.354
And I'd rather-- I find,
like, cheese and potatoes

00:21:53.354 --> 00:21:55.270
and all these horrible
things that I shouldn't

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.220
be eating way more satisfying
at the end of the day, probably.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:02.106
CAROLYN JUNG: And you did not
grow up in a foodie family.

00:22:02.106 --> 00:22:03.314
BILL CORBETT: No, not at all.

00:22:03.314 --> 00:22:03.814
No.

00:22:03.814 --> 00:22:05.770
CAROLYN JUNG: What did
you eat as a child?

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.103
BILL CORBETT: You don't want to.

00:22:07.103 --> 00:22:08.930
It's like my parents
are going to call me

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.010
up and yell at me, but--

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:12.195
CAROLYN JUNG: They don't
watch YouTube, right?

00:22:12.195 --> 00:22:14.070
BILL CORBETT: No, my
dad, I had to set him up

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.617
with a Gmail account, and it
didn't really work so well.

00:22:16.617 --> 00:22:17.950
I don't think he's ever used it.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.265
I had to literally
set it up for him

00:22:20.265 --> 00:22:22.140
and then call him on
the phone and guide them

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.520
through the logging
in so I could send him

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.320
a video to watch.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.610
And then so yeah, I don't--
and then he was like

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:28.640
where's the volume?

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.070
Where's the volume?

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.986
I can't hear anything.

00:22:29.986 --> 00:22:32.620
So he's not going to see it.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.020
My mom might see it.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:43.341
But yeah, it was-- my
parents weren't, and I'm not

00:22:43.341 --> 00:22:45.340
talking trash, but they
just weren't good cooks.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.150
And they never-- there
were a few things

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:50.440
here and there that
they surprise you.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.720
You pull out the recipe cards
from the old Betty Crocker

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.124
recipe card box,
and you get excited.

00:22:56.124 --> 00:22:57.290
But there's a lot of things.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:00.200
I can remember my grandfather
babysitting us once,

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.830
and my grandfather was
even way further removed

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.660
from cooking
process of any kind.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.521
He tried to serve me a
bouillon cube in hot water

00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:09.770
and call it soup or something.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:12.210
I was like, this isn't soup.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.320
Just open a can.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.870
But yeah, so yeah, I
definitely didn't grow up

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.460
in a foodie family.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.150
My dad still jokes
about it a lot.

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.200
He's always asking
me why I've got

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.330
to buy these fancy ingredients
and things like that.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.288
CAROLYN JUNG: I remember
when I interviewed you

00:23:27.288 --> 00:23:29.149
for my own blog years ago.

00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:30.690
You said your parents
had never eaten

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.250
in a restaurant
you'd worked act.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.290
Is that still true?

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:34.790
BILL CORBETT: It's
still true, yeah,

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.660
because they live in Canada,
and when they come to visit,

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:38.900
I usually take time off.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.040
And they actually--
so it's usually

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.117
a thing where we
don't get the chance

00:23:43.117 --> 00:23:44.200
to actually come sit down.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.825
And they haven't
actually been out here

00:23:45.825 --> 00:23:47.650
since I've lived out here.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.400
I've been home a couple times,
but they haven't been out here.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.920
So they haven't
had the chance, no.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.961
They came to New York once,
and we went to the restaurants

00:23:54.961 --> 00:23:56.460
so I could show
them where I worked.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.470
It was a day we were closed.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.980
And so yeah, so they actually
haven't been able to-- they

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:01.720
haven't been to eat at
one of the restaurants

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.600
that I cook in yet.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.630
CAROLYN JUNG: I think
you need to remedy that.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:08.170
BILL CORBETT: Yeah,
we'll work on that.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:11.090
CAROLYN JUNG: So given
your love for music,

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.410
if you wrote a heavy metal song
about your life and career,

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.020
what title would you give it.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.540
BILL CORBETT: I don't know.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:19.870
I don't know.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.915
Probably have something to do
with getting my act together.

00:24:23.915 --> 00:24:26.169
CAROLYN JUNG: I think
you've done pretty well.

00:24:26.169 --> 00:24:27.710
I think you need
another title there.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:34.010
So you're now also one of the
founding members of Killed

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.600
by Dessert, an annual
event to benefit Share

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.330
our Strength, which it
started in New York,

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:42.250
but now it's in San Francisco.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.920
Why did you want to
become involved with that?

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.534
And tell people a little
bit about that event.

00:24:47.534 --> 00:24:48.950
BILL CORBETT: So
Killed by Dessert

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:52.010
is an event where me and
five other pastry chefs,

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:54.970
we basically created
this event where you come

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.200
and you pretty much eat dessert.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:57.960
We do each--

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.085
CAROLYN JUNG: Not bad, huh?

00:24:59.085 --> 00:25:01.390
BILL CORBETT: We each
do a savory course.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.050
So you come in, you get
a savory hors d'oeuvre,

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.930
and then you sit down, and
you get 12 courses of dessert.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.280
You get two courses
from each pastry chef.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.622
So it's kind of like a fine
dining menu in reverse, almost.

00:25:13.622 --> 00:25:15.830
But the pastry chefs we have
involved are incredible.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.980
There's Lincoln Carson,
who I used to work for,

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.690
and then Christina
Tosi from Momofuku,

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.145
Brooks Headley from Del
Posto, Michael Laiskonis., who

00:25:22.145 --> 00:25:24.975
used to be the former
pastry chef at La Bernadin,

00:25:24.975 --> 00:25:30.990
Francisco Migoya, who
works for the CIA.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:32.595
So yeah, we have--
there's six of us,

00:25:32.595 --> 00:25:34.470
and it's this incredible
thing, and basically

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:38.460
what happens-- The reason
it all came about was just

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.070
we wanted to do a
pastry event together.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.317
And then we picked a charity
because we didn't really

00:25:44.317 --> 00:25:46.900
care about-- we weren't doing
it to raise money for ourselves,

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.850
so we thought let's give the
money to Share our Strength.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:52.690
And then it worked
out because then they

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.148
could use the-- we could use
their ticketing infrastructure

00:25:55.148 --> 00:25:56.610
and things like that.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.330
So they supported us
that way, and then

00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.612
they get to keep all
the money, and it

00:25:59.612 --> 00:26:01.100
makes our lives much
easier because we

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.820
don't have to worry about
selling tickets and all

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.460
that kind of thing.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:04.970
CAROLYN JUNG: And is it
happening again this year?

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.070
BILL CORBETT: It'll happen.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.310
It's probably going
to happen in LA.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.670
It hasn't been announced yet.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.740
We're trying to
figure it out still,

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.137
but it happens in a
different city every time.

00:26:13.137 --> 00:26:14.220
So we did one in Brooklyn.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.530
We did one in Austin.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.120
We sort of did a half
one in Washington, DC,

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.346
and we did San
Francisco last year.

00:26:20.346 --> 00:26:22.684
This year it'll probably be LA.

00:26:22.684 --> 00:26:24.350
There's a couple other
cities on the map

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.790
that we keep making promises
to, but it's an amazing event.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.770
You know, we raised, last
year in San Francisco

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:34.326
we raised $20,000 for
Share our Strength.

00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:37.780
CAROLYN JUNG: So I know
you don't like the word

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.560
self-taught, but you did
not go to cooking school,

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.230
and you learned by
doing through working

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.230
with really incredible people.

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:50.410
So for anyone out there
who is considering

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.930
being a pastry chef,
what is the best

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.219
advice you could give them?

00:26:54.219 --> 00:26:56.510
BILL CORBETT: I think you've
got to find your own path.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.509
I don't think school is
necessarily a bad thing,

00:26:58.509 --> 00:27:01.070
and I don't think working
your way up is a bad thing.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:02.884
Sometimes it can be
really difficult also,

00:27:02.884 --> 00:27:04.800
if you haven't gone to
school, to get somebody

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.160
to give you a chance.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.699
So school is also
a way, I think,

00:27:07.699 --> 00:27:09.740
for a lot of cooks to get
their foot in the door.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.490
And I think it's important
for a lot of cooks.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.540
I think it's really
difficult to not go to school

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.335
and take the path I took,
because no one wants

00:27:19.335 --> 00:27:21.980
to give you the time of day.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:26.140
So advice-wise, I would
just say keep trying.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.100
Get involved with a chef
you're interested in,

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.260
but if you don't have any
of those basic skills,

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.120
like I worked in those
crappy restaurants coming up,

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.619
so I had this, I at
least had the language.

00:27:37.619 --> 00:27:39.160
And I knew how to
hold a knife, and I

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.770
knew these very simple,
very basic skills.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:48.470
But if you don't
have any of that,

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.440
if you're just like you're a
high school kid finishing up

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.039
school and you're
like I don't know

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:54.330
what I want to do with my life.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.080
I like to cook, but
I've never really seen

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.710
what it's like inside a kitchen,
in a real professional kitchen.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.320
I would advise either going
and learning what it's like

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.507
or going to school to get
the language so you can then

00:28:05.507 --> 00:28:06.590
get your foot in the door.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.480
CAROLYN JUNG: So
before I open it up

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.370
to questions from
all you guys, I

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:13.720
wanted to play a fun
little game with you

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.695
that I actually did
with Anthony Bourdain

00:28:15.695 --> 00:28:17.320
a few years ago when
I interviewed him.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.700
He loved it, by the way,
so I hope you will, too.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.990
So I'm going to
say a topic, and I

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:26.220
want you to say the
first one or two

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.460
words that come into your
mind when you hear it.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.525
So cake pops.

00:28:30.525 --> 00:28:31.525
BILL CORBETT: Starbucks.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:35.125
CAROLYN JUNG: Corona.

00:28:35.125 --> 00:28:37.090
BILL CORBETT: Domenic Ansel.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:40.070
CAROLYN JUNG: Pop
rocks in desserts.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:42.110
BILL CORBETT: Lars
Ulrich from Metallica,

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.110
only because I made his
dad a birthday cake once

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.110
and put pop rocks in it.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.730
CAROLYN JUNG: And
put pop rocks in it?

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:51.708
The Food Network's
Cupcake Wars show.

00:28:51.708 --> 00:28:55.964
BILL CORBETT: A travesty,
I guess the first, yeah.

00:28:55.964 --> 00:28:58.335
CAROLYN JUNG: Double
stuffed Oreos.

00:28:58.335 --> 00:28:59.710
BILL CORBETT: Delicious.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:01.430
CAROLYN JUNG: Butter.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.855
BILL CORBETT:
Necessary, I guess.

00:29:03.855 --> 00:29:06.556
CAROLYN JUNG: Ripe papaya.

00:29:06.556 --> 00:29:08.419
BILL CORBETT: Vomit.

00:29:08.419 --> 00:29:10.210
CAROLYN JUNG: That was
actually [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:12.810
because I know that's his
least favorite thing because

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:15.990
of the aroma of a ripe papaya.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.975
Low-fat desserts.

00:29:20.529 --> 00:29:24.170
BILL CORBETT: Eh, I guess.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:28.560
CAROLYN JUNG: And last but
not least, Marissa Mayer's

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.752
fabled cupcake spreadsheet.

00:29:31.752 --> 00:29:33.910
BILL CORBETT: I don't
know anything about that.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.159
CAROLYN JUNG: Oh, well, we
should connect them, right?

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.910
Well, thank you all, and
if you have any questions

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:42.540
we'd love to answer them.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.040
You have any for Bill?

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.680
AUDIENCE: So my question is
you alluded to it a little bit.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.760
You didn't grow up in a
foodie household or anything.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.727
So I'm kind of curious.

00:29:50.727 --> 00:29:52.560
What was your first
introduction to cooking?

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.840
Not like cooking in a
professional kitchen,

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.930
but just as a kid or
something, were you

00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:59.454
flipping pancakes or something?

00:29:59.454 --> 00:30:00.120
What did you do?

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:04.750
BILL CORBETT: I think for
me it was-- growing up,

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.720
food and cooking was
this total mystery to me,

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.247
and I was just like you
either knew how to do it,

00:30:10.247 --> 00:30:11.580
or you didn't know how to do it.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.492
And I didn't know how
to do it, so I was like,

00:30:14.492 --> 00:30:16.200
I just never thought
I was going to cook.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.650
I never would've expected to
end up cooking for a living,

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.460
but I think probably
the first time

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.370
I realized that you can actually
make something was probably

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:27.040
home EC class in seventh
grade or something like that.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:33.300
And we made crepes, and
I didn't get an A, no.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.210
I couldn't cook at that point.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:38.022
I still was-- so I went home
and tried it again, though.

00:30:38.022 --> 00:30:40.480
But it was this thing where I
was like oh, you can actually

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.200
make this.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.350
This isn't something
you just buy,

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:47.970
or someone who knows
how to cook can make it.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.280
You can actually make
something with the tools.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:54.250
So that was my first
eye-opening experience.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:56.580
It didn't really-- it
wasn't like oh, I'm

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.970
going to be a chef now.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.510
Nothing like that, but it
was definitely my first.

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:03.060
That's the first time I remember
thinking oh, I can actually

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.040
cook something and apply heat to
something and change something

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.870
and make it actually
into something better

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:10.110
than the sum of its parts.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.860
AUDIENCE: So
there's this delight

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:17.405
with pairing salty and sweet,
the caramel and sea salt thing.

00:31:17.405 --> 00:31:20.200
Do you see that
continuing, or is

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.045
that where we're going, the
savory sweet intersection?

00:31:24.045 --> 00:31:26.670
BILL CORBETT: I don't think it's
necessarily where we're going.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.880
I think people are always
going to want dessert.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.800
And I think it's
really important, also,

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.820
that when you're applying the
savory sweet set of things,

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.050
that you do it in a smart way
that suddenly isn't making

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:41.320
the product into an appetizer.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.170
It's still going to be sweet.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.628
It still has to
taste like dessert.

00:31:44.628 --> 00:31:47.750
Most people want something
creamy and some maybe

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.740
crunchy texture involved,
maybe some cake.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.850
So people are going to want
those textures, I think,

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:58.182
and people may go towards-- I
think the salty sweet thing has

00:31:58.182 --> 00:31:59.640
its applications,
but I don't think

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.880
across the board
we're suddenly going

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.440
to be eating
everything salty sweet.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.260
But I think it depends.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.440
Caramel is better
with a little salt.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.080
AUDIENCE: Does chocolate sell?

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.920
If you put a chocolate
dessert on your menu,

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.795
is it usually a top seller?

00:32:11.795 --> 00:32:14.030
BILL CORBETT: Yeah, chocolate
is always a top seller.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.767
I think people just
automatically go

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:16.850
for the chocolate dessert.

00:32:19.446 --> 00:32:22.070
When people don't know what they
want, they just get chocolate,

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.340
I think.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.300
Because chocolate does
things in your brain,

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:29.100
and that's why they gave it to
soldiers in the war and things

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:29.600
like that.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.510
So yeah, I think chocolate
is always the big seller.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:37.210
And honestly, it's the
hardest dish to make.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:42.071
I think for me, the hardest
dishes are chocolate dishes.

00:32:42.071 --> 00:32:43.570
Because I don't
think chocolate goes

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.094
with everything like
everybody pairs.

00:32:46.094 --> 00:32:48.260
Chocolate has a way of being
paired with everything,

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.840
and I don't think it goes
with all these things

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.881
that people pair it with.

00:32:50.881 --> 00:32:53.847
I don't think chocolate and
fruits are always the best.

00:32:53.847 --> 00:32:55.430
Certain chocolates
and certain fruits.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.560
It's treated like
a wine, almost,

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.505
where you're pairing terroir
and wherever the beans are grown

00:33:01.505 --> 00:33:03.630
and how they're roasted,
and it changes everything.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:07.470
It's like-- so
it's yeah, I think.

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:09.702
But definitely our number
one and two sellers

00:33:09.702 --> 00:33:10.660
are chocolate desserts.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.285
AUDIENCE: Have you
tried to incorporate

00:33:12.285 --> 00:33:14.620
any international
cuisines into your style?

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.120
Because I know most
of the pastries,

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.180
like American, French, Italian
just within a few countries.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.255
But have you tried anything
outside of the norm?

00:33:21.255 --> 00:33:23.380
BILL CORBETT: I definitely
try to take inspiration,

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:28.140
I think, from new ingredients
that I might discover.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:32.340
But I don't necessarily
try to copy a cuisine,

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.031
especially because I'm not fully
familiar with those cuisines

00:33:35.031 --> 00:33:35.530
usually.

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:37.790
And if I try to copy,
it's going to come off

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:43.430
like this fake, non-authentic
version of what it should be.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:45.920
So I'll take inspiration
maybe from a cuisine,

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.950
or I might use something
like a red curry paste

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:51.390
in a coconut ice cream.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:54.720
But it's things like that, then
you get this coconut-curry ice

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.760
cream thing.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.170
But I'm not going to try
to recreate, necessarily,

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:02.080
a Thai dish because I don't
understand the cuisine.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.995
And I think it's going
to come off as phony.

00:34:03.995 --> 00:34:05.620
AUDIENCE: Do you make
pastries at home,

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:10.260
or do you get friends and family
asking you to make things?

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:15.310
BILL CORBETT: I make stuff at
home sometimes, not very often.

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:18.500
And it's usually only for if I'm
going to a party or something,

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.460
then I'll make something.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.462
But generally I don't
make pastry at all.

00:34:22.462 --> 00:34:23.920
I usually just cook
savory at home.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.520
But yeah, I don't
cook a lot of pastry.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.590
I think it drives me crazy
because I have this-- at work,

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.960
I have this amazing
kitchen with all the tools,

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.679
and there's this is
non-exhaustible supply of pots

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:39.179
because the dishwasher
will wash them.

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:42.310
And when I'm at home,
it's this tiny space,

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:45.080
I have some of the equipment,
but not all the equipment.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.989
And I don't have
the convection oven.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.790
And it's kind of an
excuse, to be honest.

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:54.010
But it's like, but it's
like, it's just not as fun.

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:57.220
And so I'm kind of stuck working
with tools that I necessarily

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.440
like working with,
and it's not--

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.180
it just doesn't come as
easily, so I'd rather just

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.900
do it at work and
then bring it home.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.060
AUDIENCE: Did you make
your own wedding cake?

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:06.980
BILL CORBETT: No,
my mother-in-law

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.855
made my wedding cake.

00:35:07.855 --> 00:35:11.250
Actually, it was before I worked
in pastry that I got married.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:15.730
So I hadn't-- I was not good
at making pastry at that point.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:19.112
But my mother-in-law for
years, not when we got

00:35:19.112 --> 00:35:21.070
married, but years before,
had a cake business.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:22.636
CAROLYN JUNG: Oh, interesting.

00:35:22.636 --> 00:35:24.010
BILL CORBETT: So
she would always

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.950
make all these crazy
cakes, like all the ones

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.800
in different shapes,
really amazing.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.300
She's an amazing
cake decorators.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.180
She does stuff that's
not in my wheelhouse.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.763
CAROLYN JUNG: Wow,
that's high praise.

00:35:33.763 --> 00:35:37.184
BILL CORBETT: So she did,
yeah, she did our wedding cake,

00:35:37.184 --> 00:35:39.100
and we actually got
married in their backyard,

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.710
in my in-laws' back yard.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.970
They live on a lake in Tampa.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:44.350
It poured rain in the morning.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:45.400
It was a great time.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.970
It actually all turned out
OK, but it was stressful.

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:51.540
OLIVIA: Chef, will you
talk about the dessert

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.170
and all the components of it?

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:54.440
Let me get it for you.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.870
BILL CORBETT: So we have
two desserts for you to try,

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:58.560
and one is the one
we did in the class

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.595
we did a little earlier, which
was we did a milk chocolate

00:36:02.595 --> 00:36:04.470
cream of basil meringue
and a hazelnut crumb.

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:05.320
OLIVIA: It was good.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:09.000
BILL CORBETT: And
then this one here

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.870
is actually the beet
cake that's in the book.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:14.540
So it's beet cake with fromage
blanc frosting and candied

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.270
walnuts And we garnished
it with a little bit

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:20.455
of beet paper and
beet caramel sauce.

00:36:20.455 --> 00:36:22.030
OLIVIA: How do you
make beet paper?

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:23.920
BILL CORBETT: So it's
actually really simple.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:24.890
It looks like--
people probably think

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.800
it's some scientific thing, and
we use some crazy weird gums

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.490
to make it happen, but all
we do is we take beet puree.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:33.470
We roast the beets, puree them.

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.180
We add a little bit
of sugar, and then we

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.264
spread it really thin
and dehydrate it.

00:36:38.264 --> 00:36:41.599
OLIVIA: It's just so
stunning to look at.

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.640
CAROLYN JUNG: I just want
to add one thing, which

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.480
is for some people,
this cake might

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:51.930
be a little of a
stretch to make.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.190
It's a little-- it's
not hard or complicated,

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:58.650
but it does take a little bit
of time, and it's incredible.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:01.680
But I would like to put a
plug in for the garnish that

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.990
is actually not on there today.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:06.670
The walnut ice cream,
which you've heard me

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:07.390
rave about this.

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:10.030
So I actually made
the ice cream when

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:11.780
I was testing recipes
for this book,

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.900
and if you have an ice
cream maker, it's so simple.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.400
And I tell you, it is
the best walnut ice

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.650
cream I have ever had.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.460
I was spinning it in the
machine and keeping--

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:26.810
I couldn't stop putting my spoon
into the hole to grab tastes.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.950
I mean, I'm shocked
there was any left

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:30.900
to actually freeze
in the freezer.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:31.860
That's how good it is.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:36.240
So if you want to make
something of Bill's in the book,

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.770
that is a little bit simpler.

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.260
I recommend, though,
walnut ice cream for sure.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:44.440
Well, thank you all
so much, and we're

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:47.060
going to be here signing copies
of the book, San Francisco

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.160
Chefs Table, also
hope you'll come by,

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.140
and we'll be happy to
personalize them to you.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.940
Thank you.
