00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
[Music and laughter]

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.380
This is amazing, you get this pulsating of
the reaction.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.940
My name is Steve Mould,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.000
I've got my own YouTube channel where I make
science videos.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.200
Some of them are dangerous and if they are
then I assess the risks.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.140
It's an important part of my job.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.550
But sometimes you find out the hard way that
there are risks you didn't know about.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.190
For example I was burning some aluminium powder
for a project

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.120
and I wanted the fire to go out.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.540
So I poured water onto it which you should
never do.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.000
So I made it my mission to figure out why
that's problem,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.690
why you can't put out a metal fire with a
water fire extinguisher.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.930
You can't put out a metal fire with a carbon
dioxide fire extinguisher either

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.860
which is really counter intuitive.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.850
So that's what this video is about.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.130
We're going to use magnesium instead of aluminium.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.920
It's a little easier to set light to.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.240
This is magnesium turnings.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.900
I'm going to spread it out a little bit.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.680
[Wooshing sound]

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.800
Alright.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.880
And let's see if we can put it out.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.080
It will not go out with a carbon dioxide fire
extinguisher.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.740
If anything, it makes it worse.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.480
The next thing is to try a water fire extinguisher.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.020
This is really dangerous so we're going to
go up onto the roof of the Ri.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.479
We're going to use a squeezy bottle instead
of an actual water fire extinguisher

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.680
just because I've got a bit more control over
this.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.240
Just going to let it get going.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.040
That's crazy bright, isn't it? Alright.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.560
[Laughter]

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.440
So with a water fire extinguisher it's even
worse. It's explosive.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.680
It's a bit like fireworks.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.879
So why can't you put out a metal fire

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.810
with standard fire extinguishers like water
and carbon dioxide?

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.019
To figure it out, let's do it again in a more
controlled environment.

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.959
So I'm going to fill this beaker with gas
carbon dioxide.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.420
To do that I've got solid carbon dioxide in
the bottom, dry ice,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.560
if I add some water, it should start to fill
with carbon dioxide,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.439
and you can actually see that happening there.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.260
And let's try and put out a normal fire with
the carbon dioxide.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.209
So I've got a piece of wood here.

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.349
We're going to set fire to it.

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.069
The wood is reacting with oxygen in the air.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.010
That's the chemical reaction of burning.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.780
It's the carbon in the wood.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.900
And you also need heat as well. It's the fire
triangle, right?

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.180
Fuel, heat and oxygen.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.720
So what happens when I dip this into the carbon
dioxide?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.360
It goes out straight away.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.169
That's because we're removing one of those things
from the fire triangle.

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.040
We're removing oxygen. So the chemical reaction
has to stop.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.120
But let's try it again with magnesium.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.040
It doesn't go out until it's all burnt.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.349
So carbon dioxide can put out a wood fire
for the reasons you already know.

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.760
But it can't put out a metal fire.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.419
But actually when you think about it, it's
weird that carbon dioxide,

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.840
it's weird that this can put out a wood fire.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.310
Because if you think about it,

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.780
the explanation is that carbon dioxide starves
the fire of oxygen.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.510
Except that carbon dioxide has oxygen in it.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.200
It has two oxygens for every carbon.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.100
In that really hot environment of a fire,
this carbon dioxide molecule is unstable.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.870
The oxygen can be removed and the oxygen will
preferentially stick to

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.200
or react with the atom that pulls on it more
strongly.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.160
And in the case of a metal fire it's the metal
atoms that win

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.160
and you're left with carbon that is stripped
of its oxygen.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.070
Whereas with the wood fire you've got oxygen
that's either going to

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.310
bond with the carbon in the wood

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.640
or it's going to stick with the carbon in
the carbon dioxide.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.580
There's no difference between the two, it's
a tug of war between carbon and carbon.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.600
Nothing is going to happen.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.320
The case with water, it's the same thing happening.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:24.380
The reason using water is even worse is that
water can boil explosively,

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.970
taking bits of fuel with it and spreading
it around.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.640
And the other thing is, when you strip oxygen
away from H2O, from water,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.050
you're just left with hydrogen and hydrogen
gas is also explosive.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.390
So don't use carbon dioxide or water on a
metal fire.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.690
It's a class D fire so you have to use powder
which basically is -

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.280
you drop a solid mass over the fire and that
smothers the fire.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.560
One final cool thing is that you can burn
magnesium

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:03.430
inside a block of solid carbon dioxide, otherwise
known as dry ice.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.070
So we're going to give that a whirl.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.770
We've created a little dip inside the block
of carbon dioxide here.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.080
We're going to fill that with some some magnesium.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.240
So the heat from the fire is turning the solid
carbon dioxide

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.490
into gaseous carbon dioxide. It's sublimation.
It goes straight from a solid to a gas.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.960
And then it's getting so hot

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.710
that the magnesium can steal oxygen away from
the carbon dioxide

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.130
to form magnesium oxide. This is amazing.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:48.270
You get this pulsating of the reaction. It
glows and dies down and glows again.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.740
That's because the oxygen is being used up,
and then more of it is becoming available.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.450
And I think now we're reaching the end

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:02.420
as that white light turns into more of an
orange glow.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.440
Just black body radiation because it's still
hot in there.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.760
Wow.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.320
So there you go, more videos like that over
on my channel.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.139
I recommend you start with a video about chladni
figures.

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:16.240
Link in the description.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.930
And as always, don't forget to subscribe to
the Ri channel as well.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.320
Both channels are on Patreon so you can support
us that way too.
