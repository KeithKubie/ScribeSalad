This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Squarespace.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.010
We love the moon cause it’s close to us.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:13.289
we love the… quasi-orbital satellite?

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.160
Hey guys Julia here for DNews.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.980
Seriously the moon is awesome, it has phases
and makes the tides come and go, plus it’s

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.980
just so freaking pretty.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.419
I wouldn’t mind another one hanging out
in the sky.

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:24.539
The more the merrier right?

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.539
Wait, what that’s you say?

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.090
We have another moon?

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.920
Well not so fast, we actually have a quasi-orbital
satellite called 3753 Cruithne (croo-ee-nya).

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.740
Named for the early Celtic people in the British
Isles.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.480
It’s not technically a moon since it’s
not in orbit around Earth.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.050
Just like us, it orbits the Sun.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.150
It’s in orbital resonance with us, which
is when two or more bodies get stuck in a

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.160
gravitational dance with one another.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.940
The Earth and Cruithne are at about 1 to 1
ratio, so our orbits are really similar.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.790
At times it looks like we’re playing cat
and mouse with each other.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.160
Except Cruithne’s path follows what’s
called a “horseshoe orbit”.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.471
To the sun it looks like a typical elliptical
orbit, But to us on Earth, Cruithne orbit

00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:05.360
looks kind of bean shaped.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.930
Wondering why you haven’t seen it before?

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.930
Well… its small.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.660
it’s only 5 kilometers wide, while the moon
is 3,476 kilometres.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.160
plus its kind of far away, it gets closest
to earth at 30 times the distance to the moon,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.080
which is a pretty big distance.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.350
So Cruithne can’t be seen with the naked
eye, it takes at least a 12.5-inch telescope

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.350
to be seen.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.770
But Cruithne isn’t the only sort of moon
we have.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.520
A couple other planets, like Jupiter have
what are called Trojan objects, and in 2010

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.050
we found our very own.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.150
Trojan objects are natural satellites that
share an orbit with a larger body at what

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.120
are called Lagrangian points.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.240
These areas follow 60 degrees ahead of or
behind the bigger body, at a gravitationally

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.280
stable spot, like an island in space.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.070
Our Trojan is named 2010 TK7 and orbits the
Sun at Earth’s L4 Lagrange point.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.610
At 300 meters across it’s just a little
guy, although still not exactly a moon since

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.330
it doesn’t orbit around the Earth.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.170
And then there’s 2006 RH120 - a miniature
teeny tiny moon only a few metres wide.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.090
The Catalina Sky Survey of Arizona found it
in 2006.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.230
It seems Earth snagged it out of solar orbit
for about 11 months and by June 2007, it was

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.230
gone.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.280
We miss you 2006 RH120, it felt like we barely
knew you.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.280
*sniffle*

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.980
But don’t get too sad, we have another object,
well a bit of space debris really, orbiting

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.260
us right now!

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.340
B44E is also tiny, at just a few metres across.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.910
B44E orbits Earth about 2 to 3 times the distance
of the Moon.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.120
It’s pretty similar to J002E3, which researchers
think might be a piece of the Apollo 12 Saturn

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.169
V rocket.

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:42.790
So B44E it might also be something left over
from humans going into space.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.590
So for now second moons remain in the realm
of science fiction, but they’re still pretty

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.590
fun to think about.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.540
