LAURENCE MORONEY:
On this episode

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.626
of "Coffee with a
Googler," I'm chatting

00:00:02.626 --> 00:00:06.300
with Will French, who works on
Google Developer Docs for Maps.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.520
He'll tell us all
about it and stay tuned

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.147
for his superhero origin story.

00:00:10.147 --> 00:00:19.400
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.450
So Will, you're a tech
writer here at Google,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.990
and I understand writing
technical documentation

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.000
at Google, it's a pretty
complex process, right?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.916
WILLIAM FRENCH: It is.

00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:29.227
A lot goes into
documenting Google APIs.

00:00:29.227 --> 00:00:30.560
LAURENCE MORONEY: So it's like--

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.101
I mean, we have
thousands of products

00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:33.380
and many pages for them.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.820
How do you manage
the whole thing?

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.980
WILLIAM FRENCH: Well, we use
the same source control systems

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.190
as other Google products.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.460
So the same types of
tools that engineers use,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.920
technical writers use
to create and maintain

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.616
technical documentation.

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:46.490
LAURENCE MORONEY: So if
you're writing a doc,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.630
it's almost like
writing source code

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.920
that gets compiled in and--

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.960
WILLIAM FRENCH: Yeah,
it's very-- very much so.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.120
In fact, we actually
do even write some code

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.930
as tech writers.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.810
LAURENCE MORONEY:
You write code?

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.170
WILLIAM FRENCH: Yeah.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.370
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.880
What's the last piece of
code that you've worked on?

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.670
WILLIAM FRENCH: Let's
see, I did a sample

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.620
to demonstrate some
new API features.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.260
A lot of the time,
tech writing samples

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.580
won't actually be published.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.410
Sometimes they are,
but most of the time,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.972
we just use them to make
sure everything works.

00:01:08.972 --> 00:01:11.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: And really
makes the docs authentic

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.830
if there's good
samples in there.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.205
WILLIAM FRENCH:
Yeah, it gives us

00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:16.897
an in to even find problems
with code and things like that.

00:01:16.897 --> 00:01:18.980
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now, you
work on the Google Maps

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.820
platform, right?

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.945
WILLIAM FRENCH: That's
right, Maps and Places APIs.

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:24.676
LAURENCE MORONEY: So what kind
of stuff do you do with that?

00:01:24.676 --> 00:01:27.530
WILLIAM FRENCH: Well, I write
and maintain documentation

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.320
for the Maps iOS APIs, and
I'm responsible for all

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.050
of the Places APIs
documentation.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.150
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow,
iOS APIs, that's like--

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.750
how is-- how is that to work
with, like with Google Maps?

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.875
WILLIAM FRENCH: That was
a bit of a learning curve,

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:43.102
but it's actually a lot
of fun to work with.

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:44.810
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now,
even though like--

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.280
you and I have
worked on GEO stuff

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.840
and I do GEO outreach myself.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.042
And most of the team
is based overseas

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:51.000
and that kind of thing.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.580
But you're based
here in Kirkland.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.070
And what's it like being
a Googler in Kirkland?

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.144
WILLIAM FRENCH: Kirkland
is a wonderful facility.

00:01:57.144 --> 00:01:59.310
It's even got a bike trail
running right through it.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.061
So as a cyclist, I
really appreciate that.

00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:02.893
LAURENCE MORONEY: I
hear you've had some fun

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:04.190
adventures while you're biking.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.750
Could you tell us
about some of them?

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.800
WILLIAM FRENCH:
Well, you're probably

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.220
referring to the bat incident.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.886
LAURENCE MORONEY: The
bat incident, yes.

00:02:09.886 --> 00:02:11.219
So tell the viewers about that.

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:13.010
WILLIAM FRENCH: Oh,
well, a couple of years

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.190
ago, I was cycling on the
Burke-Gilman Trail in Seattle.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.530
And I had an encounter
with a flying bat.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.950
It was flying somewhere in
the middle of the afternoon,

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.375
so he probably
shouldn't have been out.

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:24.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: Maybe
it was a blind bat.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.190
No, wait, they're all blind.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.400
WILLIAM FRENCH: Well,
I collided with him.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.130
And in the process of moving him
out of the road, I was bitten.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.810
LAURENCE MORONEY: So you've
been bitten by a bat?

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.530
WILLIAM FRENCH: I have.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.050
LAURENCE MORONEY: So this sounds
like a comic book superhero

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.069
origin story.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.110
WILLIAM FRENCH: Sort of,
except I'm still waiting

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.491
for my superpowers to arrive.

00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:41.990
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Have any of them--

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.160
do you get sonar and that
kind of stuff working?

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.380
WILLIAM FRENCH: Well, I have
an aversion to emergency rooms.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.130
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Ladies and gentlemen, we

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.150
have Batman with us.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.990
So back to tech writing and back
to Maps and that kind of thing

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.779
then, I understand that you
work a lot with the Solutions.

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:58.820
So could you tell us a
little bit about Solutions

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.810
and what they do?

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.960
What good are they
for developers?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.460
WILLIAM FRENCH:
Well, GEO Solutions

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.190
are like standard tutorials
and documentation,

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.190
and it sort of takes
it a step above

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.830
and makes a more
comprehensive offering.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.360
So rather than
just demonstrating

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.120
how to put a marker on a
map, we'll show you that.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.670
We'll show you how to style
the markers on the map.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.480
We'll show you how to build
a back end to serve data to.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.530
LAURENCE MORONEY: So one of
them is a store locator, right?

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.540
So if I own a chain
of stores, you'll

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.700
basically give me
everything that I

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.940
need to be able to build a
mapping solution around that?

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.730
WILLIAM FRENCH: Yeah, the
store locator solution, it

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.370
has a few different
flavors, actually.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.010
And we've got a simple
store locator, which is all

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.740
based on JavaScript,
and it takes

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.180
a set, a hard coded set of
coordinates, and displays them

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.770
on a map and demonstrates
styling the markers

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.110
and how to add an info
window with custom data.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.566
We've got a slightly
more involved version

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:04.190
of that called the
New York City Subway

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.680
Locator, which also involves
marker clustering and view

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.370
bounding.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.540
So it's got some open
source libraries in there

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.572
that it uses for that.

00:04:12.572 --> 00:04:14.030
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Marker clustering

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.800
is a really cool
technology, right?

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.810
If you've ever had a map, and,
you look at it from the outside

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.950
and if you're trying to show
subway stations in New York

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.074
City, for example, there's
just too many pins,

00:04:24.074 --> 00:04:25.490
and you can't see
any of the city.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.990
But clustering solves that?

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.198
WILLIAM FRENCH: Clustering
solves that problem, yeah.

00:04:29.198 --> 00:04:32.750
And there's-- basically what
it does is it breaks down pins

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.210
so that if there's a
certain number of them,

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.010
they get condensed
into one large pin.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.750
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right, and
then it's like a number--

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.680
WILLIAM FRENCH: And then
expands into individual pins.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.200
LAURENCE MORONEY: So that's
perfect for something

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.520
like the New York subway.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.930
How many stations do you know?

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.980
WILLIAM FRENCH: I
don't know offhand.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: There's
hundreds, though, right?

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.280
WILLIAM FRENCH: Yeah, the
GEO JSON data is actually

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.860
pretty interesting to look at.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.960
LAURENCE MORONEY: So is
that how you drive it?

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.870
So GEO JSON data gives you
the locations of these pins,

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.980
and then you cluster that?

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.620
WILLIAM FRENCH: Yeah, for
the purposes of that demo,

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.910
the data was taken from the
actual New York City subway

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.230
organization.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.310
So that's available online,
and it's in GEO JSON format.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.940
So with that, there's
a lot of stuff

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.012
that developers can
do using GEO JSON.

00:05:16.012 --> 00:05:16.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.280
And then the code that's
part of the solution is also

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.690
showing you how to
parse GEO JSON, right?

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.410
WILLIAM FRENCH: That's right.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: Which is a
useful tool in and of itself.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.140
WILLIAM FRENCH: Yes.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: So if I'm
building something-- like,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.450
I don't own anything as
big as the New York subway.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.950
But if I'm building
something like--

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.180
I don't know, if I have
a chain of small bakeries

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.510
or something along those lines,
the solution will guide me

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.870
in how I can have
my bakeries plotted,

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.780
how those plots can be styled,
popups, that kind of thing?

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.460
WILLIAM FRENCH:
Yeah, the solution

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.910
shows a baseline implementation
that developers can then

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.050
expand and customize.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.540
So the code is all there for--

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.516
free for the taking

00:05:51.516 --> 00:05:52.640
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.600
And I believe there are
code labs as well that'll

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.640
teach me how to do this stuff?

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.990
WILLIAM FRENCH: Yes, a
number of the solutions

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.240
also include code labs,
which are a longer,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.240
more involved walk-through,
sort of a step-by-step tutorial.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.380
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.280
Now, if you were to build one
of these yourself, how would

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.000
you get started?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.260
WILLIAM FRENCH: If I
was going to create

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.550
a new solution from scratch?

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: No.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.321
I mean, like, if you had a
chain of bookstores or something

00:06:13.321 --> 00:06:15.320
like that that you wanted
to plot, how would you

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.989
get started with a solution?

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:18.530
WILLIAM FRENCH:
Well, for these ones,

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.420
I would simply go out
to the GitHub repo

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.500
and clone the repo for the
solution that I want to use.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.180
So all of the code is
available on GitHub for these.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.180
I can go out and get it.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.320
I can run it.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.619
I can get an API key
and deploy it myself.

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:34.910
LAURENCE MORONEY: So if I
want to build my own solution

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.327
to find all the bats in
Seattle that might bite me,

00:06:37.327 --> 00:06:38.660
where would I go to get started?

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.015
WILLIAM FRENCH: Well you
would go to developers.googl

00:06:41.015 --> 00:06:42.796
e.com/maps/solutions.

So thanks very much, Will.
