[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:06.070
STEVEN MULLER:
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.620
I'm Stephen.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.490
I'm business development
manager at Google Play.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.440
Along with my
colleague, Brian, we

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.100
hope to regale you
with some tools

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.840
and tips for growing and
engaging users on Google Play.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.710
Google Play gives you access
to a massive [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.500
of one billion potential users.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.450
Your challenge as a
developer is to [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.290
the right users, user
feedback to improve your app,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.041
and engage them in the long run.

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:34.790
We're going to walk
you through some tools

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.310
that Google Play offers
to make this easy.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.240
We've parted out some
of the topics here.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.620
I'm going to cover store
listings and experiments,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.510
Brian will then cover
interactions with users,

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.130
translation, alpha/beta testing,
as well as Developer Pages.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.390
We have some cool
giveaways for you as well.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.280
So, before I begin, I wanted to
share with you that, formerly,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.519
I was a Naval officer
on a nuclear submarine

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.290
and actually see some
parallels between life

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.980
on a submarine and
a store listing,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.313
that I'd like to share with you.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.840
So, icons.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.540
Icons.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.210
They're everywhere.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.315
My submarine, for example,
in itself, was an icon.

00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:23.576
It represented strength
and deterrence.

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:25.080
You should be asking
yourself, what

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.480
does your icon say
about your app or game?

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.250
It's the first thing
people see and it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.250
doesn't matter how great
your app or game is,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.490
if no one downloads it.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.410
An effective app icon,
app or game icon,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.296
serves as a quick
identifier for your app.

00:01:44.296 --> 00:01:46.330
And you should also think
about changing it up,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.280
seasonally or perhaps
around holiday specials.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.780
Next is your title.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.960
It's also one of the
first things people see.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.600
I can refer to my old submarine
as the USS West Virginia SSBN

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.250
736 Gold, Group
10, or I could just

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.310
refer to as the 736 Gold, which
is what most people called it.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.030
Similarly, with
your app, you want

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.810
to keep it short and sweet.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.250
Does anyone see the play on
words in this game's title?

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.690
You want to be thoughtful
about your brand

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.370
and anticipate the future.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.300
For example, how a
version two look?

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.356
Next are descriptions.

00:02:33.356 --> 00:02:36.970
You can imagine, on a submarine
descriptions are everywhere.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.179
But the last thing you want to
do is go into a radiation zone

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.220
without wearing your
thermoluminescent dosimeter.

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:49.000
In your app, you want your
description to be short

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.850
and you want to use bullets to
highlight your product offering

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.390
and tell the user what your
app or game actually does.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.475
This is also a great place
to talk about what's new.

00:03:00.475 --> 00:03:03.100
On a submarine, you can
imagine, day in and day out you

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.700
get bored with the same
food, eating the same thing

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.519
100 days in a row.

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.310
But on occasion, we
would hear that there's

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.810
some new food coming and
we'd all get excited.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.320
And I distinctly
remember one year,

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.846
sort of floating around at
400 feet below the surface,

00:03:16.846 --> 00:03:18.470
we actually had turkey
on Thanksgiving,

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.460
believe it or not.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.450
So that was cool.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.220
We were excited
about what was new.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.060
Similarly, with your
Play Store listing,

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.600
you could talk about a
potential UI redesign

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.200
or now that you may
be supporting where.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.660
So this brings us to
store listing experiments.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.970
This allows you to test
different parts of your store

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.750
listing page.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.950
There are several
things you can test--

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.610
your icon, your featured
graphic, screenshots,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.876
your promotional video,
and your description,

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:56.530
all to see how these assets may
improve your conversion rate.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.870
On a submarine, we tested
various approaches.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.180
Experiment A could have
been approaching a target

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.820
from beneath, whereas
experiment B could've

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.460
been approaching a
target from behind,

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.030
through the [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.720
We would then take
that data and decide,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.470
what's the best way
to approach or targets

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.130
going forward, based
on their attributes?

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.079
Similarly, with store
listing experiments,

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.390
you can use data
instead of intuition

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.250
to optimize a text and
graphics of your store listing.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.660
So you want to start
with testing icons.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.230
Icons can have the
greatest impact,

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.860
either positive or
negative, on your installs.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.700
Test early.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.497
Second, you want to
have a question in mind

00:04:41.497 --> 00:04:42.330
when you're testing.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.420
You want to have an objective.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.160
For example, does artwork
visualizing game play drive

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.270
more installs than
artwork that doesn't?

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.370
So, best practices.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.645
Developers have been asking
us for best practices.

00:04:58.645 --> 00:05:01.020
We would like to share with
you some things that we think

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.603
would help or that
you should consider

00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:05.260
when running your experiments.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.480
So first, as I mentioned
before, start with a hypothesis.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.070
Then you want to test it.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.380
You want to test one thing at
a time, you want to iterate,

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.580
and you want to do
the test long enough

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.640
to get statistical significance.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.035
You don't want to cut
the test off too short.

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:28.200
And then, of course, you
want to pay attention

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.824
to the banner in the
Dev console, which

00:05:29.824 --> 00:05:32.510
gives you your results.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.900
Probably most importantly,
you want to be bold.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.650
Minor little
adjustments probably

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.120
will be inconclusive, so
make big, broad changes

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.020
and test those.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.060
I'm going to walk you
through a few examples

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.290
here from successful
game developers who

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.980
used store listing experiments.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.830
For example, "Kongregate"
tested different icon art

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.150
and they saw a 91%
increase in installs

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.600
just by testing the icon.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.940
As you can see, "Rovio"
used three rounds

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.230
of testing until they
found the optimal winner.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.420
This may have taken
them a little bit longer

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.930
but it was completely worth
the investment as they're

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.210
able to iterate and
incorporate their learnings,

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.890
and they actually saw
a pretty good boost.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.450
Does anyone see which
icon, which variant,

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.740
of which experiment
is the winner?

00:06:31.235 --> 00:06:31.735
All right.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.990
In contrast, here's
an experiment

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.240
conducted on screen shots.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.460
"Dots," a game
developer-- they used

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.020
a very measured and
controlled approach when

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.920
testing their screen shots.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.960
So they held everything
constant except the illustration

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:59.060
of the game play mechanics and
they also had a great result.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.480
That's all for store
listings and experiments.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.080
I'd like to thank you
and turn things over

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.030
to Lieutenant Brian.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.730
Brian'll take the
helm and bubble you up

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.380
through the surface.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.950
BRIAN QUIMBY: Thanks, Steven.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.980
So now that you've
tested your store listing

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.880
page to see what resonates
best with your sailors,

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.320
your submarine is ship
shape and ready to launch.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.679
So the next step is to
interact with your crew

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:27.970
through the ratings and review
section of the developer

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:28.840
console.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.060
It's one of the most important
aspects of the Play Store

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.260
and it's incredibly easy for
you, the developer, to do.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.920
So ratings are one at the top
ways that users will market

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.210
your app to other people.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.310
They're are also going to help
you understand what users love

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.440
and hate about your app,
and how their sentiment

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.350
has changed over time.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.230
Replying to reviews is
one of the best ways

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.710
to create meaningful
connections with your users

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.230
and show them that you
listen to their feedback

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.900
to improve your product.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.820
Now, we listen to you
developers' feedback

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.080
and added some features
that you wanted most

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.230
within the developer console.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.760
So the ratings
chart that you see

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.210
is now available on
the reviews page,

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.260
making it easy to track trends
and individual star ratings,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.680
and you can also search
for specific reviews

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.150
and do a free text search
across all of your reviews.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.420
Recently launched,
too, one of the most

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.560
requested features--
being able to get

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.190
a notification
once a user updates

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.549
a review you've responded to.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.230
Now, ratings can materially
impact your installs.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.940
So you want to work towards
improving your scores so

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.650
that you could even be
promoted by Google Play.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.580
We have a minimum bar
of 4.0 for inclusion

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.660
in any of our merchandising
opportunities.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.450
We encourage everyone
to get into a dialogue

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:03.230
with your users, replying to
both good and bad reviews.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.880
It'll make sure there's not
a mutiny on your store page.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.930
So here's an example from one
of my developers, "ZomboDroid."

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.610
If you ever need an
awesome app to make memes,

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.210
I suggest you check them out.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.110
But you can see how
they're actively

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.530
responding to low reviews and
asking the user to email them

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.090
at their support address.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.840
This serves a few purposes.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.520
First, it's going to
help increase engagement.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.460
Second, it looks much better
to users who've not yet

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.270
downloaded the app, to
show that the developer is

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.110
willing and able to respond
to technical questions

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.190
and support them.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.280
And again, after you've worked
with the user on their issue,

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.130
going back and asking them
to update their review

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.085
can result in an increase in
your ratings and higher stars.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.330
So, as the song
goes, in the Navy,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.880
you can sail the seven seas.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.100
Well, if we're doing
all of that traveling,

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.830
we also need to
make sure that we're

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.850
going to be speaking the right
language for the country whose

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.950
port that we're in.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.560
Let's continue our
focus on the user

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.000
with a little different
twist, making sure

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.680
that they can effectively
interact with your Play Store

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.075
listing and app because
it's in their language.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.740
So within the developer
console, you already have access

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.540
to a number of optimization
tips and recommendations,

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.600
and these now
include localization

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.180
and internationalization
options to help

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.860
you take your app global.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.630
You can see these
recommendations bubbled up

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.870
within the to do section
under optimization tips.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.790
Here you can see
the recommendations

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:52.320
to translate our store listing,
make the screenshots and videos

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.850
reflect our target APK
language, and translate

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.980
the actual strings
within our app.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.580
So you can easily translate your
Play Store listing page either

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.590
by providing your
own translation text,

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.600
or purchasing professional
translations directly

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.850
from the Developer Console.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.940
If you don't provide translation
text for your store listing,

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.790
Google Play will either show
an automated translation

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.560
or the default language
setting for your application

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.520
but neither of these is
ideal if your users have

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.725
a local language preference.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.990
In addition to your
Play Store listing page,

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.970
you'll also want to
make sure that your

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.250
APK itself is translated
into other languages.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.130
Fortunately, Google makes
this extremely easy as well.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.560
Using the app
translation service,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.540
you can easily purchase
professional translations

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:56.800
for your APK strings and
in app items as well.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.030
To find this option in the
Google Play Developer Console,

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.310
you'll want to sign
in and select an app,

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.880
and then click on
APK on the left side.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.170
At the bottom, by this APK
Translation Service option,

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.510
you can click Start
or Check Progress

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.560
to launch the Google
Play Translation Manager.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.170
After you've
selected the language

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.900
that you want to translate
your app or the strings into,

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.570
you can browse a list
of third party vendors

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:28.770
who are pre-qualified by
Google to offer high quality

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.780
translations.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.940
You can upload the
strings that you want,

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.870
select the destination
or target language,

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:40.550
and then choose your translation
vendor based on time and price.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.160
You can see the estimates that
are given in the Google Play

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.130
Developer Console for each
of these third party options.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.150
Once you've purchased
translations,

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.550
you'll receive an
email from your vendor

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.040
and can then interact
directly with them

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.350
to work on your translations.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.840
Once you've added translations
to your apps text strings,

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.100
you can upload the translated
APK file to Google Play

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.180
and translated versions
will be available to users

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.970
whose language preference
matches the translation

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:15.510
languages that you've added.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:19.500
If you stop by later, I actually
have $100 translation service

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.450
coupons that you can pick
up at the tables over here

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.760
after filling out either
our developer profile

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.030
or a review of this session.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:32.790
So now you should have a pretty
solid Play Store listing.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.310
We've talked about
best practices

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.310
for your icon, title,
description, and then

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.010
using store listing
experiments to optimize

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:41.900
each of those for your users.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.160
And then we've even
localized our APK

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.530
to make sure that the
language being displayed

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.340
on the store listing,
and in the app itself,

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.140
is right for our users.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.620
I want to back up a
second, though, and talk

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.580
about strategies that you can
use when actually developing

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.020
your app in the first place.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.920
Google Play has a
great tool called Alpha

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.930
and Beta Testing that
can help you prototype,

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:09.790
iterate, test, and
launch your app.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.720
Alpha and Beta testing
is configured directly

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.940
in the Developer Console.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.850
You have the ability
to upload the APK

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.550
and distribute it before
releasing to the public.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.990
Users always have to opt
in to this functionality

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.780
and can never leave reviews.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.070
And of course,
Google loves data,

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:33.690
so you'll have access to
a wide range of statistics

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.500
and information about the
Alpha and Beta configurations

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.910
to help you troubleshoot
and fix issues.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.670
There are two ways to share
your Alpha and Beta builds,

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.300
open or closed.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.740
Closed Alpha or Beta testing
is invite only and managed

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.920
through Google Groups.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.260
This means you'll need to add
email addresses to a group

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.020
and then your users
will have access

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.240
to download the Alpha
and Beta builds.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.300
You can also have
an Open Beta which

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.970
includes a custom URL that
anyone can join and opt into.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.900
The developer can set a
maximum number of testers

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.560
and the overall progression
might be a Closed Beta

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.460
Test to an Open
Beta Test and then

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.600
actually distributing that
custom URL, via social media,

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.460
to your biggest fans to
get them early access

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.730
and get them testing
out your new app.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.120
A number of top developers
have seen great success

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.720
with Alpha and Beta Testing to
ensure that new releases are

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.210
bug free and successful.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.480
So now that you know how
to launch a great app,

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.740
the last topic I wanted
to touch on today

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.420
is a new, easy way to
promote your brand on Google

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.410
Play called Developer Pages.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.670
Think of this is the nose art
on the planes of our aircraft

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.124
carrier.

00:15:55.124 --> 00:15:57.040
It's going to get you
attention and your users

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.980
are going to love it.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.270
So right now, if you click on
the developer's name in Google

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.250
Play, you're taken to a
rather bland page that lists

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.510
all of the developers apps.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.560
Now, you actually
have the ability

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.410
to transform that space into
a unique page on Google Play

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.980
to promote your
entire app catalog.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.580
With these Developer
Pages, you're

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.820
able to upload graphics, explain
what your company is all about,

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.820
and pick a special app
to feature at the top.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.180
This gives you a
single destination

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.830
to promote all of your
apps on Google Play

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.180
and many of our top
partners have already

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.520
created their Developer Pages.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.200
Check out Any.do they
have a graphic banner

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.560
at the top, a description of
the company and the options

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.824
that they offer, and then
a featured app at the top

00:16:47.824 --> 00:16:48.740
of the screen as well.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.770
And we know that you guys are
building for mobile, tablet,

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.520
wear, and TV, but Developer
Pages look great on desktop,

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.050
too, so you can link to them
from your app's website.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.650
It's your own personal
branded page on Google.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.390
This is one of my
developers, "Zidio."

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.440
They have an awesome graphic
at the top, some eye catching

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.130
description, and again, that
featured app on their Developer

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.109
Page as well.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:19.760
Has anyone here created
a Developer Page yet?

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.260
Two?

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:20.760
Three?

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.630
Four?

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.270
You guys, right?

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.970
Not yet.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.599
Soon.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.570
So Steve and I have done
a lot of talking so far

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.980
and I was hoping to do
something interactive here

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.024
where we could actually build
a Developer Page together.

00:17:35.024 --> 00:17:37.190
I don't know if you guys
have your laptops with you,

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.106
is that something maybe
we'd be interested in?

00:17:39.106 --> 00:17:40.360
Maybe not?

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.570
Thinking about it?

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:42.070
All right.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.234
I'll run through the steps.

00:17:43.234 --> 00:17:45.400
If you guys want to follow
along with me real quick,

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.710
we can do that, too.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:47.312
It's so easy.

00:17:47.312 --> 00:17:49.520
It'll take a couple minutes
if you have some graphics

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.160
and tools ready for you.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.395
So at the top of
the screen, we're

00:17:54.395 --> 00:17:56.770
just going to sign into the
Google Play Developer Console

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.820
and click on Developer
Pages on the left.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.900
And then we want to enter
some the information

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.330
that we're going to have about
our Google Play Store listing.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.980
So promotional
text, 140 characters

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.340
to describe the brand, not
to be confused with a Tweet.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.060
You can even add
translations of that as well.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.620
Website, this should point
to your company website

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.840
or a website that's associated
with one at the top apps, maybe

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.790
the app that you're
going to feature.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:31.000
Throw in some graphic assets,
so a developer icon that's

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.540
going to be in the circle
at the top of the page,

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.727
and a header image.

00:18:34.727 --> 00:18:36.310
This header image
is going to be used,

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.210
not just on desktop, or that
big screen space at the top,

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.980
but also on mobile.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.960
The recommended
apps section, it's

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.150
going to have the
graphic taking up

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.930
the full space
across the screen.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.240
And then the featured app.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.130
So Play will auto populate
all the different apps

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.690
you have in that
developer account

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.540
and you can select
one to pin at the top.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.785
So if you're having a special,
if you have a seasonal item,

00:18:59.785 --> 00:19:02.160
or something that you just
want to promote a little more,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.582
you can click that
featured app right there

00:19:04.582 --> 00:19:05.790
to sort of pin it to the top.

00:19:09.365 --> 00:19:11.240
I'll give you guys a
couple minutes if you're

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.448
clicking through any of them.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.527
I was hoping to even show
off one or two awesome ones

00:19:22.527 --> 00:19:24.360
but I'm thinking you
guys are still working,

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.784
so maybe we can sort of
huddle over there later

00:19:27.784 --> 00:19:29.700
and we can look at some
guys' Developer Pages.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.010
I want to thank everyone
for coming to the session.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.060
A couple quick items
that we can wrap up

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.980
with because I know Stephen
and I have been talking a lot

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.974
but we do want to talk with
all you guys individually, too.

00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:45.390
And I think with
a group this size

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.900
we can probably head over
to the tables in the back

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.750
and maybe chat with
you guys one on one

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.150
if you have any specific
questions or issues with Google

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.890
Play.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.470
Couple things I'd love for
you to do to help me out.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.790
So at the top right
there is a quick survey

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.240
to tell me about this session.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.620
Did you like the topics we
covered-- store listing,

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.750
Beta testing, Developer Pages?

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.470
Did you find it helpful?

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:10.530
And then number two,
and I love this one

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.730
because I got a custom
URL that big Android

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.250
barbecue at the end, but
I want you to fill out

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.664
a developer profile.

00:20:16.664 --> 00:20:18.580
This is going to go
directly to Stephen and I,

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.900
and if you have any questions,
issues, need some help

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.845
with Google Play, strategies, or
tips, let me know in that form

00:20:24.845 --> 00:20:26.720
and we're going to be
able to respond to you.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.290
We also have a
great book, "Secrets

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:32.980
to App Success on Google Play."

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.850
This is written by
Google, contains

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.900
lots of juicy information
about your Play Store listing.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.550
And you fill out those
two forms for me,

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.290
I'd love to send you
off with one today.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.760
So with that, I'm going
to wrap up but again,

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.129
it'd be great to talk to
everyone later over here.

00:20:50.129 --> 00:20:50.670
Thanks a lot.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:53.070
[APPLAUSE]
