India and Pakistan are concerned I think

India and Pakistan are concerned I think
 

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.160
India and Pakistan are concerned I think
we're closer

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:54.170
we're closer
 

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.080
we're closer
I think we're getting somewhat closer

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:56.090
I think we're getting somewhat closer
 

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.390

there is a great amount of talk you've

00:31:58.390 --> 00:31:58.400
there is a great amount of talk you've
 

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.010
there is a great amount of talk you've
had more talk in the last six to eight

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:00.020
had more talk in the last six to eight
 

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.230
had more talk in the last six to eight
months than we've had in the last 50

months than we've had in the last 50
 

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.990
months than we've had in the last 50
years so there is a silver lining in the

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:05.000
