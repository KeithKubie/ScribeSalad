ALEX DANILO: Hello everyone.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.930
Welcome to our session entitled
"The Future of the Living

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.430
Room."

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.385
My name's Alex Danilo.

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:09.760
I'm going to be
moderating today.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.349
I have Majd Bakar
and John Affaki here.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:13.890
They're both Directors
of Engineering

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.540
for Chromecast and Google Cast.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.650
So feel free to interrupt
anytime with questions.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.900
There's a microphone over
here on the right hand side.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.705
So if you just want to get
up and ask us questions.

00:00:23.705 --> 00:00:26.080
So I just wanted to start with
just a little bit of scene

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.580
setting.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.970
So if you remember in
the keynote this morning,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.390
Timothy talked about the
living room of the future.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.790
And that things
will just kind of

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.040
disappear into the background.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.660
So one of the products these
guys have been responsible for

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.980
is, of course, Google
Cast and Chromecast,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.759
which disappears
behind the TV set.

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:42.300
So that's kind of
this seamless thing

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.500
that you don't
actually see but you

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.880
get to access from your phone.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.290
So maybe we could
start with where

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.940
did that actually come about?

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.130
What was the idea originally?

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.990
MAJD BAKAR: Well, so
our goal from Chromecast

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:00.840
was to bring as much content
into the new living room

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.920
with the phone being the
center of the digital life.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.900
The new remote control-- echo.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.010
The new remote control for
the living room, people

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.460
are-- especially
millennials-- they're

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.940
tied to their phones
and mobile devices.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.020
And so they have their
whole digital life there.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.090
So what's better than to take
that experience from the phone

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.890
and just amplify it, project
it to a larger screen

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.260
or to a larger speaker
or to other devices

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.290
and have that living room
experience be more emerging

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.500
and engaging with the user.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.220
And as part of the living
room, Google's vision

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.970
is there is this people that
are very mobile focused.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.550
And they are always on the go.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.740
They are tied to
that user experience.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.850
And this is where Google Cast
and Chromecast come about.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.610
But we are also
having Android TV.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.630
Where for a more traditional
experience was a first screen

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.960
UI and using a D-pad
remote control,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.320
you can navigate a very exciting
UI and compelling experiences.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.830
And Google is investing
heavily on both sides.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.040
We provide both
platforms for you

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.220
as developers to bring your
experiences to the living room.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.970
JOHN AFFAKI: Yeah.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.939
And Majd gave the really
compelling consumer story.

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.480
But one of things
that we also wanted

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.620
to do with both
Cast and Android TV

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.120
was really for
application developers

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.510
to make it a very seamless
development environment.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.440
Something that you're
used to developing

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.600
at this point for the
mobile users, people

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.330
who are either playing
games on the go

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.170
or watching media on the go,
using the same development

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.280
model to extend to
all of your device.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.000
Whether again, it's Cast, where
you're using your Android app,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.972
your iOS app to cast.

00:02:46.972 --> 00:02:48.430
And really it's an
extension of it.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.600
Or you're using your very
similar Android application

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.100
to run directly on Android TV.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.600
So we wanted to
make it a little bit

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.200
of the best of the both
worlds, both for the developers

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.620
as well as for the consumers.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.867
So that's where [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:01.700
ALEX DANILO: Got it.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.770
And of course as a
developer, if you're

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.230
adding Google Cast
capability to your app,

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.530
whether it's iOS or
Android or whatever that

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.797
works on Android TV as well.

00:03:10.797 --> 00:03:12.630
So it's kind of like
Android TV in some ways

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.490
is a super set of a simple
device like the Chromecast.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.420
But then Google Cast itself is
spreading to all other devices.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.430
Because we have
Cast Audio as well,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.490
which is of course a great way
to send sound around the house

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.490
if you have a media app,
if you're playing music

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.460
or whatever.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.710
And we've also introduced
multi-room audio.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.740
So if you have
multiple Cast devices,

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.240
they can play in
perfect sync, which

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.656
is a really neat feature from
a developer's point of view.

00:03:35.656 --> 00:03:37.585
So how many developers
out here have

00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:39.920
had any experience with
developing Cast applications?

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.140
A few.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.920
That's nice.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.552
Good.

00:03:45.552 --> 00:03:47.010
JOHN AFFAKI: What
about Android TV?

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.510
All right.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.780
ALEX DANILO: A few.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.195
That's good.

00:03:51.195 --> 00:03:52.025
JOHN AFFAKI: Not much
overlap, actually.

00:03:52.025 --> 00:03:52.440
ALEX DANILO: Yeah.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.424
JOHN AFFAKI: Which is
kind of interesting.

00:03:53.424 --> 00:03:55.160
ALEX DANILO: That
is interesting.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.050
So as a developer,
what would you

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.145
say would be the strengths
of one of the platforms

00:04:00.145 --> 00:04:00.770
over the other?

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.320
I mean, we're doing
the two platforms that

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.630
have different characteristics.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.840
So where do you see different
types of application fitting

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.286
with the two models?

00:04:08.286 --> 00:04:10.160
MAJD BAKAR: Well, I
wouldn't say that there's

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.160
one that is more
powerful than the other.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.220
But it's more if you are
targeting different interaction

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.279
models, which might result
in a different user.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.180
I would say younger
users, they would

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.260
like to have that
feeling of the phone.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
They like to navigate
a list of songs

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.450
or playing a game
using their phone.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.970
Other people, other
users might be

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.460
more interested
in just lean back

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.340
and having the remote
control with physical buttons

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.910
to navigate the shorter list.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:41.660
JOHN AFFAKI: Yeah.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.620
I think it really depends
on the type of application.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.000
If you're going to
be very input heavy,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.370
generally speaking,
whether it's search

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.385
or actually entering text.

00:04:51.385 --> 00:04:53.010
Your phone is a much
better controller.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.020
And at that point,
developing for Cast

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.020
is a much better interaction
model for the user.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.620
Because the touchscreen
keyboard is generally

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.680
much more interesting
to use than either

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.640
a D-pad remote, where
you can enter passwords

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.657
on the screen or whatnot.

00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:07.990
So you've got that type of user.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.860
And as Majd said,
I think anybody

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.860
who's dealing with leanback,
generally speaking,

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.450
likes to have a much more
responsive experience

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.820
with the remote, or simple.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.600
Where they don't
want to look down.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.820
They don't want to
turn on the phone.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.260
So I think it really depends
on the applications I think.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.100
We've also got
applications, which

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.370
work in both of
the worlds, which

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.460
is you're starting
something maybe

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.357
on the bus or the train
on the way back home.

00:05:32.357 --> 00:05:34.440
When you get home, you
just want to click a button

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.523
and continue that same
experience without actually

00:05:36.523 --> 00:05:38.030
relaunching an application.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.064
And that you can't really do
in say the Android TV world.

00:05:43.064 --> 00:05:44.980
But you could do in Cast
in that you're really

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.010
extending your existing
experience onto the TV.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.040
So they both have very
strong experiences.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.190
But they're different.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.940
ALEX DANILO: Yeah.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.410
One thing also with the
platforms that in recent times,

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.520
there's talk of the GPU power
on devices like the Cast device

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.020
and the Android TV device.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.310
And generally, the GPU is more
powerful on the Android TV

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.600
device versus a Chromecast.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.830
So if you have an existing
Android app, extending it

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.190
to Android TV's natural.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.160
And you get more GPU power.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.970
But of course, we've introduced
the remote display API, which

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.680
I might get John to explain.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.830
Basically, this is how you get
to use the GPU on your phone

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.190
but have Cast act as
a secondary display.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.520
So can you talk about it?

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.810
JOHN AFFAKI: Yeah.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.377
I mean, essentially
the Cast model--

00:06:26.377 --> 00:06:28.960
if you guys aren't that familiar
with, a few of you that are--

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.580
is that there's two parts
to your application.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.310
You've got one part that's
running on your mobile device.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.220
And essentially, it's your
Android iOS or web application

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.300
that's running in Chrome.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.010
And then you have part
of the application

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.968
that's running within
directly the Cast device.

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:44.500
And that's an HTML5 application.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.610
Now with Cast, we've
never essentially-- we

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.530
focused on reach with Chromecast
and getting the device

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.584
to as many people
out there as possible

00:06:51.584 --> 00:06:52.750
with a very low price point.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:58.190
Which means we've never had,
you know, 980 GPU in there.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.280
We've never had anything
great as far as power.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.350
Because its main purpose
was to stream video.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.692
But games on there have
been-- games with Cast

00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:08.150
have actually been
doing very well.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.890
Because again if you're
thinking about us extending

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:15.050
the reach of the mobile
applications to the TV,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.380
mobile gaming is huge.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.940
In case you haven't noticed.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.940
And so we really wanted
to be able to extend

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.680
that experience to the TV.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.500
But the GPU is very limiting.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.710
And so one of the things
that we've really looked at

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.080
is actually using the
GPU that's on your phone

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.390
and having you be able to build
your game natively for Android

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.030
or iOS but render to a
second screen or basically

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.615
a virtual display and
stream that to the TV.

00:07:40.615 --> 00:07:42.240
And that's actually
worked really well.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.820
If you take a look-- and I
think Khaled is giving a talk

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.220
a little bit later about this.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.350
Where we can actually
get really high action

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.945
games going, where you can
have really great rendering.

00:07:50.945 --> 00:07:52.820
If you're looking at
the high-end or actually

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.650
even mid-end Android
devices and iOS devices

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.310
will actually allow you to deal
with really great graphics.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.100
And we can get very good
latency within the living room

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.019
so that you can't really tell
that you're actually rendering

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:07.060
everything on your phone.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.016
And really the
best part of it is

00:08:10.016 --> 00:08:12.140
everybody's upgrading their
phones year after year.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.774
So as you upgrade your
phone, your game console

00:08:15.774 --> 00:08:17.190
or your gaming
experience actually

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.680
gets better every time.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.280
And for developers, it's
actually a very natural model,

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.180
just like developing for
a native Android TV game

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.339
is actually fairly
trivial once you've

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.380
done Android development.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.980
You know, basically it's the
same development platform.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.830
In this world, you don't
have the added complexity

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.480
of the HTML5 receiver
that you're dealing with.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.659
You're really building your
game and just rendering

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.090
two screens on the same device.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.450
And we will take care
of pushing it out.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.490
And again when we're
looking at the developers,

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:52.240
Unity has been a massive
model for environment

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.520
to develop games four.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.210
And we've built
this Unity plug-in

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.330
that makes it absolutely
trivial to do so.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.000
So [? row ?] displays, it
really brings the ability

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.410
to extend your games in
a simple matter to the TV

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.192
if you're developing for Cast.

00:09:07.192 --> 00:09:08.400
So it's going to be good.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.108
ALEX DANILO: Yes.

00:09:09.108 --> 00:09:10.830
So do we have game
developers here?

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.990
Any game developers?

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.490
Oh, yeah.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:13.760
A few.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.718
About the same as Cast.

00:09:14.718 --> 00:09:15.320
Yeah.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.060
Very good.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.620
Anyone have any questions
you'd like to ask us?

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.540
Don't be shy.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.040
Yes.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.534
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:24.534 --> 00:09:26.526
But what is the
competitive threat

00:09:26.526 --> 00:09:30.510
Android TV has to somebody like
Samsung or Vizio [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:33.735 --> 00:09:35.360
ALEX DANILO: So the
question was what's

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.530
the competitive threat
from something like-- well

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:41.060
between Android TV and
other manufacturers

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.780
that embed their own
devices in the TV set?

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.487
We believe in a
healthy ecosystem.

00:09:45.487 --> 00:09:47.320
So it's not so much as
a competitive threat.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.620
It's like, you know, we
believe the best platform

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.640
will win out in the end.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.899
And of course,
Android TV's currently

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:53.940
shipping in all Sony TVs.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.730
So all Sony Bravias
are all shipping

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.980
with Android TV at the moment.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.485
And, you know, that will
continue to increase.

00:10:00.485 --> 00:10:02.610
It's nice to see these
different platforms play out

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.410
against each other.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.090
And at the end of the
day, if developers

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.650
move to a particular platform
that will make it successful

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.760
and other manufacturers will
follow on, that's what we hope.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.530
But again, it's up
to market forces.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.930
That's bit of a
difficult question.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.749
MAJD BAKAR: But at
the same time use,

00:10:17.749 --> 00:10:19.665
I mean at Android TV we
have several partners.

00:10:19.665 --> 00:10:23.450
At CS last week, we announced
additional partners.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.840
Sony TV-- Sony is a big one.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.030
But they are another five
that's followed suit.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.860
And we see that as expanding.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.850
As developers, I mean, you
should target the platform

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.990
that has the most
compelling user

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.955
for your particular application.

00:10:39.955 --> 00:10:41.455
And in some cases,
you might be need

00:10:41.455 --> 00:10:45.270
to target multiple platforms
until things settle down.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.520
This is the same as in phones.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.020
Right?

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.790
We still target Android and iOS.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.110
So this will continue to
be even in the TV space.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.485
AUDIENCE: Just a
quick follow on.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.500
How long do you think
that will continue?

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.958
ALEX DANILO: The
follow on question

00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.380
was how long do you
think that will continue?

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.580
MAJD BAKAR: That's a
bit hard to guess that.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.810
Look, Android is a very
compelling platform in general.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.970
Bringing it to a
TV is definitely

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.080
a huge step for that ecosystem.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.980
And maintaining a platform
is very-- it's not easy.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.145
We are committed to doing so.

00:11:15.145 --> 00:11:20.560
And we'll continue to bring
innovation and stability

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.406
to that platform.

00:11:22.406 --> 00:11:24.280
JOHN AFFAKI: And one of
the-- and again, it's

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.196
not a matter of advantage
versus disadvantage.

00:11:26.196 --> 00:11:27.720
But to some extent, there is.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.590
Right?

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.670
In many cases to bring your
application to Android TV

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.200
is not much of a decision if
you've already got an Android

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.950
phone application.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:40.396
AUDIENCE: I'm asking you this
as a former [INAUDIBLE] owner.

00:11:40.396 --> 00:11:45.336
I think [INAUDIBLE] Android
on the TV [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:45.336 --> 00:11:46.675
Because I've wanted that.

00:11:46.675 --> 00:11:48.300
Because I want that
Android experience.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.523
And now I see that Samsung
and Vizio and others

00:11:50.523 --> 00:11:51.264
have stepped up.

00:11:51.264 --> 00:11:52.847
And I'm just worrying,
as a developer,

00:11:52.847 --> 00:11:56.204
as, you know, I tell my students
what should you build for.

00:11:56.204 --> 00:11:59.168
Having backed the
mobile-friendly developer

00:11:59.168 --> 00:12:01.144
platform if you already
have an Android,

00:12:01.144 --> 00:12:03.096
being able to push
those [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:03.096 --> 00:12:05.096
onto the device that was
built for that platform

00:12:05.096 --> 00:12:06.084
is very compelling.

00:12:06.084 --> 00:12:08.060
But there are other
thoughts, you know,

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.036
that developers build
for where the money is.

00:12:10.036 --> 00:12:13.988
And if Samsung can make it easy
to go through all of their TVs.

00:12:13.988 --> 00:12:15.964
and they're
dominating the market,

00:12:15.964 --> 00:12:17.460
then why wouldn't [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.070
MAJD BAKAR: So I mean,
time will only tell.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.520
I don't think it will be only
one platform to be honest.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.610
I think it there will be
multiple platforms that

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:26.550
will stay there.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.030
But we are committed
to Android TV.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:33.290
And you're going to see more
and more OEMs and even a larger

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:37.160
user base coming in this
year for Android TV.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.980
So it will be competing
in terms at least of size.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.290
Is it going to be the
only game in town?

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.676
I don't know.

00:12:45.676 --> 00:12:47.300
ALEX DANILO: Again,
and as a developer,

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.110
you probably have to-- like
I'm a developer too, right?

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.370
So you have to work out
where to spend your time.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.140
So if you do have the
Android application already,

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.090
right, it's trivial
to extend to the TV.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.540
So that's not a big
investment for already

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.530
a growing ecosystem.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.390
If you've got a media
consumption app,

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:03.910
I would say, look
at Google Cast.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.255
Because that gives you the
install base of Cast devices.

00:13:06.255 --> 00:13:08.330
There's like over 20
million of them out there.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.790
And it's continuing
to sell like hotcakes.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.130
And those things will run
on Android TV as well.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.920
So there's a really safe
bet for like a media app.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.860
So again, it depends
on what you're doing.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.530
If you're a gaming person,
you need to come and listen

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.696
to Khaled's talk next.

00:13:20.696 --> 00:13:22.570
Because he'll go through
a whole lot of stuff

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.730
about how to actually
build for gaming.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.960
And in the remote display API,
which we brought, which we just

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.200
spoke about, is a great way
to get high performance gaming

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.520
through those Cast devices.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.660
So again, horses for courses,
depends what you want to do.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.990
But I mean, some of the
other major platforms

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.030
around, I mean, you
have Firefox OS on TVs.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.820
You have WebOS.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.500
I mean, the choices are there.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.160
And they will just all play out.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.321
But what's interesting
about Firefox OS and WebOS--

00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:49.820
this is a slight deviation from
what we we're talking about.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.460
But both of those are based
on HTML5 technologies.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.570
And Google Cast originally
chose HTML5 as the platform

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.177
to run on the Cast device for
that whole easy to develop--

00:14:00.177 --> 00:14:02.510
Because it's familiar to a
number of different platforms

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.926
and different types
of developers.

00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:07.640
So it's the amount of effort as
a developer, how much time you

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.410
have to invest to get
your app on that device.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.005
And we see both
Cast and Android TV

00:14:13.005 --> 00:14:17.184
as being two fairly easy
paths to making that happen.

00:14:17.184 --> 00:14:17.850
MAJD BAKAR: Yes.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.650
ALEX DANILO: Yes.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:24.135
AUDIENCE: I hear-- the
media criticizes having two

00:14:24.135 --> 00:14:26.611
completely different paths.

00:14:26.611 --> 00:14:27.110
Right?

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.860
I mean, how do you
respond to that?

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.770
Because it becomes
confusing to the consumer

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.870
two devices that from
their perspective

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.250
do exactly the same thing
from the same company.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:37.916
ALEX DANILO: OK.

00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:39.770
So the question was
that the media often

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:43.440
says that we have two
conflicting paths or whatever

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.040
and how do you resolve that?

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.456
Well, the media say a lot of
things, which is interesting.

00:14:47.456 --> 00:14:49.520
And we have two different
paths in like Chrome OS

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.811
versus Android, right, as well.

00:14:50.811 --> 00:14:52.840
So we have two major
operating systems.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.830
It's a question of
providing different options

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:56.560
for developers.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.190
Because some are suited better
for some style of application

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.240
versus the others.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.954
And it's also a question
of trying new things.

00:15:04.954 --> 00:15:06.370
The media has been
saying, oh, you

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.660
should merge Chrome OS
and Android for years.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.910
But they've both become
successful in their own right.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.190
So there's no reason
that the Cast ecosystem

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.800
can't live alongside
Android TV forever really.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.964
It's not like you
have to make a choice.

00:15:18.964 --> 00:15:20.380
MAJD BAKAR: And
we're still seeing

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.150
that some people have
preferences for one interaction

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.270
model over the other.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.430
Eventually maybe
in five, 10 years,

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.660
you'll have one interaction
model that will be the norm.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:37.910
But for the short term at least,
some people have preferences.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.540
I, for example, I
definitely prefer

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.560
to use a phone as
my remote control.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.880
But other people in
my household might

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.195
prefer to have a
physical remote control.

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:47.990
So and this is why
we are offering--

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.480
I won't say they're competing.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.700
They are more complementary.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:55.790
And we're trying to make
sure that we satisfy

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.630
the larger number of consumers.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.490
But we are providing
you with the tools

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:03.410
and-- especially as Alex
said-- on the media side,

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.470
you can write your
application once

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.742
and it will be available
to both platforms.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.652
Yes?

00:16:12.652 --> 00:16:14.610
AUDIENCE: You said you
prefer to use your phone

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.089
as a remote control, right?

00:16:16.089 --> 00:16:19.035
The Android TV app right
now is very limited

00:16:19.035 --> 00:16:20.508
to leanback navigation.

00:16:20.508 --> 00:16:22.472
You have to swipe
to go everywhere,

00:16:22.472 --> 00:16:23.454
keyboard in the phone.

00:16:23.454 --> 00:16:25.418
Are there any plans to
open an API to offer

00:16:25.418 --> 00:16:28.118
more control to the
developers for remote control

00:16:28.118 --> 00:16:29.194
of the Android TV?

00:16:29.194 --> 00:16:29.860
ALEX DANILO: OK.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.480
The question is
about Android TV.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.320
And Majd says he prefers to
use the phone as a remote.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.245
And at the moment, Android
TV's more the leanback thing

00:16:38.245 --> 00:16:38.870
with the phone.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.570
So are there any
plans to introduce

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.910
new APIs for different
input options

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.580
from the developer
point of view?

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.010
MAJD BAKAR: So for
the time being,

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.180
we're focusing on making
the leanback solution

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.610
for Android TV very solid.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.440
There's still some
work to do there.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:58.550
And we are investing heavily
in the developer tools

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.240
to make it easy for you to
bring up that experience.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.500
Also while the usage of
Android TV is increasing,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.141
it's still a relatively
nascent platform.

00:17:11.141 --> 00:17:13.099
So we want to make sure
that we have uniformity

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.400
in the experience to make sure
the users don't get confused,

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.909
at this time.

00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:19.700
In the future, we might
be looking at this.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.155
But for now, we're not.

00:17:22.155 --> 00:17:24.530
ALEX DANILO: I think we had
another question out the back

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:25.141
there.

00:17:25.141 --> 00:17:25.612
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:25.612 --> 00:17:28.028
Just a riff on this idea of
the future of the living room,

00:17:28.028 --> 00:17:29.520
push it a little bit harder.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:29.740
ALEX DANILO: Good.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.406
AUDIENCE: It seems
that you guys believe

00:17:31.406 --> 00:17:33.374
TV is a part of our future.

00:17:33.374 --> 00:17:38.290
So I find that interesting,
because maybe it's not.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:42.291
However, I'm a huge fan of
Cast and what's going on.

00:17:42.291 --> 00:17:45.070
And I think you guys are in
a push me, pull me situation.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.106
where you're kind of
like keeping one leg

00:17:47.106 --> 00:17:50.690
stuck in the 20th century idea
of the entertainment model

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.697
while helping us think
about the 21st century.

00:17:53.697 --> 00:17:54.530
ALEX DANILO: Thanks.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:56.270
Very, very interesting question.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.020
Do you want me to
repeat the question or--

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:58.200
MAJD BAKAR: Do you want to--

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:58.866
ALEX DANILO: OK.

00:17:58.866 --> 00:18:02.400
So the question is more about
the future of the living room.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.470
We're talking about
the future of TV

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.920
and whether or not TV
will be in the future.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.460
And we kind of have
one foot in both camps,

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.300
one in the 20th century
with screens everywhere,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.770
and the 21st century
going beyond that.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.490
So what do we think?

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.200
MAJD BAKAR: I mean,
you're right that the way

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.630
we've been consuming TV
is still very traditional.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.390
You sit down just
slouch in your couch

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:33.860
and watch a broadcast
type of interaction.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.750
We do think that with
Cast we could open up

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.690
additional avenues there.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.790
Because we're trying to bring in
the power of the mobile phone,

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.350
the power of the touch
screen that is 17 inch away

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:51.950
from your eyes, very engaging
experience to that leanback

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:54.330
traditionally very
one-way experience.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.670
So you can build interactive
two-way applications,

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.060
two-way interactions
with your users.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.940
And at the same time, have
very, very complex navigation,

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.030
complex user experience
that usually you

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.670
can't get when you are 10
feet away or 5 meters away

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.690
from that screen.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:15.310
But on the flip side,
there are aspect

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:17.420
of the TV that,
while traditional,

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.450
are still going
to continue to be.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.550
The first is TV is social.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.780
And by social, I don't
mean like social network.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.910
But usually, it's more than
one person experiencing that

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:27.610
together.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.340
And we've built a case in
North America and Europe,

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.450
we've built living rooms
all around that TV.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.910
If you have wall with a
large screen, and people

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.779
are facing that and interacting
and consuming from it.

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:42.070
And that's something you
don't get with a small screen.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:46.260
So there still will
be consumption there.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.460
Empirically though,
what we've seen

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.000
is when people who
are traditionally

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.340
mobile consumers-- so
let's say a teenager who

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.440
consumes their
YouTube or Netflix

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.240
on the phone or tablets.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.040
Once they use Cast and cast
that content to a larger screen,

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.800
their usage increases
dramatically.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.260
We're seeing increases
between 30 at 70%.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.990
In some cases, even over 100%
increase in minute consumed.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:15.190
So that will continue to play.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.810
We do think that between
Android TV and Cast

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.930
and the ability to bring
that mobile experience

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:23.720
into the living room,
we'll be able to give you,

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.374
as a developer,
more tools to bring

00:20:25.374 --> 00:20:26.540
more compelling experiences.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.210
We're not going to be
bringing those experiences.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:29.530
We're relying on you to do that.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:30.780
We are the platform providers.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.430
So we give you the tools,
and then up to you to do it.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:35.757
JOHN AFFAKI: And the TV
is one of the examples.

00:20:35.757 --> 00:20:38.090
If you're looking at it,
really what we're looking to do

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.260
is get you to consume your
media, your games in the best

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.400
device in the house.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.416
The TV is an example.

00:20:43.416 --> 00:20:44.790
And Majd just
talked about, which

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.440
is like the larger screen which
allows social experiences.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.180
Speakers are another one.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:48.400
Right?

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.640
I mean, if you're looking,
yes, we can think of the future

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.240
where everybody's
got their VR headset

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.170
in a corner in their
headphones and basically

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.260
consuming their media all alone.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.990
But the reality is at
the end of the day,

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.370
whether it's
speakers or TV, we're

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.840
just looking to enhance your
experience and make it better

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.410
and increase consumption
time for all of your apps,

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.300
et cetera, et cetera.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.800
So it's not just the TV.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.337
It's really about if there
was another medium where

00:21:11.337 --> 00:21:13.920
we could extend that experience
where it would make it better,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.792
we would look at
extending it that way.

00:21:16.792 --> 00:21:19.458
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:19.458 --> 00:21:20.208
JOHN AFFAKI: Yeah.

00:21:20.208 --> 00:21:21.184
Sure.

00:21:21.184 --> 00:21:23.400
AUDIENCE: One that
VR will be social.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:23.900
Right?

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.260
So it's not going to be just
people dystopically sitting

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.360
in the corner.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.374
So I think we have to have
a bigger vision about what's

00:21:30.374 --> 00:21:31.040
going to happen.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:31.540
Right?

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.524
Again, we're bringing all of
our historical baggage with us.

00:21:34.524 --> 00:21:35.990
But I think that's wide open.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.490
Right?

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.730
What it means to be a
node in the network,

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.840
we haven't even really
figured out yet.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.906
Two, the idea that TV is
connected to the distributor

00:21:46.906 --> 00:21:48.020
is the problem.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:48.520
Right?

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.480
You guys are helping
to break down the fact

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.040
that we can actually distribute
that identity to what it is you

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.440
watch, when it is you watch it.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.040
And you're talking
about, yes, it's

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.490
a better experience
on the screen.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.760
I just want to keep
pushing the living room.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.260
Right?

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.370
I want to keep pushing
the idea that we

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.010
don't have to keep thinking
that that remote control that's

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.560
got 40 useless buttons
is going to be there

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.500
in two years from now.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.464
Like, why?

00:22:10.464 --> 00:22:10.964
Right?

00:22:10.964 --> 00:22:14.090
And I think that
we can push harder.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.510
JOHN AFFAKI: Absolutely true.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:19.740
And the problem is when
people talk about TV,

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.200
sometimes they mean the physical
TV, the physical screen.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.050
Sometimes they mean the
TV service as your service

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.260
you get from Comcast
or Time Warner

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.900
or whatever other provider.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:37.160
Definitely our goal in
introducing the mobile aspect

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.890
of the experience
into the living room

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.940
is to give more options
both to consumers

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.570
and to content providers,
service provider, developers,

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:46.610
or whatever.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.160
So we want to give
you more choices

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.960
and try to open
up that ecosystem.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.994
So let's continue
working together.

00:22:53.994 --> 00:22:54.660
ALEX DANILO: OK.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.570
So any more technical questions?

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:00.880
We're getting quite a few
interesting questions there.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.830
I've got a question.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.700
Now we can have
multi-room audio.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.212
So it's a real
technical question.

00:23:06.212 --> 00:23:08.420
We can have multi-room audio
with multiple Cast Audio

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.170
devices.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:13.100
Will we one day possibly
have like synchronized video?

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.480
So we can have multiple
screens in the house playing

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.142
the same music video, so I can
have a multi-room disco party.

00:23:19.142 --> 00:23:24.260
[CHUCKLES]

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.670
MAJD BAKAR: Technically,
it's definitely feasible.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.210
We have the technology to do it.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:32.842
I don't think the
infrastructure is there yet.

00:23:32.842 --> 00:23:34.925
And by infrastructure, I
mean home infrastructure.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.840
Wi-Fi routers or
even regular routers

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.620
are still not powerful
enough and not

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:47.262
be able to handle that amount
of videos flowing in the home.

00:23:47.262 --> 00:23:48.720
There might be few
that would have.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.310
But until we have mass appeal
or mass penetration of that,

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.220
it will take time.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:59.940
Another thing is so far--
it sounds very interesting.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:00.440
It's cool.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.231
I'd like to use it.

00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:02.710
But I would like
to also understand

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:06.002
how big that use case
would be, how many people

00:24:06.002 --> 00:24:07.710
would want to have
the same video playing

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:09.310
all around the house.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:10.901
Yes.

00:24:10.901 --> 00:24:12.150
ALEX DANILO: We have one, two.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.066
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:18.100
MAJD BAKAR: So currently,
we're focusing on audio.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.610
And that technology is
definitely portable to video

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.030
and would be able
to synchronize them.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.350
Actually as it turns
out, synchronizing video

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.230
is easier than
synchronizing audio.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:32.600
Because the latency and
the tolerance of your ear

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.350
is much, much, much
higher than your eyes.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:39.750
So we can do that.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.180
We need to wait until
the network is available.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.080
ALEX DANILO: Network
can deal with it.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:45.580
Cool.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.280
Ah, question.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:46.780
Yes.

00:24:49.336 --> 00:24:52.948
AUDIENCE: I don't know-- can you
scale the video on Chromecast

00:24:52.948 --> 00:24:54.220
to 4k?

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:58.280
MAJD BAKAR: Currently,
Chromecast supports only 1080p.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.050
We'll see when we add 4k.

00:25:04.192 --> 00:25:05.150
ALEX DANILO: All right.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:05.620
Cool.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:05.770
OK.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.364
We've got probably enough time
for maybe one last question.

00:25:08.364 --> 00:25:08.864
OK.

00:25:08.864 --> 00:25:11.234
AUDIENCE: I want to follow
up with this question.

00:25:11.234 --> 00:25:13.604
There are Android TV
devices that are 4k.

00:25:13.604 --> 00:25:16.444
Is the Cast protocol
only [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:16.444 --> 00:25:17.360
MAJD BAKAR: Thank you.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.330
ALEX DANILO: The question
was about whether or not

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:20.800
the Cast protocol's
limited to 4k

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.736
because there are
Android TV 4k devices.

00:25:22.736 --> 00:25:23.360
MAJD BAKAR: No.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.550
Actually, Cast protocol has no
limitation on the resolution.

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.100
It's a matter of
the actual hardware

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.687
being able to decode 4k.

00:25:31.687 --> 00:25:33.520
And then obviously, you
do need to make sure

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.800
of your network throughput.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.410
So this becomes
like people's home,

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:41.340
whether their routers and
their broadband connectivity

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.920
is capable of handling 4k.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.910
4k Bitrates these
days is anywhere

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:51.820
between at the low, low
end, 10 megabit per second.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.880
And it goes up to 24
megabit per second.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:58.394
So you need to make sure
that you can sustain that.

00:25:58.394 --> 00:25:59.060
ALEX DANILO: OK.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.090
Wonderful.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.870
Well thanks, Majd and
John for a nice insight

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.890
into the living room.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:06.300
Anyone want to
follow up with this,

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.945
office hours will
be from 3:00 to 5:00

00:26:07.945 --> 00:26:09.070
over in the other building.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.394
So feel free to come and ask
us all sorts of questions.

00:26:12.394 --> 00:26:13.935
And enjoy the rest
of the conference.

00:26:13.935 --> 00:26:16.080
And thanks for listening.
