00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:02.235
This baby's rough.
[whistles]

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:03.069
Yeah, it is.

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:04.003
MIKE WOLFE: Look at the logo.

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.205
FRANK FRITZ: I know.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:07.974
MIKE WOLFE: The first
thing we see is Aerosmith.

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:09.342
I mean, plain as day.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.411
But it's not the Aerosmith logo.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:12.746
Aw, look at that guy, man.

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.214
MIKE WOLFE: That
looks like the, uh--

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.782
FRANK FRITZ: Keep on trucking!
MIKE WOLFE: Yeah.

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:16.883
FRANK FRITZ: "Keep
on trucking" dude.

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:18.017
MIKE WOLFE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.120
And it's got some "keep
on trucking" dude on it.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.491
I mean, the paint is detailed,
but I'm confused by that.

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:28.261
So we don't know if this is a
fan's depiction, you know, of--

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.662
somebody just liked Aerosmith.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:30.463
Oh, yeah, somebody
that likes the band.

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.531
Yeah.
FRANK FRITZ: Yeah

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.299
MIKE WOLFE: The van
itself is very cool.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.235
This is an International
Harvester Metro.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.905
They made these things from the
late '30s into the mid-'70s.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.741
You know, so I guess it kind
of fits the time period.

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.943
MAN: This is a '64.

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:45.745
MIKE WOLFE: Did you put
it up on the car trailer?

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:47.814
MAN: Yeah, we-- my
son and I put it up

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:50.083
on the trailer
because it was-- it

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:53.453
was pretty much buried to the--
- Oh, yeah.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.187
You can see.
- In mud.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.255
Oh, OK.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:56.389
- So this was all in the ground.
- Ground.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.224
- Right here?
- Ground contact.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:01.661
When I first saw that van, I
thought it was pretty cool.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.763
Essentially, the
condition it is now,

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:06.332
it is becoming part
of the landscape.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.567
MIKE WOLFE: Have
you learned anything

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.135
about the van since you've--

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.770
FRANK FRITZ: Since you owned it?

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.443
I heard it through someone who
heard that the original owner

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:20.880
of the van, Mark Lehman,
was here on the property,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.384
and that he had a connection
with the band itself.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:26.653
MIKE WOLFE: Do you know
his contact information?

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:27.687
MAN: No.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:29.055
I don't know.

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:30.457
OK.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:31.825
What I know about
Aerosmith is, they

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.627
did come from around this area.

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:35.595
Woo.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.230
It's held pretty good.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.432
I guess you could
try to get some DNA

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:40.900
off the mattress in here.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.202
[laughter]

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.537
There's, like, two
mattresses in there.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.439
Look at this thing, man.
MIKE WOLFE: Wow.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.408
Look at these, like,
old Persian rugs.

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:49.642
FRANK FRITZ: Yeah.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.211
MIKE WOLFE: I'm going "CSI"
on this thing too, man.

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.813
I'm thinking to myself, OK, they
made these from the late '30s

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:55.148
to the late '70s.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:58.418
If they used this van when
they first started rocking,

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:00.386
it would have been
old enough where they

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.388
could acquire it pretty cheap.

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:05.225
Water cooler.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.894
Budweiser can's got age to it.
- Look at that.

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:08.962
It says Three Dog Night.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.196
FRANK FRITZ: Somebody
made one of those

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.698
with those little
clicker things.

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:12.732
MIKE WOLFE: Label maker.

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:14.300
So what's the other
side look like?

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.002
Is it painted on
the other side too?

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.037
- No, this is the only--
- That's it?

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:19.572
- --the only paint.
- Oh, wow.

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:20.673
Look at this side.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:23.176
[laughs] Dang, man.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:24.277
FRANK FRITZ: Not
much left there.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:26.079
MIKE WOLFE: This
thing is roached.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.450
But what's holding it together
is the painting on the side.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.818
That's the money shot.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:36.122
If we can somehow prove that
this is Aerosmith's first van,

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:38.091
condition goes out the door.

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:40.994
I mean, if it's real,
then this moment

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.795
is, like, picking folklore.
- Oh, yeah.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:43.730
Yeah.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.731
I mean, it is what
it is right now.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.266
I mean, I tell you what.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.701
If it is, I mean, that's major.

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.236
- That'd be a cool piece.
- You know?

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:51.204
Yeah.

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:52.138
MIKE WOLFE: What
do you want for it?

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:53.006
Let me ask you that.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.942
Do you know what
you want for it?

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:58.878
[laughs] I guess
that's to be determined.

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:02.048
I'd feel terrible if I were
to offer this to somebody

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.917
and then find out later
that it was, you know--

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:04.951
It was the original van.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.986
Or sell it under
false pretenses

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:09.389
saying that it has Aerosmith,
and them getting something

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.823
that--
MIKE WOLFE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:11.991
--is bogus.
FRANK FRITZ: Right.

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:13.026
I gotcha.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:13.960
So you have to get
ahold of, I mean--

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.295
Pin it down.
Yeah.

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:18.197
--someone in the organization,
whether it be management,

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:20.166
someone in the band.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:22.936
- Their roadie, bus driver.
- I mean, yeah.

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:25.004
I mean, somebody that was--
somebody that's been with them,

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:26.472
obviously, for a while.
- Yeah.

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:27.674
Yeah.

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.542
It's not like we can
just call up Steven Tyler

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:32.011
and go, hey, man,
what are you doing?

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:34.247
This is Mike and Frank.

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:36.182
I think I found your van.

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:37.917
Clic.

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:40.053
Well, let me think about
some-- let me, uh--

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.088
What kind of
connections do we have?

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:43.323
MIKE WOLFE: So Frank
and I are having

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:44.891
a conversation
about who we would

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.926
know to connect the dots here.

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:48.127
I mean, I don't
know how to help you

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:51.064
other than for us
to try to figure

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:54.167
out some sort of a connection.

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:56.636
I mean, I have some friends in
Nashville that are musicians.

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:58.504
Maybe we could call one
of those guys, like Dan.

00:03:58.504 --> 00:03:59.472
Yeah.

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:00.940
MIKE WOLFE: Dan
would probably know.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.076
Dan Auerbach is a guy I've
known for a few years.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.611
I ride motorcycles
with him all the time.

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.412
I sold him a guitar,
sold him an amp.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.414
So I got a pretty good
relationship with him.

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.116
You know, you ever
heard of The Black Keys?

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:11.250
MAN: Yeah.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.652
MIKE WOLFE: I mean, I
know him pretty well.

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:14.621
I could call him and ask him if
he knows anybody in the group--

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.189
you know, in Aerosmith.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:17.590
Here's the money
shot right here.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.492
Let me get it.
FRANK FRITZ: Yeah, this is it.
