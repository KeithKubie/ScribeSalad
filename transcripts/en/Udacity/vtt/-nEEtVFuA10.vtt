00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.110
Таким образом, мы наблюдаем, что чем ближе человек относится к кому-то,

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.990
кто страдает шизофренией

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.530
Более вероятно, что этот человек также страдает расстройством.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.130
Поэтому мы знаем из этого, что существует генетический компонент для шизофрении, но сам по себе этого недостаточно .

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.250
но сам по себе этого недостаточно .

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.390
There also has to be some kind of
stressful environmental experience

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.190
that the person suffers from.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.650
Those two things together are really
what's required and we refer to this

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.530
as the diathesis stress model.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.750
So, diathesis means
the biological predisposition

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.850
and the stress means some kind
of environmental event.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.260
It's those two things together
that are really required.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.440
And this, by the way, applies to all kinds
of psychological disorders.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.470
Anxiety, personality disorders,
obsessive compulsive disorders.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.990
So, let's take a closer look at some
of the seenvironmental risk factors

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.480
for schizophrenia.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.930
So one of the risk factors involved
in the development of schizophrenia

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.790
is maternal infection.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.750
And so what we mean by this is that
if a pregnant woman is exposed to diseases

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.000
or infections, that the baby, later on
in life, actually has an increased risk

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.520
for the development of schizophrenia.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.750
So some of these diseases and infections
include things like herpes,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.280
influenza, rubella and toxoplasmosis.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.520
And toxoplasmosis by the way is found
in feline feces which is one reason

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.280
why doctors always recommend

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.520
that pregnant women
stay away from cat litter.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.530
Other environmental risk factors
include chronic stress

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.750
and taking certain drugs, now again,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.500
by themselves, these things do not cause
or even really increase schizophrenia.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.040
It's that coupled with
a genetic predisposition

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.748
that's really required.

00:01:49.748 --> 00:01:53.679
And again this is what we mean
by the diathesis stress model.
