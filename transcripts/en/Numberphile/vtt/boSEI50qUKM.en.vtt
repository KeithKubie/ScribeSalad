Hi, I'm Brady.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.720
I make the Numberphile videos
and there's just a few quick

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.760
messages I wanted to share.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.150
Firstly, we had a bit of a
glitch this week, and it seems

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.710
our last video didn't go to
most of our subscribers.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.760
And it's a really cool one,
it's a collaboration with

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.090
ViHart all about tetrahedral
dice.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.090
If you don't know what I'm
talking about, or haven't seen

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.900
it, you may not have gone it,
and I'll put a link under the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.440
video and on the screen.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.950
Next, I just want to say
something about our notorious

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.950
bits of brown paper.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.500
You see them all the
time in our videos.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.580
And this is a whole bunch
from previous films.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.960
Some people love them and
some people hate them.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.280
I've written a blog about why I
use it, so I'm not going to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.800
cover it again now, but I just
wanted you to know--

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.270
let me grab something
here, hang on.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.850
This particular piece, it's
the Nepalese flag from our

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.920
video about the most

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.320
mathematical flag in the world.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.720
Well that's actually
up for auction at

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.030
the moment, on eBay.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.790
We're raising money
for charity.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.290
If you're interested, and would
like to own this piece

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.960
of Numberphile history, why
don't you put in a bid?

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.670
And if it proves popular, maybe
some of those other ones

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.330
could go to charity as well.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.502
Next, I just wanted to mention
a video that was sent in by a

00:01:07.502 --> 00:01:10.800
viewer when we were doing all
our Rubik's cube films.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.810
It's one that I really meant to
show everyone at the time,

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.790
but didn't really
get the chance.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.700
So I just want to highlight
it now.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.930
Basically it's from a guy called
either Shy or Shay, I'm

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.590
not sure how to pronounce his
name, but he's got a whole

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.200
bunch of Rubik's cubes
of different style.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.980
And he managed to make them say
Numberphile, and then he

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.890
solved every single
one of them.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.960
And I reckon that's pretty
amazing, and

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.710
worth a special mention.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.960
While we're having this chat, I
thought this might be a good

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.070
opportunity to hear what you
want us to making films about.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.120
So why not use this video, in
the comments section below, to

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.400
give us some suggestions and
tell us more about what you'd

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.350
like to say.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.640
Lastly, I don't normally do
these sort of messages in

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.520
videos, but I do let people
know what's going on via

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.840
Twitter and Facebook.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.730
You can follow us on there.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.660
There's always a little bit
extra, pictures, chances to

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.590
get involved.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.060
So sign up for those, if you're
that kind of social

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.270
media person.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.389
A reminder again, if you didn't
see the ViHart video,

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.740
links are below.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.260
And under the video, I'm going
to put loads to all my other

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.730
channels, because some of you
don't realize, when I'm not

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.810
obsessing about numbers, I've
got a whole bunch of other

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.800
videos about chemistry, and
astronomy, and physics.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.210
You can check them out too.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.430
Thanks for watching.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.130
I'm actually flying off to San
Francisco now, but I'll be

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.610
back next week, putting up
new Numberphile videos.
