there are numerous factors that have

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150
there are numerous factors that have
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.350
there are numerous factors that have
contributed to Africa's economic develop

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
contributed to Africa's economic develop
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.830
contributed to Africa's economic develop
economic development issues I have

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840
economic development issues I have
 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.290
economic development issues I have
decided specifically to focus on one of

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300
decided specifically to focus on one of
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.470
decided specifically to focus on one of
those which is basically policy however

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
those which is basically policy however
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.109
those which is basically policy however
in the book I do talk about things like

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119
in the book I do talk about things like
 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.139
in the book I do talk about things like
the historical context issues of

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:30.149
the historical context issues of
 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.870
the historical context issues of
geography the historical context and the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
geography the historical context and the
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.900
geography the historical context and the
contents of colonialism for example and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
contents of colonialism for example and
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.030
contents of colonialism for example and
how that all may have to some extent

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040
how that all may have to some extent
 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.490
how that all may have to some extent
contributed to the economic malaise that

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500
contributed to the economic malaise that
 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.770
contributed to the economic malaise that
we see now across the continent

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780
we see now across the continent
 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.790
we see now across the continent
however the main issue that I am

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
however the main issue that I am
 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.880
however the main issue that I am
tackling in my work is that of aid which

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890
tackling in my work is that of aid which
 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.120
tackling in my work is that of aid which
is an active policy where we as the

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130
is an active policy where we as the
 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.160
is an active policy where we as the
international and global community have

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
international and global community have
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.060
international and global community have
designed a specific policy towards

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070
designed a specific policy towards
 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.280
designed a specific policy towards
towards supporting economic development

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290
towards supporting economic development
 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.039
towards supporting economic development
in Africa so rather than things like

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
in Africa so rather than things like
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.649
in Africa so rather than things like
geography and history which are

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
geography and history which are
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.929
geography and history which are
ostensibly outside the realm of our

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939
ostensibly outside the realm of our
 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.330
ostensibly outside the realm of our
abilities were really focused on a very

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
abilities were really focused on a very
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.080
abilities were really focused on a very
specific issue of aid to Africa and how

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
specific issue of aid to Africa and how
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.230
specific issue of aid to Africa and how
that has been a negative factor in

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
that has been a negative factor in
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.410
that has been a negative factor in
ensuring long-term economic growth

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420
 
 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.020
 
I suppose in the context of my work I

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030
I suppose in the context of my work I
 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.910
I suppose in the context of my work I
think that there is this unstated view

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920
think that there is this unstated view
 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.940
think that there is this unstated view
or unstated fact that a to Africa has

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950
or unstated fact that a to Africa has
 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.050
or unstated fact that a to Africa has
not worked by that I should clarify that

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060
not worked by that I should clarify that
 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.670
not worked by that I should clarify that
there are essentially three types of aid

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680
there are essentially three types of aid
 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.310
there are essentially three types of aid
there's a humanitarian or emergency aid

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320
there's a humanitarian or emergency aid
 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.880
there's a humanitarian or emergency aid
which goes to actually assist during

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890
which goes to actually assist during
 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.490
which goes to actually assist during
times of let's say a tsunami or if

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500
times of let's say a tsunami or if
 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.139
times of let's say a tsunami or if
there's a an emergency like an

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149
there's a an emergency like an
 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.529
there's a an emergency like an
earthquake or a flood then there's also

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539
earthquake or a flood then there's also
 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.620
earthquake or a flood then there's also
NGO or charitable aid which is very

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630
NGO or charitable aid which is very
 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.080
NGO or charitable aid which is very
small amounts of money that people send

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090
small amounts of money that people send
 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.960
small amounts of money that people send
to African countries to support pretty

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970
to African countries to support pretty
 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.680
to African countries to support pretty
much clear and defined projects such as

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690
much clear and defined projects such as
 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.969
much clear and defined projects such as
providing a scholarship for a girl to go

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979
providing a scholarship for a girl to go
 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.669
providing a scholarship for a girl to go
to school those two types of aid that

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679
to school those two types of aid that
 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.430
to school those two types of aid that
I've just mentioned are they can

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440
I've just mentioned are they can
 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.710
I've just mentioned are they can
certainly help in terms of immediate

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720
certainly help in terms of immediate
 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.229
certainly help in terms of immediate
band-aid solution solutions but they

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239
band-aid solution solutions but they
 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.809
band-aid solution solutions but they
will not contribute to long-term

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819
will not contribute to long-term
 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.960
will not contribute to long-term
economic development in the sense that

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
economic development in the sense that
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.000
economic development in the sense that
it will not help to get Africa to grow

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010
it will not help to get Africa to grow
 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.050
it will not help to get Africa to grow
at sort of ten percent or more per year

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060
at sort of ten percent or more per year
 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.819
at sort of ten percent or more per year
which would actually meaningfully reduce

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829
which would actually meaningfully reduce
 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.400
which would actually meaningfully reduce
poverty across the continent but so

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410
poverty across the continent but so
 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.630
poverty across the continent but so
those two types of aid are very

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640
those two types of aid are very
 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.979
those two types of aid are very
different from the third type of aid

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989
different from the third type of aid
 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.390
different from the third type of aid
which is what I critique in the book

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400
which is what I critique in the book
 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.270
which is what I critique in the book
which is the large billion dollar

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280
which is the large billion dollar
 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.520
which is the large billion dollar
programs of aid that go from government

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530
programs of aid that go from government
 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.440
programs of aid that go from government
to governments and also international

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450
to governments and also international
 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.090
to governments and also international
institutions such as the World Bank to

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100
institutions such as the World Bank to
 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.970
institutions such as the World Bank to
Africa and those are that's the type of

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980
Africa and those are that's the type of
 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.990
Africa and those are that's the type of
aid that I'm talking about

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000
 
 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.690
 
the history of aid in Africa or in the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700
the history of aid in Africa or in the
 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.960
the history of aid in Africa or in the
development discourse has its roots and

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970
development discourse has its roots and
 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.810
development discourse has its roots and
actually began in earnest in the at the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820
actually began in earnest in the at the
 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.510
actually began in earnest in the at the
Bretton Woods in the 1940s and

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520
Bretton Woods in the 1940s and
 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.610
Bretton Woods in the 1940s and
essentially really took hold

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620
essentially really took hold
 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.640
essentially really took hold
after the Marshall Plan which was in the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650
after the Marshall Plan which was in the
 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.910
after the Marshall Plan which was in the
night between 1945 and 1919 fifty

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920
night between 1945 and 1919 fifty
 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.980
night between 1945 and 1919 fifty
there's a five-year program

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990
there's a five-year program
 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.070
there's a five-year program
it was thirteen billion dollars which in

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080
it was thirteen billion dollars which in
 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.570
it was thirteen billion dollars which in
today's terms is about a hundred billion

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580
today's terms is about a hundred billion
 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.500
today's terms is about a hundred billion
dollars and really the idea was that the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510
dollars and really the idea was that the
 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.570
dollars and really the idea was that the
newly emerging African countries that

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580
newly emerging African countries that
 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.630
newly emerging African countries that
were coming out of Independence had no

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640
were coming out of Independence had no
 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.750
were coming out of Independence had no
money to finance economic development so

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760
money to finance economic development so
 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.820
money to finance economic development so
the idea is very simple that savings

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830
the idea is very simple that savings
 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.560
the idea is very simple that savings
leads to investment which would lead to

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570
leads to investment which would lead to
 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.870
leads to investment which would lead to
growth the problem is that because these

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880
growth the problem is that because these
 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.130
growth the problem is that because these
were new economies there was not

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140
were new economies there was not
 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.230
were new economies there was not
necessarily any savings in these

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240
necessarily any savings in these
 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.730
necessarily any savings in these
economies and so the idea was that you

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740
economies and so the idea was that you
 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.070
economies and so the idea was that you
put aid instead of the savings and aid

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080
put aid instead of the savings and aid
 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.140
put aid instead of the savings and aid
should lead to investment and therefore

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150
should lead to investment and therefore
 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.780
should lead to investment and therefore
lead to growth what we have seen

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790
lead to growth what we have seen
 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.600
lead to growth what we have seen
actually is that that has not been the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610
actually is that that has not been the
 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.340
actually is that that has not been the
case the issue of of aid delivering

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350
case the issue of of aid delivering
 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.430
case the issue of of aid delivering
growth and reducing poverty has not

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440
growth and reducing poverty has not
 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.590
growth and reducing poverty has not
actually happened in reality if anything

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600
actually happened in reality if anything
 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.620
actually happened in reality if anything
we've seen growth rates go down across

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630
we've seen growth rates go down across
 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.979
we've seen growth rates go down across
Africa and poverty rate levels rise very

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989
Africa and poverty rate levels rise very
 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.710
Africa and poverty rate levels rise very
dramatically while at the same time Aid

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720
dramatically while at the same time Aid
 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.680
dramatically while at the same time Aid
has consistently risen over time in

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690
has consistently risen over time in
 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.920
has consistently risen over time in
Africa I should add here that one of the

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930
Africa I should add here that one of the
 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.930
Africa I should add here that one of the
fundamental problems with the aid model

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940
fundamental problems with the aid model
 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.990
fundamental problems with the aid model
is that we've tried many different

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000
is that we've tried many different
 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.730
is that we've tried many different
interventions so in the 1960s aid was

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.520
really work in alleviating poverty went
to the 1980s where we focused on aid for

00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:01.309
they themselves have a moral qualms to
 

00:20:01.309 --> 00:20:04.210
they themselves have a moral qualms to
actually do what's right what I mean by

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:04.220
actually do what's right what I mean by
 

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.169
actually do what's right what I mean by
that is it's all too easy if you are a

00:20:08.169 --> 00:20:08.179
that is it's all too easy if you are a
 

00:20:08.179 --> 00:20:10.930
that is it's all too easy if you are a
good leader to become bad and the bad

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:10.940
good leader to become bad and the bad
 

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.990
good leader to become bad and the bad
leader to become worse so there's a

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000
leader to become worse so there's a
 

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.269
leader to become worse so there's a
reason why African history is littered

00:20:16.269 --> 00:20:16.279
reason why African history is littered
 

00:20:16.279 --> 00:20:20.190
reason why African history is littered
with examples of despotic and tyrannical

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200
with examples of despotic and tyrannical
 

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.350
with examples of despotic and tyrannical
you know leaders across the continent

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360
you know leaders across the continent
 

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.240
you know leaders across the continent
who've stayed in power for many many

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:25.250
who've stayed in power for many many
 

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.879
who've stayed in power for many many
years and you know even in those

00:20:27.879 --> 00:20:27.889
years and you know even in those
 

00:20:27.889 --> 00:20:30.220
years and you know even in those
situations they have very clearly

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:30.230
situations they have very clearly
 

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.460
situations they have very clearly
continued to receive aid monies I wish I

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:33.470
continued to receive aid monies I wish I
 

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:34.869
continued to receive aid monies I wish I
could sit here and say actually this is

00:20:34.869 --> 00:20:34.879
could sit here and say actually this is
 

00:20:34.879 --> 00:20:37.299
could sit here and say actually this is
a figment of the past it's not there's

00:20:37.299 --> 00:20:37.309
a figment of the past it's not there's
 

00:20:37.309 --> 00:20:38.799
a figment of the past it's not there's
still many African leaders that are

00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:38.809
still many African leaders that are
 

00:20:38.809 --> 00:20:40.899
still many African leaders that are
still facing charges you know very

00:20:40.899 --> 00:20:40.909
still facing charges you know very
 

00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:43.180
still facing charges you know very
regularly most recently we were still

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:43.190
regularly most recently we were still
 

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.490
regularly most recently we were still
hearing of governments that are actually

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:45.500
hearing of governments that are actually
 

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.860
hearing of governments that are actually
being sued for stealing aid money so

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:47.870
being sued for stealing aid money so
 

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:49.419
being sued for stealing aid money so
this is not something from the past and

00:20:49.419 --> 00:20:49.429
this is not something from the past and
 

00:20:49.429 --> 00:20:51.700
this is not something from the past and
I think it's virtually impossible to

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:51.710
I think it's virtually impossible to
 

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.539
I think it's virtually impossible to
strip out the aspect of political

00:20:55.539 --> 00:20:55.549
strip out the aspect of political
 

00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:57.610
strip out the aspect of political
leadership from the aid model the the

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:57.620
leadership from the aid model the the
 

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.759
leadership from the aid model the the
notion of lack of accountability

00:20:59.759 --> 00:20:59.769
notion of lack of accountability
 

00:20:59.769 --> 00:21:01.810
notion of lack of accountability
immediately comes in when you've got an

immediately comes in when you've got an
 

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.260

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.120
 
I think there have been a number of

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:07.130
I think there have been a number of
 

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.160
I think there have been a number of
Africans the debate about aid to Africa

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:09.170
Africans the debate about aid to Africa
 

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.740
Africans the debate about aid to Africa
is going on every day across the

there's obviously scope for an alliance
 

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.680
there's obviously scope for an alliance
there whereas traditionally African

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:13.690

opportunity for African governments to
 

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.480
opportunity for African governments to

that is very interested in African
produce so that's I think that there'll

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000
produce so that's I think that there'll
 

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.070
produce so that's I think that there'll
be much it should be much more of that

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080
be much it should be much more of that
 

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.840
be much it should be much more of that
so much so that Africa can continue to

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:36.850
so much so that Africa can continue to
 

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:39.090
so much so that Africa can continue to
do a very strong solid developmental

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:39.100
do a very strong solid developmental
 

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.109
do a very strong solid developmental
path

00:27:42.109 --> 00:27:42.119
 
 

00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:44.689
 
um I think that there's a lot more scope

00:27:44.689 --> 00:27:44.699
um I think that there's a lot more scope
 

00:27:44.699 --> 00:27:46.489
um I think that there's a lot more scope
for it to be able to move the needle

00:27:46.489 --> 00:27:46.499
for it to be able to move the needle
 

00:27:46.499 --> 00:27:50.569
for it to be able to move the needle
towards a positive message if we start

00:27:50.569 --> 00:27:50.579
towards a positive message if we start
 

00:27:50.579 --> 00:27:53.359
towards a positive message if we start
to listen to different messengers I

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:53.369
to listen to different messengers I
 

00:27:53.369 --> 00:27:56.119
to listen to different messengers I
think the reason why it's negative is

00:27:56.119 --> 00:27:56.129
think the reason why it's negative is
 

00:27:56.129 --> 00:27:58.069
think the reason why it's negative is
that the traditional media tends to

00:27:58.069 --> 00:27:58.079
that the traditional media tends to
 

00:27:58.079 --> 00:28:00.859
that the traditional media tends to

as I said earlier over 60% of the

as I said earlier over 60% of the
 

00:29:07.169 --> 00:29:08.989
as I said earlier over 60% of the
population in Africa is under the age of

population in Africa is under the age of
 

00:29:08.999 --> 00:29:11.989
population in Africa is under the age of
24 so this is a very big it's very

00:29:11.989 --> 00:29:11.999
24 so this is a very big it's very
 

00:29:11.999 --> 00:29:15.229
24 so this is a very big it's very
important to get young Africans to

00:29:15.229 --> 00:29:15.239
important to get young Africans to
 

00:29:15.239 --> 00:29:16.549
important to get young Africans to
believe in themselves and have a

concerted effort to make that message

00:29:33.079 --> 00:29:33.089
concerted effort to make that message
 

00:29:33.089 --> 00:29:36.710
concerted effort to make that message
positive

I don't think you can say we can say

I don't think you can say we can say
 

00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:41.149
I don't think you can say we can say
that because it's important to

00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159
that because it's important to
 

00:29:41.159 --> 00:29:43.159
that because it's important to
understand the global linkages and

00:29:43.159 --> 00:29:43.169
understand the global linkages and
 

00:29:43.169 --> 00:29:46.279
understand the global linkages and
perhaps allowing Lehman Brothers to fail

perhaps allowing Lehman Brothers to fail
 

00:29:46.289 --> 00:29:49.909
perhaps allowing Lehman Brothers to fail
as an example of why you cannot make

00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919
as an example of why you cannot make
 

00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:52.940
as an example of why you cannot make
these decisions very quickly nor can you

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:52.950
these decisions very quickly nor can you
 

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:54.380
these decisions very quickly nor can you
make them very like in a very light

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:54.390
make them very like in a very light
 

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:58.850
make them very like in a very light

terms of size that could could really
dramatically affect or cause a collapse

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120
dramatically affect or cause a collapse

not be a good thing were there to be a

decision to to allow some hedge funds to

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720
decision to to allow some hedge funds to
 

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.330
decision to to allow some hedge funds to
fail for example or some investor to

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:17.340
fail for example or some investor to
 

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.340
fail for example or some investor to
fail so I actually don't think so I

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:19.350
fail so I actually don't think so I
 

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.930
fail so I actually don't think so I
think it's a much more it needs a much

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:20.940
think it's a much more it needs a much
 

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.970
think it's a much more it needs a much
more considered approach I know people

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:22.980
more considered approach I know people
 

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.190
more considered approach I know people
are very anxious and very keen to see

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200
are very anxious and very keen to see
 

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.860
are very anxious and very keen to see
decisions be made quickly but I think

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:27.870
decisions be made quickly but I think
 

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.510
decisions be made quickly but I think
it's really important to understand that

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520
it's really important to understand that
 

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.570
it's really important to understand that
we now also know that what can happen to

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.580
we now also know that what can happen to

we now also know that what can happen to

about to fail from the experience of
 

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.230
about to fail from the experience of
seeing Lehman Brothers fail so I

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240
seeing Lehman Brothers fail so I
 

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.840
seeing Lehman Brothers fail so I
actually think that you know we would

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:44.850
actually think that you know we would
 

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:46.580
actually think that you know we would
like to see more regulation we would

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:46.590
like to see more regulation we would
 

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.090
like to see more regulation we would
like to see some changes to the system

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:49.100
like to see some changes to the system
 

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.980
like to see some changes to the system
that from where it was in the past but I

that from where it was in the past but I
 

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.470

don't think that we should get too hung

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480
don't think that we should get too hung
