00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.130
Humans have attempted to harness the great
Mississippi River for nearly three centuries,

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:12.570
but just how successful have we been and are
we making things worse?

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.570
Hey Guys.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.570
Julia Here for DNews

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.699
As the world warms up and changes weather
worldwide, many places like the US and the

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.670
UK will see more severe storms and without
a doubt, more flooding.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.630
But climate change isn’t the only way humans
have made flooding worse.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.400
We’ve been doing that for years.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.420
Basically the best example comes from John
McPhee’s 1987 New Yorker article “Atchafalaya”

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.870
about the attempted control of the Mississippi
River.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.460
Basically it goes like this.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.430
The Mississippi always wants to find the shortest
and easiest path to the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.489
And every thousand years or so, it switches
paths or “jumps”.

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.410
And these can be BIG jumps, like anywhere
from Texas to Florida.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.360
For the past century or so, the river has
been itching to switch from its current course

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.739
to the Atchafalaya, which would essentially
cut off the entire current Delta and all of

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.079
New Orleans from the river.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.670
Which of course is not good for the loads
of people who live there and the commerce

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.000
that depends on it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.149
So the Army Corps of Engineers took on the
task to tame the river.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.479
They built Old River Control Structure to
limit the take of the Atchafalaya to 30%.

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.820
But rivers flood.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.619
That’s just what they do naturally.

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.229
Water evaporates from the ocean, lakes, rivers,
forms in the atmosphere and comes down as

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.909
precipitation, that’s basic.

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.920
And some years it doesn’t rain, it pours.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.659
And when that happens a river will leave its
banks and flood the surrounding areas.

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:21.899
This is natural and normal.

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.779
And sometimes happens every year like the
Nile River.

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:28.560
But ironically by building control structures,
like levees and dams, we’ve restricted the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.369
flow of the water, make it faster, stronger,
and more prone to flooding.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.090
Rivers do this naturally too, as the river
erodes its banks, sediment deposits on the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.009
bottom of the river, and constricts it.

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.600
Like putting your thumb over a hose nozzle,
it only increased the force of the river.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.329
To make matters worse, more water reaches
the rivers than ever before thanks to increased

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.189
construction over the past 50 years of things
like developments and parking lots, all these

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.700
flat surfaces drain straight to the river
rather than dissipating into riparian zones.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.049
This can lead to the perfect storm.. or flood.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.429
This combination lead to a disastrous (Catastrophic)
flood in 1973, that nearly destroyed Old River

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:03.429
Control.

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.079
After heavy snowfalls the previous two winters,
and more rain in the spring lead to the most

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.810
water in half a century to flow through the
river.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.730
Many cities along the river saw waters above
flood level for more than 50 days.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.280
In total the flood caused over 250 million
dollars worth of damage.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.659
A report published in the journal Science
concluded that the flood was man-made.

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.000
And warned that more river constricting and
levee building would only make problems worse.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.709
Since then two more floods rivaled and even
surpassed the 1973 flood.

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.819
The Great Mississippi flood of 1993 killed
50 people and caused 15 billion dollars worth

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:35.819
of damage.

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.959
It flooded 30,000 square miles and some places
were flooded for 6 months.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.109
A flood in 2011 put Old River Control to its
greatest test yet.

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.390
Thanks to heavy snow and rain the previous
winter, that summer the Mississippi Valley

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.920
was flooded for months.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.780
The breech of levees in Missouri, Arkansas,
Mississippi, and Tennessee forced thousands

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.780
to flee.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.359
And farmland was destroyed thanks to chemicals
released into the floodwaters.

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.640
So we haven’t exactly learned our lesson.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.640
What to do about it?

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.400
Well we certainly can’t move elsewhere.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.069
More people live in the Floodplains than ever
and relocation plans costs millions of dollars.

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.109
We could build more levees but the levees
that do exist haven’t been properly maintained

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.769
and really, they might wind up making things
worse.

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.590
Jeffrey Mount, director of the Center for
Watershed Sciences at the University of California,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.239
Davis, said that “The dark secret that no
one wants to share is that there are two kinds

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.690
of levees: those that have failed and those
that will fail”

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.469
Some suggest using floodplains as fertile
farmland, not cities.

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:32.999
And building strategic overflow system (or
“flowage easement”) into a levee.

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:37.030
That way they could be open more often and
water could flow onto farmland, and the government

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.480
would compensate the farmer for any losses.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.510
Some suggest using wetlands as natural buffers.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:56.010
Other plans include modern technology to better

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:20.609
understand flooding.
