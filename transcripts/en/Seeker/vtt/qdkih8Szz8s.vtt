00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.000
What’s the most environmentally friendly
country?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.620
Well depends on who you ask.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.740
And the answer might surprise you.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.320
Hey Everyone Julia here for DNews.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.180
Here in the US we like to think pretty highly
of ourselves.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.770
We like to think we’re the BEST AT EVERYTHING.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.640
Especially on a day like Earth Day.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.840
But we can’t seem to get it through our
skulls that we aren’t great at all the things.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.080
Especially when it comes to the environment.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.240
So where does the US Rank?

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.220
Who bested us?

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.660
According to the Organization for Economic
Co-Operation and Development’s Better Life

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.440
Index, the top honor goes to Sweden.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.780
Other top countries include Australia, the
United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Finland.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.930
Although this index only measures things like
air pollution and water quality, the things

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.180
that really affect a person on a daily basis.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.760
But according to Yale University’s Environmental
Performance Index, Switzerland takes the lead,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.840
followed by Luxembourg, Australia, Singapore,
and the Czech Republic.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.800
The EPI is more comprehensive.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.000
It measures things like environmental health,
air pollution and water quality, but it also

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.449
takes into account less tangible things like
the the health of the ecosystem.

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.969
Which includes protected habitat, fish stocks,
and energy use.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.670
How did Switzerland get ahead?

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.710
In recent years the country has designated
a lot of land as National Parks, which earned

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.749
it the top score for Terrestrial Protected
Areas.

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:22.080
And it gets over half of its energy through
hydroelectric power, the rest from Nuclear,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.240
so it’s got a very small carbon footprint.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.429
Luxembourg is a small country with only half
a million people and 1500 square miles.

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:29.429
(2500 square km).

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.439
But its robust water and sanitation networks
plus protection of 17% of land habitats earns

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.759
it the number two spot.

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.659
Australia comes in at number 3 with high marks
in health impact and water quality.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.060
The land down under also boosts solid scores
in both terrestrial and marine protected areas.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.219
How about the US?

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.530
Well according to the EPI The United States
is number thirty three, just above Malta but

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.710
below Belarus.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.429
While we excel at measures of health, like
air quality and sanitation, we suck, I mean

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.460
really really suck at other measurements.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.369
The US performs very poorly in measurements
of fisheries, with huge collapses of certain

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.369
fish stocks.

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.700
And the country still has some room to grow
in terms of climate and energy use.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.780
I know i know, most of you must be wondering,
where is Costa Rica?

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.600
The Small Central American country is well
known for its eco-tourism.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.810
According to the World Bank over 20% of the
land is designated as a protected area.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.940
Well they did reforest half their country
in just a few decades.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.890
And this year, they used 100% renewable energy
for 75 days.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.190
Yet, it placed 54th on the EPI listing.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.310
Its downfall seems to be its treatment or
lack thereof of wastewater.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.390
According to a UN report, just three percent
of the country’s urban sewage was treated

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.170
before being released back into the water.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.770
But all of this data is from 2014 so maybe
when the index is updated in 2016 things will

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.040
look a little different.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.480
Fortunately Toyota is pitching in to help
us become a greener nation!

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.010
The new Toyota Mirai is looking to the future
with sustainability in mind; fueled by hydrogen

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.320
and leaving zero emissions behind.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.670
Special thanks to our viewers Wesley Van Der
Burg, jean-francois prince, michael gutierrez,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.460
and a few others who asked this question in
the comments.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.230
And you wanna know more about the environment,
Trace tells us the truth about biodegradable

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.430
plastics in this video down here.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.830
Do you have any science questions you’d
like us to tackle?

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.870
Ask below and might just answer in a future
episode.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.900
