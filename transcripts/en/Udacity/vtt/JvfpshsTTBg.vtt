00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In TOR, to improve performance, instead of routing each packet using a new onion routing path,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
TOR sets up a circuit between two endpoints to allow further communications

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
to only require symmetric encryption operations.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And so the question is--what could go wrong?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And the options are--if the onion routers at the beginning and end of the circuit collude,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
they are able to identify the communicating endpoints by looking at the circuit identifiers.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If the onion routers at the beginning and end of the circuit collude, they may be able to identify

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the communicating endpoints by manipulating the timing of packets in a flow.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If an onion router in the middle of the circuit is malicious, it would be able to identify

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and disrupt Alice's traffic by identifying the symmetric keys used.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And the last option--an adversary who can cause arbitrary congestion on the network

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and who knows someone is sending a steady flow of packets to endpoint B,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
may be able to identify all the onion routers in the circuit.

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all that apply.
