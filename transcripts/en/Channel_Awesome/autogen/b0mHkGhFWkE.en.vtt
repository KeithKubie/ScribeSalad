what people from the 40s really you know
I<00:09:03.980><c> guess</c><00:09:04.730><c> no</c><00:09:05.210><c> I</c><00:09:05.240><c> mean</c><00:09:05.570><c> I</c><00:09:05.600><c> I</c><00:09:05.750><c> agree</c><00:09:06.200><c> with</c><00:09:06.590><c> that</c>

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:06.770 align:start position:0%
I guess no I mean I I agree with that
 

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.310 align:start position:0%
I guess no I mean I I agree with that
but<00:09:07.190><c> then</c><00:09:07.370><c> again</c><00:09:07.460><c> he's</c><00:09:07.730><c> also</c><00:09:07.910><c> dead</c><00:09:08.300><c> so</c><00:09:09.020><c> it's</c>

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
but then again he's also dead so it's
 

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
but then again he's also dead so it's
not<00:09:09.500><c> like</c><00:09:09.770><c> he's</c><00:09:09.950><c> continuing</c><00:09:10.700><c> on</c><00:09:10.850><c> doing</c><00:09:11.420><c> this</c>

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:13.330 align:start position:0%
not like he's continuing on doing this
 

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.940 align:start position:0%
not like he's continuing on doing this
so<00:09:14.330><c> I</c><00:09:14.450><c> guess</c><00:09:14.840><c> I'll</c><00:09:15.050><c> give</c><00:09:15.230><c> you</c><00:09:15.320><c> a</c><00:09:15.350><c> little</c><00:09:15.680><c> leeway</c>
