00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.460
 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.580
The great thing about living
in today's world is that we

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.240
get to live longer.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.565
Unfortunately, the downside is
that with older age comes a

00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:25.010
higher risk of age related
diseases, such as Alzheimer's,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.130
Parkinson's, heart diseases,
or cancer.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.700
 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.200
In order to understand human
health span, we need to get to

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.160
know more about biology
of ageing.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.300
There is no hiding it,
it's complicated.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.740
It has genetic components, it
has environmental components,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.630
and there is an extensive
interplay between the two.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.910
One part of the human genome
that has been shown to be

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.800
linked to longevity is part
of chromosome four.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.400
Because individual genes can
affect lifespan, we need a

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.350
simple model to study it.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.819
So what we use is a nematode
worm called C. elegans.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:14.860
 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.730
On this plate, there are
thousands of worms.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.610
They're really small, about a
millimetre long, which is why

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.560
we need to use the microscope
in order to study them.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.760
Their genetic makeup is really
similar to our own, so

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.830
studying genes in the worm that
control lifespan will

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.400
also tell us a lot about
our own lifespan.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.820
They live for about two
to three weeks.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.120
They're really easy to look
after, and we can also

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.100
manipulate their genes
very, very easily.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.600
 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.160
Even though they're so small,
we can tell the difference

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.640
between a young worm and an old
worm just by looking at

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.580
them down a microscope.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.990
On the left is a young worm,
and on the right is a much

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.350
older worm.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.630
The older worm can no longer
move around the plate

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.300
searching for food, and you
might be able to see it looks

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.066
a lot sicker.

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:04.150
As with humans, there is much
variation between individuals

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.470
in terms of how long they live,
which means when we

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.770
study ageing in a worm, we
need to look at a whole

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.130
population of worms rather
than just one or two

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.930
individuals.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.410
So you can ask, how do you
measure ageing in a

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.400
population of worms?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.610
What we do, we start with let's
say 100 worms, and we

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.660
put each and every single one
of them on a separate plate.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.070
And we check up on them every
single day until they die.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.630
So we need a way to assess
whether they stop moving

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.130
because they are dead, or
because they just don't want

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.340
to move anymore.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.960
So what we do we essentially
poke them with a stick.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.050
In our case it's a
platinum wire.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.660
And if they respond, that means
they're alive, if they

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.430
don't we count them as dead.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.220
So this way, we can
draw a graph.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.320
If we start, let's say, with 100
worms alive at day zero,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.695
we have to check every single
day how many worms have died.

00:03:01.695 --> 00:03:05.330
 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.950
We can draw a really nice
parallel to humans in here,

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.520
because just as us, worms can
live to different age.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.010
In our lab, we are particularly
interested in

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.690
genes that cause changes in
how long the worms live.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.930
If they live shorter,
the whole curve is

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.450
shifted to the left.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.810
And if they live longer,
the whole curve is

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.060
shifted to the right.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.440
 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.310
The aim of research in our lab
is to eventually develop drugs

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.990
that will influence the genetic
control of ageing, and

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.650
therefore delay or even prevent
many of the age

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.810
related diseases in humans.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.410
So in this way, we are using the
worm to reveal the secrets

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.805
of a long and healthy life.

00:03:43.805 --> 00:04:10.519
