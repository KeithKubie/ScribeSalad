00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.080
Let's say we have an endpoint at
/puppies that returns a collection of

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.600
puppies with their date of birth
in the format of month, date, and

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.400
year, like so.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.510
Later on, we realize that we can
also include the information of

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.580
the time of birth for each puppy.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.950
But we must change the format
of the date of birth like so.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.660
How do we add this feature
without causing problems for

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.060
users already using our endpoint?

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.720
Versioning allows you to make
new functionalities without

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.800
breaking features for
users still using older implementations.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.259
If your application renders webpages and

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.580
has API endpoints, specifying the API
in your URIs is also helpful for users.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.680
Another method of implementing
versioning is by including the version

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.040
number in your HTTP header.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.450
GitHub implements versioning this way.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.910
Whichever method you choose, versioning
is an important consideration for

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.650
your users as your application grows and
changes.
