STEVEN PINKER: Thank you.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.480
The invitation to
this conference

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.590
summarized its theme
in words that I

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.130
think that Helen wrote, "Pick up
any guide to effective writing

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.610
and what will you find?

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.510
Probably some version
of the same advice

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.030
that Strunk and White offered
in the 1950s," which I think

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.970
actually dates back to
the 19-teens from course

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.989
lectures from Professor Strunk.

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.030
"Engage your reader's
attention through examples,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.730
illustrations, and anecdotes.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.830
Use clear, precise language
to express complex ideas.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.730
Avoid obfuscating jargon.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.210
Favor active verbs
and concrete nouns.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.870
Write with conviction,
passion, and verve.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.000
Pick up a peer-reviewed
journal in just

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.350
about any academic discipline
and what will you find?

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.170
Impersonal, stodgy,
jargon-laden prose

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.810
that ignores or defies most,
if not all, of the principles

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.360
listed above."

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.380
Absolutely.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.390
And I'm going to follow the
implicit advice in that passage

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.470
by engaging my
listeners' attention

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.380
through some examples.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.870
To define the problem
that we are dealing with,

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.840
here are just a half
a dozen examples

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.900
that I have
collected from papers

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.280
of students and colleagues.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.450
All of us have read
passages like this.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.944
Some of us have written
passages like this.

00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:23.360
Quote, "Most
importantly, there is

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.020
a lot of variability in
this population regarding

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.600
the level of
linguistic difficulty

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.920
that is being
exhibited," which means

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.770
children differ a lot in
their language problems.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.800
"In fact, it is most likely
impossible to prove causality

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.950
between violence in media and
violent behavior in children,

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.980
and only a small
amount of correlation

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.980
has been shown through studies."

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.510
That is, it's
impossible to prove

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.360
that violence in the media
causes violence in children.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.630
The two are not even
strongly correlated.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.180
"Genetic influences are implied
when non-adoptive siblings who

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.240
share approximately 50%
of their segregating genes

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.480
are more similar than
adoptive siblings."

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.020
Translation, if
biological siblings who

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.810
share half their
variable genes are

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.290
more similar than
adoptive siblings who

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.120
share none of their variable
genes, then genes must matter.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.250
"Comprehension checks were
used as exclusion criteria."

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.570
Translation, we excluded
participants who

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.770
did not understand the task.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.870
Finally, "Gilbert,
et al, asked subjects

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.970
to learn a fictitious vocabulary
by reading assertions, e.g.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.340
A [? manishna ?] is an
armadillo, whose veracity

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.750
was either affirmed or denied
by the subsequent presentation

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.330
of an assessment word."

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.401
Which means that people
in this experiment

00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:42.400
looked at a computer
screen, the computer screen

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.600
said a [? manishna ?]
is an armadillo,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.970
it disappeared, and then
the word True or False

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.850
appeared on the screen.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.600
Now, by the way, the locution,
the subsequent presentation

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.390
of an assessment word
is a wonderful example

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.620
of what Helen has
dubbed a zombie noun.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.220
That is, a nominalization,
the conversion of a verb

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.570
to a noun that reifies
or thingifies a process,

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.710
and which we, academics,
are all too fond of.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.910
So the question is, why are
we so prone to passives,

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.330
abstractions, and zombie
nouns, all of these sins

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.920
that we point out over and over
again, but that so many of us

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.190
can't avoid using?

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.060
Now, the most common
explanation appeals to motives,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.490
to nefarious motives.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.820
That academics, and bureaucrats,
and legal scholars, and so on,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:41.200
want to affect an
impression of expertise,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.940
they want to sound
sophisticated and [INAUDIBLE],

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.320
and so they try to
bamboozle their readers

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.370
with highfalutin verbiage.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.840
And I think there's no
doubt that this happens,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.000
but I don't think that it is the
principal explanation for why

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.020
so much academic writing stinks.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.930
For one thing, I
think it's just not

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.260
all that plausible for
so many mediocre writers.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.290
These are perfectly
unpretentious, ordinary people.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.910
You can have a beer with them.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.720
And I think it's probably
unfair to accuse them

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.210
of trying to impress others.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.320
Also, it gets us off the hook.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.269
It's like, it makes it too
easy for us to say, well,

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.070
I wouldn't just try to
use opaque language just

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.650
to impress.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.220
I'm a regular person.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.380
And it makes it easy to
overlook the mental habits that

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.220
lead us, for completely innocent
reasons, to write so poorly.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.780
I think a more complete
explanation would appeal

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.240
to a mismatch between
ordinary thinking and speaking

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.070
and what we have
to do as academics.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.910
And I'll illustrate this
with three principles, which

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.960
I call your inner primate,
the curse of knowledge,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.640
and the difference between
naive realism and postmodernist

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.760
self-consciousness.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.120
So let me go through
each one of them.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.540
To begin with, we are primates.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.510
This is a zoological
fact, but it is also

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.300
an important principle to
remember as we compose writing.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.070
Our minds did not
evolve to think thoughts

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:21.730
about sociology or literary
analysis or cosmology.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.390
Our minds evolved to
deal with-- to understand

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.830
the world through vision,
through space, through force,

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.810
through motion.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.050
Things get pushed.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.860
They go clunk.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.900
They move from one
place to another.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.530
Everything else is a
learned abstraction.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.470
Now, we are-- the mind
is capable of making

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.420
those abstractions, but it
requires a particular history,

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.070
which we can see, we
can reverse engineer,

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.580
through the ubiquitous
metaphors in our language.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.990
We say, inflation rose in July.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.590
What exactly do we see
or experience or feel

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.470
when we use that sentence?

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.750
Well, it's highly abstract.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.230
We all understand it, thanks
to two concrete metaphors,

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.700
inflation, increase in size,
and rise, change in position.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.060
These distributions
have thick tails.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.670
That is a way of describing
a mathematical property

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.190
of a power-law distribution.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.850
To distribute, of
course, is to scatter,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.660
to put in numerous places.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.430
A tail is a concrete object.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.220
They can be thick or thin.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.360
Ethnic tensions are flaring up.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.210
Again, you could
walk down the street

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.320
and never actually
see an ethnic tension,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.740
let alone it flaring up,
but we understand that,

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.860
because we have the metaphor
of tension, of, say,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.560
two people pulling on a
rope, and another metaphor

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.260
of something that is cool
suddenly bursting into flame.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.780
And by the way, notice
that each one of these

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.840
has a mixed metaphor, which
shows that although there were

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.600
historical origins in
these locutions in terms

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.490
of concrete experience, we have
packaged them so well that we

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.210
forget what the original
metaphor is, allowing

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.050
us to mix our metaphors.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.800
So this is an encapsulation
of what we do as,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.200
not just as academics, but
as thinkers, as citizens,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.770
as people who read
Newsweek magazine.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.220
We take a concrete
event, so ethnic tension

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.100
might be the Irish
kid throws a rock

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.620
at the window of
the Italian store,

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.840
but then we take that
event and hundreds like it,

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.560
and we package it into
a single cognitive

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.650
unit-- cognitive psychologists
call this process, chunking--

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.430
and then we build more complex
chunks out of assemblies

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.222
of simpler chunks.

00:07:44.222 --> 00:07:47.550
We abstract away from
the concrete particulars,

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:53.390
so that a rise in
emotion can be analogized

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.760
to arise in a physical flame.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.500
And then we pick a noun
and we label the chunk.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.010
We do this so often,
we don't realize

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:07.430
how much of our vocabulary
consists of applying nouns

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.340
to highly abstract ideas,
which, fortunately, we can then

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:11.840
manipulate.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.190
We can feed them into
still more abstract ideas

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.350
with things like causality,
variability, difficulty,

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.630
genetic influences,
comprehension checks, exclusion

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.370
criteria, criteria, presentation
of an assessment word.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.372
Each one of those
particular expert

00:08:28.372 --> 00:08:30.830
in a discipline or, for that
matter, even a literate adult,

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.700
has already mastered
as a simple unit

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.929
in their mental vocabulary.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.659
Now, the power from
that comes from the fact

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:43.539
that you don't have to
work backwards every time

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.760
and remind yourself
of what exactly

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.620
has to take place in
the world for something

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.870
to count as an ethnic tension.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:57.890
The problem is that this leads
to the opposite of ideal prose,

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:01.020
particularly when your
reader or your listener

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.740
may not have packaged a
complicated series of events

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.710
into the same chunks.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.940
You might use a chunk that
is overlearned, perfectly

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.430
clear to you, but if someone
else hasn't recapitulated

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.810
the process of packaging
their experience

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.260
into that abstraction,
they, in the worst case,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.470
may have no idea what
you're talking about,

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.340
in the best case, be expending
so much cognitive effort

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.070
to reconstruct what
went into that chunk,

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.620
they have little left
over to understand

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.060
the rest of the passage.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.770
This brings me to
the second principle

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.500
for why academic prose
is so systematically bad

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.520
and it is another psychological
phenomenon sometimes called

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.150
the curse of knowledge.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.200
That is, it is very
difficult to imagine

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.155
what it's like not to know
something that you do know.

00:09:54.155 --> 00:09:56.530
Now, the curse of knowledge
was actually first discovered

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:01.240
in children, where it goes
by the name of, sometimes,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.220
deficient theory of mind or
difficulty in mentalizing.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.240
That is, in knowing about
someone else's mental state,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.880
acting as an intuitive
psychologist or a folk

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.510
psychologist and trying to
figure out what's going on

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.270
in someone else's minds.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.660
Children are bad at that when
the content of someone else's

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.630
mind differs from the
content of their own mind.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.530
Classic experiment.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.730
You show children
a box of M&amp;M's.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.700
They open it up.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.090
There are pencils inside.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.580
The child is surprised.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.210
You say, well, Jason is
going to come into the room.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.910
What does he think
is in the box?

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.920
And the child will say, pencils.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.350
Now, Jason, of
course, had no way

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:44.910
of knowing that the M&amp;M
box has pencils in it.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.060
The child, himself or herself,
didn't know until a minute ago

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.270
that the box had pencils
instead of M&amp;M's.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.910
But the child, now
knowing it, can't

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.160
imagine that someone
else doesn't know it,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.160
even if they had no way
of figuring that out.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.130
Now, we can't get too
smug, because we adults

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:06.170
are prone to exactly
the same shortcoming.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.960
We're apt to forget that our own
chunks, our own abstractions,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.890
which we laboriously learned in
our intellectual autobiography,

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.030
not everyone else
may have learned.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:21.910
There's an old joke about
the joke tellers convention.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.420
Stop me if you've heard this.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.440
But a comedian
invites a friend along

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.810
to the annual
convention of comedians

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:32.280
and sits in the audience,
anticipating an evening

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.900
of rip-roaring hilarity.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.700
And what happens is that each
comedian gets on the stage

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.550
and says, 347.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.190
Uproarious laughter.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.520
Then someone else
gets up and says, 212.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.330
Everyone giggles hysterically.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.080
Friend says to the
comedian, what is this?

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.100
This doesn't seem funny.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.225
And he says, well, you see,
we've heard these jokes

00:11:52.225 --> 00:11:56.960
so many times that we save the
trouble of actually telling

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.460
the joke by just referring
to them by their number.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.517
And so the punchline actually
is not relevant to my point.

00:12:03.517 --> 00:12:05.350
But anyway, the friend
goes up and he tries.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.650
And he goes up and he says, 417.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.790
Silence.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.190
512.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.690
Nothing.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.645
He sort of slinks
off in humiliation.

00:12:14.645 --> 00:12:16.020
He said, I was dying up there.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:16.620
What happened?

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.810
And the friend says, well, it's
all in the way you tell it.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.560
Now, that isn't the
point of the anecdote.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.190
The point is that all of us
are a bit like the comedians

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.620
at the comedian convention.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.720
That is, we refer to
things by abbreviations,

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.950
forgetting that other people
have not learned them.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.450
Finally, there's a third
reason for bad academic prose

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.200
and that is that
there's a mismatch

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.790
between the optimal mental model
of prose communication, what

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.480
you ought to have in
mind as you communicate,

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.340
and what we actually
do as academics.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.740
Writing is a highly
unnatural human activity

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.020
and academic writing is
more unnatural still.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.220
There is an unknown audience.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.910
They are distant
in time and space.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.020
Talking about things
that none of us

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.530
have experienced in common.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.150
And I think the
problem is all the more

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:11.630
acute for graduate students,
who I-- people often ask me,

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.570
you must see a lot
of awful writing

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.090
among your undergraduates.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.010
And the answer is, no.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.150
The answer is that the
truly horrendous writing

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.570
comes from graduate students.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.170
The reason being, I think,
that they are suddenly

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:27.280
immersed in this world in
which everyone knows so much.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.340
Everyone seems to
know everything

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.630
and so you just
don't know who you're

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.590
informing of what, since
everyone just seems

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.260
so knowledgeable except you.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.520
And it's very hard to
gauge, and in fact,

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:45.170
easy to overestimate how much
knowledge your reader has.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:52.860
But just getting back to the
third reason for the awfulness

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:53.705
of academic prose.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.170
Given this inherent difficulty
that you're not really

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:03.220
engaging in any natural
form of communication,

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.350
you have to have a model,
a fictitious model,

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.030
of how you should be
pretending to communicate.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.630
And my favorite model of this
comes from a wonderful book

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:16.690
by Mark Turner and Francis-Noel
Thomas called Clear and Simple

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.340
as the Truth,
which outlines what

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:23.110
they call classic style,
a tacit model of the prose

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:29.450
communication process that
they recommend as an ideal.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:33.230
The model, that is, the
fictitious, pretend kind

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.140
of communication that you
aspire to in this style

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.860
is joint attention.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.820
That is, the writer
orients the reader

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.390
to something in the world
which the reader can

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.220
see with his or her own eyes.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.600
The goal is to help
the reader see reality.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.590
The style is conversation.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:15:01.020
The classic style model has
in it a number of assumptions.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.280
The assumptions are
that truth can be known.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.780
That prose is a window into
an objectively existing world.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.180
That the thought can stand
alone and precedes the word.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.590
Writing is not thinking.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.300
That thoughts are
concrete images.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.780
An agent applies
force to an object,

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.180
an object moves or stays put.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.340
In that sense, classic prose
is the opposite of anything

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.230
that is relativist, ironic,
romantic, post-modern,

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.980
or self-conscious.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.900
It's a model of communication
that is realist, indeed,

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.040
naive realist.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.980
There is an external world.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.230
Anyone can see it.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.610
The purpose of
prose communication

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.520
is to get someone
else to see something

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.680
that is objectively out there.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:51.470
Now, this is highly congenial
to the worldview of a scientist

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:56.860
and it is pretty much the worst
nightmare to a post-modernist.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.270
And this might even help
explain why, I think,

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:03.610
so much of the clearest
prose from academics

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.820
is often from
science popularizers.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.430
I know Helen did a survey
of academic journals.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.290
I don't think science
came out so well.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:17.020
But I think our clearest
prose stylists nowadays

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.920
are people like Richard
Dawkins and Brian

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.579
Greene, who try to convey
science to the public.

00:16:22.579 --> 00:16:24.620
And I think there's a
systematic reason for that.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.110
Namely, the mental
model of the scientist

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:32.090
is pretty close to the ideal
model for good prose, at least

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.452
according to the theory
of Turner and Thomas.

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:35.910
So let me just give
you an example.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.950
Again, always illustrate
your abstract ideas

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.090
with concrete examples.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.980
This is from an article by
the cosmologist Brian Greene

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.320
and I'll just read it to you.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.960
"In 1915, Einstein
published the general theory

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.610
of relativity, which was the
culmination of a 10-year search

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.760
to understand the
force of gravity.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.300
The theory was a marvel
of mathematical beauty,

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.550
providing equations that
could explain everything

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.820
from the motion of planets to
the trajectory of starlight

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.890
with stupendous accuracy.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.500
Within a few short years,
additional mathematical

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.839
analyses concluded that
space itself is expanding,

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:14.150
dragging each galaxy
away from every other.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.550
Though Einstein
at first strongly

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.339
resisted the startling
implication of his own theory,

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.349
observations of
deep space made by

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:23.540
the great American astronomer
Edwin Hubble in 1929

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.690
confirmed it.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.410
And before long,
scientists reasoned

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.850
that if space is now expanding,
then at ever earlier times,

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.020
the universe must
have been smaller.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.090
At some moment in the
distant past, everything

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.410
we now see, the
ingredients responsible

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:40.790
for every planet, every star,
every galaxy, even space

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.870
itself, must have
been compressed

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:46.290
to an infinitesimal speck
that then swelled outward,

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.220
evolving into the
universe as we know it.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.450
The Big Bang Theory was born.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:52.880
During the decades
that followed,

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.730
the theory would receive
overwhelming observational

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:56.720
support.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.320
Yet scientists were aware that
the Big Bang Theory suffered

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.020
from a significant shortcoming.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.690
Of all things, it
leaves out the bang.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.670
Einstein's equations
do a wonderful job

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.290
of describing how the universe
evolved from a split second

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.370
after the bang,
but the equations

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.140
break down, similar to
the error message returned

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.210
by a calculator when
you try to divide 1

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.960
by 0, when applied to
the extreme environment

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.990
of the universe's
earliest moment.

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:22.030
The Big Bang thus
provides no insight

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.840
into what might have
powered the bang itself."

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.640
Now, this is not fancy prose.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.750
It's not poetic.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.150
It's not inspiring.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.990
But it is quite
astonishing in conveying

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:34.440
highly abstract
ideas, nothing less

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.160
than the history
of the universe,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.730
and the history of the last 50
years of theoretical cosmology,

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.470
what the problem with
the theory is now

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.410
that scientists are
attempting to deal with,

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:52.470
in utterly transparent prose.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.060
Now, despite that
built-in advantage

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.270
that I think science
has, even scientists

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.110
have to be a bit post-modern.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:06.370
That is, when you do
science-- although notice

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:12.630
how Greene conveyed the history
of cosmology in classic style.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.250
There was a great
deal of confidence

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.290
in the way he described things.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.450
There was very little
hedging or uncertainty.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.949
And you really
feel, when you read

00:19:21.949 --> 00:19:24.490
that prose, like you're standing
next to him and he's saying,

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.090
look at that, look at that,
look at that, look at that.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.150
Now, of course, this
is entirely fictitious,

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.010
because even the most
realist scientist

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.380
has something in common
with a post-modernist.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.670
Namely, convictions such as,
it's hard to know the truth.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.420
The world doesn't just
reveal itself to us.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.020
None of us is objective.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.600
Objectivity, in
fact, is elusive.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.910
We understand the world
through our own theories

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.230
and constructs.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.460
They are not just pictures
or images, but sets

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.580
of verbal propositions.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.620
And our ways of trying
to understand the world

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.280
must be constantly
scrutinized, examined,

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.970
and purged of error and bias.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:06.570
Now, these precepts are what
any scholar has to always

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:11.070
have in mind, but even
though they are the reality,

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:15.430
they are all poisonous
to clear prose style.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.810
That is, many sins
of academic writing

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.800
are actually
accurate reflections

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.220
of this self-conscious,
ironic, meta aware,

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.416
post-modernist stance
that even the most realist

00:20:27.416 --> 00:20:30.580
scientist has to live with.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.650
And I'll just give
you-- again, I'm

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:36.070
going to follow Helen's
advice, and all of our advice,

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.550
and I'm going to be
concrete by what I mean.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.510
So for example, what makes
academic prose so turgid?

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.970
Well, one part is,
one ingredient,

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:48.540
is the focus on the activity
of studying something,

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:52.900
of the writer's job or clique or
peer group or daily activities,

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.900
as opposed to the
thing in the world

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.260
that you are writing about.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.950
I'll give you an example
from my own field.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:04.020
Paper-- that all too
familiar opening.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.261
"In recent years, an increasing
number of researchers

00:21:06.261 --> 00:21:08.760
have turned their attention to
the problem of child language

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.050
acquisition.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.290
In this article, recent
theories of this process

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:13.170
will be reviewed."

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:14.660
We've all heard
that, but notice it

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:19.470
has nothing to do with the
actual phenomenon of interest.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:23.820
It's all about what the people
who study child language do.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.530
A much better
beginning would be,

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.970
"All children acquire the
ability to speak and understand

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:28.900
a language.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.620
How do they
accomplish this feat?"

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.390
A second sin of
academic writing,

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.800
and again, this comes from the
necessary self-consciousness

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.080
of a scholar, but again, is
poisonous to clear prose,

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.300
is metadiscourse, writing
about the writing.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.110
My first book for
Harvard University Press,

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.030
I had a copy editor
who warned me

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:54.920
about the academician's habit
of metadiscourse and excessive

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.810
signposting.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.520
We tend to mistakenly think
that to help orient the reader,

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.580
we keep having to place
signposts, telling

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.850
the reader what we're going
to do, what we just did,

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.350
what we're going to
do next, such as,

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.860
and again, this ought
to sound familiar.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.120
"We have just reviewed
structuralist theories.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.900
Next, it will be
necessary to summarize

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.290
functionalist theories.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:18.790
But first, constructionist
theories must be discussed."

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.080
The problem being
that the reader

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.530
has to expend so much effort
understanding the signposting

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:30.160
that they have totally lost
track of the actual narrative.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.810
Yet another problem is
excessive apologizing.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:36.340
"The problem of
language acquisition

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.050
is extremely complex.

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.180
It is difficult to give
precise definitions

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.090
of the concept of language
and the concept of acquisition

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.100
and the concept of children.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.280
There is much uncertainty
about the interpretation

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.290
of experimental data and a great
deal of controversy surrounding

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.230
the theories.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.450
More research needs to be done."

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.510
Sound familiar?

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.110
And finally, compulsive hedging.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.106
Somewhat, fairly, nearly,
almost, partially, relatively,

00:23:01.106 --> 00:23:02.980
comparatively, predominately,
to some extent,

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.580
to a certain degree.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:09.470
And for me, what crystallized
this bad habit was

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.490
an anecdote where a
fellow academic pulled out

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:15.240
a photograph of her
four-year-old daughter

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.050
and she said, "We
virtually adore her."

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.630
Now, this shows that the
academic's habit of hedging

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.570
has gone too far.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.530
Well, the question--
I think that one

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:31.680
of the main challenges in
stylish academic writing

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.660
is how do we resolve
the inherent discrepancy

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:39.725
between the demands of clear
prose, which basically invoke

00:23:39.725 --> 00:23:43.270
an implicit theory of
naive realism-- the truth

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.890
is out there, it's objective,
all you have to do is look

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.800
and you'll see it
with your own eyes--

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.020
and the demands of reflective
scholarship-- objectivity

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.750
is elusive, we understand the
world through our theories,

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.120
and so on.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.880
And these are not, in
fact, contradictory.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.230
Because you don't
have to believe

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:05.880
that all the canons of classic
prose are literally true,

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.840
that the truth can be
known and so on, but rather

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.020
the art is to write
as if they are true

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.220
and to count on
the reader to fill

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:18.530
in the missing hedges,
apologies, qualifications,

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.860
self-conscious
remarks, and so on.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.260
That is, you can
pretty much take

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.250
for granted that anyone who is
reading your academic article

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.614
knows that what
you're writing about

00:24:28.614 --> 00:24:31.030
probably has some controversy,
otherwise you wouldn't have

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:36.680
anything to say, knows that it's
difficult to draw conclusions

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.417
from data.

00:24:37.417 --> 00:24:38.750
That's kind of the ground rules.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.760
You don't have to state
it in every sentence.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:47.710
And in fact, human
language is only possible

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.610
because the reader
or the listener

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:55.370
naturally fills in
the lines, connects

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:59.580
the propositions, a
process sometimes called

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.380
conversational implicature.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:06.510
That's a fancy jargon word
for reading between the lines,

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.370
for supplying what
was not explicitly

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:13.170
stated using common sense
and shared expectations

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.100
to fill in what was not
stated in so many words.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:21.960
My favorite example comes
from the little bit of poetry

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:26.600
on the shampoo bottle, wet
hair, lather, rinse, repeat.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.710
Now, when you read
those instructions,

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.330
you naturally know
that you don't

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.500
have to try to wet your
hair when you repeat it,

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.020
because your hair's already wet.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.865
And the author of those words
didn't actually state, oh,

00:25:38.865 --> 00:25:40.332
the first time, wet your hair.

00:25:40.332 --> 00:25:41.790
The second time,
you don't have to.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.140
You know that.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.080
And also, when it
says repeat, you

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.252
know that means repeat once.

00:25:46.252 --> 00:25:47.710
You don't go into
an infinite loop,

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.080
repeat over and over again.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.862
But if an academic had
written those words.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:01.740
So just to summarize, the
sins of academic writing,

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.020
as Helen so expertly
pointed out,

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.920
include zombie nouns, that
is, abstract nominalizations,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.920
excessive abstraction in
general, passive constructions,

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.920
hedging, apologizing,
excessive signposting.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.940
The reasons that these
sins are so tempting

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:22.980
are not just the attempt to
affect expertise, but also

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.950
because of an inherent
mismatch between the demands

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:31.070
of clear prose and the
activities of scholarship.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.100
Namely, the human mind
is inherently concrete

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:39.200
and abstraction requires a
laborious process of chunking,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.940
which a reader may
not have replicated,

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.440
that the curse of
knowledge makes

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.820
us forget our own history
of abstract chunking,

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:50.140
and that the mental model
underlying clear prose

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.830
communication, a kind of naive
realism or joint attention,

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:57.220
are incompatible with the actual
demands of scholarship, which

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:01.690
depends on a certain degree of
self-consciousness, skepticism,

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:03.040
and irony.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.390
Thanks very much.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:05.940
[APPLAUSE]
