00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.992
Arcane books of forbidden lore,

00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:11.311
disturbing secrets in 
the family bloodline,

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:15.431
and terrors so unspeakable the very 
thought of them might drive you mad.

00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:19.973
By now, these have become standard 
elements in many modern horror stories.

00:00:19.973 --> 00:00:23.213
But they were largely popularized 
by a single author–

00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:25.334
one whose name has become an adjective

00:00:25.334 --> 00:00:28.708
for the particular type of 
terror he inspired.

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:31.508
Born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890,

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:35.444
Howard Phillips Lovecraft grew up 
admiring the Gothic horror stories

00:00:35.444 --> 00:00:38.668
written by Edgar Allan Poe 
and Robert Chambers.

00:00:38.668 --> 00:00:41.401
But by the time he began writing in 1917,

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:45.044
World War I had cast a long 
shadow over the arts.

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:47.075
People had seen real horrors,

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:50.342
and were no longer frightened 
of fantastical folklore.

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:53.077
Lovecraft sought to invent a 
new kind of terror,

00:00:53.077 --> 00:00:57.075
one that responded to the rapid 
scientific progress of his era.

00:00:57.075 --> 00:01:01.633
His stories often used scientific elements
to lend eerie plausibility.

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:03.021
In "The Colour out of Space,"

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.679
a strange meteorite falls near 
a farmhouse,

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:09.078
mutating the farm into a 
nightmarish hellscape.

00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:12.825
Others incorporated scientific 
methodology into their form.

00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:17.239
"At the Mountains of Madness" is written 
as a report of an Antarctic expedition

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:20.289
that unearths things better 
left undiscovered.

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.695
In others, mathematics themselves 
become a source of horror,

00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:26.187
as impossible geometric configurations

00:01:26.187 --> 00:01:29.396
wreak havoc on the minds of 
any who behold them.

00:01:29.396 --> 00:01:32.910
Like then-recent discoveries of 
subatomic particles or X-rays,

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.515
the forces in Lovecraft’s fiction 
were powerful,

00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:38.638
yet often invisible and indescribable.

00:01:38.638 --> 00:01:43.263
Rather than recognizable monsters,
graphic violence, or startling shocks,

00:01:43.263 --> 00:01:47.827
the terror of “Lovecraftian” horror lies 
in what’s not directly portrayed–

00:01:47.827 --> 00:01:51.780
but left instead to the dark depths 
of our imagination.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.399
Lovecraft’s dozens of short stories, 
novellas, and poems

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.051
often take place in the same 
fictional continuity,

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.583
with recurring characters, locations, 
and mythologies.

00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:02.564
At first glance,

00:02:02.564 --> 00:02:06.245
they appear to be set within Lovecraft’s 
contemporary New England.

00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:10.513
But beneath the surface of this seemingly 
similar reality lie dark masters,

00:02:10.513 --> 00:02:13.774
for whom Earth’s inhabitants 
are mere playthings.

00:02:13.774 --> 00:02:16.883
More like primordial forces 
than mere deities,

00:02:16.883 --> 00:02:21.032
Lovecraft’s Great Old Ones lurk at 
the corners of our reality.

00:02:21.032 --> 00:02:22.867
Beings such as Yog-Sothoth,

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:25.725
“who froths as primal slime 
in nuclear chaos

00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:28.506
beyond the nethermost outposts 
of space and time.”

00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:31.064
Or the blind, idiot god Azathoth,

00:02:31.064 --> 00:02:33.721
whose destructive impulses are 
stalled only by

00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:35.851
the “maddening beating of vile drums

00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:39.157
and the thin monotonous whine 
of accursed flutes.”

00:02:39.157 --> 00:02:42.211
These beings exist beyond our 
conceptions of reality,

00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:45.173
their true forms as inscrutable 
as their motives.

00:02:45.173 --> 00:02:46.759
Lovecraft’s protagonists–

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:50.095
often researchers, anthropologists, 
or antiquarians–

00:02:50.095 --> 00:02:52.440
stumble onto hints of their existence.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.996
But even these indirect glimpses are 
enough to drive them insane.

00:02:55.996 --> 00:02:57.298
And if they survive,

00:02:57.298 --> 00:03:01.579
the reader is left with no feeling of 
triumph, only cosmic indifference–

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.599
the terrible sense that we are 
but insignificant specks

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.420
at the mercy of unfathomable forces.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.808
But perhaps the greatest power 
these creatures had

00:03:09.808 --> 00:03:12.483
was their appeal to Lovecraft’s 
contemporaries.

00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:13.880
During his lifetime,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.159
Lovecraft corresponded 
with other writers,

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.105
encouraging them to employ elements and 
characters from his stories in their own.

00:03:21.105 --> 00:03:24.574
References to Lovecraftian gods 
or arcane tomes

00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:26.870
can be found in many stories 
by his pen pals,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.144
such as Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch.

00:03:30.144 --> 00:03:33.874
Today, this shared universe is called 
the Cthulhu Mythos,

00:03:33.874 --> 00:03:38.216
named after Lovecraft’s infamous blend 
of dragon and octopus.

00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:39.267
Unfortunately,

00:03:39.267 --> 00:03:42.392
Lovecraft’s fear of the unknown found 
a less savory expression

00:03:42.392 --> 00:03:44.006
in his personal views.

00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:46.099
The author held strong racist views,

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.763
and some of his works include 
crude stereotypes and slurs.

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:53.471
But the rich world he created would 
outlive his personal prejudices.

00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:55.127
And after Lovecraft’s death,

00:03:55.127 --> 00:03:58.883
the Cthulhu Mythos was adopted 
by a wide variety of authors,

00:03:58.883 --> 00:04:01.543
often reimagining them from 
diverse perspectives

00:04:01.543 --> 00:04:04.335
that transcend the author’s prejudices.

00:04:04.335 --> 00:04:06.171
Despite his literary legacy,

00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:09.215
Lovecraft was never able to 
find financial success.

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:13.041
He died unknown and penniless 
at the age of 46–

00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:16.044
a victim of the universe’s cosmic 
indifference.

00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:19.271
But his work has inspired numerous 
short stories, novels,

00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:21.912
tabletop games, and cultural icons.

00:04:21.912 --> 00:04:25.559
And as long as humans feel a sense of 
dread about our unknown future,

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:30.249
Lovecraftian horror will have a place in 
the darkest corners of our imagination.
