00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
Now let's do Part b).

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.866
Find the average velocity of the particle for the time period between time 0 and time 6.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.466
So the easy way to think about this, average velocity, is that your

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
average, or one way to think about it, the distance that you

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
travel, sometimes I use "d" for distance or "s" for displacement

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
But your distance in general is equal to your average

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
velocity times time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
Or, your average velocity is equal to the distance

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
you travel, divided by time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
And so how do we figure out the distance that we travel

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.133
over that period?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
Especially because they didn't explicitly give us

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
the position function.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Well if you think about it,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
Let's think about the velocity function over here

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
which they did give us,"v(t)"

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
and I don't know exactly what it looks like,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
let me just draw a general velocity function right over here

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
So this is our t-axis,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
and this is our velocity axis right over here

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
and we care about between time 0 and time 6,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.466
and let's say our function does something like this,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
it doesn't really matter, this is just a general drawing

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
over here, How do we figure out the total

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
distance over that time?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
Well, if you take any small time,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
right over here,and you multiply it

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
times roughly the constant velocity over that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
time period, then that will tell you the area of

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
this little column, which will tell you

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
approximately, the distance traveled

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
over this very small interval of time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
Because you have time times an approximately

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
constant velocity, which will give you a

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
distance.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
And so in general if you take the area

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
under this curve, from 0 to 6,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
that will give you the total distance

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
travelled.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
So "d" is equal to the definite integral

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
from 0 to 6 of "v(t)"

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
of this thing right over here,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
"v(t)dt"

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
So if you want the average velocity,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
you just find the distance, which is

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
this definite integral, and then

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
you divide that by the time, or the

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
elapsed time, in this case,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
I could actually write times delta t

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
right over here, our change in time

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
right over here, is going to be 6

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
we start at 0 and we finish at 6, so we

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
just have to evaluate this

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
definite integral, which is not that easy to evaluate

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
analytically, it's lucky for us that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
they do allow us to use calculators in this part

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
so we'll evaluate it using a calculator

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
And then we just have to divide it by 6

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
So let's first find out teh distance

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
travelled between time 0 and time 6.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
And to do that,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
we can use the TI-85

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
We'll go to catalog,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
this tells us all of the different

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
functions they have.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
And to evaluate definite integrals, we use the
