very simple it it almost looks like the
lines are drawn by crabs but like you

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:39.790
lines are drawn by crabs but like you
 

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.030
lines are drawn by crabs but like you
know yeah yeah yeah like it actually

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040
know yeah yeah yeah like it actually
 

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.480
know yeah yeah yeah like it actually
kind of works and but they kind of keep

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:45.490
kind of works and but they kind of keep
 

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.010
kind of works and but they kind of keep
going back and forth so I like that it's

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:47.020
going back and forth so I like that it's
 

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.420
going back and forth so I like that it's
like some parts it looks like the lines

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:48.430
like some parts it looks like the lines
 

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.699
like some parts it looks like the lines
are kranj other times they're very well

00:11:50.699 --> 00:11:50.709
are kranj other times they're very well
 

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:53.340
are kranj other times they're very well
shaded and they blend in very nicely so

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:53.350
shaded and they blend in very nicely so
 

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.319
shaded and they blend in very nicely so
it's sort of a nice variety in there too

00:11:55.319 --> 00:11:55.329
it's sort of a nice variety in there too
 

00:11:55.329 --> 00:11:57.780
it's sort of a nice variety in there too
yeah which I like um I think that's what

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:57.790
yeah which I like um I think that's what
 

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.750
yeah which I like um I think that's what
it has going for it for me particularly

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:00.760
it has going for it for me particularly
 

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.260
it has going for it for me particularly
is that I can almost forgive the lack of

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:04.270
is that I can almost forgive the lack of
 

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.990
is that I can almost forgive the lack of
story and honestly it's probably one of

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000
story and honestly it's probably one of
 

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.790
story and honestly it's probably one of
the most pointless episodes there are

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800
the most pointless episodes there are
 

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.910
the most pointless episodes there are
yeah but you know obviously you probably

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920
yeah but you know obviously you probably
 

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.560
yeah but you know obviously you probably
even more than glitches a glance really

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:13.570
even more than glitches a glance really
 

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.380
even more than glitches a glance really
yeah actually I have to say glitch is a

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:16.390
yeah actually I have to say glitch is a
 

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.190
yeah actually I have to say glitch is a
glitch for me visually was was uh I mean

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:20.200
glitch for me visually was was uh I mean
 

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.530
glitch for me visually was was uh I mean
horrendous it was how I just for

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:22.540
horrendous it was how I just for
 

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.540
horrendous it was how I just for
whatever reason it assaulted my sense of

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:24.550
whatever reason it assaulted my sense of
 

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.340
whatever reason it assaulted my sense of
things who didn't take it but really if

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:26.350
things who didn't take it but really if
 

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.949
things who didn't take it but really if
you think about the story it's so that's

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959
you think about the story it's so that's
 

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:32.370
you think about the story it's so that's
like a decent story this one has like

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:32.380
like a decent story this one has like
 

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.280
like a decent story this one has like
nothing and yet I'm gushing but it's

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:35.290
nothing and yet I'm gushing but it's
 

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.310
nothing and yet I'm gushing but it's
just again it it's distracted me from

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320
just again it it's distracted me from
 

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.740
just again it it's distracted me from
the fact that it has no story by giving

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:40.750
the fact that it has no story by giving
 

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.100
the fact that it has no story by giving
me so much visual input to enjoy and not

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.110
me so much visual input to enjoy and not
 

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.610
me so much visual input to enjoy and not
just to see but to actually enjoy so

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:47.620
just to see but to actually enjoy so
 

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.569
just to see but to actually enjoy so
yeah I think I would I love the idea of

00:12:51.569 --> 00:12:51.579
yeah I think I would I love the idea of
 

00:12:51.579 --> 00:12:53.730
yeah I think I would I love the idea of
bringing in different animators to do

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:53.740
bringing in different animators to do
 

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.590
bringing in different animators to do
sort of different episodes and even if

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600
sort of different episodes and even if
 

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.000
sort of different episodes and even if
they sort of want to step out of the

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.010
they sort of want to step out of the
 

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.650
they sort of want to step out of the
bowl of the Adventure Time mold it's

00:12:58.650 --> 00:12:58.660
bowl of the Adventure Time mold it's
 

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.810
bowl of the Adventure Time mold it's
like that's my I do kind of wish there

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:00.820
like that's my I do kind of wish there
 

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.630
like that's my I do kind of wish there
was the

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:01.640
was the
 

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.420
was the
more creative way to either tie it into

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:04.430
more creative way to either tie it into
 

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.960
more creative way to either tie it into
a story or just make it you know the

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:07.970
a story or just make it you know the
 

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.210
a story or just make it you know the
idea of them bringing animators just

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:10.220
idea of them bringing animators just
 

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.030
idea of them bringing animators just
have it be so far removed like if it

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040
have it be so far removed like if it
 

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.460
have it be so far removed like if it
always was an April Fool's thing I would

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:15.470
always was an April Fool's thing I would
 

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.920
always was an April Fool's thing I would
actually sort of understand that a bit

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:17.930
actually sort of understand that a bit
 

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.930
actually sort of understand that a bit
more I don't know if you can only do

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:19.940
more I don't know if you can only do
 

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.190
more I don't know if you can only do
April Fool's because I did they don't

April Fool's because I did they don't
 

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.630
April Fool's because I did they don't
always land on that day yeah

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:22.640
always land on that day yeah
 

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.110
always land on that day yeah
you know but I don't know I'm very up in

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120
you know but I don't know I'm very up in

the air about it because it does seem
 

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.340
the air about it because it does seem
like when you have just like this guy

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:30.350
like when you have just like this guy
 

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.200
like when you have just like this guy
really was a really cool animator and

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:32.210
really was a really cool animator and
 

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.240

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:00.290
style I wish there's a little bit more
 

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.880

connection as to making the reasoning a

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:03.890
connection as to making the reasoning a
 

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:08.350
connection as to making the reasoning a
little bit more unique as to as to why

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360
little bit more unique as to as to why

mean it's just so strange so like I said

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:24.890
mean it's just so strange so like I said
 

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.800

but they also gave a reason why this

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:52.460
but they also gave a reason why this

yeah yeah I mean okay if glitch is like
 

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.880
