00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.850
This is about a revolutionary way of actually
treating patients with cancer.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:15.630
This is about taking your cellular material
and asking it to do something for you.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.470
And that is actually to go and seek, find,
and destroy these cancer cells.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.230
We don't have to, like, make things and put
them in the body, like, that are medical devices.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.910
We can actually take biological material and
actually put that back in the body and ask

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.510
them to do the things that we want them to
do.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.600
So when we're talking about cell therapy,
we're asking, the cells in the body to do

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.600
something.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.600
&nbsp;
We're talking about the immune cells… one

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.600
specific immune cell, the T-cell.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.410
Here's a sick patient and they have cancer,
and we're going to take their material, their

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.780
T-cells and we're going to supercharge those
T-cells.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.750
And in order to do that, we have to take the
cells out of their body and we're going to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.300
have to manipulate those cells.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.230
We're going to have to make them smart and
in order to make them smart, we're going to

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.600
do genetic engineering on those T-cells.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.240
And we're going to create the DNA that is
necessary for those T-cells to recognize the

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.020
cancer cells.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.170
So what happens is the patient will show up
to their doctor's office if they're diagnosed

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.159
with cancer
blood cells are removed from the patient through

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.500
a process called apheresis, and this apheresis
product is collected in a bag…

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.500
The blood essentially has targeted cell-types
we're interested in.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.500
These are the immune cells, the T-cells.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.500
These are the cells that are actually going
to fight the cancer cells.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.500
We have to sort of supercharge those T-cells.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.500
We have to do what's called reprogram them,
genetically modify them, introduce DNA into

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.500
these cells that allow these cells to then
specifically, target cancer cells, but that's

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.500
not, that's not it yet.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.500
These cells are then transferred into a bioreactor
platform…

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.021
… in order to make these cells happy, we
grow them up in what we call media, Liquid

00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:46.549
Media, and that the liquid media has the right
nutrients 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.770
and vitamins.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.409
That particular step there can take a couple
of days.

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.770
To grow up these cells in that environment
and then,these cells are then removed from

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.000
the bioreactor, we have to wash them, we have
to concentrate them, we have to give them

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.979
the right formulation, as we call it, to then
administer back into the, into the patient.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.400
The patient is then called back in and they
get their cells infused.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400
we are giving them those supercharged cells
that they need to kind of kickstart &nbsp;&nbsp;what

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.400
needs to happen here.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.019
...every cancer cell has a certain phenotype
associated with it so certain surface markers

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.930
will allow us to say, "That is a cancer cell."

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.610
In the instance of leukemia for example, there
is a specific target called CD-19 that is

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:35.000
expressed on these tumor cells and so what
we can do is we can genetically engineer the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.849
T-cells to specifically target the CD-19 receptor
So, that's how we're able to specifically

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.400
target seek, find, and destroy those cancer
cells.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.530
Today, it only takes one dose to treat patients
and see recovers, and see curative rates in

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.580
anywhere between 50% to 80%.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.599
So to me, that's actually translating into
we've actually created a different, you know,

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.599
roadmap for that, for that patient.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.599
Despite the fact that we've made tremendous,
headway when it comes to the clinical science

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.599
and clinical development of these cell therapy
products, there still remains challenges that

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.599
are associated with this and largely speaking,
they're related to manufacturability.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.599
This is a very laborious process.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.599
It requires people and it requires different
materials, etc, to actually take it from Point-A

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:09.599
to Point-B to Point-C…

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:10.599
It's literally begged, borrowed, and stolen
from different adjacent industries to, to

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.599
sort of repurpose technology solutions to
allow for the manufacturing of this product!

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:12.599
And so not, you know, not one slice fits all
anymore, and we're okay with that.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:13.599
We're okay with about, this is a personalized
treatment for you.

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.599
what we've really done is really push the
envelope in terms of what regeneration really

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:15.599
can mean to, to the treatment and the care
in patients.

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:16.599
We don't have to, like, make things and put
them in the body, like, that are medical devices.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:17.599
We can actually take biological material and
actually put that back in the body and ask

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.599
them to do the things that we want them to
do.

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.599
I think cell therapy holds the promise of
providing instructions to different cell-types

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:20.599
to do things that we normally have lost the
function to do and we want sort of, that gain-a-function

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.599
back, etc.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.599
I think one very important point about cell
therapy, it's truly personalized medicine

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.599
so what we've done today saying, "You present
yourself with cancer today but we are going

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.599
to create a treatment for you that is truly
personalized.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:25.599
We understand how you present yourself in
your cancer.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:26.599
the science has accelerated.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.599
We're learning a lot every single day in terms
of how cancers present themselves, in addition

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.599
to how we can treat those cancers, but there's
so much more that we need to learn.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.599
we know how to genetically engineer T-cells
to seek, find, and kill those cancer cells.

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.599
So, cell therapy is about really revolutionizing
the way that we treat cancer.

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.599
I think this is where we have really changed
the way that we're looking at how we care

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.599
for our patients and how we treat &nbsp;them in
giving them the best treatment in care and

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.599
ultimately, looking towards that, that endpoint,
which is curing your cancer.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.614
And I think this is where, we've, you know
... big step change in our thinking.
