00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:02.770
FEMALE SPEAKER: Way
back in February,

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.360
we reached out to Cliff,
our fearless Talks at Google

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.040
leader, and April Whitney,
who's sitting with us today,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.560
Theron's publicist at
Chronicle, about bringing

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.380
Maddie and Theron to campus.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.980
After months of
planning, we are so

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.070
excited to introduce Maddie
the coonhound and Theron.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.810
We just walked around campus
with Maddie and Theron

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.400
and saw her balance
on many a thing.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.695
We'll be posting those
pictures later today.

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:29.820
FEMALE SPEAKER: So you can
look at them on Google+.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.550
The hashtag is going to be
hashtag Maddie on things.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.780
So during the year long
trip across country,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.030
Theron took pictures of
Maddie balancing on everything

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.549
from a horse to
open fridge doors.

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:42.590
Some of you might have
seen this on his Instagram

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.310
account, Facebook,
all over the web.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.400
They have a great
website and web presence.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.240
So all this culminated
into the book

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.630
"Maddie on Things," which led
to Theron's newest project,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.480
"Why We Rescue."

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.700
Theron is going to talk about
both of those projects today

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.540
and after will be able to
answer some of your questions.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.440
Also, if you don't have a
copy of "Maddie on Things,"

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.850
you can buy yours after the
talk in the back from Books Inc.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.780
And then we also have some
Maddie the coonhound shirts

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.900
and stickers.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.152
And with that, we would like
to introduce Theron and Maddie.

00:01:16.152 --> 00:01:22.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.020
THERON HUMPHREY: Yeah,
thanks for having me.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.200
So I've been on the road
seven months this year.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.770
Last year I went to all 50
states shooting a documentary.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.375
And this year we're doing
another 50 state documentary.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:33.750
And concurrently
with that, we're

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.290
doing a 50 state book tour.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.790
So that's like the broad stroke
of what I'm up to this year.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.280
And the Maddie book tour,
hey, that's rolling right now.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.610
And this idea was project.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.650
But it's like since then become
my photo brand and my identity.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.370
You got her?

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.560
OK.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.580
Yeah.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.040
So this is the
cover of the book.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.240
You might have seen it.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.760
And the thing that I want to
do and be a part of on the web

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.419
is be innovative
with storytelling.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.805
And we also want to do
things that are fresh.

00:02:11.805 --> 00:02:15.926
So, like, no one goes and does
a 50 state bookstore, right?

00:02:15.926 --> 00:02:17.050
Like, that's kind of crazy.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.040
Like, you normally go to LA and
Las Vegas and New York City.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.650
You go to these
really big places.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.550
But what we wanted to do is
go to all the small towns

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.100
and big cities in between.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.334
And we built a really
awesome book tour website.

00:02:29.334 --> 00:02:30.250
It's maddieontour.com.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.150
We built it on Meteor.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.950
It's a new web technology.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.680
And it pulls in data from
Instagram and Twitter.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.970
And it archives it on this
really beautiful website.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.600
So if you visited that
site, you could see, like,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.380
our path and our story and
our time together on the road.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.870
Does anyone here program?

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.130
Do you all know Meteor?

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.630
Yeah.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.463
It's pretty awesome.

00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:53.695
It's good stuff.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.670
Most of the people I talk
to don't, like, really

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.040
love technology.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.700
So it's cool.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.576
I was actually at
Pixar yesterday.

00:03:03.576 --> 00:03:04.950
And that was weird
because I felt

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.200
like they should be talking
to me, just like you all

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.152
because you all create
really neat things.

00:03:09.152 --> 00:03:11.110
And I'm just taking photos
of my dog, you know?

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.150
I don't know.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.750
OK, no one's-- I'm
terrible at jokes, I guess.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.860
But where you come from
is really important.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.370
And Maddie was a side project,
the reason I was traveling.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.750
And so I think the
pleasure I have

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.314
of having this quick platform
is I get to tell you what I love

00:03:32.314 --> 00:03:33.730
in life and what
I love to create.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.360
And this is where I came from.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.070
Its Pollocksville,
North Carolina.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.174
It's a screen shot
of Google Maps.

00:03:41.174 --> 00:03:42.340
You might know Jacksonville.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.020
There's a military base there.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.970
But I grew up on
really sandy soil.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.340
I grew up on a farm.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.220
And that was my home,
and I really I hated it.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.510
Like, I hated where I came from.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.300
But now I love it so much.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.350
Maybe that's your story too.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.370
And this is the last
place that I lived.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.850
This is Sandpoint, Idaho.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.540
So I haven't had an apartment
or house in three years.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.040
And this is about six hours
east of Seattle, so, like,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.580
way up in the mountains.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.289
It's really beautiful,
epic country.

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:12.330
And this is like the scale
of the country, right?

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.410
Like, America is huge and vast.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.250
And I went to school
in Savannah, Georgia.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.910
I studied photography.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.320
And I just love to
show this for scale.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.210
And, like, what happens
in life is no one

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.780
is really good explaining
that while you're in school

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.530
it's essentially a four year
grant to study what you love,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.850
to execute your vision.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.310
Because once you
graduate, you quickly

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.950
realize that you start
creating and making

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.690
stuff for other people to earn
the money to get them rich.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.140
And for photography
that is so apparent.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.930
So I don't show you--
this is the stuff

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.680
I was creating before
I started traveling.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.910
So, like, I don't show you
this work to impress you.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.490
I was shooting
product photography

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.860
for a company called
Coldwater Creek.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.190
Like, your mom might
really love it.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.700
My mom loved it.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.430
And this is what had me.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.704
This is my life for
60 hours a week.

00:05:10.704 --> 00:05:12.120
You don't go into
the photo studio

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.640
and you'd don't shoot one
or two pairs of handbags.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.360
You shoot 35 of these.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.630
And you do it Monday through
Friday, 60, 70 hours a week

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.590
sometimes, depending on
if it's holiday season.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.360
There's art directors and
stylists and photographers.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.130
And everyone has
this, Sears and GAP

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.540
and Banana Republic and JCPenny.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.800
They all have this whole
world of product photography.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.060
And so you take
something you love,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.350
which is for me photography,
and you can modify it.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.120
And you start pointing
your camera at things

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.640
that you don't love and
that you don't believe in.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.250
So then what happens is
Monday through Friday

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.330
this is what you shoot.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.800
And then on the weekends you
don't want to pick up a camera.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.130
Like, you do something else.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.330
You go get drunk or go skiing
or backpacking or all three

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.470
because you're in Idaho.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.680
And that really did happen,
you know, on the ski hill.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.130
That was me skiing right then.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.967
You got to squish the bugs.

00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:07.300
I grew up in the East Coast,
so I didn't grow up skiing.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.360
So my first time, like,
when you ski-- OK,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.554
this is a terrible story.

00:06:12.554 --> 00:06:14.720
Like, you just go out there,
and you think you turn.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.360
And then you fall
on you're butt.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.500
But really you have to do this.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.660
That's my ski
lesson for the day.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.610
OK.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.965
Thanks for having me Google.

00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:25.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.220
But this work that I created
that totally changed my life.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.700
And what happened was
I worked for two years,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.980
and I saved up my
whole week of PTO,

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.210
which is Paid Time Off
in the corporate world.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.510
And I took my camera, flew
back to North Carolina just

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.930
to visit my granddad.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.470
And I pointed my camera at
what was familiar, the place

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.610
I came from.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.140
And this is a still life that
never changed my entire life.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.636
And, like, up in the
right hand corner,

00:06:54.636 --> 00:06:55.760
there's this great giraffe.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.910
And you would press the bottom,
and it would collapse over.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.790
And that little thing brought
me so much peace just knowing I

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.280
could always know where it was.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.560
That giraffe was always there.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.110
So I just pointed my camera
at the familiar and just

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.360
documented the place
that I came from.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.090
This is our tobacco farm,
tobacco barn, rather.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.640
And this is where
I spent my life.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.230
This is where I grew up.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.890
This is my
grandparents right when

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.280
they got married, 17 and 18.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.449
And I was hanging with my
grandma a couple months ago.

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:26.740
And she was telling this story.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.090
They didn't have running
water in their house

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.620
until she was 18.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.110
They didn't have electricity
until they were 16.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.010
And for me that
just blew my mind.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.170
Like, my life has been so easy.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.860
Like, has anyone, like,
not had clean drinking

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.470
water in the United States
or, like, ever gone hungry?

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.670
Like, our baseline for
existing is so easy.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.680
In most of the
world, like, those

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.140
are the reason for waking up,
to find clean water and to eat.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.910
And for me, I'm just like,
man, life has been so easy.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.230
And it was great just
sitting down with her

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.180
and listening to her.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.840
And I photographed my granddad
and recorded his voice.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.740
And he told me
stories of his life.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.692
And this is the tractor that I
grew up riding on the back of.

00:08:09.692 --> 00:08:11.650
I would be on the plow
going through the field.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.600
Like, they don't really
plow fields anymore.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.435
It's all no till
farming these days.

00:08:16.435 --> 00:08:18.185
But I would go through
the field with him,

00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:19.520
and it was so incredible.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.490
And it was just like
a really great week.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.090
I was back where I came from.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.580
I was hanging out
with my granddad.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.440
And then you fly back to Idaho,
and it's like, hey, Theron.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.605
You have 30 pairs of
earings to shoot today.

00:08:29.605 --> 00:08:31.813
I'm like, man, this is way
less cool than hanging out

00:08:31.813 --> 00:08:32.521
with my granddad.

00:08:32.521 --> 00:08:36.020
Like, do these even need
to exist in the world?

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.530
That's what I was thinking.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.914
And the following day
I got a phone call.

00:08:41.914 --> 00:08:45.200
And my mom was like, hey,
Theron, your granddad

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.720
passed away.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.040
So, like, literally,
in a heartbeat,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.110
like, this photograph became
more valuable because you can't

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:56.000
sit down with my granddad
and record his voice.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.520
You can't sit down
and take his portrait.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.360
So now one day when I have
kids I get to be like, hey,

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.510
this is your grandfather.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.850
This is what his life was like.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.060
This is what his
voice sounds like.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.160
And I didn't want to be 60 and
wake up and be like, hey, kids,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.620
this was my story.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.700
I was a product photographer.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.120
I made a living.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.350
I have, like, a big 401k,
and here's what I created.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.280
I got to this point
where I would rather

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.420
be broke and wake
up every morning

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:30.080
and create something that I
love that I can be proud of.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.260
So what I did, I quit my job.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.630
I went to Kickstarter,
and I presented this idea

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.900
that I would travel
all 50 states.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.060
And every single day as I
traversed America and drove

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.490
65,000 miles, I
would meet someone,

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.630
I would document their life,
I would record their story,

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.312
and I would share it on the
web on a website that we built.

00:09:51.312 --> 00:09:52.770
And it was this
wide idea because I

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:58.160
was sitting on the sofa
in my place in Idaho.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.700
And I called my best friend.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.290
And I was like, you know,
I want to do something.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.480
And I was like, man, this
is kind of a wild idea.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.440
And I was like, is
thiswildidea.com taken?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.490
Like, it must be, right?

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.150
It's such a common phrase.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.210
And it wasn't taken.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.590
So we registered the domain.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.750
And that's where the
project was born from.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:19.160
And ultimately this project was
National Geographic's travel

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.090
project of the year, which
was this incredible honor

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.180
at the end of the
year because there's

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.254
many days it was
cold and raining.

00:10:26.254 --> 00:10:28.170
I was sleeping in the
back of my pickup truck.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.600
And I was meeting
people every day,

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.474
and it didn't feel like
anyone was listening.

00:10:31.474 --> 00:10:34.770
So at the end, to get a call
from the senior photo editor,

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.396
and she was like hey,
Theron, like, come to DC.

00:10:37.396 --> 00:10:39.020
We want you to talk
about your project.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.410
I was like, that's so amazing.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.260
And now she follows
me on Instagram,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.865
and she likes my
photos sometimes.

00:10:44.865 --> 00:10:46.280
And it's super humbling.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.440
It blows my mind that they're
even looking at what I create.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.230
But yeah this was a huge honor.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.496
And I actually just
looked at the analytics--

00:10:55.496 --> 00:10:57.230
[BARKING]

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.240
Dogs.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.460
Love dogs.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.740
I actually just looked
at the Google Analytics.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.630
And this website has had over
a terabyte of data pulled off

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.210
of it in the past,
like, 18 months.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:12.080
And I guess in y'alls world
that's not a lot of data.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.950
But for me, just a dude
taking photos-- and the photos

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.440
are, like, 50 to 75 k too.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.660
So they're not, like,
these huge files.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.349
And that was incredibly--
this moment, I was like, wow.

00:11:25.349 --> 00:11:26.890
Somebody's looking
at what I created.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.550
And this what the
work looks like.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:32.140
And if you go on the website,
thiswildidea.com there's

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.790
30 to 40 photos for each person.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.790
And there's audio of them
telling their stories.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.500
And I just spent
time with people.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.190
I walked up to them,
and I shook their hand

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.490
and said you exist, you
matter, you're worthy.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.830
I want to celebrate your life.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:53.270
And the way I would look at
the project was two ways.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.750
The first is, like, when
recently has any one come up

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.590
to you and been like,
what did your grandma cook

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.940
that you loved?

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.420
Like, what do you
remember about her house?

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.550
Like, we don't talk and
engage with life in that way

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.290
very often.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.450
So that was, like,
my first level

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.642
of engagement with people.

00:12:11.642 --> 00:12:14.100
And then they realized that I
wasn't selling them something

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.975
and that wasn't trying
to ask them for money.

00:12:15.975 --> 00:12:19.510
They just welcomed me into their
lives and into their homes.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.630
And, I don't know,
it's just incredible

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.440
when you just walk up to
folks and shake their hand.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.140
And, for me, the new
measure of making work

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.990
was that if I feel
uncomfortable in my stomach,

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.220
if it flips upside down,
then I need to go do it.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.072
So if you're a creator,
if you're a storyteller,

00:12:37.072 --> 00:12:39.530
and waking up every morning
and shooting in the Golden Gate

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.680
Bridge in fog doesn't make
you feel uncomfortable,

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.040
like, I want to encourage you
to go shoot something else

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.998
that does because I think
that's how you really

00:12:46.998 --> 00:12:50.110
grow as an artist, as a
storyteller and image maker.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.200
And I promise you, walking
up to a rancher in Wyoming

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.966
is terrifying.

00:12:54.966 --> 00:12:55.840
I don't know.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.954
Maybe that sitting here
in Google headquarters

00:12:57.954 --> 00:12:58.870
doesn't feel that way.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:03.400
But go out into the world
and walk on someone's land

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.735
with this interest of
wanting to hear their story.

00:13:05.735 --> 00:13:10.000
It's terrifying in
the best of ways.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.390
And I think the
best way to think

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.890
about my work and this project--
and I tell this whole story.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.160
And it connects to
Maddie because this

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.760
is the reason why the
Maddie book exists.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.246
She was traveling with me for
this whole year on the road.

00:13:23.246 --> 00:13:25.010
And the best way to
think about my work

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:28.610
is if there's a box on
your front door right now.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.840
You know it's delivered.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.611
You check the UPS
because that's what I do.

00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:34.360
I want to know when
it's out for delivery.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:40.450
And inside that box was an
audio recording, 30, 45 seconds,

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.807
and 10 photographs of
your mom when she was 18.

00:13:43.807 --> 00:13:45.265
So, like, someone
sat down with her

00:13:45.265 --> 00:13:47.071
and recorded her
voice, what she wanted

00:13:47.071 --> 00:13:49.320
to do in life, what she was
passionate about, what she

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.610
loved, and then just
took a portrait of her.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.580
Like, opened up her
fridge and photographed

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.950
the inside of her fridge,
what was in it that day.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.920
Now fast forward
30, 40 years later.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.770
Like, what would
those images be worth?

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.560
Would you want to
leave right now

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.920
to go listen to what
she sounded like?

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.110
I would love to know
what my mom sounded like,

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.240
what she wanted to
do with her life.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.140
And that's what
this work was about.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:15.700
It's about celebrating the
every day, the ordinary.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.400
And I don't know.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.310
It's so damn simple.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.860
But I think it just resonated
with folks in the right way.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:28.250
And there's this
horse on the ranch.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.110
And the other amazing
part of the story

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.565
is my dog came with me.

00:14:32.565 --> 00:14:34.102
This is Maddie.

00:14:34.102 --> 00:14:35.810
And if you've been
following for a while,

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.500
you actually know
she is pointing

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.030
the incorrect direction.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.130
So, like, I kind of
started to fall in love

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.380
with photographing
her this way because I

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.470
liked her spots
better on this side.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.100
And how Maddie came
to my life is--

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.450
and this is her
on four soup cans.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:57.320
But right before I started
traveling, I got on Petfinder.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.390
And I was like I need a dog for
my adventure across America.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.152
And, you know,
Steinback had Charlie.

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:04.110
And was like, I'm born
and raised in the south.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.060
I need a coonhound
to come with me.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.850
So I got on Petfinder.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.450
And the first one that
popped up was Maddie.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:11.624
And I was like, oh, my gosh.

00:15:11.624 --> 00:15:12.540
She looks like a deer.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.390
That's so amazing.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.164
So I went to see her at
the shelter that day.

00:15:17.164 --> 00:15:18.080
And I played with her.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.390
And she was fantastic,
but very aloof.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.690
And as I was walking to put
her back into the cage--

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.020
because I wasn't sure.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.930
I was, like, in my
truck for a whole year.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:27.710
So, like, you know,
I wasn't going

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.835
to be able to leave my dog
at home for eight hours.

00:15:29.835 --> 00:15:31.610
She was always with me.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.220
I was walking back
into the cage,

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.804
and she pressed her body against
my leg the whole way back.

00:15:35.804 --> 00:15:37.720
And I was like, I can't
put you back in there.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.190
It's so sad.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.170
So I walked up to adopt her.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.130
And I thought it was going to
be this long paperwork process.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.246
And it was $40.

00:15:45.246 --> 00:15:47.950
I was like, OK, so
I own a dog now.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.590
It was really quite that simple.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.510
It all happened in,
like, six hours.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.500
Like, Petfinder, visit
Maddie, adopt her.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.300
Now I have a dog in my life.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.394
And I had no idea
what I was doing.

00:15:58.394 --> 00:16:00.060
And this is one of
the first photos that

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.540
got a lot of traction
around the world.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.880
Like, "People" magazine
published this photo.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.600
Man, this image actually
has a really crazy story.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.830
I was in South Dakota, and I
was eating lunch in my tailgate.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.540
So, like, when you
travel with a dog,

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.210
you quickly realize that you
don't eat in a restaurant.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.397
You get your food to go
or you get a sandwich,

00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:21.730
and you eat it on your tailgate.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.530
And your dog can run around
and play in the woods.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.480
And I was on some
land on a dirt road.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.599
And a big diesel
truck passes me.

00:16:30.599 --> 00:16:32.390
And I was like, oh,
I'm on this guy's land.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:33.980
He's going to get upset.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.190
But he tipped his hat at me.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.880
So I was like, OK, we're cool.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.940
I can be here.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.272
And he parked his truck and took
his horse out of his trailer.

00:16:41.272 --> 00:16:42.980
And I got that feeling
inside my stomach.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.854
I was like, I need to
go engage with this guy

00:16:44.854 --> 00:16:45.800
and shake his hand.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.190
And I want to hear his story.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.450
And I walked up to him.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:49.930
I'm was like, hey, I'm Theron.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.430
This is my dog Maddie.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.840
And I was like,
you know, my dog is

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.620
really good at
standing on things.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.160
Could she stand on your horse?

00:16:59.160 --> 00:16:59.660
Right.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.130
A really common thing to do.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.840
And he looks at me in the eye.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.000
And he goes, I know who you are.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.579
I seen you in "People" magazine.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:08.950
I was like, that's so crazy.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:12.319
I was in the middle of
nowhere South Dakota,

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.300
and he had seen the work.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.880
But, yeah, I mean,
I think this is

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.890
just what you do when you
travel for an entire year

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:21.550
with your dog.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.640
Like, maybe like I'm a
mother with a new child.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.720
[BARKING]

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:33.530
Yeah, the work grew out
of just her natural talent

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.555
and desire to climb things,
get up on trees, on rocks.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.520
I think the other thing
that I came to love

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.802
was the entire book is
shot on the iPhone 4.

00:17:48.802 --> 00:17:50.770
So, like, every
image inside it is

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.450
iPhone 4, which
is kind of crazy.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.440
And here's the other really
insane thing about it.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.490
So Instagram came
about this time

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:01.920
when I was doing this
project, so two years ago.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.590
And I didn't have a community
of people around me.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.680
I was on the road by
myself using this app.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.780
So I didn't shoot
through the native camera

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.270
and then upload it.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.280
I was shooting, literally,
through the Instagram app.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.640
So I have one photo of
each of these moments,

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.590
and there's no
outtakes or alternative

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:22.900
frames on the other side.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.474
So it's literally one
image, much like a Polaroid.

00:18:26.474 --> 00:18:28.640
I just thought that's how
you're supposed to use it,

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.070
like, you get one take
much like you literally

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.860
would a Polaroid photo,
which is really crazy

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.140
to think about now.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.280
Like, I would never shoot
like that these days.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.040
But it was so great.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.390
Just, like, you get into to
respond of shape and line

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.020
and space.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.800
Like, this is Portland,
Oregon at Voodoo Donuts.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.400
And then it's
like, I don't know,

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.750
put your dog in the basket.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:53.210
And then it just makes
the photo better.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:54.850
You guys are, like,
totally unsure

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.850
of everything I'm
talking about up here.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.640
But this is an
incredible example

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.720
of why you should never
eat inside a restaurant

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.760
because you miss the woman with
the Poodles on her sweater.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.190
And I was sitting under a tree
eating, and she was walking by.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.770
And I was like, can my
dog stand on your walker?

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:12.960
And she's like, yeah, sure.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.460
And then Maddie's
like, no big deal.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.250
I can do that.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.754
And then you take a photo
and you upload it instantly

00:19:17.754 --> 00:19:18.420
to the internet.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:24.670
And then it just happens
so quickly just like that.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.290
And in my mind I was like
what would the mailman do

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:31.920
if he opens the mailbox and
there's this dog in there?

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.580
And so many of the photos
just happened on a whim.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:39.340
Like, my friend jokingly opened
both the doors to the fridge.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.540
I was like, oh, Maddie
should stand up there.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.950
And then you place her.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.190
Stay, Maddie.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.540
And take a photo.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.430
Upload it.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:47.820
And give her a treat.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.140
And so, like, all these
images kind of just

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.280
happened so quickly.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:58.010
I literally took the photo and
then uploaded it within, like,

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:59.510
10 seconds of making the image.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:04.070
And then, like, 500,000 people
see that image on their phone.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.530
And it just blows my mind,
that idea that the image goes

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.410
into space and then it comes
back to people's phones,

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.830
and they share this
moment with you.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.210
Like, my dog was here on
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.490
I don't know.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.960
I'm not articulating
the idea that well.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.509
But it's just special.

00:20:22.509 --> 00:20:24.800
Yeah, and we celebrated
birthdays on the road together.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.720
And she was always with me.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.660
You start to do weird things
with your dog, I think.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.700
I was, like, driving.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.290
I was like, hey, Maddie.

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:33.480
I think it's your birthday.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.521
And then it's like,
what are we going to do?

00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:36.520
It's like, I don't know.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.400
Let's get you a birthday hat.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.910
And then you're in
the Dollar Store,

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.710
and you see this little banner.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:41.960
And you're like, I don't know.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.200
Let's take a photo.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.809
I'm not crazy dog
person, I promise.

00:20:45.809 --> 00:20:46.350
I don't know.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.880
Maybe I am.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.060
This is the levee
in New Orleans.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.910
This the levee that
broke down there.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.715
That's my good buddy,
Michael Tucker.

00:20:55.715 --> 00:20:57.490
And, like, I love
showing this image.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.220
We think, conceptually,
what's fascinating

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.570
about photography is
often what you choose

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.640
not to show in the frame
is more important and more

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.050
valuable than what is in
the frame to create a story.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.407
So what I mean by that is,
like, the basketball goal

00:21:11.407 --> 00:21:12.240
is cranked down low.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.560
But literally right
outside the frame

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.660
is my pickup truck that
has a camper shell.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.730
So Maddie is only about
a foot off the ground.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:23.860
So I never intentionally try to
create work that upsets people.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.210
But I also don't want to be
that guilty of photographing

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:31.100
cliches, like just shooting my
dog on a beach during sunset.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.285
But, historically,
like, another example

00:21:33.285 --> 00:21:35.760
of including things in the
frame and not including them

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.310
is a famous image by Dorothy
Elaine during the FSA

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.780
during the Great Depression.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.260
There's this migrant mother
image of her and her child.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.400
But she intentionally,
in the dark room,

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.620
Photoshopped-- that's
a weird analogy saying

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.220
darkroom and Photoshop together.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.940
But she, in the dark room,
took out the husband's hand.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.560
So it created this, like,
story of his destitute woman

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.860
and her child by herself without
this strong man there with her.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.930
So the idea of not including
something in the photograph

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:09.120
is just as valuable
as what you do show.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.160
So I don't always think
about photography like that.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.603
But the frames
are really strong.

00:22:15.603 --> 00:22:16.570
Yeah, you know.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:17.970
I don't know.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.525
Maddie, can you
stand across this?

00:22:19.525 --> 00:22:21.150
And then she's like,
yeah, no big deal.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:21.950
I can do that.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.720
And then you take
a photograph of it.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.006
And, you know, just waking up
with Maddie every single day.

00:22:28.006 --> 00:22:30.920
[BARKING]

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.450
I really wish I could
just print this image

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:36.600
huge on my wall and--

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.339
[BARKING]

00:22:39.339 --> 00:22:40.130
Are you OK, Maddie?

00:22:44.612 --> 00:22:46.930
She's like, why am I
all the way in the back?

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.450
Maddie is not a leash dog.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.600
And I think Google
is a leash campus.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.490
We normally spend
most of our days

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:53.920
in open fields in the woods.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.860
So she just wants to explore.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.760
Yeah, and, you
know, just driving

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.800
with my dog, spending
time with her.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.865
And the work evolved
and changed over time.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.100
Shes' just a good sport
and a good subject.

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.140
And then, like, you'd just
be walking by a garage

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:21.020
and just responding--
hey, Maddie, yeah.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.420
And just responding to objects.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.890
And, you know, you see this
Easy Rider helmet in the garage.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:28.910
And you start asking
questions like can

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.430
Maddie where this helmet?

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.970
And quickly the answer is
yes, she can wear the helmet.

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:35.035
And it's the photograph.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:41.490
This is waking up with her
and spending time with Maddie.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.280
That's my buddy [? Moneal ?].

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.360
So I fell in love
with this idea of

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.950
how, like, dog and
man melt together.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.990
And you start just
exploring that.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.250
It comes so simple.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.000
Like, he was laying
on the couch,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.319
just kind of being
silly, fake sleeping.

00:23:57.319 --> 00:23:59.485
And I was like, oh, Maddie
should lay on top of you.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.750
And I started
asking this question

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.230
of how would Maddie
wave to me if she could?

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:09.160
I don't think she
would use her paws.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.180
Like, what if she
could control her ears?

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.580
It would be so wonderful
if she could do that.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.310
So that's where
the work came from.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:21.450
We were at South by Southwest
where this tour started some

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.370
seven months ago.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:23.703
And we were at my buddy's house.

00:24:23.703 --> 00:24:25.360
And I saw this guitar case.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.080
And I was like, oh, Maddie
should totally sit in it.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.870
So I told her to
sit and lay down.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.020
And then she just fell
asleep in the case.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.284
And I was like, OK.

00:24:33.284 --> 00:24:34.700
You can stay there
if you want to.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.340
Coonhounds, like, totally
love to curl up in small balls

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.230
and get in tiny places.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.570
And then this is definitely
one of my favorite images.

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.710
And, no, they're not
chocolate sprinkles.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.150
So you don't have to
email me afterwards.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:52.660
But I was like, Maddie
does everything all in.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.580
And I feel like if
she wanted ice cream,

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.425
she'd just, like, dive her face
into the bowl of ice cream.

00:25:00.609 --> 00:25:02.150
And then you're in
the grocery store,

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.330
and you're walking
by the pineapple,

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:04.760
and you think of the
Chiquita banana woman.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.860
And you're like, can
Maddie where a pineapple?

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.470
And you buy a pineapple.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:09.740
And the answer is yes.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.060
She can wear pineapple.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.000
Hey, Maddie.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.300
Hey.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:19.070
And, man, she is such a good
sport and such a good model.

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:21.250
I just love that
little bit of tongue.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.960
And that's what becomes
really great about photography

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:30.040
is often it hinges on one
tiny element and tiny moment.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.010
Like, with this image, if her
tongue wasn't sticking out,

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.140
it would lose so
much of the power

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.210
and, like, what made it special.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.732
The other really scary
thing about photography--

00:25:40.732 --> 00:25:42.190
I've been thinking
about more of it

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:43.773
recently-- is, like,
when you sit down

00:25:43.773 --> 00:25:48.170
to edit your photos after you
shot the day or the concept,

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.910
and you're going through them,
and you get to the last photo,

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.800
and you choose that image,
like, it makes me so nervous.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.260
Like, what if I didn't
shoot that one more frame?

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.700
What if I didn't
click once more?

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.400
I'm like, am I teetering,
like, that much on life

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.550
where it's just like this
half of a second decision?

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:08.650
Because so often you're
like, OK, I got it.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:09.427
I got this photo.

00:26:09.427 --> 00:26:10.260
You're like, no, no.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.340
One more.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.700
And then you choose that.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.960
Oh, it makes me so
anxious to think about it

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.280
if I didn't shoot
that photograph.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.220
Insights into my mind.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.530
And this photograph has
a crazy story on the web.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:27.300
So for the bookstore
we're on right now,

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.050
we were shooting the video
for talk it to promote it.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:32.810
And we were in the store,
in the Cafe, rather.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.060
And I was thinking "Seinfeld."

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:34.862
So at the end of
the shoot, I was

00:26:34.862 --> 00:26:37.190
like, oh, let's pour
Maddie a cup of coffee,

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.450
ask her to sit on the
stool, put her paws up.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:40.966
My buddy started pouring coffee.

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:43.090
I'm shooting with my phone,
and she starts yawning.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:44.850
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.910
This is amazing because
you couldn't recreate

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.882
this photograph if
you had $100,000.

00:26:50.882 --> 00:26:53.230
This is so serendipitous.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.740
And this photo took
on a life of its own.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.660
This is just a tiny example.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.700
And they're ultimately
really great folks.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.640
But So Delicious,
they took the photo,

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.550
they, like, poorly Photoshopped
their product into it

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.330
and, like, put it
out there on the web.

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:10.060
So really just, like,
blatant and disrespectful use

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.620
of photography and, like,
breaking copyright laws.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.600
And it just really
broke my heart.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.580
And I was like, well, let's
turn this bad situation

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.770
into something really good.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:19.705
So I went to Facebook.

00:27:19.705 --> 00:27:21.830
And I was like wouldn't it
be great if So Delicious

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:26.020
donated $10,000 to an animal
shelter for stealing my photo?

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.849
And through a couple
of phone calls

00:27:27.849 --> 00:27:29.390
I received from So
Delicious, they're

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:31.723
like, that's going to be the
greatest idea ever, Theron.

00:27:31.723 --> 00:27:34.310
Let's do that--
just because by law

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:37.800
they would have been on
the hook for a lot more.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.430
And then through about
6,000 suggestions

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.430
and tweets and emails
later, So Delicious

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:46.040
did give $10,000 to a
shelter in Chicago that

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.140
puts elderly animals into
good homes, which is, like,

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.820
a super tough sell in
that world if you're

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.280
involved in animal rescue
or adoption at all.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.910
So this year, concurrently
with this 50 state book tour

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.430
we're doing, I was like,
this isn't quite easy enough.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.880
I was like, let's shoot
another 50 state documentary.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:11.650
So the way that I look at
photography and creating work

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.650
is Maddie is this
beautiful pop song.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:17.890
And it's fun, and it's
like a catalyst and a entry

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:18.660
to my other work.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.750
And then I want to
create documentaries

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.150
and shoot projects that are
driven by the heart and much

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:28.740
more salt of the earth
and have personal value

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.620
and social value.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.760
So, you know, I
didn't intentionally

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.210
get into the dog world.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:37.360
But what I quickly realized
is that I didn't want my place

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.280
to be showing sad
dogs behind sad cages

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.480
because Maddie was a rescue
dog at a high kill shelter.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.330
And she changed my life.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.630
And I don't want
to promote the idea

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.970
that these dogs in your
local shelter are bad dogs

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:56.470
or abused or not
worthy of your home.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.890
The truth is two out of
three dogs in America

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:03.100
that still find homes in America
aren't from shelters or rescue

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:03.920
groups.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.310
And I just I want to suggest and
tell the story that if you're

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.800
looking to bring an
animal into your life,

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.990
go to the Humane Society.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.520
Go to the animal shelter.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.457
Go to your local rescue group
and check those dogs out.

00:29:16.457 --> 00:29:18.040
And this is what the
project is about.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:23.670
It's storytelling and
spending time with people

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.630
and celebrating their life.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:31.770
And if we go whywerescue.com,
as every state we traverse

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:35.440
America, there's a
new story posted.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.420
And there's audio
and photography.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.949
And I think the other great
thing about creating projects

00:29:41.949 --> 00:29:43.990
at this scale-- so, like,
so much of the internet

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:45.400
is a hot flash.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.560
It's, like, boom, bang.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.620
Here's your ad.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.344
Here you go.

00:29:48.344 --> 00:29:49.760
But when you create
work like this

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.560
that's over the course
of an entire year,

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.050
people can invest in it.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.180
They can check back
with it once a week.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:59.020
There's always a new
story to be posted there.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.055
And so I think people
get much more invested

00:30:01.055 --> 00:30:03.760
and in tune with the
project and the spirit

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.490
of what you're creating
instead of just

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.680
being something fleeting.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.340
So that's kind of like
how I look at photography

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.265
now and on the web.

00:30:12.265 --> 00:30:15.450
So, like, build and
awesome, custom website.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.370
Build it so it works
great on mobile.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.810
And then invest
in it over a year.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.305
That's what I'm into,
just telling stories.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.750
And this is my really
good buddy, Garret, AKA

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:32.510
really kind of amazing on the
Instragrams if you use that.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:36.870
And so this year has been
super expensive for us.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.650
So we're driving
40,000, 50,000 miles.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.600
And the way that we're
supplementing our gas bill

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.870
is we, ourselves, hand screen
printed some really nice

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:46.840
t-shirts.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.440
So if you are into Maddie, I
would love to sell you a shirt

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.660
because it helps out
our gas tank so much.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.950
And they're on, like, the
best shirts made in America.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:56.010
It's the good stuff.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:31:00.030
And then, man, I love the next
slide because I love stickers.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.910
And actually I
found this-- I think

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:04.231
Google use-- this
is Sticker Robot.

00:31:04.231 --> 00:31:05.730
I found them because
I think you all

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:07.710
have ordered stickers
from them before.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.490
But they're, like,
the best stickers.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:10.460
They're UV coated.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.500
And they last, like,
five years outside.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.730
And we got stickers too.

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:15.630
And I think they're super rad.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.370
I get pumped on stickers.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.990
And this is just a
little slide of what

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.730
I have planned for next year.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:28.250
And this is the book that
we're pitching right now.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.720
And it's "Maddie the Coonhound,
a Super Serious Project

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.310
About a Dog and a Motorcycle."

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:35.490
So the plan is to
traverse all of America

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:40.085
with my dog in a side car
and me on a motorcycle.

00:31:40.085 --> 00:31:41.960
And we're just going to
go on this adventure.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.770
And I think it's just going
to be a blast and just

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.072
a ton of fun.

00:31:46.072 --> 00:31:48.280
So that's, like, what we're
looking for for next year

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.440
to go create.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.250
And then this year, hey,
if you do have the book

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:55.990
or you wanted it, like, I
made Maddie's paw prints,

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:58.230
her little paw
print, into a stamp.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:01.230
So I'd love to stamp your book.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.610
I would love to sign your--
I can sign my name too.

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:06.544
I would like to do that.

00:32:06.544 --> 00:32:09.100
Yeah, and I would love to
hear what you guys create.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.590
I also have
suggestions of what you

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:13.200
could do better
if you need those.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.600
I'm just kidding.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.420
That was a bad joke.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.810
This is being recorded.

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:22.050
But yeah, do we have time
for if you have a question?

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:23.760
AUDIENCE: So what is
her favorite reward?

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.390
In some of those
pictures, it looks

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.000
like she was
stretched pretty far.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.958
THERON HUMPHREY: Right.

00:32:27.958 --> 00:32:31.000
Yeah, I mean, Maddie is
really just simple, you know.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.775
She'll eat anything, you know.

00:32:32.775 --> 00:32:34.582
AUDIENCE: And then have
you ever measured--

00:32:34.582 --> 00:32:36.040
on that one where
she's on the hand

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.390
rails-- have you ever
measured her length, like,

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:39.970
how far she can go?

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.094
THERON HUMPHREY: I haven't.

00:32:41.094 --> 00:32:43.400
I think that was, like,
the ultimate stretch,

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.870
that one on the hand rails.

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:47.680
Yeah, but I never put
a tape measure to it.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.460
I guess I need to.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.816
But she's about 45 pounds or so.

00:32:51.816 --> 00:32:53.664
AUDIENCE: Do you close
her eyes by herself?

00:32:53.664 --> 00:32:54.580
THERON HUMPHREY: Yeah.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:56.600
It's just, like, a
lot of-- I should

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.930
have had some more images
here speaking to that.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:02.060
But I guess the
sprinkled nose has it.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.580
But, yeah, it's just a
moment I choose to share.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.910
So, like, we were on the
"Today Show" recently.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.744
And she was sitting in
the stool next to me.

00:33:08.744 --> 00:33:11.326
And I look over, and her head's
down, and her eyes are closed,

00:33:11.326 --> 00:33:12.430
and she's just sleeping.

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:16.092
I was like, oh,
Maddie, that's great.

00:33:16.092 --> 00:33:19.470
But, yeah, it's just a
moment within the time

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:21.920
that I'm taking the photo
that she just, like,

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.969
Zens out and, like,
just shuts her eyes.

00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:25.510
I don't know.

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:26.968
I always thought
it was super cute.

00:33:26.968 --> 00:33:31.400
That's why I choose
to share those images.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:31.910
Yes, ma'am?

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.850
AUDIENCE: So how did
she come to the shelter?

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.470
And how old was she
when you adopted her?

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:40.220
And how long have you had her?

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.610
THERON HUMPHREY: She was about
a year old when I got her.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:44.850
And, sadly, I don't know
any of her back story.

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:46.590
She just got dropped off.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:49.530
But her name was Madi,
M-A-D-I, when I rescued her.

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.810
So I was like, we got
spell it differently.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.940
So I just changed
the spelling of it.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.840
But, yeah, I mean, like,
one of my Maddie wishes

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.700
would be to get to meet her
mom and dad and have, like,

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:00.814
puppy photos of her.

00:34:00.814 --> 00:34:02.230
That would be so
great because I'm

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:05.489
sure she had amazing
ears as a puppy.

00:34:05.489 --> 00:34:06.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:07.260
Thanks for coming
to hang out with us.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.019
I'm sorry we're so
quiet and reserved.

00:34:09.019 --> 00:34:09.659
THERON HUMPHREY: It's OK.

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:11.783
AUDIENCE: I wish we could,
like, be a little closer

00:34:11.783 --> 00:34:14.374
and get more into what
you're talking about.

00:34:14.374 --> 00:34:17.880
I guess my question
is-- you must,

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.750
I mean, with the Why
We Rescue project,

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.900
you must connect a lot with
both specific people who

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.714
rescue animals and also
with organizations.

00:34:24.714 --> 00:34:26.130
Do you have any
particular stories

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.764
you want to share about, like,
really magical rescue stories?

00:34:28.764 --> 00:34:30.139
THERON HUMPHREY:
Actually I don't

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:32.857
connect with organizations.

00:34:32.857 --> 00:34:34.440
I think they're out
there, and they're

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.760
doing really awesome work.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.310
But, for me, it's about
telling the individual stories

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.550
without affiliation to a group.

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.500
And, for me, I'm
just a storyteller.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.100
And I want to get people
excited about rescuing dogs

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.489
and then go out and find
the organization that

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:51.350
makes the most sense for them.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:55.030
But, I mean, the stories vary.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:59.610
The project can be as simple
as, like, waking up and, like,

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:00.940
I need a dog in my life.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.200
And you go to a shelter
and you pick one.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.740
Like, that's not that
profound of a story.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.830
But that's what we're
celebrating because you

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:11.180
literally change that
animal's life in that moment,

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.160
and that's worthy of
documenting and sharing.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.610
And then you have other
stories on the website where

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.464
I met this really
wonderful girl.

00:35:18.464 --> 00:35:20.880
She graduated college and was,
like, a little lost in life

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.320
like we all had been,
or I was as well.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.930
And she's like, I
need a sailboat.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.260
So she spent, like,
$2,000 or $3,000,

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.090
bought a cheap
sailboat, sailed down

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.530
the Mississippi without
knowing how to sail,

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:37.595
learned to sail along the way,
and brought her dog with her.

00:35:37.595 --> 00:35:39.860
And that's just like
this incredible story,

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:43.800
right, of risk and adventure
and, like, a big question mark.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.380
So, like, I don't know.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:48.080
If you leave anything
from here today,

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.720
like, I just want
to encourage you,

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.310
shake you by the shoulders,
and say that, like,

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:55.915
choosing not to
go on an adventure

00:35:55.915 --> 00:35:58.400
or create work
that's your vision

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.250
isn't just a simple
yes or no question.

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.110
If you are choosing
to put it off,

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:04.850
that's, like, a whole
attitude towards life.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:06.820
It's not just a single moment.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.600
Hey, Google, thanks
so much for having me.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.800
It's been a pleasure.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.440
Maybe next time we
can sit in a circle.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.030
I don't know.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:19.110
We can hold hands
next time and talk.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.200
Yeah.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.105
But, yeah, thanks so
much for having me.

00:36:22.105 --> 00:36:22.980
Thanks for the venue.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.530
I totally appreciate it.

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:30.244
[APPLAUSE]
