00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.460
Okay, so, now I know this is kind of a subjective

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.040
quiz, but here are the answers I was looking for. Storing login

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.760
information. This is something, you know, I just mentioned previously. That's a

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.280
really common use of cookies. So when you log into a website,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.530
the web server gives you a cookie, and that identifies you for

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.320
future requests. Storing small amounts of data to avoid hitting a database.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.570
Yes, this is another kind of handy little thing. You know, if

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.270
you've just got a small piece of data that you want to store.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.600
You know it, it's, it's temporary. It's small. You don't need to

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.620
have all the infrastructure of a database to store it. And have

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.520
to you know hit your database on every request to retrieve it.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.700
That sort of thing. Especially if it's, it's, if it's you know,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.120
anonymous data. You know, data you don't mind losing. Because a user

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.440
can of course clear all the cookies out of their browser or

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.630
you know, a browser may not have cookies enabled at all. Storing

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.220
user preference info. no, this is not a good use of cookies.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.780
At least in the notion of a user as we've

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.770
been kind of talking about where, you know, you might log

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.360
into a website and you have these preferences. This is

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.960
because you want the data to survive. Now, cookies can be

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.959
erased at any time. A user can change browsers, they

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.164
can go to a different machine, and the cookies don't, you

00:01:08.164 --> 00:01:11.460
know the cookies are specific to one browser. And as long

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.250
as the user allows them to be there. So data like

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.520
user preferences that you want to exist until a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.770
user changes them on your website Shouldn't be stored in

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.860
cookies and tracking you for ads. This is unfortunately maybe

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.510
not a a good use more of an appropriate use

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.530
because tracking you for ads isn't really inherently a

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.150
good thing, but its a really common use of cookies.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.060
You go to a website, you may find yourself with

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.670
20 cookies that are tracking you for different ad providers.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.490
And in fact, I had a friend that worked for an ad tracking company for a while

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.758
and these transfers are kind of related. They used

00:01:48.758 --> 00:01:51.790
to joke that they had the world's largest database

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.570
stored in users' browsers all across the internet.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.150
They had like, many hundreds and thousands of, of

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.620
terabytes of data. In theory stored you know, a

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.870
few hundred bytes at a time, in users' cookies.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.970
Because they powered a lot of really big ad networks.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.860
Cookies, and we'll come back to a little bit how ad

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.860
networks work. I think it's, it's interesting to understand. That cookies

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.040
are a critical technology for tracking you for for advertising purposes.
