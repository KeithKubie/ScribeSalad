00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.940
So school is starting up again.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.220
I know I can hear your groans from here.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.690
Trust me I get it.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.410
But did you know there are some schools where
it’s always summer?

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:15.099
Well at least on friday.

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.710
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.930
As many schools across the country face major
budget cuts, some turn to drastic measures.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.940
A popular solution seems to be to simply cut
a day off of the school week.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.280
According to the Education Commission of the
States, about 100 school districts across

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.780
the US use four-day weeks.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.590
And it’s pretty big in Colorado.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.830
Over a third of the school districts there
have adopted a four-day schedule.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.750
And it’s not a new idea by any means.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.329
There are some countries that have traditionally
had a four day week.

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.000
Like France, where Wednesday has been treated
as the day for kids since 1972.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.600
It’s a whole day where students participate
in sports or other enrichment activities.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.180
But recently, the government worried about
how tired students might be with the longer

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.180
days.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.470
So they’ve limited each school day and added
Wednesday as a school day.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.700
But back in the states it seems to be catching
on.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.829
The reasoning goes that schools will save
money by cutting a day off on things like

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.710
busing, school meals and cutting energy usage.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.250
But does it actually save money?

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.390
Well according to the same report by the ECS,
actual savings range from 0.4 to 2.5 percent

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.430
per year.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.360
So it seems the benefits aren’t exactly
financial, so what, if any, are there?

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.280
Well one recent study published in the journal
Education, Finance and Policy found something

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.280
surprising.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.670
After switching to a four-day school week,
many school districts in Colorado found that

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.080
math scores actually went up a bit for 5th
graders!

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.690
And reading scores… really didn’t change.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.840
This surprised the researchers, they thought
that missing a day of school would lower scores.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.549
They thought that especially for the younger,
elementary school kids, longer days on a shorter

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.430
school week would hurt their academic performance
because their attention spans are shorter.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.619
Also, a longer weekend would give them more
opportunity to forget what they had learned."”

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.520
Which is called academic loss, a phenomenon
most noted when students go on summer holiday.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.850
When they come back many teachers have to
spend weeks reteaching old material.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.229
When switching to a four day week, schools
still have to meet hourly government mandates.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.650
So the other four days of school are actually
longer.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.119
While some might gasp at a longer school day,
turns out it might be a good thing for learning.

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.530
Longer school days the rest of the week means
more time learning, going in depth and less

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.910
time rehashing old topics from the day before.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.860
And according to Jimmy Linderman, superintendent
of the Chattooga County School District in

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.540
Georgia, shorter school week means kids are
more rested and less rambunctious at school.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.360
Since switching to a shorter week, they’ve
seen a decrease of over 70% of discipline

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.360
referrals.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.360
And as for the day off?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.140
Whether ballet or soccer or tutoring, the
extra day means more time to spend on extra

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.569
curriculars and other enrichment activities.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.250
Unfortunately it might not be a boon to all
kids.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.840
Low income student might miss that extra day
of enrichment and even could wind up missing

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.690
meals that the school normally provides.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.459
And maybe it wasn’t so much a boost to student’s
performance, but to the teacher’s.

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.480
Some schools like Sage International, a charter
school in Boise use that day off, not to shut

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.370
down the school and save on energy costs,
but rather to keep the school open for the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.370
teachers.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.620
They use that extra day as an in-service day
for teacher training.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.379
They can spend the day learning new tricks
of the trade and swapping classroom success

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.379
stories.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.260
But even for teachers who treat the Friday
off as a long weekend, there’s still a boost

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.260
in morale.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.379
Just like in many tech companies, like Treehouse
who instituted a four-day work week, who’ve

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.310
claimed higher employee morale and greater
focus.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.030
And that’s what one of the authors of the
that study think.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.739
They believe that teachers “were so enthusiastic
about the four-day week--they did a better

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.739
job.”

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.569
A shorter school week sure sounds like a dream!

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.450
But does the extra time off actually help
to ease your stress?

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:33.870
Check out this DNews episode that suggests
that it might do the opposite.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.190
So what do you think?

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.560
Would you like a shorter school week?

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.180
Even if it means longer school days?

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.700
