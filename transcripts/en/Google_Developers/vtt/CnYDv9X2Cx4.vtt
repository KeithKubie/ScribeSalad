&gt;&gt; MIHAILOVSKI: Hi, my name is Nick Mihailovski
and I'm going to quickly walk you through

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:09.470
the Google Analytics Treemap demo. In this
demo we get data from the Google Analytics

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.710
Google Data API and we return to the HTML
table. And that table is then visualized using

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.079
the Protovis SVG library into a real fancy
Treemap here. When you just get the data as

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:27.380
a table, here we're looking at rows and rows
of HTML data, about 500 rows here of Google

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.939
Analytics Data. We're looking at the different
pages that people came to visit at your website

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.570
and that's all the number of people who came
through that certain page. With this visualization

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.330
what we're able to do is visualize how many
entrances for a particular page is and how

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.970
many bounces that people came to this site.
And the bounces are one-page view visits.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.780
And so, when you come to the site you only
see one page and you leave, we define it as

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.790
a bounce. And we calculate the bounce rate
as the total number of bounces divided by

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.050
entrances. And so, what this visualization
allows us to do is the larger boxes show us

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.800
pages that have higher traffic. You see this
You + Tube page has the most entrances at

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.710
55,000 while some of this much smaller pages
have much less. And so, the size of the box

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.050
represents the traffic, the color represents
the bounce rate. Generally, a low bounce is

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.380
good and what it's colored as green and red--a
higher bounce is bad and we color it as red.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.580
And so, we've added some interaction here
with some JQuery in so that way you can filter

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.650
out different pages that have high entrances.
And so that way you can make the smaller entrances

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.860
larger. And so, quickly we can come in here
and say this was green and this page here

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.780
has a low bounce rate, 8.5% to 4%. This page
here also had a low bounce rate, 1.36%. But

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.430
then let's look at some of the red and we
can quickly see this page had a 90.7%. And

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.159
so, it's a quick way to take a boring HTML
table and transform it to something really

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.170
beautiful using Protovis, JQuery and SVG.
