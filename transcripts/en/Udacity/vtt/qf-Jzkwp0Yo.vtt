00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.960
Just to help us understand this, I want to actually also emphasize that

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.160
let's find these type of changes in an image, a real image like this one.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.560
Of course, photo taken by my colleague Henry Christensen.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.670
And let's look at various types of things within this image.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.350
First, let's look at illumination changes.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.680
Now if you look at this scene, there is,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.759
of course, because lighting changes, there is shadows.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.310
Those are illumination changes.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.590
You can, of course, see a lot of different types of things.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.450
There's not a lot of specular reflection here.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.680
But that kind of tells us that there could be some changes happening in

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.720
the scene because if the, if the lights were on,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.780
we would actually see a lot more illumination information.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.750
We can separate out things like the word tech

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.840
because the color is different in front of that.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.730
Also it has a specific shape that actually helps us also distinguish and

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.545
separate that out.

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:53.160
Depth discontinuity again comes in,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.540
in this tower here is in front of something else.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.120
We can look at that depth and see that this has to be in front so

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.769
there should be some sort of a discontinuity here at the tower.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.940
Surface normal, basically again if you look at the steps here you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.660
can see a lot of discontinuities because sometimes a surface normals of

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.280
these steps are changing around.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.850
You can see this kinds of things across in the shape here.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.620
Each one of these shapes basically has a different surface normal, and

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.170
it helps us kind of distinguish that.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.160
Of course objects have well-defined boundaries.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.860
This you know fire flume kind of things here or the roof decks here at different

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.930
objects, the windows and such, each one of them have different levels of detail.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.090
And again that could be of course look for separately.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.740
And of course also additionally reflectance change.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.510
Now this is most visible here because and

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.050
I go down this roof top you can see the changes in colors.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.980
A much more subtle change, but there is definitely a reflectance change here.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.600
That starts telling me that this is a different shape and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.400
of course there is of course much changes in this one too.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.450
Hopefully this helps you try to start thinking about how we can actually look

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.140
for these types of changes in real images.
