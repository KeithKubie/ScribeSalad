00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.760
&gt;&gt; Note that in this exercise, there were only seven examples and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.240
only five features. So we could do it by hand. What would happen if the number

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.350
of examples was much larger and the number of features were much larger?

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.240
This algorithm would still work but we'll need a lot more computing power.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.764
It is also possible that the algorithm may not be able find the right concept to

00:00:58.764 --> 00:01:02.690
converge to because I might be allergic to multiple meals at

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.180
multiple restaurants such as breakfast at Kim's and

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.870
lunch at Sam's. But even in that case, the benefit of this algorithm is it will

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.730
show that convergence is not possible even after many, many examples.
