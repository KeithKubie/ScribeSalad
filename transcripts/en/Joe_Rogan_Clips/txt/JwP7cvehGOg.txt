Speaker 1:          00:00          I mean belt or really now is like it's a major player and they have like major, major talent. Absolutely. Very interesting. Yeah. I mean they don't get as much credit. Obviously they're not those big promotion, but they have some of the best fighters. Yeah. They got, I mean look, they've got gay guard sauce, you know, they got Rory Macdonald. Macdonald. Yeah. You can go down the list. How about fucking Ryan Bader Kayo and food with that crazy. I thought Baylor was going to win. I thought I was going to use this pressure and just wear on him and mount wrestling. Um, but yeah, that's crazy. 10 seconds. Well he clipped him with that. Crazy. It's like a level chap. Yeah. Level Change. Half Hook, Half Jab. I think he was getting federal to think that he was in drop for a shot and looped to hook over the top. Right. It seemed like he wanted to get fade or to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Isn't that how I got the knockout? The fight before that too, right, exactly. And plaintiff took, yeah. Yeah. I think it was a level change. Left Hook and people are thinking like, oh shit, he's coming for a take down. What has a heavyweight man, he's a motherfucker. I looks good. He looks fantastic. Body looks good. You. Yeah. I mean he looks like a heavyweight. Yeah. And you know he's weighing two 35 ish, somewhere around there. You know, which is a great weight for heavyweight things. The best way for that weight class. Yeah. There's that point of diminishing returns. Right? You get to like two 60 unless you're in Ghana. Well see in Ghana who doesn't know how to wrestle. So that's part of the problem. But, but if he did holy fuck, but as, as agile as you need to be arrested, I don't know if he can move that fast.

Speaker 1:          01:24          He can move fast, man. That kind of moves like a cat. Damn. He scares the shit out of me. Cause like if that guy knew, he knew like what everybody else knew. I just think he's so physically gifted. Yeah. I mean when you see him punch people it's like it's a different thing. It's different. Yeah. Just a lunchbox coming at your head. The power is just preposterous. Just doesn't even make any sense. Yeah. If that guy could get with a guy like Dwayne and start moving and just, you know, not just rely on throwing hammers but set and stuff up and switching stances and I don't know if you can do that with that kind of weight. You know, like how long can a guy like that move? You know, that Sam can get them to move that long. I guarantee you dude, Sam, like I'm telling you, like if I'm going like from my body mass, if I'm able to walk around with a 65 and the lactate threshold, he's told me I can have, I guarantee you you can do it with the big guy like that.

Speaker 1:          02:16          Wow. That would be insane. Well, there's not a lot of big guys like that. That's the thing too. It's like who does he have to train with? It's going to push him. Yeah. You know, the I, that is a giant problem with heavyweights, whether it's in wrestling or Jujitsu or anything, it's finding someone that they could train with. It's that heavy. That's that big. I mean, he's, he's a legit natural 265 pound man. Yeah. You know what I mean? Well, I feel like if you're getting hit by another 200 seat, if I'm home man two it's going to take more out of you. Even if a to 65 and you're getting hit by another guy's to 65 I still feel like your head can only take so much.
