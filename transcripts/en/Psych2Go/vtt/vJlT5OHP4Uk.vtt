What's up Psych2Go viewers? It's Donna. You know, the person behind the voice over for the last video on Gawking at the opposite sex.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.380
And, I'm here to introduce a new segment on Psych2Go called:

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.920
Psych News Edition.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.260
Where we announce the new discoveries that are happening in the world of psychology.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.620
So, without further ado, let's get on to the first story.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.700
Scientists at the University of Maryland, School of Medicine, lead by Dr. Scott Thomas

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.140
claimed to have found a compound that can beat the symptoms of depression within twenty-four hours.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.700
The team focused on a compound called "GABA-NAMS"

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.380
And, tested their hypothesis on rats.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.880
Rats are subjected to chronic mild stress that caused the rats to act depressed.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.120
When treated with the compound, scientists were able to reverse the symptoms of depression within twenty-four hours.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.880
That's a huge improvement from current antidepressant medication we have today.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.380
Normally, current medication takes up to two weeks to work.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.960
But, people won't start feeling positive effects until six to eight weeks.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.900
Now, the study hasn't been done on humans yet so, I'm a little bit skeptical of it as of now.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.380
Just by the fact that sometimes depression is caused by external events.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.820
Whether that be bullying, abuse or financial problems.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.800
Before taking medication those external problems need to be addressed first, a pill will not make those problems disappear.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.420
Don't get me wrong, any sort of progress in the realm of science is a great thing.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.220
And only good can come out of this new discovery.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.480
Our second story comes from the University of Pennsylvania

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.860
and it's for you, frequent migraine sufferers.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.580
I've got good news and bad news.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.460
The bad news is being prone to migraines is genetic.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.020
If you often get them that's that and you're born with what you have.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.460
The good news is researchers have found a link to migraines and an incomplete circle of Willis.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.080
The circle of Willis is the joining area of several arteries of the brain.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.720
Because of that finding, researchers are now working on other treatments for migraines.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.780
It's coming soon you guys.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.760
And, our final story is about

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.020
..screaming.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.620
Screaming is a vital form of human communication.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.680
Without using any words, it can convey messages of excitement or fright.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.480
Furthermore, screams have this effect on the brain that causes it to become alert once it's heard.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.700
That's important of course because it tells us right away that we either need to fight

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.740
or run.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.200
That is why Popple and his team at the University of Geneva in Switzerland

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:55.180
asked people to judge screams based on how terrifying they were. In hopes to learn about this mean of communication much more.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.940
Researchers found that roughness in screams range from thirty to one hundred and fifty hertz.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.580
And, the rougher the sound the greater the activation in the Amygdala.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.700
The team suggest that this new information can be used to improve alarms.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.340
Please don't make alarms more annoying.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.660
This one's annoying as it is.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.420
That's the news we have for you this week and we at Psyc2Go would love to hear your opinions on what you learned today.
