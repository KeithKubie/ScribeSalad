00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.300
Emoticons are rewiring our brains!

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.650
[MUSIC]

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.570
I'm Anthony Carboni, this is DNews and new
research shows that we're creating a whole

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.869
new type of brain activity to handle all those
passive-aggressive smileys people are putting

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:20.980
at the end of their texts.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.140
We've talked about pareidolia here on the
channel before- you probably already knew

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.820
about it. It's that human tendency to see
faces in things like the fronts of cars or

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.480
clouds, stuff like that. It's common enough
that there's a subreddit devoted to it.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.440
Carl Sagan thought it might've been an evolutionary
trait. The idea is that we're hardwired to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.650
recognize friendly or angry faces at a moment's
notice, it gives us a better chance at survival.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.500
That makes sense intuitively- no one has to
tell you to see a face in your toast or a

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.260
light socket, you just see it. It also matches
up with what goes on in your brain when it

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.180
happens.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.530
Pareidolia happens in the ventral fusiform
cortex of our brain, almost instantly- in

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.260
an fMRI, the average person recognizes a human
face in 130 miliseconds and something with

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.260
a... face-y... look in 165 miliseconds. And
the brain activity looks almost exactly the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.310
same in each.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.609
So that brings us to our smiley emoticon-
specifically the dash-as-nose variety. You'd

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.469
figure it fits right into the whole face burned
into toast thing. But here's the thing- when

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.929
the emoticon was introduced on a message board
in 1982, it had to be explained. It wasn't

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.560
naturally recognized as a smiling face. Our
brains saw it more as language or punctuation.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.439
It was a symbol to be decoded.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.429
A new study out of Flinders University says
that's changed over time. 20 people were shown

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.209
real faces, smiley emoticons, and a bunch
of meaningless punctuation while their brain

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.979
activity was monitored- and the emoticon was
recognized by the pareidolia part of the brain.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.149
We now see it innately as a face.

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.729
But here's something interesting- turn a face
sideways, it's still a face, your brain reacts

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.299
to it the same way. Type an emoticon the opposite
way or vertically and our brains don't register

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.020
it as a face at all. Which kind of makes sense
to me, because if someone types it the opposite

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.459
way in a text it takes me a moment to get
what they mean.

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.400
Dr. Owen Churches, the lead researcher on
the study said this means emoticons are something

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.040
new- a new sort of language. And our brains
are building a new pattern of brain activity

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.560
to decode it. This is kind of similar to research
that shows things like the invention of maps

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.860
and clocks changed the way we saw and organized
information. We change the world and it changes

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.400
us in return.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.629
I really do hate that smiley winky emoticon
that people put at the end of jerky statements

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:43.239
to keep themselves out of trouble- but I love
constructing entire messages out of emoji.

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.549

Man, you guys are gonna end every comment
with one of those smileys, aren't you?
