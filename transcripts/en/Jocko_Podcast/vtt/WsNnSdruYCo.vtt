00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.560
What do you do when you're broke in?

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.960
What do I do when I'm broken?

3
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.410
When I'm broken,

4
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.120
I relish it. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to use it

5
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.820
<v 1>cause [inaudible].</v>

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.470
<v 0>If I'm broken, then I just found my limitations</v>

7
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.320
and until I know what my limitations are,

8
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.350
how can I push them? How can I get better?

9
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.140
But once, once I see it,

10
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.510
once I feel it, once I see where I was broken,

11
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.300
then I can a cap. That weakness,

12
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.210
I can fill in that gap.

13
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.470
I can reinforce that breach.

14
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.710
If you break, it means it's time to

15
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.880
fortify your wheel to make it stronger.

16
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.660
They look, there's, there's all kinds of different ways to break.

17
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.490
You can break physically, you can break mentally,

18
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.530
you can break your heart,

19
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.560
you can break your spirit and none of those are fun and all of those are going

20
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:36.100
to leave a mark.

21
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.770
But the mark that they leave can be the mark of victory or it can be the mark of

22
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:49.224
defeat

23
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.020
because every time you break in, in every way that you break,

24
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.390
wow, it's a chance.

25
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.420
It's definitely a chance for you to give up and for you to just to fall apart.

26
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.090
But there's also opportunity.

27
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.180
There's opportunity to get stronger and get smarter and get faster and get

28
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:26.030
tougher and get more stable and get more resilient and get

29
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.613
<v 1>better.</v>

30
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.620
<v 0>When you break,</v>

31
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.780
you have the opportunity to show the world,

32
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.210
the whole world what you are really made of.

33
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.890
So, so if you break, if, if you break,

34
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.510
<v 1>yeah,</v>

35
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.820
<v 0>the fight easing over.</v>

36
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.690
In fact, if you break the fight is just beginning.

37
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.910
And as you crawl up and out of that dismal and wretched place covered,

38
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.950
and you covered in Plod and sweat and dirt and filth,

39
00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:32.040
as you rise above what you were,

40
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.480
and as you take the form of,

41
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.000
of who you are supposed to be,

42
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.410
you will see that in the very act of standing up in the very act of fighting on

43
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.460
you will become a, and you will remain

44
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.670
unbroken.
