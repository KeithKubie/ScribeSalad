grinding command I really love the idea
 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.410
grinding command I really love the idea
that I can be someplace where nobody

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420
that I can be someplace where nobody
 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.000
that I can be someplace where nobody
else is around me and I'm seeing

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010
else is around me and I'm seeing
 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.670
else is around me and I'm seeing
something nobody else is seeing and

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680
something nobody else is seeing and
 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.160
something nobody else is seeing and
there could be care

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170
 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.960
