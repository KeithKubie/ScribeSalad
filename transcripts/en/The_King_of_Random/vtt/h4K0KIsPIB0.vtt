00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
[Captions by Y Translator]
Guys, today, we're doing
something a little bit different.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.560
We are here at Salt Lake FANX.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.540
Previously known as Salt Lake Comic Con,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.940
and today, we're going
to be looking around,

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.700
walking around checking out
some of the stuff that we have here

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.080
at this convention,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.060
and we'll be sharing with you
some of the tips and tricks

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.800
that we've learned from going
to cons in the past that hopefully

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.060
could help you if you haven't gone
yet or even if you've been to several.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.180
[Music]

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.440
First two tips to share
have to do with comfort.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.300
One is for the comfort of others,
and one is for your comfort.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.800
You may notice that there
are quite a few people here.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.240
I'm pretty sure this convention gets
upwards of 70,000 people coming through,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.160
and there are some
bigger Cons than that even.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.100
So, the first tip is always make
sure you shower and wear deodorant.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.800
It's going to make the day better for you.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.280
It's going to make the day
better for everyone.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.760
If that were not a thing,
like this would probably

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.520
the most unpleasant room in the world.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.000
The second tip that I have for your
own comfort is to do what you can to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.940
make sure you wear comfortable shoes.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.560
Most convention centers will
either have a concrete floor,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.880
or just a thin carpet going over it.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.440
And if you walk around
for a long time on that,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.480
your feet are definitely
going to start to hurt.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.820
So good shoes, good soles.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.200
You might even want to get the inserts
to make it even more padded.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.800
It's going to make your day a lot better.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.820
&gt;&gt; It's excellent.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.240
&gt;&gt; For me?

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.600
&gt;&gt; Good job.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.540
&gt;&gt; What are your gonna do with it?

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.640
Let's go do smashing things!

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.200
If you can, you might want to
try bringing in your own food.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.320
Most conventions will let you
at least bring in some good snacks,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440
and if you get the food
that they're selling there,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.400
it's usually pretty high priced.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.100
So you can probably save
yourself some money, bring snacks in.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.500
If they don't then even leaving
food in the car is probably

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.000
going to be a best bet for lunch.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.720
[Music]

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.940
&gt;&gt; Oh, you got a marker.
That's so handy to have.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.920
&gt;&gt; Very cool.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.740
Osric Chau everyone.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.340
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.300
Thanks very much.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.500
&gt;&gt; Builder, maker, creator, doing things.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.040
We try to think of titles and like
labels for what he actually does,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.240
and we can't because
he does so many things.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.900
&gt;&gt; So what do you think?

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.900
You want to be in a video sometime?

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.800
&gt;&gt; Oh absolutely.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.300
&gt;&gt; Awesome, we'll make that happen.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.500
It's probably a good idea to use
the restroom before you

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.400
show up at the con.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.900
Sometimes it's nice and organized
and there's no problem getting

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.600
in, but a lot of the time there's going to
be a lot of people and the lines will be

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.800
pretty crazy long
and cleanliness is iffy.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.240
So, it can't hurt to use
the loo before you go.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.800
Just make your life easier.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.900
Comic conventions are a really cool
place to wear your favorite costume

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.400
or cosplay but you do want to make
sure that the first time you wear it

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.000
is not while you're at the convention.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.200
You want to try and spend at least
a couple of hours wearing your costume

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.600
before the convention so that you'll
know where it may or may not be

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.400
comfortable, if it pinches, if it
binds or especially if it's

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.440
going to break or tear anywhere.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.100
If you do have problems with it breaking,
you want to make sure you reinforce

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.420
that before you get to the convention.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.540
[Music]

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.700
It's a really good idea
at conventions to always bring cash.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.300
A lot of vendors do take cards
but sometimes their card readers

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.000
go down or sometimes they just
don't have them and you should also

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.400
make sure that you have small bills.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.400
Sometimes it's hard to
have change for stuff.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.700
So bring cash, use small bills
and then save yourself having

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.900
to pay the like, $5 at ATM fees.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.620
It's pretty nuts.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.400
[Music]

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.500
&gt;&gt; How many millions
of followers you have?

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.120
&gt;&gt; We just passed ten million.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.340
&gt;&gt; Ten million idiots follow this guy.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.080
Can you believe that?

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.000
I got 37 people who follow me.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.940
You got ten million.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.500
&gt;&gt; How many people saw you
in Guardians of the Galaxy though?

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.780
&gt;&gt; 20, 20 people saw me.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.920
This is the monger taking
revenge on the maker.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.440
Ready?

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.800
&gt;&gt; It's what happens.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.720
&gt;&gt; It happened. This is really look great.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.400
&gt;&gt; You know what?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.940
If you need something built,
if you let me know.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.220
I can get that done for you.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.120
&gt;&gt; That's right man,
he does that for a living.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.060
&gt;&gt; He builds [bleep]

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.440
Ten million followers.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.840
If you follow him it will
be ten million and one.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.920
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.980
All right. Well that was
completely unexpected.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.500
I literally didn't even realize
he was there until we like stopped and

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.100
he was like, oh yeah, the the hammer.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.260
He actually signed that earlier.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.340
We were just talking about it.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.720
He thought it was cool and was like,
can I sign this, and so he signed it.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.940
That was great.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.200
[Music]

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.860
I'm a Ravenclaw.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.600
There are a few items that
I would definitely recommend

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.600
you bring to a con with you.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.200
I've got this backpack
that was super cheap,

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.200
and I love it

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.600
because it weighs like nothing.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.100
This whole backpack is like, maybe
a quarter of a pound, probably less,

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.780
like it is so light and thin
but it holds plenty for me,

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.600
and then there's several things that
I like to fill this back with every time.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.380
First off, I like to have a water bottle.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.300
Usually there's going to be
drinking fountains,

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.900
and drinks around you can
get for the water bottle's nice.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.580
If you can't bring it in full,
then just fill it up a drinking fountain

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.100
first chance you get and then
whenever you just start get dehydrated,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.130
overheated, anything like that,
you've got water with you.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.100
I talked a little bit about how you
want to bring food and maybe some snacks.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.700
I really like to just bring in
some high energy protein bars,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.000
energy bars, something like that.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.700
They have a fair number of pretty
healthy calories, that keep you going

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.840
for a while without taking up much space.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.480
Without making you
feel too heavy and full.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.080
A little bit of fresh
fruit is never a bad idea.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.700
I love apples.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.400
That's what I'm going with.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.500
I have a permanent marker.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.300
You never know when you're gonna
run into someone, if you're ever gonna

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.400
want to sign stuff and just in case
they don't have anything on them.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.600
You've got it covered.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.500
&gt;&gt; Oh, you've got a marker
that's so handy to have.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.000
&gt;&gt; Hand sanitizer or some wet wipes.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.300
I think these things are great.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.100
There are a lot of germs flying around
at a convention that's going to happen

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.740
when you've got lots of people,

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.100
and especially if you're
about to eat something.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.500
It's really nice to make sure your
hands are going to be nice and clean.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.720
So you're not just getting
those germs right into your face.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.100
No one wants to get sick.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.200
Phone charger.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.300
This is a spare battery.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.000
This has enough battery power to
fill my phone up like three times.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.120
It wasn't very expensive.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.200
It's not very heavy.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.600
Fits in my pack and I never have
to worry about my phone going dead.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.300
Finally, a spare pair of socks.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.580
You walk around your feet can get
kind of sweaty and gross.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.300
I like to have an extra pair of socks
for if that happens and then I put them

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.700
in a plastic bag so that I have
somewhere to put my

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.660
gross socks in afterwards.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.500
And then of course,
I am carrying around a backpack

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.700
that has some space in it.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.700
So if I pick up a souvenir, I've got
somewhere where I can just carry it

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.500
around, don't have to worry about it.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.200
You might have other stuff that you
always like to carry around.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.800
Let us know if you've got something
cool you think would help other people.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.200
Cons are a lot of fun.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.300
Hopefully some of these tips
and tricks will be useful for you

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.000
whether you've been
to no cons before or 50.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.600
There's always more to learn
and if you've got any cool tips

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.700
and tricks you want to share
let us know down in the comments.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.700
