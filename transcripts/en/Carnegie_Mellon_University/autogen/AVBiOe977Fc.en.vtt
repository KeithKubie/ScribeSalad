00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430
discipline really has things like
 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.860
discipline really has things like
painting a picture of the future with

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870
painting a picture of the future with
 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.120
painting a picture of the future with
their ideas in it

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130
their ideas in it
 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.999
their ideas in it
I'd love to see that you you you paint

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:20.009
I'd love to see that you you you paint
 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.580
I'd love to see that you you you paint
this picture of what you think is going

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590
this picture of what you think is going
 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.870
this picture of what you think is going
to happen or what you think should

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880
to happen or what you think should
 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.240
to happen or what you think should
happen and then by making it visual

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250
happen and then by making it visual
 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.090
happen and then by making it visual
other people can help I mean lots of

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100
other people can help I mean lots of
 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.070
other people can help I mean lots of
other people lots of other disciplines

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080
other people lots of other disciplines
 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.410
other people lots of other disciplines
get involved once you have that picture

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420
get involved once you have that picture
 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.720
get involved once you have that picture
of the future and that's what that's one

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730
of the future and that's what that's one
 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.060
of the future and that's what that's one
of the superpowers of designers I also

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070
of the superpowers of designers I also
 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.360
of the superpowers of designers I also
think being routinely innovative is not

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370
think being routinely innovative is not
 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.700
think being routinely innovative is not
normal you know I mean everybody else is

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710
normal you know I mean everybody else is
 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.100
normal you know I mean everybody else is
trying to figure out how to solve some

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110
trying to figure out how to solve some
 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.650
trying to figure out how to solve some
problem and designers are not that way

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660
problem and designers are not that way
 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.680
problem and designers are not that way
in my opinion they they they're much

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690
in my opinion they they they're much
 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.140
in my opinion they they they're much
more comfortable with ambiguity than the

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150
more comfortable with ambiguity than the
 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.210
more comfortable with ambiguity than the
normal discipline is and so you're in

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220
normal discipline is and so you're in
 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.070
normal discipline is and so you're in
this position designers are comfortable

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080
this position designers are comfortable
 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.470
this position designers are comfortable
in this position of not knowing which

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480
in this position of not knowing which
 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.390
in this position of not knowing which
allows you to stay in that position long

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400
allows you to stay in that position long
 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.130
allows you to stay in that position long
enough to come up with something that

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140
enough to come up with something that
 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.530
enough to come up with something that
really is meaningful to do as opposed to

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540
really is meaningful to do as opposed to
 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.140
really is meaningful to do as opposed to
I think most people that I'm involved

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150
I think most people that I'm involved
 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.990
I think most people that I'm involved
with feel the need to define the problem

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000
with feel the need to define the problem
 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.700
with feel the need to define the problem
quickly so they can get on with it

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710
quickly so they can get on with it
 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.470
quickly so they can get on with it
but once you define the problem so

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480
but once you define the problem so
 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.450
but once you define the problem so
quickly it's hard to pivot to a really

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460
quickly it's hard to pivot to a really
 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.160
quickly it's hard to pivot to a really
interesting problem or to a real

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170
interesting problem or to a real
 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.110
interesting problem or to a real
innovation and so that's one of their

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120
innovation and so that's one of their
 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.090
innovation and so that's one of their
superpowers and the other thing is this

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100
superpowers and the other thing is this
 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.780
superpowers and the other thing is this
holistic human centered approach you

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790
holistic human centered approach you
 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.660
holistic human centered approach you
know that this kind of you know you can

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670
know that this kind of you know you can
 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.180
know that this kind of you know you can
come at things from a digital from a

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190
come at things from a digital from a
 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.070
come at things from a digital from a
technical approach or from a business

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080
technical approach or from a business
 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.720
technical approach or from a business
approach but we tend to come into it

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730
approach but we tend to come into it
 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.850
approach but we tend to come into it
from the human side and I think this

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860
from the human side and I think this
 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.670
from the human side and I think this
really lowers barriers for other people

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680
really lowers barriers for other people
 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.440
really lowers barriers for other people
to come in and collaborate along with us

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450
to come in and collaborate along with us
 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.470
to come in and collaborate along with us
to start new to start new collaborations

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480
to start new to start new collaborations
 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.400
to start new to start new collaborations
you know it's just a much better

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410
you know it's just a much better
 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.710
you know it's just a much better
approach to the kind of holistic design

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720
approach to the kind of holistic design
 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.930
approach to the kind of holistic design
that we do now and I think designers

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940
that we do now and I think designers
 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.200
that we do now and I think designers
also have that superpower so today I'm

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210
also have that superpower so today I'm
 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.490
also have that superpower so today I'm
very excited for designers and design

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500
very excited for designers and design
 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.900
very excited for designers and design
designs having to respond to new

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910
designs having to respond to new
 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.540
designs having to respond to new
conditions and new requirements but

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550
conditions and new requirements but
 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.950
conditions and new requirements but
we're at the center of biggest as

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960
we're at the center of biggest as
 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.660
we're at the center of biggest as
carries over at the center of big issues

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670
carries over at the center of big issues
 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.530
carries over at the center of big issues
you know healthcare government education

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540
you know healthcare government education
 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.440
you know healthcare government education
climate change and we're also trying to

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450
climate change and we're also trying to
 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.690
climate change and we're also trying to
account to accommodate new disciplines

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700
account to accommodate new disciplines
 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.880
account to accommodate new disciplines
like designing for data these are all

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890
like designing for data these are all
 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.610
like designing for data these are all
big movements that are really making

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620
big movements that are really making
 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.600
big movements that are really making
this an exciting field so we finally

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610
this an exciting field so we finally
 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.420
this an exciting field so we finally
have a seat at the table and I think the

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430
have a seat at the table and I think the
 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.610
have a seat at the table and I think the
question is you know we've never had

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620
question is you know we've never had
 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.200
question is you know we've never had
this seat before what are we going to do

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210
this seat before what are we going to do
 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.200
this seat before what are we going to do
with it so my challenge to all of you is

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210
with it so my challenge to all of you is
 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.560
with it so my challenge to all of you is
how are you how are we how are you

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570
how are you how are we how are you
 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.480
how are you how are we how are you
going to use this new position to to

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490
going to use this new position to to
 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.380
going to use this new position to to
make a better world

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:46.390
make a better world
 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.200
make a better world
Thanks

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210
Thanks
 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:56.990
