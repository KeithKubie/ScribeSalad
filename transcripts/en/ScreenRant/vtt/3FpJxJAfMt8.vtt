00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.730
Marvel's The Avengers: Age of Ultron is a
guaranteed box office hit, but it's also the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.040
next big junction point in the Marvel Cinematic
Universe.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.150
That means there are more than a few story
threads and characters that could be introduced

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.050
or explored in the film, in order to further
expand the MCU into Phase 3 (and beyond).

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.310
Here are 10 Marvel Cinematic Universe Easter
Eggs Fans Want to See in Avengers 2.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.310
10.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.310
Black Panther's World

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.480
Marvel has a lot of new heroes coming in the
aftermath of Avengers 2, but in the case of

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.640
Black Panther, we don't expect the character
to really appear until Captain America: Civil

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.860
War.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.000
However, Black Panther's world and backstory
we fully expect to be referenced in Avengers

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
2.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.420
In Avengers 2, we know that Andy Serkis will
play Ulysses Klaw, a villain who, in the comics,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.320
steals an iconic metal called Vibranium from
Black Pather's homeland, Wakanda, killing

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.820
Black Panther's father in the process.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.710
Based on trailers, Klaw helps Ultron upgrade
his body with Vibranium - but how that goal

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.220
is achieved could set into motion events that
eventually bring Black Panther into contact

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.500
with The Avengers.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.560
9.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.560
World War Hulk

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.190
It's a big expectation that Hulk will be taking
a leave of absence after Avengers 2 - possibly

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.359
into space.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:18.810
That speculation has led to rumors of a "Planet
Hulk" movie, but that Marvel Comics story

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.619
about Hulk conquering an alien world has always
been too heavy with CGI and budget demands

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.210
to seem viable as a live-action movie.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.690
Even if we never actually see the events of
"Planet Hulk" onscreen, however, the "World

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:36.340
War Hulk" storyline (when Hulk returns to
Earth as a conquering warlord) is something

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.729
future movies could explore.

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:38.729
8.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.729
Ant-Man on Deck

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.869
In bold departure from Marvel Comics history,
Ant-Man (aka Hank Pym) won't be introduced

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.510
into the MCU until after Ultron has been created.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.210
But that doesn't mean that Pym's comic book
connections with the evil robot can't still

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.020
be referenced in some way.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.880
Age of Ultron trailers have already shown
flashbacks which bring historical elements

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.700
of the MCU to the forefront.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.100
One of those historical events could conceivably
be research done by Hank Pym that helps Tony

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.369
Stark create Ultron.

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.050
That's all speculation, but needless to say
fans are hoping some trace of the classic

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.110
Hank Pym/Ultron origin stays intact.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.110
7.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.110
Agents of Carter

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.290
Given the events of the first Avengers film,
there is still one big elephant-in-room within

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.040
the MCU: Phil Coulson's resurrection.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.720
Many fans hope that the world-threatening
events of Age of Ultron will at finally force

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.290
Coulson to re-unite with the super team he
first inspired to work together.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.200
On the villain side, HYDRA's experiments on
superpowered beings is something that AoS

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.220
and AoU will definitely have in common - and
there's also evidence in the trailers that

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.820
Peggy Carter will appear in Avengers 2.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.769
It seems clear that Marvel TV will at least
get some kind of reference from its big-budget

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:48.769
cousin.

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:49.769
6.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:50.769
Strange Magic

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.269
Avengers Age of Ultron is also the venue where
we expect to be introduced to yet another

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.430
new factor in the MCU (besides superpowers
and cosmic beings): magic.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.860
Based on what we've seen, there are possible
connections between the Scarlet Witch and

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.700
Doctor Strange, the big mystic in the Marvel
Universe, who will star in his own 2016 film

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.940
played by Benedict Cumberbatch.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.129
The source of Scarlet Witch's psychic/telekinetic
powers in Avengers 2 have been remained mysterious

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:18.860
- especially since the MCU cannot use mutants
in its films due to legal issues with Fox.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.049
Based on images and tie-in merchandise, Scarlet
Witch's powers in the movie seem to have the

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.019
same kind of stylized energy signature as
Doctor Strange, meaning Avengers 2 could be

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.440
the introduction to a whole realm of MCU magic.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.440
5.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.269
Beginning of the End... of Times

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.170
Avengers 2 will find Thor living amongst humanity
full-time as its protector; however, the Asgardian

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.090
prince's love of mankind could be sorely tested
by the time Age of Ultron is over is he could

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.030
return home only to face a greater threat
to the cosmos: Sultur and the fire demons.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.790
Now that we know Thor: Ragnarok is coming
to theaters, it's clear that while Thor and

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.510
the Avengers are battling evil robots on Earth,
events in Asgard are going to be headed toward

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.950
the end of days.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:59.970
4.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.480
Galactic Guardians

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.530
Since Guardians of the Galaxy became a hit,
fans have wondered when in where it will connect

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.640
to Avengers.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.959
Guardians director James Gunn has openly stated
that, at least for now, the franchise is more

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.000
of its own thing, but fans no doubt hope that
Age of Ultron will lay some kind of foundation

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.019
for a crossover, so things don't completely
jump the shark when Rocket Raccoon is eventually

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.900
trading banter with Tony Stark.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.170
Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet/Stones are
the most obvious way to connect the two franchises,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.660
so let's discuss THAT possibility...

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.360
3.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.700
Beginning of Infinity

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.890
Avengers 2 could very well be the film that
begins the process of turning Earth's Mightiest

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.810
Heroes into the Universe's Mightiest Heroes
- and the key may be found in Loki's scepter

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.360
from the first film.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.070
Marvel has already confirmed that Loki's scepter
IS one of the Infinity Stones, and it's speculated

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.390
that in Avengers 2 it is most likely be the
mind gem, which brings Ultron and/or The Vision

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.920
to life.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.420
And once the Infinity Stones are once again
in play on Earth, Thanos and his Infinity

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.260
War can't be far behind.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.260
2.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.530
Civil Start to War

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.860
The events of Age of Ultron (Tony Stark creating
an A.I. that threatens to destroy the world),

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.950
is sure going to put a strain on The Avengers
team - one that could conceivably fracture

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.230
Steve Rogers and Tony Stark's relationship,
in particular.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.220
In the aftermath of Avengers 2, Rogers and
Stark will likely be standing on opposite

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.690
sides of some kind of line, and by the time
Captain America: Civil War arrives, Cap and

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.560
his new team of Avengers could be going to
war against Stark and whatever authority he

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.000
wields.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.750
For fans watching Avengers 2, the hope is
to see good, weighty dramatic beginnings to

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.600
the Cap/Iron Man schism, and perhaps some
final (or post-credits) scene of what Captain

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.400
America's new Avengers roster looks like.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.590
1.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.600
Spidey Comes Home

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.600
One of the biggest headlines of the last few
years has been Sony finally lending Spider-Man

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.420
to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.490
Where, when and how Spidey will appear in
the MCU has been subject of debate and speculation

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.220
- but needless to say, fans are keeping fingers
crossed that Marvel has worked some kind of

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.840
introduction to the character into Avengers
2.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.230
With casting still a mystery, it's doubtful
that Spider-Man will appear in Avengers 2.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.550
But even one strand of his webbing seen during
a post-credit scene would be enough to get

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.630
Spidey mania going.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.150
That's it for our list of Easter Eggs fans
are keeping fingers crossed to see in The

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.150
Avengers: Age of Ultron!

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.610
Let us know in the comments if you have any
other MCU Easter Eggs you hope to see in Avengers

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.610
2!
