DAN GALPIN: Hello.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.500
I'm Dan Galpin for
The Developer Show.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.840
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.060
news from Google.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.000
In the rare case that a user's
Google account falls prey

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.840
to an attacker, the attacker can
also gain and maintain access

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.180
to your app via Google Sign In.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.120
That's where Cross Account
Protection comes in.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.430
It's a simple protocol
that enables two apps

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.470
to send and receive
security notifications

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.290
about a common user such
as account hijacked,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.390
account disabled, and more.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.820
To get started receiving
security events,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.960
take a look at the post linked
in the description below.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.290
Fuzzing is an automated method
for detecting bugs in software

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.070
that works by feeding unexpected
inputs to a target program.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.510
In order for fuzzing
to be truly effective,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.362
it must be continuous,
done at scale,

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:50.820
and integrated into
the development

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.950
process of a software project.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.840
To provide these
features for Chrome,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.510
we wrote ClusterFuzz, a
fuzzing infrastructure

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.210
running on over 25,000 cores.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.400
Today, we're announcing
that ClusterFuzz is now

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.240
open sourced and available
for anyone to use.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.820
Dopamine is our framework
for flexible reinforcement

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.600
learning.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.390
Dopamine 2.0 is now available
and includes support

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.940
for discrete domain
gym environments.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.650
Default configurations
are included

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.570
for two classic
control environments

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.530
that can be used to train a
Dopamine agent in minutes.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.930
A link to the GitHub
repo is on the post.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.940
The BigQuery sandbox
is now available.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.240
It's a credit-card-free
path to enable you

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.840
to experiment with most
BigQuery features at no cost.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.640
It provides you with
up to one terabyte

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.300
per month of query capacity
and 10 gigabytes of storage.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.940
Links to get started
are on the post.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.700
And if you want a cool
BigQuery dataset to play with,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.905
check out these six
new cryptocurrency data

00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:50.040
sets in BigQuery
public data sets.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.800
Stackdriver Profiler lets you
understand the performance

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.590
impact of your code down
to each function call

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.780
and without sacrificing speed.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.660
We've added new language and
platform support for Profiler,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.390
along with weighted filtering
and other new filters.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.540
All the details are on the post.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.580
App Engine flexible
environment now

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.030
supports the WebSocket
protocol in beta,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.530
which is the first time that
App Engine supports a streaming

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.610
protocol.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.310
WebSockets are great for use
cases such as real-time event

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.030
updates, notifications,
chat applications, feeds,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.790
collaborative editing tools,
and multiplayer games.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.300
Links to the documentation
are on the post.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.080
Chrome 73 Beta is now available
and includes constructive style

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.320
sheets, a new regular expression
function, and passive mouse

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.400
events.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.560
All the details with
code are on the post.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.230

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.172
Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:02:46.172 --> 00:02:47.630
I'm Dan Galpin
[ROLLS TONGUE] Show.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.930
[LAUGHS]

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.130
WOMAN: You've come a
long way since then.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.838
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:02:49.838 --> 00:02:50.980
