00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.410
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.780
I want to thank everybody
for coming.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.450
I know a few of you were at
the first luncheon that we had,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.780
and so your support is really
great and really appreciated.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.290
This one, the Library of Congress
Deaf Association sponsored this

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.840
event, so I want to
thank you for that.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.980
And this was a series -- first I do
want to talk about my internship.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.700
I'm an intern here at
the Library of Congress.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.720
During my time, I was
responsible for planning events,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.180
and these were the
three that I chose.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.340
Some of you came and some of you
were actually involved in the panel

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.430
for that one, so that
was really cool.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.470
The first one was technology
and telecommunications.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.860
Today we're going to be talking
about deaf art, what it looks like,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.810
what it represented, and some of
the behind meanings for deaf art.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.900
The last one will be within two
weeks, and it will be focusing

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.590 position:56%
on preserving American deaf culture.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.580
There is a fourth one,
and it's not listed.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.350
It's different than deaf culture.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.630
It's one that's specific
to my family.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.960
I'm of Samoan heritage,
and so it will delve

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.480
into the cultures of Samoa.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.110
So now, we will be
talking about De'VIA.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.840
If you don't know this
term, here it is.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.360
Little bit of my background on how
I became interested with De'VIA.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.600
I'm a student at Eastern Kentucky
University, which is where I came

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.730
from to do my internship.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:30.740
And there was one art class that
had such a wide range of art.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.160
They focused on poetry, art,
sculptures, and a wide range

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.870
of things, and that
piqued my interest.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.370
Before I want to show
you one of these pictures

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.940
that really mean something to me,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.280
I want to talk a little bit
about my family dynamic.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.210
And I come from a family of
six brothers and sisters.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.230
And this is my older sister --

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.530
&gt;&gt; Karen.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.600
&gt;&gt; Karen. And she's awesome,
just to let you know.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.580
And she was older than me, and
probably when I was five years old,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.950
she had already gone to
Gallaudet University,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.220 position:56%
and she was already a student there.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.540
So we had quite an age gap.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.670
And as I was growing up, I
didn't use sign language.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.650
&gt;&gt; I watched people signing.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.790
&gt;&gt; But I was able to watch and be
exposed to some of the letters,

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.860
some of the basic colors, and
some basic language exposure

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.960
at that time.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.330
As -- I'm trying to give a
summary of what happened but --

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:44.750
at the school, they provided an ASL
class when I was in high school,

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.230
probably around my sophomore year
in high school, when I went in

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.650
and I started to take ASL courses.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.110 position:56%
At that time, my sister was teaching
at San Diego State University,

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.020
and I had asked if she would sit
down with me on a weekly basis

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.100
so that I could learn more
and study more of her language

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.230
and could improve my skills.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.790 position:56%
She was obviously willing to do this
for me, and through our lessons,

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.000
I was able to develop not
only a relationship with her

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.240
but also develop my language.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.010
We were sisters and so we had
that relationship, but I realized

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.740
that through more language
acquisition that our --

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.340
&gt;&gt; That our relationship.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.820
&gt;&gt; Our relationship
was surface growing

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.150
up because we didn't have
the same language to use.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.810
As I started to learn, at that
time that I moved to Kentucky,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.320
and so my language classes, they
halted because I wasn't able

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.050
to work with her anymore.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.220
But then once I got to
Kentucky and settled,

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.480
then we started our courses again.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.310
None of my other brothers
and sisters knew ASL.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.610
Still to this day they don't.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.780
So for me, to be able
to have the relationship

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.050
with my sister is great, but none

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.570
of the other family
members seemed to learn.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.410
So understanding that there
were six of us, it's a lot.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.630
How De'VIA really --

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.930
&gt;&gt; Impacted me.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.020
&gt;&gt; Really impacted me
was by Warren Miller.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.530
This is an example and it's
called Family Tradition.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:57.220
And I wanted to show this
because my sister is one of six.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.730
And so you can see
the whole family here,

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.000
and then down in the corner there's
one that seems to be excluded.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.480 position:56%
All of them are having conversations
and seem to be involved,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.830
but then there's one
that's excluded.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.840
And it seems that that's to be
characterized, that's what happens

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.010
in families, that there's
always speech happening

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.280
and then there's one
that's sort of neglected.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.560
So when I first saw this,
I was quite emotional.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.870
&gt;&gt; I even cried.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.120
&gt;&gt; And even broke out in tears
seeing this because it had

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.340
such an impact and was symbolic
of the family that I grew up with,

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.300
having one deaf child in
such a large hearing family.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.390
This is truly a representation
of that.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.270
Yes, I'm able to hear myself,
but the relationship that I had

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.600
with my sister, I started
to embody some of the --

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.930
and understand some of the
oppression through her identity.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.910
&gt;&gt; And understand her
as a deaf woman.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.880
&gt;&gt; Then to even understand
her as a deaf woman.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.830 position:56%
And then everybody knows the "I love
you" hand shape, and that's seen

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.940
within this fingerprint, and
it shows a true embodiment

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.560
of the deaf culture
and the deaf identity.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.200
It becomes part of who
you are, and that I want

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.770
to support the deaf community,
I want to be involved,

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.470
I want the language acquisition.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.970
Yes, I'm motivated to
learn the language,

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.340
but it's also to become an
ally, and within the community,

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.340
and to really immerse myself in
the culture and the language.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.160
So now I want to introduce
the expert here

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.560
of De'VIA -- that's not me.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.570 position:56%
I'm a student, still learning, but
Lenore knows so much, and she's able

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:46.460
to in-depth explain about
De'VIA and what it is.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.960
She has some historical
context about what the art is,

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.120
and some of the importance of it.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.470
And --

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Do you remember what [inaudible]?

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.180
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.850
Let me introduce myself briefly.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.030
I've worked here for
quite some time, for --

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:07.330
&gt;&gt; Eight years.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.380
&gt;&gt; For eight years, and
many of you know me.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:15.620
In graduate school, I took courses
and I have a degree in art history.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.430
&gt;&gt; European American art.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.730
&gt;&gt; And I --

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.030
&gt;&gt; European American art.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.810
&gt;&gt; And studied European
American art.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.040 position:56%
Now, I have been here at the
Library of Congress for eight years,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.350
but I've been in Maryland
for about 20 years.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.040
I graduated from Gallaudet
University, and as I moved here

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.530
from Pennsylvania, I
ended up staying here.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:39.550
This is my home because of
a very large deaf community.

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.830
I went to Western Pennsylvania
School for the Deaf in Pittsburgh,

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.450
and when I moved here,
I decided to stay here,

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:47.880
you know, for cultural reasons.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.440
I don't have deaf in my family as
well, and in my small hometown back

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.250
in Pennsylvania there's
not a deaf community.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.920
And so this is like home for me.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.210
So let's talk a little
bit today about De'VIA.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.120
&gt;&gt; And the multiple
perspectives [inaudible].

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.320
&gt;&gt; We're going to look at multiple
perspective about deaf artists.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:13.770
Oh, thank you, Michaela,
you're quick on the draw there.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.920
So deaf artists have a long
tradition of creating art,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.660
both traditional and
contemporary art.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.590
And deaf art incorporates
the language

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.280
and culture of deaf artists.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.930
So there are so many different
aspects of culture and history,

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:35.740
our bodies, our sign language,
that are all included in De'VIA.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:42.800
So there are many components of
De'VIA, and these are listed here:

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.510
high contrast colors and
images, facial expressions,

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:54.670
[inaudible] the movement of our
hands, our eyes, our mouths.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:58.980
You'll see so many different
things incorporated in our art.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.570
And oftentimes, you'll
see us talking

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.510
about other people's
focus on our ears.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:10.850
But deaf art, it's focus is
on American Sign Language.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.160
&gt;&gt; Hello again.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:21.450
This is kind of a short
timeline that depicts De'VIA

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.090 position:56%
from its original start until today.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:31.670 position:56%
So the first box, it talks about the
time in the 1960s when they started

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:36.700
to realize that there
was a divergence and kind

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.550
of a difference in
the art in that time.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:44.040
It was in the '60s, and there
wasn't too much of an established

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.570
and announced culture at that time.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.810
So there was one group,
the deaf art movement,

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.820 position:56%
and a group of deaf students came
together and they started to analyze

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.510
and look at what is art
and what is the impact?

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.060
And that's where they
came up with De'VIA.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:04.680
A few years later, a person --

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:10.970
a woman named Betty Miller,
and that was in 1972,

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.760
Betty Miller, she was known
as the grandmother of De'VIA.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:24.010
And the reason for that was it
was the first all-deaf art exhibit

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.200
that she had curated.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.730
And it was called The Silent World.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.220
And that was in 1972.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:44.730
Then in '89, in deaf art, there
were a group of nine artists

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.840
that came together, and they
really wanted to look at,

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.740
how can we make this more profound?

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.180
How can we make this
have more of a movement?

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.830
They looked at what the manifesto
was, what the murals and what kind

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:03.050
of impact that they wanted De'VIA
to have on the overall culture.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.080
Another organization, Deaf
Artists of America, DAA,

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.910
they created an entire exhibit --

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.210
&gt;&gt; Gallery.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:20.200
&gt;&gt; It was a full gallery
of different --

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.500
&gt;&gt; Artists.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.430
&gt;&gt; Art, different preservations
and different exhibits

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.250
that were curated at that time.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:32.280
And then the big celebration
came at the 25th anniversary.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.050
What I was really excited
about, though,

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.590
was this, the Kentucky Deaf Fest.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:43.200
And so like I said, I was
from -- I am from Kentucky,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.990
and I was there during this year.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:50.500
So the Kentucky Deaf Fest,
it's a biannual festival,

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.390
and when I saw De'VIA, I didn't
really know what it meant

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:01.710
at that time, that it was so
all-encompassing of other facets.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:07.050
It also had skits with different
artists, there were comedians,

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:11.630
they told stories, and they had
different child exhibits as well.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:16.210 position:56%
So it was a full range of activities
for all of the participants.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:20.570
So if you ever have a chance
to go, they have food as well.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:28.010
So. So the 2012 was two
years prior, and then --

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.810
&gt;&gt; In 2014.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:34.040
&gt;&gt; Then they had the next
event which was in 2014.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.530
And this is where it continued to
grow into numerous other events

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.420
and continued to celebrate
the culture.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:48.390
There was one example at this event
is when they highlighted De'VIA,

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:53.270
and it was a true festival at that
time, and they really were able

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.950
to spread the word about De'VIA
and what the arts impact was.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.150
&gt;&gt; If you wouldn't
mind, I'd like to talk

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.280
about the timeline a little bit.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.240
The curator of De'VIA and the
different exhibits, it's hard --

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.100
you know, time has
flown over the years.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.090
I don't have exact
dates and times in mind,

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:21.800
but I went to a deaf De'VIA.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.920 position:56%
Within three years, folks are hoping

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.430
to organize another De'VIA
exhibit in the next three years.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.480
So hopefully the timeline
will continue.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.910
&gt;&gt; I know it's a lot, but if you
want to go ahead and read this,

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:45.740
this was really important
about who Dr. Betty Miller was

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.170
and the creation of De'VIA.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.510
And then --

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.810
&gt;&gt; The quote from her.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.390
&gt;&gt; This is the quote from her,
and it really talks about her art.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.040
So this was who we had
referred to previously

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.880
as the grandmother of De'VIA.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:06.970
And I also wanted to mention
that she did just recently pass.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:24.420
&gt;&gt; So I'd like to expand on De'VIA
through looking at actual artwork.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.860
Here you see two hands
that are chained

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.600
and fingers that are mangled.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.820
And this was about the prohibition
of American Sign Language.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.200
For so many years,
American Sign Language even

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.600
in deaf schools had
a focus on oralism --

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.510
people learning to hear and to
speak -- and not on sign language.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.930
And Betty Miller, remember
her age and at her time,

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.580
this was a very prevalent --

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.800
&gt;&gt; And unfortunate experience.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.800
&gt;&gt; And unfortunate experience
in the deaf community --

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.180
not one that I have experienced.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.260
Now, in deaf schools it's
very common for folks to --

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.550
teachers and audiologists to focus
on our ears and on our speech,

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.510
and so hearing tests
were a daily part of life

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.910
and speech training was
a daily part of life.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:20.300
But it was very arduous, because
the sense was that if you're going

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.660
to out in the big wide world,
you need to be able to speak,

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.000
you need to be able
to use your hearing.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.760
And I have, you know, education in
math and all of my regular studies,

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.780
and I enjoyed those classes but
I hated going to speech training.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:44.040
I just -- I can't tell you
what that experience is for me.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.560
&gt;&gt; I can't imagine her
experience [inaudible].

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.510
&gt;&gt; And I can't imagine Betty's
experience at that time.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.890
Now, this is Chuck Baird.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.690
He's a deaf artist and one
of the founders of De'VIA.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:00.740
He passed away two years ago.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.900
So here's his All-American
Breakfast.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.670
Can you see it here?

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.170
Now, some deaf people -- I think
you can see this and you'll catch

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:16.980
on pretty quickly, but the
syrup is in the shape of a hand.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.860
&gt;&gt; De'VIA is about
showing the sign language.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:23.200
&gt;&gt; De'VIA incorporates sign
language into the artwork itself.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.190
And so, when we sign "syrup,"

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:30.050
the artist actually depicted
the hands as the bottle.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.660
Now, in this one, art number two,
again, a focus on sign language.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:42.670 position:56%
You'll notice that it's backlit by
the heart, and it's focusing on art.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.190
These are -- you may not be able to
see them, but they're paint brushes

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.110
and pencils and so forth.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.510
Now, this is artwork
by Paul Johnston.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.560
He's a professor at
Gallaudet University and one

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.970
of my professors, and
a great teacher.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.280
I really enjoyed him as a
professor and also as a friend.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.730
And he'll be retiring this May, and
he is thrilled to start travelling

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:11.350
and now being able to focus
on his one art in retirement.

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:17.610
So this piece, Poetic
Hand, shows the expression

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:23.670
of American Sign Language in not
just conversation but poetically

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.580
and musically and rhythmically.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.840
And I think you can see the
movement in the picture itself.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.540
It really focuses on the beauty
of American Sign Language.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:40.020
In this piece, the
Theory of Language,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.830
there are five factors
that are included --

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.690
&gt;&gt; Features of De'VIA.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:49.390
&gt;&gt; As features of De'VIA.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.740
So the hands, and of
course your mind,

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.030
your eyes because it's a visual
language and a visual art form,

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:03.570
and of course we all still
have this struggle with speech

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.700
that often gets represented
in the artwork itself.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:13.310
But mostly the incorporation of
hands and not focusing on the ears

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.610
but focusing on the eyes.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.080
And so these are the kind
of the building blocks,

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.500
the features of De'VIA, the theory
of language itself using the eyes,

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:36.680
the ears, the hands, the
mouth, and the brain.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.890
&gt;&gt; And they all [inaudible].

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:45.990
&gt;&gt; And they all come together in
a theory of language, all right?

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.350
This is Susan Dupor.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.320
She lives in Wisconsin
and she's an artist there

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.960
at a deaf school in Wisconsin.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.780
&gt;&gt; Teacher [inaudible].

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:02.900
&gt;&gt; And as a teacher, she thinks
and incorporates the experiences

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.510
of children in her artwork.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.340
This is Deaf American.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.710
And you'll notice what's
in her hand.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.660
She doesn't look really happy.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.760
She says, "I don't know.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.230
This is what it have,
a hearing aid."

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:21.900
And it shows her contempt for
the hearing aids being forced.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.580
And that was a similar experience
for me for so many years.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.290
Everyone was focused on me wearing
hearing aids that were just noise

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:33.350
to me, and I really have enjoyed
the day that I was able to get rid

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.270
of my hearing aids and
enjoy peace and quiet.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.180
Now, this is entitled
The Family Dog.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:51.020
Now, this is maybe her view of her
family or maybe cousins or being

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:55.400
at a family gathering
that she feels fenced off

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.550
and not a part of the family.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:03.890
And Susan depicted herself
as a dog while everyone else

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:08.850
in the family is participating
in conversation and the business

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:13.360
of the family, and she had
felt left out and ignored.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:19.720
And this is her stark portrayal
of feeling like the family pet.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:24.940
And I need to say that this was an
experience that I had in my family

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.480
as well because my
family had no experience

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.500
with deaf people nor the language.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.770
My mom would finger spell
and she had home signs.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.830
For example, [inaudible]
she would --

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.370 position:56%
in ASL, this is the sign for school.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:43.080
My mom's version of it was
this because she thought, "Oh,

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.240
you go to the place
where you hold books."

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.800
So that was her sign.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.240
And so at Christmas or at
Thanksgiving, you know,

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.280 position:56%
the family is all there together but
it was still a lonely time for me.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.090
And you know, I would talk
to the family and say, "Hey,

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.570
what are you guys talking about?

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.870
Could you tell me?"

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.200
And it was really hard for them.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.140
And even to this day, you know,

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.380
families that don't sign don't
understand that experience.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] we'll tell you later.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.990
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, tell about the
whole, "We'll tell you later,

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.200
we'll tell you later" concept.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.680
&gt;&gt; Right. I think that's an
important thing, Michaela.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.550
Oftentimes deaf people in a
family or group will say, "Hey,

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:27.850
what are you talking about?"

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.150
They're like, "Oh, don't worry.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:30.450
We'll tell you later."

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:34.310
And that's such a common
experience that often happens to us

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.020 position:56%
in hearing families, and you know --

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.020
now, Pete, you all
know Pete Richey here.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.670
He is really fortunate.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.230
He comes from a family
where his father is deaf --

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.940
you know Alex Richey,
and his mother is deaf,

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.090
and they come from a deaf family.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:54.320
And there are hearing people
in the family who do sign.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.920
But as a deaf person, Pete never
would have had this concept

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.930
of a family because he
comes from a deaf family

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:03.540
with a full language intact.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.840
So you know --

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.140
&gt;&gt; I wish my parents were deaf.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.440
&gt;&gt; I wish my parents were deaf.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.510
Now, let's talk about the history

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:24.710
of deaf education in
Milan in the 1880s.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:29.570
American Sign Language
was under scrutiny.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:32.760
There was an announcement
in the education world

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.450
that sign language would
forever be forbidden

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.340
in the education of deaf people.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:46.360
And that was the theory that
was being promoted at that time,

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.870
that the best thing for deaf
people was to hear and to speak,

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:58.070
and not to use sign language that
separated them from the world.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:05.710
And so there was a large
educational influence at that time

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.460
by Alexander Graham Bell,
and I'm sure you know of him.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.330
Now, let's look over
at this painting here.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.470
Do you Goya's painting,
The Third of May?

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:17.090
Okay, and this is an actual event.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:20.270
This is the depiction of an
actual event tht happened

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:25.990
where people were being murdered,
and you understand that history.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.570
And this deaf artist
incorporated that,

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:32.000
said that this was
almost the murder of ASL.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.770 position:56%
It was almost the time that American
Sign Language had its demise.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:39.050
And this is by artist
Mary Jane Thornley.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:44.630
She has seen that artwork and
she got the idea of, "Wow,

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:49.030
I could portray something like
that using American Sign Language

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.330
in my art."

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.660
Now, this is Nancy Rourke.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.190
She's a well-known artist
and she lives in Colorado,

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.810
and she and I are good friends.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:02.160
And I have much of her
artwork in my house.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.490
I have some of Chuck
Baird's pieces as well.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:09.490
And I really value those
because since he has passed.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:13.640
But this is Nancy Rourke's artwork.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:19.600
So this one on your left says
The Fifth Grade Experience.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.790
&gt;&gt; It's a portrait.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.550
&gt;&gt; It's a self-portrait.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:29.150 position:56%
And the artist is portraying herself
as a doll with the eyes crossed

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:34.440
out with a large box,
which is her hearing aid.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.740
Her --

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.040
&gt;&gt; Button eyes.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.950
&gt;&gt; With button eyes, and a mouth
that's closed in stitches as well.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:47.460 position:56%
And the focus was for her not to see
but to actually focus on hearing.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.970
&gt;&gt; Big FM systems.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:53.480
&gt;&gt; And these FM systems, the
phonic ears, they were so bulky.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.610
Can you imagine being a little
kid out in the playground,

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.290
and trying to play ball
with the other kids

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.660
and having this phonic ear
on you, bouncing around

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.020
and the ear piece is falling out?

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.710
So this is her depiction
of the hearing community.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:11.670 position:56%
Now, she was in a mainstream school,
meaning that she was a deaf person

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:16.000
in a regular classroom
with all hearing people,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.990
and this was her identity that the
other kids would make fun of her

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:25.970
because she had to wear
this big plunky hearing aid,

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:29.120
and she had really felt
alone and depressed,

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.210
even being in a mainstream school.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:36.110
Now this piece is called
Coalition Peak.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:41.980
And Coalition Peak is
a concept about De'VIA.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:45.660
And in France, they also had --

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:46.960
&gt;&gt; Sortiss [phonetic] in France.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.260
Sortiss.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.710
&gt;&gt; They have a movement
of the sortiss

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.570
in France, the deaf community.

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.380
And so they were talking
about the deaf art movement

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.640
and the American art
movement being in coalition.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:05.230
And so they took an image here
of V-ditz [phonetic] who was

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.660
from the National Association
of the Deaf and their view

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:15.700
of American Sign Language as
showing, needing to survive.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:21.300
And so here's the word "defend,"
and portraying that we need

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.830
to defend American Sign
Language from the waves

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.910
of oralism and depression.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:33.580
And those waves, for so many years,
often affect the deaf community

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.720
and continue to affect the deaf
community, and it's the work

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:41.370
of artists to build a mountain
that protects the deaf community

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:44.360
from these waves of
oppression and oralism.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:50.700
And so, again, that's the word
"defense," preserving our culture,

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:56.250
defending our culture and
cherishing it as a value of ours.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.050
Oh, okay.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:13.230 position:56%
This is Tony Landon McGregor, a deaf
artist who is also Native American.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:17.790
He incorporated not
only his deaf experience

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:21.580
but his Native American
experience in his artwork.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:25.220
His art is so beautiful, it's hard

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:29.510
for this PowerPoint
to show this to you.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.370
This is a gourd, and
he has decorated it

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:36.210
in the Native American
style and themes

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:40.280
with American Sign Language
incorporated into the images.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.580
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] animals.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.880
&gt;&gt; So you can see the animals,

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.950
and this is very typical
of Native American Art.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:51.480
Here's another depiction
entitled ASL Eagle Painting.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.500
Again, a Native American
experience of incorporating animals

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.430
and nature, natural themes.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.680
He now lives in Texas.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.550
&gt;&gt; This is a landscape in Texas.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And you'll see the landscape
here, and then these are hand shapes

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:14.300
that show not the word "eagle" but
the forms of the wings, the claws,

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:20.220
and the head and the
beak and the eye.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.280 position:56%
Mary Rappazzo grew up in California,

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:30.180
and a lot of her artwork
is shown in many galleries.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.920
She's hard of hearing but she
has an experience of being deaf,

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:39.860
and she considers herself a
person who lives in two worlds.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:48.240 position:56%
So she talked here about deaf people
in a march and coming together

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:53.700
as one voice to support and to
speak out about the diversity

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:58.860
of deaf culture, and to
relinquish oppression.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.030
[Inaudible]

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.650
And so this was one of the marches.

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.540
And the deaf community
has marched so often

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.170
in its history for its rights.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:12.750
So this is something that
talks about the importance

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.790
of people coming together and
speaking up with one voice

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:17.560
for issues they believe in.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.780
This one is called
the Learning Circle.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:30.970
And here are people that are
talking as they're studying.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:36.270
But if you'll notice here,
the other person is reading,

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:41.740 position:56%
and there's a person outside of the
window, and they want to be involved

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.990
but they can't be involved in
the educational experience.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.500 position:56%
And so they feel -- this is
artwork that depicts someone feeling

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:53.270
as an outsider, [inaudible] and
it's similar to the other theme

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.970
that you saw earlier in
the family dog painting.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.000
&gt;&gt; One voice [inaudible].

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.090 position:56%
And how also talking about like DPN,

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:19.860
the Deaf President Now,
and how that relates.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.280
[Inaudible]

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.460
&gt;&gt; So people may not know
about DPN, Deaf President Now,

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.720
and that was what -- in '88, '89?

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.430
The spring of -- right.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:35.870
And if you were here
in D.C. at that time,

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:39.000
you knew about the
Deaf President Now.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.060
So a little bit of history about
that is that there was a president

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:50.040
of Gallaudet who was a person who
is hearing and not a deaf person.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.930
And when they were
electing a new president,

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.630
they decided to hire
a hearing person.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:02.820 position:56%
And the deaf people were enraged,
and there was a huge protest covered

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.940
in national and international news.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.660
And the deaf people had to speak

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.960
up with one voice to
get what they wanted.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.890
They wanted a deaf person
to lead a deaf institution.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:16.450
And so Deaf President
Now prevailed, and I.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:19.910
King Jordan was named as
president of Gallaudet University.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:24.130
And so that was definitely one
great example in the history

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:28.280
of the deaf community of people
coming together with one voice.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:32.750
This is Ellen Mansfield.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.250
She lives nearby in
Frederick, Maryland.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:42.740
She graduated from New York
Art College and had moved here

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:47.360
and has lived here,
continuing [inaudible],

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:52.370
working in various art
forms and art genres.

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:59.970
She knows that some deaf
schools, the education --

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:04.350
or a mainstream school puts
a person out on the streets

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:06.930
if they don't get a
quality of education.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:12.930
And so she has really
been a proponent

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:17.850
of using American Sign Language
as a way to teach deaf children.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:21.050
Not to use what's called TC
-- total communication --

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:24.210
where you sign and
speak at the same time.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:30.560
And so what she's saying is that
this is the result of oppression,

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.880
that over time, you can
actually be out on the streets

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.380
and end up being a beggar.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:43.080
And that's one of the effects that
deaf people do know in society.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.370
And the goal, from
this artist's view,

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:49.280
is to have American Sign
Language for full inclusion

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.630
and education of deaf people.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:56.530
&gt;&gt; This is her self-portrait.

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.230
&gt;&gt; So this is her self-portrait,
I Will Never Forget.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.710
&gt;&gt; She was going to
mainstream school and --

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:06.000
&gt;&gt; She went to a mainstreaming
school and it was --

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.780
and she was a product
of oral education.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.450
She terms itself here, the
victims of oral education.

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:15.770
It was an experience that
was engrained on her,

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:17.530 position:56%
that Sign Language was not valued --

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:21.950
that only speaking and only
hearing was valued in society.

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:23.390
&gt;&gt; It wasn't until way later --

00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:27.570
&gt;&gt; And it wasn't until many
years later, where she learned

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.220
about American Sign Language.

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.520
Now, she had the experience --

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.900
and other deaf people have had
the experience of being wacked

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.940
on the hands with wooden
spools and things, rulers, to

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.540
&gt;&gt; For signing.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.020
For signing.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.540
&gt;&gt; To punish them for signing.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:48.080
Now, at Western Pennsylvania
School for the Deaf in Pittsburgh,

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:52.730
that I went to, I heard
that there were the days

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:54.840
where classes before me had gone

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.700
through that kind of
corporal punishment.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:01.110
And when I came along much
later, fortunately for me,

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:04.820
they used American Sign
Language in deaf education.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:12.330
&gt;&gt; So this is the last slide
and the last art that we had.

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:17.860 position:56%
But I really wanted to focus on this
and to really look at the art here

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.910
and to see the multiple
perspectives,

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:23.110
to figure out what the
feelings are when you look

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:25.300
at this type of painting.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:29.920
When you look at this
hunger for ASL,

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:35.470
when you hear about the Milan
conference in Italy from 1880,

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:40.240 position:56%
and you really see the emergence
from where ASL was previously banned

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.320
to now an inclusion in education.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:47.340
So you see how it's
affecting getting jobs,

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.640
how it's affects everything.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.910
And the oppression of the
language really affects your life

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.840
and pursuit of happiness.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:01.170
The language and the culture is
everything and understanding,

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:04.960
for so many, culture is their life.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.430
So now would be a great time.

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:10.970
We can field some questions
if anybody has any.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.130
And we would ask that if anyone
is going to use Sign Language,

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:17.940
that they could come up
to the front of the room.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:32.690
[Inaudible]

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.610
Hello, everyone.

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.040
My name is Lacorum [phonetic],

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:41.070
and I am from South San
Diego here in California.

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:44.780
I was really excited to be
a part of this and to --

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.220
it was a great presentation.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.520
But I was really excited.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:53.850
What does it mean here, to see
the black hands at the bottom?

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:55.150
What is your take on that?

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:57.850
What do you think that means?

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:02.410
&gt;&gt; Well, these are hands --
the hands of oppression and --

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:08.750 position:56%
oh, and I'm sorry, I need to be over
a little bit better for the filming.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.050
Thank you.

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:11.350
All right.

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:12.650
Let's see.

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:16.350
So these images show the
[inaudible] depression,

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:19.810
the anger -- the negative aspects.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:21.400
Because they weren't
allowed to sign.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.250
They were starved for ASL.

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.680
&gt;&gt; And it's almost
like [inaudible] dead.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.930
&gt;&gt; And it's almost like
the hands are dead,

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:30.690 position:56%
that they don't -- they're lifeless.

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:33.900
[Inaudible] And you'll notice
again this other image is framed

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.650
in darkness as well.

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:40.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I did notice
that dark at the side.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:43.070
Thank you very much.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:47.490
Other questions?

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:52.110
If anybody -- I know there are
several members of the audience

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:56.760
that are deaf, so if anybody
wants to comment, they could.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.760
Fred, you want to come up?

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.060
Yeah, please.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:07.890
Hello, everybody.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:11.570
You know, as I'm looking at this
art, I think this is really great.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:15.130
I know there was the
one with the family

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:17.180
that showed everybody was just
talking while this deaf person

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.210
stands at the sidelines
and isn't included.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:24.300
And that happens when
people, as I was born --

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.010
I was born deaf, and
I was a military brat.

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:33.640 position:56%
And I tell you what, that
experience was even more incredible.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.800
So it was --

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.100
&gt;&gt; And I was a brat --

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.250
&gt;&gt; Really, and speaking of
military brat, I was a brat.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:45.010
You know, I often spoke out and
was in New York and when my mom --

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.710
when we got there, it was in
Ellis Island and the family,

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:54.360
we were in New York and
we tried to go out --

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.960
my whole family's excited to go
out one day and do something.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.890
But I was deaf and
so was my brother.

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:05.700
And so what I would do,
I would start to pick

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.900
on people to get attention.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.590
You know, it was the way
that I had to act out so

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:12.000
that I could get attention.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.900
And so every member of my family --
that was my way to get attention.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.840
I would just pester
and pester and pester,

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.240
until I could finally get
attention and get access

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:27.800
to what people were saying.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.950
[Inaudible] You know, no one
enjoyed that, but it was only way

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.940
that I could get attention.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.110
In Providence, Rhode Island
my experience for education

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:37.540
with signing was banned as well.

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.790
It was all speech-focused.

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:41.250
It was -- it's called
an oral approach,

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:46.370
and so we had to just put your
hands down and practice speaking.

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:49.540
And people often said, you know,

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.450
I had a deaf voice
and things like that.

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:56.380
But I learned Sign Language
way later, probably --

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.490
&gt;&gt; Not until I was 14 or 15 --

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:03.460
&gt;&gt; No sign language exposure
until I was 14, 15 years old.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.750
And so thank God for
Kendall School for the Deaf,

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:08.580
which is in Washington,
DC, near Gallaudet.

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.370
So happy that, you know,
I could finally embrace

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:13.350 position:56%
and find peace with a deaf identity.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:15.250
Like Lenore said about
this FM system,

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:18.270
this big box with these
bulky ear things,

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:20.520
to finally just get rid of that.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.010
And to see -- I don't know
how you hearing people deal

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:25.930
with the sounds every day.

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:32.350
But you know, I am deaf, I am
proud deaf and I was born deaf,

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:34.520
and so I know how happy I am.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.820
So thank you.

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:40.750
Other comments?

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:42.550
Yeah, come on up.

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:48.180
[ Inaudible ]

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.480
Hello, everybody.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.760
I'm Alex Richey, and I was born
and raised in a deaf family.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:58.030
I went to a school for the
deaf, and it was in the '50s.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:01.210
I was six at the time
when I was in first grade.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:04.750
And we were able to
sign at the deaf school.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:06.660
We did practice speech
reading every day

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:08.410
and we did do the headphone things,

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:12.020
but there was one teacher
specifically that I remember

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:15.140 position:56%
that really struggled with me on how

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.180
to pronounce the L. I
just couldn't get it.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.110
And she would get mad at me,

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.510
and we would fight, and
I would get spanked.

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:25.790
I got pulled over the knee so
many times, and I would sob

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:28.940
until the two chairs
would go together.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.460
They would get all of the
students together and throw all

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:36.450
of their clothes in
together and would cover me

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.060
with all of these clothes.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.440
And that was really
traumatic for me.

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.030
And I could never still
forgive that teacher

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:44.590
for the humiliation at that time.

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:47.920
And that was one of the really
negative experiences that I had.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.100
Still to this time -- I
know every once in a while,

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:56.000
over all of these years, I still
feel, you know, humiliated.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.560
What she did to me in front of
all of the other students and how

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.320
that has still affected me.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:05.470
And so, you know, I never wanted
to tell my parents about that,

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:08.670
because I knew that my father
would go after that teacher.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:12.130
But I never told, never
did anything.

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:13.590
But that was one of
my bad experiences

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:15.950
of growing up, learning oral.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.580
Other comments?

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.880
Or does anybody want
to share anything else?

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.180
Is there --

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:40.350
I'm curious if everybody
understands what -- I'm sorry.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:42.330
Make sure I'm in the right place.

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:43.790
It's interesting, deaf
culture, right?

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:45.960
How we have to figure out where
to stand, how the lights go.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:52.480
So I was wondering if
people understood when --

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.040
if the interpreters, when the
sign for TC, total communication,

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.180
if the interpreters really
portrayed what that means.

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.130
And if not, I want to go
through a little bit of that

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:02.700
to explain what this means.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.200
This total communication.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.510
It means that the voice
-- you're trying to speak,

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.930
while you're signing,
at the same time.

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:14.200
So you're liked focusing on your
vocal cords, the mouth patterns.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.850
And so there's a situation
where you're trying to --

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.150
&gt;&gt; The voice always dominates --

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:21.330
&gt;&gt; Your voice always
dominates the Sign Language,

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:22.710
and so the signing is no good.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:24.010
It's lax.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:25.310
&gt;&gt; It's muddled.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:27.860
&gt;&gt; So the person that can sort
of hear, you know, I can do that.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.230
There are other people
that are similar to me --

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:33.040 position:56%
you know, if they have a hearing
aid or they consider themselves hard

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.410
of hearing, I can lip read
and look very closely,

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:40.020
but once I turn my head, I have
no access to that information.

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:43.320
And so that specifically only
works for that situation.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.040
So for this total communication
approach, you have to meet people

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.770
that are exactly similar in
that mode of communication.

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.180
If a deaf person is on
the sidelines watching us,

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.060
they have no idea what's going on.

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.330
And they have a very
hard time understanding.

00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:58.750
So that's why that
mode isn't effective,

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:01.300
and ASL is something
that I cherish as well.

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.730
Taking off those hearing
aids is fantastic for ASL.

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:10.490 position:56%
And you must, because once I take my
hearing aids off, I'm out as well.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:14.090
You know, I have to think, what
happens if my battery dies?

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:18.920 position:56%
Then I have to write back and forth,
and I struggle with communication.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.000
And it's the same people that
I communicate with fine today,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.500
tomorrow I could be
completely in the dark.

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:31.560
So just try to imagine that, with
these deaf children in schools,

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.090
and most of the teachers that
they're growing up with --

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:36.900
even if they were at
a deaf school --

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.850 position:56%
that approach of total communication
and their signing and trying

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:43.620
to speak at the same time, these
children are not able to hear.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:47.820 position:56%
You have to be able to hear some and
have some hearing ability for that,

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.800
as well as English awareness.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:55.040
&gt;&gt; And other people won't
have the exact same experience

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.340
as you as well.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.300
Let me add to that.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:02.810
Total communication, TC,

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:10.960
was a method of education
that was used in deaf schools,

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.110
but you really didn't
get an education.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:17.110
There were signs, but it was
still following English word order

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:18.410
and word structure.

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:23.610
And it was still left to the
deaf person to do all the work.

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:27.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And so understanding that we have
organizations that are out there

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.690
that are really supporting and
advocating for deaf children

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:35.030
as they're born to right away give
them access to a visual language.

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:38.540
Imagine being -- and I know I
already explained some of that --

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:42.730
there was a workshop with Craig
Anderson that had happened before.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.210
I know [inaudible]
there was one PowerPoint

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:49.010
that explained that
-- a baby is born.

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:54.680 position:56%
They immediately have access to
language, so imagine a deaf child --

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.630 position:56%
and other members of the family are
all hearing, and they're all talking

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:03.110
and communicating, while this baby
has no absorption of any language.

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:05.730
They're not able to pick
up anything from them.

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:09.060
So there are years
of miscommunication.

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:12.090
And that's why there's such a
delay in education for deaf,

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.160
as well as the development
of language.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.340
These skills that we're noticing
in language are so behind

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.430
and when they're able to get into
a school, they finally are able

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:23.540
to start learning and have
exposure to education and the way

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:25.600
that things around them work.

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.940 position:56%
[Inaudible] And notice they're here,
they're starving for communication,

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.980
and it's because of the void
that they've had for so long.

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.570
Often we see that the
English skills --

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:38.510
we notice it looks like a
second language learner.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:41.830
And like, oh, this person who is
deaf is writing in broken English,

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:43.800
and that's not proper grammar.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.190
Well, because they didn't learn
it until way later in life.

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:49.170
They didn't have access to it until
they were five, six years old.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:52.450
So it's terrible when we see that.

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:57.010
So I just wanted to
mention that, so that's all.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:58.740
We got an applause --

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:02.060
&gt;&gt; So we need to close.

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:07.890
&gt;&gt; One last comment.

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:12.520
Sorry. It will be real
short, real short.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.530
So as we watched what
she just said --

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:19.020
did you see her facial expressions
and the way that Ellie was

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:22.760
when she was talking, you can look
and see how animated she really is.

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.610
That right there is the
portrayal of deaf culture.

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:28.500
You know, when you can point
-- some parents are like, oh,

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.960
don't point at me like
that, you know.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.820
That seems to be a faux
pas in hearing culture.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.680
But there's the directness
that happens within

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.950
and the facial expressions
and the animation that happens

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:41.390
within the deaf culture, that
that's how we portray things,

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:43.740
and that's how things go.

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:48.390
And when a hearing person is
not animated, we see no gesture.

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:50.290
We miss out on some
of that communication,

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:52.230
because it's within the voice.

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:56.380
And a lot of people misunderstand
deaf when we are really animated.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.840
But that's part of the language.

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:05.330
Sorry. We have to wrap up.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:09.880
There's other people that
are trying to use this room.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.000
[Inaudible] Because it's --

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.670
their was a topic from
the audience that --

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:15.970
&gt;&gt; Would be a whole new discussion.

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:18.350
&gt;&gt; Needed a whole bunch.

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.700
So okay. I wanted to
cite my sources.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.940
There was no plagiarism.

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:32.750
And so remember I told you that
there were other upcoming events?

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:36.880
There was one more that
is deaf culture-focused.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:45.520
And the person that's coming
here will be Max Williamson,

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:49.460 position:56%
and he will be coming and helping
with the presentation and be talking

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:53.610
about the past and other
movies and the preservation

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:56.910
of the language, as
well as deaf culture.

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:58.430
So thank you so much.

00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:59.730
That is it.

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:01.130
And hopefully see you
at the next one.

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:02.430
Thank you everybody.

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:04.420
Bye-bye.

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:08.070
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
