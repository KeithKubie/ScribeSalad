- NO, I DON'T WANT--

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:08.408

PLEASE LEAVE.

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:09.910

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:13.614
- MY NAME IS--I'M DENISE.
I'M JUST--I'M DENISE.

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:16.016
- CAN I TELL YOU A SECRET?
- SURE.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.551
- I WAS CRATE TRAINED.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:18.952
- WELL, THAT'S COOL.

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:21.188

FROM THE MOVIE KAT--

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:27.027

- THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.029
I MISS MY REAL CLOTHES,
THOUGH.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.698
BELIEVE IT OR NOT I'M NOT
NORMALLY DRESSED LIKE KATNISS.

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:33.300
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME?

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.736
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO GET
HERE, I'M NOT EVEN FROM HERE.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.007
I FLEW ON AN AIRPLANE TO COME
MEET MY AUNT ELIZABETH.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.808
BUT SHE DIDN'T EVEN COME
MEET ME AT THE AIRPORT.

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:43.610
NOW I'M LIVING IN A DOGHOUSE.

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:45.979
- RIGHT? IT'S LIKE
YOU CAN'T TRUST ADULTS.

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:48.882
- YOU CAN'T CRUSH THE DOLT?

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.551
- YOU CAN'T TRUST ADULTS.

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:52.719
- OH, YOU--
WELL, YEAH, YOU CAN.

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:54.087
YOU JUST HAVE TO
TRUST THE RIGHT ONES.

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.789
- ARE YOU SCARED?

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.658
- I NEED, LIKE,
A PARENT OR A GUARDIAN

00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:58.992
TO GET ME OUT OF HERE.

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:02.095
- I WANNA BE WILD AND
RUN AWAY FROM RESPONSIBILITY,

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.332
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M LIKE,
"THIS GIRL NEEDS MY HELP."

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:08.402
- I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.838
- DENISE, THIS IS MY FRIEND
RON FUNCHES.

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:13.273
- ARE YOU FROM THE ORIGINAL
MOTION PICTURE <i>DICK TRACY</i>

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:15.976
STARRING WARREN BEATTY AND HIS
GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME MADONNA?

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.779
- YOU'RE GOOD AT MOVIES.
- THANK YOU.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:22.316
- RON FUNCHES, WHAT SHOULD I DO?
THIS POOR GIRL NEEDS HELP.

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:23.884
- ANSWER'S ON YOUR ARM, MAN.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.520
WHY DO YOU THINK
WE TATTOOED YOU?

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:29.356
- "MAKING GOOD CHOICES,
SETTING LIMITS."

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:31.325
I'M GONNA GET YOU
OUTTA HERE, DENISE.

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:32.626
YOU TRUST ME?

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.529
- YES, C-CZAR.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:38.131
- ALL RIGHT, DENISE.
- OKAY.

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:40.400
- I CAN FEEL MY PARENTAL
INSTINCTS KICKING IN.

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:42.402
[triumphant synthesizer music]

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:43.937
AND I SEE
A LITTLE GIRL IN NEED

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:47.207
AND I WANNA STRAIGHT-UP
HELP YOU.

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:50.377
BECAUSE I'M A VILLAIN.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.413
BUT I'M A GOOD VILLAIN.
