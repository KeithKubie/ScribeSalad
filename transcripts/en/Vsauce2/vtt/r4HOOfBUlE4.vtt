00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.820
Vsauce!

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.560
Kevin here, I’m gonna play a song I wrote
just for you.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.950
Ready?

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.130
Here we go.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.609
[drill noise] Wait, is this a song?

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.679
Is a drill… music?

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.289
Actually let’s back up a second.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.710
Like all the way back.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.210
Let’s put you back in the womb.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.210
 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.260
Hey, can you hear me?

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.320
You’re listening to your first song.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:51.410
That consistent rhythm is the beat of your
mother’s heart.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:04.540
The uterine blood and amniotic fluid flowing
around you create that gentle drone.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:12.220
Consonants and high frequency sounds are filtered
by the layers of skin and fat in your mother’s

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.220
abdomen, but you can hear a soft melody of
low frequency bass and vowels.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.220
Your eyelids are closed until 28 weeks after
conception, but you start to hear at week

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.220
18.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.220
Before even knowing there’s a world to see,
you’re immersed in a world of music.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.220
Ah, you’ve been born!

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.930
Welcome to humanity -- and your brain has
gifted you with musicality.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.700
While music is a social and cultural construct,
meaning that it’s something we create ourselves,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.610
musicality describes the mental processes
that underlie musical behavior and perception.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.690
Your brain is trained to respond to emotional
and intonational aspects of the human voice,

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.300
an important feature of human biology.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:47.020
Despite only an 8% body mass difference, adult
males have a voice about 50% deeper than females.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.160
Your brain adapts to processing information
being delivered at different pitches, but

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.740
studies show Tweety Bird and the rest of the
animal kingdom have trouble with this.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.369
Relative pitch allows you recognize relationships
between notes to transpose the same tune in

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.770
a different key.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.191
So if you hear “Mary Had A Little Lamb”
sung in a high pitch by Mickey Mouse or in

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:14.250
a low pitch by Darth Vader, you’ll still
recognize that it’s “Mary Had A Little

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.250
Lamb.”

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.760
Tweety Bird and Curious George would think
they were completely different songs.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.170
Okay, humans notice the nuance of pitch.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.440
But what happens when you lose the sense of
hearing or never had it in the first place?

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.660
The brains of the deaf and hard of hearing
can rewire to feel music rather than hear

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.660
it.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.600
The information is processed in the brain
similarly to how others hear sound.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.950
Even without the ability to hear, music finds
its way into our bodies.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:54.700
And for some people that experience results
in feeling...meh!

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.010
An estimated 4% of humans lack musicality.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.210
Amusia is an inability to recognize pitch
changes and can include problems with musical

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.370
recognition and memory.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.780
This causes difficulty understanding not only
the emotion of music, but also nuances of

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.850
language.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.790
Like being able to distinguish the pitch change
that differentiates statements from questions.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.810
This is a statement.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.000
This is a question?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.900
And their short-term pitch sequence memory
deficiency prevents amusics from forming the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.690
story of music in their minds -- to remember
the pitches they’ve heard, to anticipate

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.010
their repetition, and to be aroused by their
changes.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.010
Yet some can process pitch and still not derive
any gratification from music.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.180
Most people physiologically react to pleasurable
music with higher skin conductance and heart

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.170
rate, but researchers found that people with
musical anhedonia show no relationship between

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.680
musical enjoyment and a physiological response.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.400
While music can give most people chills, a
dopamine increase in the nucleus accumbens,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.150
music to them is just kinda...friend-zoned.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.010
These musical disorders show us that music
isn’t just about processing sound -- it’s

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.900
about using that sound to understand the thoughts
and feelings of others.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.910
An education that begins after the doctor
slaps your tiny butt cheeks and your mom starts

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.750
babbling in your crying cute little infant
face.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.720
Baby talk or Motherese is a type of speech
marked by exaggerated pitch.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.930
Our earliest understanding of verbal communication
involves Prosody, the rhythmic patterns of

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.370
stress and intonation in language.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.830
“Mama.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.300
Dada.”

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.550
Without that pitch change it sounds emotionless,
robotic and kinda creepy.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.360
“MAMA.”

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.130
Studies show babies pay more attention when
they hear exaggerated pitch, length, and timbre.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.570
Their brains love the excitement of surprises.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.870
Pitch can matter a lot to meaning; it’s
so important in Mandarin Chinese that the

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.130
same word can have completely different meanings
based on how you say it.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.920
“Ma” can mean mother, lazy, hemp or horse.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.840
Before kids learn syntax, they may learn the
building blocks of language through The Alphabet

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.840
Song.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.090
Which comes from a French folk song Mozart
popularized in ‘Twelve Variations on ’Ah

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.670
vous dirai-je, Maman’ -- later becoming
Baa, Baa Black Sheep and Twinkle, Twinkle

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.890
Little Star.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.930
It’s a popular tune.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.780
Not only does musicality help with language
and predates the alphabet song, musicality

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.310
predates the alphabet itself... and all written
language.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.440
By a lot.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.750
Middle Age bards, Beethoven, and Beyoncé
didn't invent musical communication.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.520
Before our ancestors developed writing -- values,
memories, and customs were conveyed through

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.520
song.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.520
Sacred song-cycles honored the Gods, passed
down histories and were the essential medium

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.870
of memory.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.830
Ethnomusicologist John Blacking suggests singing
and dancing preceded homo sapiens by several

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.200
hundred thousand years.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.740
Caves are full of acoustic reverberations,
like your shower, that must’ve made Caveman

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.620
Ugg feel like Pavarotti.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.270
But Ugg couldn’t just make noise - Ugg needed
notes.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.950
Unlike noise which features sharp, erratic
waveforms, notes are repeating ripple patterns

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:30.950
of sound.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.310
A hammer hitting a nail creates an irregular
ripple of air pressure while a flute can create

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.430
a consistent ripple that repeats over and
over.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.740
An easy way to produce notes is with a column.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.740
 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.840
Flutes and clarinets vibrate the air within
a column.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.210
Strings are columns that can vibrate.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.200
Pressing a tightly-stretched string against
the neck of an instrument shortens its length,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.140
which alters its vibration and pitch.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:05.030
The consistent whirring of a spinning drill
produces a musical note and sustaining it

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:12.280
is a form of drone music.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.100
Controlling notes and creating music make
audible order out of nature’s chaos.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:23.010
Darkness is scary and overwhelming because
you can’t see what danger may be lurking...

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.180
but you can renew your comfort with light.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.670
Silence reflects the absence of life.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.340
We often say it’s, “Dead quiet.”

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.130
But you can fight back with sound.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.920
And in that battle, you form a relationship
with people you’ll never meet.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:46.530
As the language of emotion and physiological
arousal, music is a fundamental method of

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.600
connecting you to others.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:54.120
Preliterate tribes used music to unify the
group in times of danger; songs are used in

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.919
religious services to coalesce the group.

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:02.430
In music, collaborating becomes proof that
the sum can be greater than its individual

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.840
parts.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:10.850
Music welds you together with others at parties,
clubs, weddings, work, and even funerals.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.060
Concerts are a celebration of collective cultural
unity.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:19.170
In movies, music reinforces and heightens
the emotion of the scene.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:24.930
National anthems reflect the history, values,
and dreams of entire countries made up of

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:29.220
millions of people past, present, and future.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:37.750
Music unites what you see, what you hear,
what you think, and what you feel -- literally.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.070
Sound physically touches you.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.580
My voice is touching your ear drums and causing
them to go in and out.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.940
I’m moving part of you with every word.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:53.540
Music is so intrinsically tied to our motor
systems that children have difficulty remaining

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.980
still when singing.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:00.610
A study of music’s effects on exercise showed
cyclists who synchronized their movement with

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.960
music required 7% less oxygen than those who
didn’t.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.610
The rhythm and tempo of music can unlock
the body for sufferers of Parkinson’s disease,

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.130
freeing them to move despite the disease freezing
their movement.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:21.200
It’s the soundtrack to our motion and behavior
- consciously and subconsciously.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.779
Background music in stores influences shoppers
to stay longer and buy more.

00:09:26.779 --> 00:09:31.530
If classical music is playing in a liquor
store, you’re more likely to buy more expensive

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.530
wine.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.810
If French music is playing, you’re more
likely to buy French wine.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:42.750
Music drives cultural behaviors -- and connects
us to time, which is why songs arouse a strong

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.990
sense of nostalgia.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.620
Your head is like a jukebox with eyeballs.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:54.490
The songs you know become part of your mental
catalog, and you’re able to recall them

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.610
with incredible accuracy.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:02.970
Earworms are those catchy, bits of music that
repeat over and over sometimes called “involuntary

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:03.970
musical imagery.”

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:10.230
It’s also possible to remember almost
nothing but music.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:16.060
In his book, Musicophilia, Oliver Sacks tells
the tale of former renowned musician and conductor

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:22.390
Clive Wearing who, after a brain infection,
had virtually his entire memory erased.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:27.740
Retrograde amnesia left him unable to recall
his past and his anterograde amnesia only

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.760
allows his short term memory to last only
up to 30 seconds.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:38.420
After every handful of blinks, Clive’s eyes
open to a brand new world.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:44.930
His subsequent loneliness, confusion and constant
fear left him feeling robbed of consciousness.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:50.080
He says, “It’s like being dead.”

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.120
In an attempt to regain control of his life,
he started keeping a journal.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:01.050
But the entries amounted to simply repeating
the same sentiment and crossing out the previous

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.050
one.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.150
This time properly awake.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.040
This time finally awake.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.920
This time completely awake.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.180
One of Clive’s only portals back his life
is his wife, Deborah.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:22.510
To him, her visits to the facility where he
lives are a miracle, resulting in sobbing

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.930
and clinging to her presence.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:29.830
But within minutes of her departure he leaves
messages for her saying, “Please come and

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:33.350
see me, darling -- it’s been ages since
I’ve seen you.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.490
Please fly here at the speed of light.”

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:43.589
She would’ve had to travel at the speed
of light to get there before Clive forgot

00:11:43.589 --> 00:11:46.250
that he needed to see her.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:52.649
The only other gateway to himself, the only
thing that holds him in the state of being

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:54.870
Clive -- is music.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.980
He plays the piano, sings, and learns new
songs.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.730
While eating a chocolate bar, he is constantly
surprised by how the bar is changing because

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.890
he forgets that he has been eating it.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:11.589
But as he plays music, his symptoms are suspended
temporarily.

00:12:11.589 --> 00:12:15.990
Music allows a precious moment in which Clive
Wearing is…

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.080
Clive Wearing again.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:25.660
The momentum of the music briefly keeps him
afloat before sinking back down into that

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.740
lost place.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:36.890
Through music, he stays awake...completely
awake...until the song is over.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:44.200
An 1886 painting by George Frederic Watts
depicts Hope as a blindfolded woman sitting

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:51.070
on the globe, clutching a broken harp and
desperately listening to the sound of a single,

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:57.130
frail string -- the only one that remains.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:02.560
As long as you have music and the ability
to embrace meaning from the sounds around

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.700
you, you cannot be alone.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.600
That is…

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.510
Hope.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:28.199
And as always - thanks for watching.
