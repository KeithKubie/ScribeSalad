00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.240
Why Do Olympians Wear Colored Tape?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.349
The colored tape the Olympians and other athletes
wear is called “Kinesio® Tex Tape”, which

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.110
is essentially just an elastic cotton strip
with an acrylic, heat activated adhesive.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.810
The tape was designed in the 1970s by a Japanese
chiropractic and acupuncture specialist, Kenzo

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.810
Kase.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.050
To date, there hasn’t been a single reputable
study that conclusively shows this tape actually

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.949
does anything the makers and athletes claim
it does, though as Kevin Anderson, director

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.170
of Kinesio UK, states “There’s a lot more
needed on the research side to confirm the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.410
positive results we’re seeing so far.”

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.379
(In truth, there have been numerous studies
in the over 30 years this tape has been around

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.359
and so far the results of using the tape have
been more or less in-line with the placebo

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:53.359
effect.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.269
It’s interesting that the company itself
can make such claims when they apparently

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.659
have not done research themselves to back
them despite being around for over 30 years;

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.650
otherwise, I’d assume Mr. Anderson would
be citing said research, rather than saying

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.650
research is needed.)

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.080
So to answer your question as to why Olympians
and other athletes are wearing colored tape

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.510
– because they think it helps in some medically
significant way.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.070
The lack of evidence to support this never
stopped athletes from wearing Phiten bracelets/necklaces

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.100
or Power Balance holographic bracelets, which
in their heyday both got amazing reviews from

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.710
athletes as to the performance benefits, only
to go out of fashion when it was conclusively

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.940
shown that they didn’t do anything (and
when the sponsorship dollars to said athletes

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.090
dried up).

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.820
So it’s not surprising that Kinesio tape
has become popular; it certainly seems more

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.970
believably beneficial than an over priced
plastic bracelet with a holographic sticker

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:53.970
on it.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.680
Further, the placebo benefit is potentially
better than nothing.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.600
Basically, if nothing else, it’s probably
good in such athletic competitions to think

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.470
you have a slight edge… the power of positive
thinking and all that.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.490
As Amy Powell, associate professor of sports
medicine at the University of Utah School

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.800
of Medicine said in a recent interview, “Anything
that [athletes] perceive as an edge, they’ll

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.020
try, whether it’s scientific or not.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.080
And the athletes are convinced that [Kinesio
tape] is really helpful.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.320
It wouldn’t be the worst placebo in the
world; it’s not doing any harm.”

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.000
As mentioned, this tape has been around for
a while, even seen in the Olympics since 1988,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.160
but has only relatively recently become widely
popular among athletes after Kinesio very

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.660
wisely donated 50,000 rolls of their tape
to be used by various Olympians from 58 countries

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.210
during the 2008 Olympic Games.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.350
They also switched gears from primarily offering
skin colored tape to pushing other colors.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.470
They say on their website, “The colors were
developed to be compatible with color therapy…”

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.570
Yep, color therapy.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.620
And, more accurate and surprisingly candid,
they go on to state the colors were made to

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.660
“provide field advertising at athletic events,
a conversational opener, and instant product

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.660
recognition.”

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.440
According to sports chiropractor and strength
and conditioning specialist, Chad Peters,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.040
they also “paid [Olympic volleyball player]
Kerri Walsh to wear black tape instead of

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.090
flesh tones in Beijing.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.180
After that, it just exploded.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.470
Everybody wanted it.”

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.480
Specifically, after the Beijing games, sales
skyrocketed to 300% of what they were before

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.090
and Kinesio tape has become “must use”
by athletes the world over.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.700
As to what the tape is supposed to do, this
is from the Kinesio website,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.400
In cases of injury or overuse, the muscle
loses its elasticity.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.050
Dr. Kase needed to develop a tape that would
have the same elasticity as healthy human

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.050
muscle.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.840
He knew from his practice that the tape would
also need to stay on the skin where it was

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840
applied.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.020
He spent two years doing a lot of research
relating to elasticity, adhesives and breathability.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.129
Finally, he came up with a tape that possessed
the proper degree of elasticity, and that

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.370
lifts the skin microscopically.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.220
From that beginning, Kinesio® Tex Tape was
invented.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.180
Its unique properties were based on a study
of kinesiology.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.550
Kinesio® Tex Tape is used to

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.280
Re-educate the neuromuscular system
Reduce pain

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.819
Optimize performance
Prevent injury

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:21.489
Promote improved circulation and healing
…Kinesio® Tex Tape is used to treat anything

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.500
from headaches to foot problems and everything
in between.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.570
As to the inspiration behind the tape, Kenzo
Kase states, “Our pain sensors are located

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.270
between the epidermis and the dermis, the
first and second layers of your skin, so I

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.850
thought that if I applied tape to the pain,
it would lift the epidermis slightly up and

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.160
make a space between the two layers.”

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.610
To date, the main study that is often cited
seeming to indicate that the Kinesio tape

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.100
actually does any of these things better than
a placebo is The Clinical Efficacy of Kinesio

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.290
Tape for Shoulder Pain: A randomized, Double-blinded,
Clinical Trial.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.670
Unfortunately for Kinesio, there are quite
a lot of problems with the way this study

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:09.490
was done and even then the results don’t
say what many media outlets are saying it

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.820
does.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.020
The first questionable aspect of the study
is the fact that its primary author is a certified

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.430
Kinesio taping practitioner and someone who
has applied for two patents for Kinesio-type

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.430
tape.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.620
Granted, in a study like this, you need a
Kinesio expert to apply the tape, but it brings

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.340
up the question of bias when the primary author
has great interest in the study providing

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.880
a positive result.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.270
It would be better to simply hire a Kinesio
expert to apply the tape and have independent

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.970
parties actually perform the study.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.449
Nevertheless, just because a certified Kinesio
Taping practitioner was the primary author,

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.870
if his methods were sound, we can’t throw
out the results altogether.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.380
So were there any other problems with the
study?

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.950
In a word, yes.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.110
64 people were initially eligible for this
study, with applicable shoulder problems,

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.260
but 22 were weeded out as “an attempt to
eliminate subjects with pathology that would

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.949
be less likely to respond to the selected
taping intervention.”

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:12.040
While it is good to weed out subjects that
aren’t fit for what you’re studying, weeding

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.410
them out because “they would be less likely
to respond to the selected taping intervention”

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.750
sounds an awful lot like trying to fix the
results, not selecting from “randomized”

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.130
test subjects, as the title implies.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.290
Again, not conclusively showing bias, as maybe
they really did weed out subjects simply because

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.560
they weren’t fit for the study, but their
wording sounds fishy.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.630
Further, such a small sample-size is also
questionable, in terms of actually providing

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.820
conclusive results, positive or negative,
unless there was a clear, strong contrast

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.870
between the control and the test subjects.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.650
This brings us to the real problem with this
study.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.140
There is no control group.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.550
Both the “control” group and the test
subjects had Kinesio tape applied.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.990
The only difference was that one group had
the tape correctly applied, based on the methods

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.090
taught to Kinesio taping practitioners, the
other group had it incorrectly applied, but

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.960
it was the same Kinesio tape both times.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.310
This might be proper if studying the benefits
of one method of applying the tape vs. another,

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.340
but not to study whether the elastic tape
actually does something or not.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.850
Again, as with the small sample size, whether
the results came out positive, negative, or

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.110
inconclusive, one can hardly take them seriously
in this context.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.410
And, in fact, their so-called “control”
group showed similar results as the ones given

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.830
the correct taping method.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.770
Specifically, the final results of this study
can be summed up (though in a much more glowing

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.160
way in the paper, highlighting initial possible
differences within the first 48 hours that

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.840
went away after) as: some people got better,
some people got worse with the correctly taped

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.500
group, and some people got better and some
worse with the incorrectly taped group.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.050
Or, as they state in the paper, “The improvement
noted in both groups makes it difficult to

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:57.390
determine any specificity of effect the intended
therapeutic tape application may have had

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.850
over the sham application for all outcome
measures in this study.”

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.210
Despite the results explicitly being inconclusive,
the small sample size, the potential bias

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.600
of the author, and the lack of control group,
this paper is often cited in the media as

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.340
conclusively showing the tape was beneficial
for helping with shoulder problems.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:20.130
I was going to write about a few additional
studies on the effects (or often lack thereof)

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.740
of Kinesio tape, but this article’s already
about 10 times longer than I anticipated it

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.170
would be and I’m guessing there are about
zero people that made it this far.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.949
But just in case I’m wrong, I’ll refer
you few brave souls that waded through the

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:35.540
last 1500 words or so, and for some odd reason
want more, to several linked studies at the

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:41.969
top of the References below if you’d like
to read up more on studies pertaining to Kinesio

00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:47.540
tape, including one such study that simply
looked at 97 other studies on Kinesio tape’s

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.540
“effectiveness”.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.220
For the most part, they all seem to conclude
with something to the effect of “Use of

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:57.290
the tape doesn’t seem to produce clinically
significant results, but more rigorous testing

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.120
is needed to be sure.”

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.790
But a few are very slightly more positive,
leaning towards thinking there is at least

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.770
some benefit, even if not what the company
claims, though again tending to state that

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:14.709
more rigorous testing is needed to be sure
and to test whether any type of tape would

00:09:14.709 --> 00:09:16.100
have the same benefit.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:22.660
So in the end, is Kinesio tape actually beneficial
with respect to “reducing pain, optimizing

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:27.380
performance, preventing injury, promoting
improved circulation and healing, and re-educating

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.270
the neuromuscular system”?

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:35.750
Probably not, at least not for all those claims,
but the placebo effect can’t be ignored

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:40.500
completely in terms of perhaps providing some
benefit to athletes, if they believe the tape

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.500
works.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.500
And, who knows?

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.380
Maybe someday someone will prove that Kinesio
tape really is beneficial beyond what would

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.070
be expected with the placebo effect, possibly
even lining up with some of their claims!

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.930
Stranger things have happened and the use
of an elastic tape to help support inflamed

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.800
or sore body parts as they move seems like
it probably could be helpful, just perhaps

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.470
not at treating “anything from headaches
to foot problems and everything in between”.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:10.200
As Dr. David Geier, orthopedic surgeon and
director of sports medicine at the Medical

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.370
University of South Carolina stated, “If
there is structural damage like a torn ACL

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:32.350
or meniscus, it’s not going to be effective;
after all, it’s tape.”
