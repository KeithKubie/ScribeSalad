00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:11.120
What Happens to Sherlock Holmes' Mail

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.260
When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle first began writing
Sherlock Holmes stories back in the late 19th

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.560
century, 221B Baker Street didn’t exist.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.050
While Baker Street itself existed, and still
exists today, the numbers on the street back

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.909
when Doyle wrote the Sherlock Holmes novels
and when Holmes was supposed to reside there

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:34.539
(1881 to 1904 according to Doyle’s original
stories) only went into the hundreds.

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.059
It would seem that Doyle intentionally picked
an address that didn’t exist.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.059
This all changed in the 1930s when the street
numbers in London were rejigged and reallocated

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.480
to make things a little more streamlined.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.039
During the reallocation, a recently constructed
building for the Abbey Road Building Society

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:56.200
(aka Santander), known as “Abbey House”
was awarded all of the odd numbers between

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.260
219 and 229.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.580
Because the address 221 Baker Street now existed,
all of the mail that fans across the world

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.950
had inexplicably sent to Holmes not knowing
that he didn’t exist, now had a place to

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.950
be delivered.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.220
It’s noted that as soon as the bank began
trading from the building on March 18, 1932,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.790
they were inundated with dozens of letters
addressed to Holmes.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.329
While most of the letters were basically just
fan mail or nice messages wishing the detective

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.259
well, the bank were surprised to find a decent
number of people who’d written to ask for

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.259
Holmes’ help.

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.159
Now you’re probably thinking that a large,
faceless corporation like a bank would have

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.990
dismissed these letters as an annoyance and
have them shredded or something, but that

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.990
didn’t happen.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.079
Instead, the bank went out and hired someone
to serve as “Sherlock Holmes’ personal

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.420
secretary” and charged them with reading
and responding to the mail.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.021
Rather than sending a stock reply on bank
stationary explaining that Sherlock Holmes

00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:55.430
wasn’t real, this secretary would write
back explaining that Holmes had retired to

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.890
go live in the country and raise bees on a
farm in South Downs in Sussex.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.350
Fans of Sherlock Holmes may recognise this
as being where Arthur Conan Doyle himself

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.820
claims the detective went in his twilight
years in the short stories, The Lion’s Mane,

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.660
The Blanched Soldiers and His Last Bow.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.650
Needless to say, Abbey National did their
homework when it came to staying consistent

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.670
with Holmes’ back story.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.709
According to Nikki Capar, who worked as Holmes’
secretary in the 1980s, she’d also sometimes

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.819
write back to fans as Sherlock Holmes using
quotes from the aforementioned stories, often

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.120
telling fans that she (Holmes) had “given
myself up entirely to that soothing life of

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.459
Nature for which I had so often yearned during
the long years spent amid the gloom of London.”

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.620
As it turned out, the bank quite enjoyed the
attention of sharing their address with one

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.700
of London’s most famous fictional residents,
so much so that they had a small plaque commissioned

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.159
to sit outside the building and on their 150th
anniversary even paid for the creation of

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.930
a bronze statue that currently sits outside
the Baker Street entrance to the tube.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.860
Sherlock-holmes-museumIn 1990, though, things
turned a little sour when the Sherlock Holmes

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.620
museum opened nearby and suddenly decided
that they should be the only ones who were

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.909
allowed to open Sherlock Holmes’ fan mail.

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:15.319
Although the museum was located between 237
and 241 Baker Street, they argued that as

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.670
an authority on Sherlock Holmes, there were
better equipped to deal with his correspondence

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.780
than a billion dollar company with virtually
unlimited resources that had been doing an

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.780
admirable job at exactly that for about five
decades straight.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.000
The museum even put a plaque outside their
building declaring that the museum was the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.269
real home of Sherlock Holmes.

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.080
The courts didn’t agree and they ruled in
favour of the bank, since, well, they did

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.959
technically own 221 Baker Street and it wasn’t
their fault that people kept sending letters

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.200
there to a guy who didn’t exist.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.840
The museum fought this decision for over a
decade until 2002, when the bank, which was

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.950
then known as Abbey National, moved its headquarters
to nearby Triton Square.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.250
By this point, Westminster council had grown
pretty sick of dealing with the issue and

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.909
when the bank moved, they granted the museum
exclusive rights to use the address 221B Baker

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:31.259
Street, even though the museum itself still
resided between 237 and 241 Baker Street.
