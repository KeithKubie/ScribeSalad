00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.680

(gentle music)

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.660
- Today I have a special pleasure

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.100
of introducing Charles McCurdy.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.700
I'll say three or four things about him.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.540
First we're at the University
of California Berkeley

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.790
and we're very happy to
say that our speaker today

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.320
is a graduate of the University
of California at San Diego.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.210
And he went on and did his doctorate

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.900
at the University of
California at San Diego.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.180
And then not being the purist
that I thought he might be

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.640
he didn't stay for postdoctoral
work there he went to Yale,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.200
for Yale Law School where he
was in a very famous program

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.290
that was run by Stanton
Wheeler at the Yale Law School

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.110
on Law Society studies.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.000
And then he went on to
the University of Virginia

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.420
where he has been teaching
for close to 40 years.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.070
And he has a remarkable
wonderful reputation

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.220
for undergraduate, PhD and law teaching.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.370
And he's a professor of law and of history

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.640
at that institution and he
is renowned in the profession

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.010
of legal history and
Constitutional History.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.640
Not only for his own wonderful work

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.000
but for the way he has trained
so well so many students.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.560
Possibly more than any other individual

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.450
directing PhD programs in America.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.510
I think that's actually,

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:11.610
that's an accurate statement.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.500
If not he's certainly
way up there in numbers

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.200
and certainly very far up
there in the distinction

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.550
of those who work with him.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.533
The last thing I should
speak of is his scholarship.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.160
He has a remarkable record.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.280
His early work was on Stephen J. Field,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.290
the conservative California justice

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.810
who went on to Washington to become

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.483
for a long period of decades.

00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:43.290
A key member of a court
that was moving more

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.470
and more toward a conservative

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.750
and regulatory pro-business position.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.360
And for historically Field had been seen

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.580
as a knee-jerk conservative

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.900
who just gave business
community what it wanted.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.800
But Charles McCurdy's work
changed that picture radically

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.460
and gave a much more complete picture

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.700
of what judicial conservatism was like

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.010
in the late 19th century in the large.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.560
And it was a much more
complicated phenomenon.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.620
And nobody in the field
has been able to write

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.040
the way people were writing
back in 60s about that court

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.910
or about judicial
conservatism and it's largely

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.530
if not to say exclusively is
the result of his early work.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.440
And then he moved from
that into larger studies.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.940
Studies on a larger
canvas of property law,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.890
anti-trust, the police power and Taxation.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.520
And in general one can
say as he's described

00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:46.640
in the publicity that
came for this lecture.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.800
He's been interested in the
relationship of ideology,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.610
economic change and political movements

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.330
and has given us a very rich picture

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.250
of the dynamics of change
in the legal system

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.950
as a working system as well
as in what we call the law.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.950
The narrower sense jurisprudence
and theory and courts.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.170
And he among his many publications,

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.273
he has continued to publish
over the years on Stephan Field.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.230
He did a another
path-breaking work on Field's

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.500
jurisprudence on the California Court,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.470
which really made us all
think very differently

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.460
about property law.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.650
Because he found and described brilliantly

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.350
how the court was
allocating property rights.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.090
And playing a role in setting priorities

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.900
among mining, agriculture,
commerce and other sectors.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.480
So again it's a terrific
legacy in the study

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.820
of American legal and constitutional
history that he's left.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.380
And he did more than anyone
I think to open up the field

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.380
in very new rich way of
California law historically.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.790
He then turned east and did a study

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.290
of the anti-rent movement in New York,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.060
which was a similar kind of study

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.830
in terms of looking at
a very radical ideology

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.320
that concerned property rights.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.320
And the inheritance in an
area of upstate New York

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.443
of essentially medieval tax claims

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:21.450
on servitude claims on the land.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.120
And there was a very dramatic uprising

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.290
and he wrote a really big book,

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.080
a very big book on all the aspects of this

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.880
in the way I've just discussed, sorry.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.070
In the way I've just discussed
and it was richly rewarded.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.520
Because every three years a prize called

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.610
the Order of the Coif prize
is given for the best book

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.260
in law over a three-year period.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.150
And he and another
historian shared that prize.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.200
When you think about
the outpouring of books

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.700
and the frenzy over originalism

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.130
and all the rest that's
going on in recent years

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.870
this was a wonderful achievement.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.070
And everyone in the field of legal

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.220
and constitutional
history is indebted to him

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.400
for having conquered all the prejudices

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.510
of a conservative bar in recognizing

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.070
the importance of this
kind of scholarship.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.940
So welcome back to the
University of California

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.600
especially to Berkeley, Charles,

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.470
where you taught first semester

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.730
to the benefit of our students.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.390
He actually took my courses
they didn't want me back,

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.650
students wanted just have him stay.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.700
And it's just good to have you back

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.820
and we look forward to your lecture

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.010
which is on America's first war on terror.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.010
Jeffersonian period appropriately enough

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.422
and concerning constitutional debate

00:06:35.422 --> 00:06:37.620
of the Alien and Sedition Acts.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.901
Charles McCurdy.

00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:39.759
(applause)

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.926
- Oh come along everybody.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.240
- Well thank you very much
for that warm introduction.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.770
He didn't say what's
probably the most important

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.370
connection between us.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.430
He directed my PhD dissertation

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.250
at the University of
California San Diego in 1966.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.686
And has been a shameless a
promoter of my career ever since.

00:07:03.686 --> 00:07:04.519
(audience laughs)

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:08.750
And I am forever grateful to him for that

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.050
and for also whatever part he played.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.060
I know others, I know Waldo Martin

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.890
were on the on the committee.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:19.530
And this place has always
been regarded by me,

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.900
a native California and
I grew up in Pasadena,

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.440
as the Mecca of academic life.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.060
The Mecca of learning and scholarship

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.990
in the whole country.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.170
And to come back under
these auspices today

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.373
is, well it's very exciting.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.900
During the first decade of governance

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.480
under the Constitution
of the United States,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.370
the young Republic confronted
a foreign policy crisis

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.640
that fractured the body
politic and produced

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.170
an age of political violence in America

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.010
as well as in Europe.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.920
The reign of terror in
revolutionary France

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.460
sparked the crisis.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.400
And the ensuing wars of
the French Revolution,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.400
which lasted from 1793 to
1815, sustained the crisis.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.710
President George Washington
issued a neutrality proclamation

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.800
in April of 1793.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.700
But the American people were not neutral.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:23.350
Federalists just despised
the godless bedlam in Paris

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.750
and prayed for fervently
for a British victory

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.090
over French anarchy.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.810
As feelings heightened Republicans

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:36.810
were just as attached to the
cause of revolutionary France.

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:39.950
And his feelings heightened
the partisan language

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.110
of politically active Americans

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.370
grew increasingly strident and extreme.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.400
One theme common to everyone's talk

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.130
was the fragility of
Republic's in a hostile world.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.010
And so Republicans described
the Federalists in power

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.700
not only as Anglophiles
but also as monarchists

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.588
or monocrats, who intended to subvert

00:09:02.588 --> 00:09:07.340
the Republicans state of
Liberty and not only in America

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.780
but everywhere in the world.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.070
Fantastic motives were ascribed

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:15.660
to every federalist
initiative in the Congress

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.470
and in Atlantic diplomacy.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.670
Federalists responded in kind.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.150
They not only denounced
the Jacobin members

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.230
of the Republican opposition

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.730
but also insisted often and vehemently

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.970
that political opposition
when concerted and organized

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.400
was equivalent to subversion.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.260
And this was especially true

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.880
if it were orchestrated
by a foreign power.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.910
And as the nation inched
toward what we now call

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.734
the quasi-war with France in 1798.

00:09:47.734 --> 00:09:52.370
Congress translated into law

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:56.150
the Federalists' claim
that Republican opposition

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.813
had put the very Republic in peril.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.930
And so they passed the Sedition Act,

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.410
which is the heart of my lecture today.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:08.000
The Sedition Act made it a federal crime

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.307
and I quote, "To write,
publish, utter or print

00:10:12.307 --> 00:10:15.457
"any false scandalous
and malicious writing

00:10:15.457 --> 00:10:18.287
"against the United
States or the President

00:10:18.287 --> 00:10:21.787
"of the United States or
either house of the Congress

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:24.057
"of the United States, with the intent

00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:25.887
"to excite against them the hatred

00:10:25.887 --> 00:10:28.207
"of the good people of the United States

00:10:28.207 --> 00:10:30.997
"or to stir up sedition among them."

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.230
Now the Sedition Act has
the dubious distinction

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.010
of being the only statute
enacted by Congress

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.970
in the 18th century to be
declared unconstitutional

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.960
by the Supreme Court of the United States

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.880
in the 20th century.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.430
In a case called New
York Times and Sullivan

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.430
decided in 1964 Justice William
Brennan performed the deed.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.820
And there established what he called

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.070
the central meaning of
the First Amendment.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.700
The central meaning of the First Amendment

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.130
he said as he (garbled audio) old statute

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.050
unconstitutional he said,
that central meeting

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.390
was that debate on public issues

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.230
should be uninhibited,
robust and wide open.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.650
And it may well be what will be included

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.870
are vehement, caustic and sometimes

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.980
unpleasantly sharp attacks on government

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.333
and public officials.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.690
Now at first glance at
least Brennan's description

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.230
of the central meaning of
the First Amendment in 1965,

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.770
sounds very much like John
Adams defense of free government

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.790
in his dissertation on
the cannon and feudal law

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.593
published in 1765.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.110
Behind Parliament's claim
to tax the inhabitants

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.310
of the British colonies Adams wrote

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.850
during the Stamp Act crisis of 1765,

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.120
lay the divine miraculous
origin of government

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.630
with which the priesthood had
enveloped the feudal monarch

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.710
in clouds and mysteries.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.030
The thing said Adams had
always been different

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.440
in Massachusetts.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.220
Its government was founded on knowledge

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.423
generally diffused through
the whole body of the people.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.470
Let every sluice of knowledge
be opened and flowing,

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.130
said Adams in 1765.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:20.130
Let us dare to think and
speak and think and write.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.400
I said think twice, one of them was read.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.673
Let us dare to read and
think and speak and write.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:33.150
The irony of course is that in 1798,

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:37.433
President John Adams signed
a Sedition Act into law.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.283
And there's more.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.180
Neither Adams nor the house
and the Senate majorities

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.700
who voted for it or the
Supreme Court justices

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.200
who sustained it against
constitutional attack

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.320
13 different times between 1798 and 1801

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.800
doubted the competence of Congress

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.183
to make seditious libel a federal crime.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.750
In their view the Sedition
Act was fully warranted

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.000
by the Constitution of the United States.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.540
Now describing how Adams
and the Federalists

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.513
reached this conclusion is my
first task in this lecture.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.950
Three components of
the Federalist argument

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.320
require attention.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.340
First the Federalists had an argument

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.040
about the scope of the First Amendment's

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.260
guarantee of a free press.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.870
Second the Federals had an argument

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.280
about the inherent powers
of the national government.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.490
And third the Federalists had an argument

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.230
about the coextensive relationship

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.520
between the federal legislative power

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.910
and the federal judicial power.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.400
Now as I reconstruct this Federalist view

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.100
I hope that you will be impressed
by its logical coherence

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.803
even if you aren't persuaded
by the arguments themselves.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.540
My second task is to account
for the nature and scope

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.780
of the Republican critique
of the Sedition Act.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.770
Culminating in the famous Virginia

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.510
and Kentucky resolutions of 1798.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.730
And two years later in
Thomas Jefferson's victory

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.560
over Adams in the election of 1800.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.730
A victory that Jefferson
never ceased to call

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.973
the revolution of 1800.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.450
It follows that my third
task is to describe

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.560
the ramifications of
that revolution of 1800

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.090
for American constitutional politics.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.090
And specifically for the
freedom of the press,

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.070
for the Federalist
doctrine of inherent powers

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.900
and for the Federalist idea of coextensive

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.701
legislative and judicial power.

00:14:35.701 --> 00:14:38.300
In other words I don't need to explain

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.420
whether the election of 1800

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.210
generated a constitutional revolution

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.260
as well as a political revolution.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.517
And if it did just how
extensive or how limited

00:14:48.517 --> 00:14:51.763
are these constitutional
changes turned out to be.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.750
Now along this route it's my intention

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.850
to establish some larger claims

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:00.140
about constitutional thought,
constitutional practice

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.910
and constitutional change in
the United States history.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.070
But you'll have to be patient.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.390
Historians have a penchant
for telling stories

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.570
that move from the
particular to the general.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.020
Rather than the general and the particular

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.170
and history has been my principle

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.193
discipline for as long as I can remember.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.830
So the Federalist argument
on freedom of the press.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.120
For Adams and his friends the Sedition Act

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.500
did not abridge as the First
Amendment says it must not,

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.360
freedom of the press at all.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.510
Because at common law
the freedom of the press

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.080
had been understood
for more than a century

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.300
as the right to publish
without prior censorship

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.180
by government officials.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.620
Prior restraint of
publication was forbidden.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.210
But freedom of the press
did not entail immunity

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.140
from subsequent prosecution.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.550
For licentiousness,
seditious or subversive words

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.530
that excited the people and inclined them

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.320
to subvert the authority or rule

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.160
of duly constituted public officials.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.030
In other words the Federalists subscribed

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:10.320
to what we now call the
Leonard levy thesis.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.510
Named for the great civil libertarian

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:16.160
and historian of American
law who recovered

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.620
and reconstructed the Federalist argument

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.093
about freedom of the
press in the early 1960s.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.900
May be pointed out that there was little

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.080
or no evidence suggesting that the framers

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.600
of the Constitution free press clause

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.320
intended to supersede the common law.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.040
And he insisted that there
were substantial evidence

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.770
that they did not intend to do so.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.510
In Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts for example,

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.130
there have been successful prosecutions

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.660
for seditious libel in the state courts

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:48.520
as late as 1791 despite the
guarantee of a free press

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.910
in the Constitution's of
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.540
Everywhere in revolutionary America

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.610
Levy maintained noisiest
defenders of a free press

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.030
asked only that the principles advocated

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.500
in the famous trial of John Peter Zenger

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.840
in early 18th century New York

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.530
be fulfilled and followed.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.130
That is those principles
were truth as a good defense

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.200
in all actions of seditious libel.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.160
And the jury's right not
just its latent power

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.000
to make determinations
of law as well as fact

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.183
in all trials for seditious libel.

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.860
And during the 1790s
there'd been some movement

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.060
in that direction.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.970
The legislature of Pennsylvania

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.160
incorporated the Zenger principles

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.900
into its statute law in 1790.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:38.090
Kentucky and Delaware
followed suit in 1792.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.270
Thomas Jefferson, we finally got him in.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:45.260
Thomas Jefferson had embraced
a qualified Zanger position

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.360
in the draft of the Virginia Constitution

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.610
which he proposed in 1783.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:55.057
Here's what Jefferson wrote
this is his free press clause.

00:17:55.057 --> 00:17:58.830
"Printing presses shall be
subject to no other restraint

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:03.417
"than libelness to legal
prosecution for falsehoods

00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:06.420
"printed and published."

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.680
Now 15 years later Adams
and the Federalists

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.380
went further than Jefferson
had dared to go in 1783.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.310
The Sedition Act of
1798 expressly provided

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.340
that truth would be a permissible defense

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.900
in a prosecution under the statute.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.020
And it provided that the
jury would have control

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.620
over both law and fact in all trials

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.450
under this Sedition Act.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.960
The Sedition Act said
Leonard Levy paraphrasing

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.007
Gilbert and Sullivan was quote,

00:18:37.007 --> 00:18:40.100
"The true embodiment of
everything excellent."

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.820
It was that is,

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.130
it was the very epitome

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.053
of libertarian thought in 1798.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.960
Now claiming that the
Sedition Act did not violate

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.620
the First Amendment as the Federalists did

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.930
was not to establish that
it was constitutional.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.960
Adams and his friends
had to show that Congress

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.050
was competent to enact it
even though article one

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.840
of the Constitution did
not and does not enumerate

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.780
a power to regulate the press.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.250
Whether to protect national security

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.173
or for any other purpose.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.450
But the Federalists were good lawyers

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.780
and there were two
interlocking arguments at hand

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.870
for them to bootstrap into a claim

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.690
that Congress could enact as the statute.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.850
The first had been
pioneered by James Wilson.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.630
A great Federalist who ends up being

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:34.720
in the federal judiciary in the 1790s.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.630
James Wilson of Pennsylvania.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.940
Now in 1781 he pioneered
it all the way back

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.760
into the Articles of Confederation.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.410
In 1781 shortly before
Congress voted to charter

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.840
the Bank of North America
Wilson rose to contest the claim

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.730
that Congress had no
power to pass such a law

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.980
because no Clause of the
Articles Confederation

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.890
authorized Congress to
create corporations.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:02.970
And besides the Articles
Confederation stipulate

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.020
that quote each state
retains its sovereignty,

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.280
freedom and independence and every power,

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.110
jurisdiction and right which
is not by the Confederation

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.000
expressly delegated to the United States

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.550
in Congress assembled.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:20.980
So Wilson faced what seemed
to be a double whammy.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.350
There was no enumerated power for Congress

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.220
to create a bank and the Constitution

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.460
or Articles of
Confederation had a coupling

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.950
like the Tenth Amendment
only it said expressly.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.040
Well Wilson had no problem claiming

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.010
that the bank was constitutional.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.010
The article just quoted from
the Articles Confederation.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.540
He swept aside as entirely
irrelevant to the question.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.840
Because in as much as no
state could exercise any power

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.410
or act of sovereignty extending
over all the other states

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:54.310
or any of them, it followed that the power

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.530
to incorporate a bank
commensurate to the United States

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.550
was not an act of sovereignty or a power.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.810
Which by the second article must expressly

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:05.160
be delegated to Congress by that body.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.760
In other words since none of the states

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.543
could create a National Bank,

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.610
the reserve powers of the
states weren't affected

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:15.237
by the fact that the Congress
might be able to charter one.

00:21:15.237 --> 00:21:18.087
"To many purposes," he said,

00:21:18.087 --> 00:21:19.787
"The United States are to be considered

00:21:19.787 --> 00:21:23.167
"as one undivided nation and is possessed

00:21:23.167 --> 00:21:25.267
"of all the rights and power

00:21:25.267 --> 00:21:30.267
"and properties by the law
of nations incident to such."

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.547
It followed he said and again I'm quoting,

00:21:33.547 --> 00:21:36.657
"That whenever an object
occurs to the direction

00:21:36.657 --> 00:21:39.657
"of which no particular state is competent

00:21:39.657 --> 00:21:43.157
"the management of it
must necessarily belong

00:21:43.157 --> 00:21:46.800
"to the United States
in Congress assembled."

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.260
Now applying Wilson's reasoning

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.530
to the Sedition question was a cinch.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.880
And one Federalist Statesman
after another did so

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.650
on the floor of Congress
and in the pamphlet war

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.260
that followed the introduction and passage

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.130
of the Sedition Act of 1798.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.720
That's because the law of
nations is the law of nature

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.860
applied to political states.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.900
And the first law of nature is the right

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.483
of self-preservation.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.400
And self-preservation it was said,

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.760
require this suppression of sedition

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.910
which undermined the people's
confidence in their government

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.570
by vilifying public servants
or condemning their acts.

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:28.730
Finally no particular
state had jurisdiction

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.780
over sedition against the United States

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.870
or against United States officials.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:39.400
So just as murder on the
high seas was of necessity,

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.070
a question for United States
law and United States courts,

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.980
so was sedition against the United States.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:50.450
In each instance, Congress
exercised powers or properties

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.830
that were incident to national
States by the law of nations.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.750
And in each instance Federalists
argued national action

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.370
did not encroach on any right, sovereignty

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.800
or power reserved to the states.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.000
Now these are the essential elements

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.103
of the inherent powers doctrine.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.630
Now the Federalists
offered one more argument

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:16.560
to reinforce the doctrine
of inherent powers.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.650
This was drawn from Federalist number 80,

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.630
the Federalist Papers from
Publius's 80th number,

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:24.890
written by Alexander Hamilton in 1788.

00:23:25.887 --> 00:23:29.780
"If there are such things
as political axioms,"

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.277
Hamilton wrote, "The propriety
of the judicial power

00:23:33.277 --> 00:23:37.017
"of a government being
coextensive with its legislative

00:23:37.017 --> 00:23:40.490
"may be ranked among the number."

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.870
So what's this coextensive power concept?

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.530
It means that if Congress had jurisdiction

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:50.080
to establish an offense,
the federal courts must have

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.870
jurisdiction to try the offense

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:56.500
and to enforce the penalty.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.930
By the same token if the
federal courts had jurisdiction

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.740
to hold a trial and to enforce a penalty,

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.630
then Congress must have
jurisdiction to abrogate the offense

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:10.863
or to modify it and to fix
a new and different penalty.

00:24:11.757 --> 00:24:13.917
"Judicial power and legislative power

00:24:13.917 --> 00:24:17.397
"want the maxim or axioms," said Hamilton

00:24:17.397 --> 00:24:19.860
"had to be coextensive."

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:24.120
Now section 11 of the
Judiciary Act of 1789,

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.530
which created the rules and procedures

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.380
and structures of the federal judiciary.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.820
Section 11 a clause the federal courts

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:37.420
with jurisdiction over all
offenses that were quote,

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.005
cognizable, by the
United States of America.

00:24:41.005 --> 00:24:42.330
Cognizable.

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.060
So what sorts of offenses
had been cognizable

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.670
that is subject to federal jurisdiction

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.650
when Congress passed the
Sedition Act in 1798.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.020
One class of federal crimes included

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:57.540
acts that had been prohibited
by federal statutes.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.370
These included bribery of United
States customs collectors.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.960
Counterfeiting United States bonds

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.300
and murder on the high seas.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.420
But a second equally
important class of cognizable

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:15.030
federal offenses included all
kinds of common law crimes

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:18.570
that Congress had not forbidden
but were not cognizable

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.690
in the courts of any particular state.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:26.170
So in the United States
Circuit Court for Pennsylvania,

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:28.850
a guy named Gideon Henfield was indicted

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:33.390
at common law for joining a
French privateering expedition

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.510
in violation of President Washington's

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.500
neutrality proclamation.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.220
A diplomatic official from
Genoa was tried and convicted

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.500
at common law for sending
threatening letters

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.090
to the British Minister
with a view to extortion.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.830
And the Philadelphia businessman
was tried and convicted

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.330
at common law for attempting to bribe

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.260
the United States commissioner of revenue

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.950
into awarding him a contract
for the construction

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.423
of a lighthouse on Delaware Bay.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:03.330
Nor was that all.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.760
Three different United
States circuit courts

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:10.560
handed down indictments at
common law for seditious libel

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.560
before the Sedition Act became law.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.490
Samuel J. Cavil, which
is the building I teach

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.480
in the University of Virginia
is named for him, Cavil Hall.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.810
Samuel J. Cavil who was
Jefferson's congressman,

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.280
a congressman from Charlottesville.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.470
He was indicted by the
feds in Richmond, 1797.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.970
Benjamin Beech editor of a
newspaper called the Aurora

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:36.860
was indicted by the feds
in Philadelphia in 1797.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.780
And John Daly Burke,

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.030
editor of a journal called the Timepiece

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:45.053
was indicted by the feds in New York City.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:49.520
The reasoning of these indictments
was since federal courts

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.740
had jurisdiction of such
offenses at common law,

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.470
and Congress's power were coextensive

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.300
with the federal judiciaries,

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.670
congress certainly had the
power to enact a statute

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.330
that defined the crime
with greater precision

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.190
and enlarged the rights
available to defendants

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:08.140
at common law.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:11.050
And this is precisely
what the Sedition Act

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.100
of 1798 achieved.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.120
Section one defined the offense.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.430
Section two made truth a good defense

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.320
and authorized the jury to
consider questions of law

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.270
as well as questions of fact

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:24.053
when deliberating on their verdict.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.037
Now I've said that the
inherent powers argument

00:27:28.037 --> 00:27:30.580
and the coextensive powers argument

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.990
had an interlocking quality.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:34.760
And this is because the power claimed

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.160
for Congress by Wilson,
and for the federal courts

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.940
in the common law crime
cases had the same foundation

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.883
and the same built-in
limitation on federal power.

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:50.790
The foundation was the idea
that pre-existing bodies

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:54.070
of law, the law of nations
in the one instance

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:55.470
the Wilson argument.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.320
And the common law in the other.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.190
The common law crimes argument,

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:02.040
legitimated action by
government authorities.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.920
And the built-in limitation
was that the idea

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.400
that Congress and/or the federal courts

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:11.510
could legitimately claim
jurisdiction to act,

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:16.260
if and only if the subject
matter at issue was beyond

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.410
the purview of the
several states or any one

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.490
of the several states.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:24.010
Federalists seem to have taken for granted

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:27.780
the resulting constraints on
the constructive amplification

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:31.090
of national power arising
from the doctrines

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:36.090
of inherent powers and the
doctrine of coextensive powers.

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:39.600
One thing however is certain
and that is that Jefferson

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.290
and the Republicans either did not grasp

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.710
the Federalist position or
they deliberately distorted it

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:48.640
in the rancorous
constitutional controversy

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.783
that generated the revolution of 1800.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:56.270
Now the campaign against the Sedition Act

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.830
began at the moment
the bill was introduced

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:00.850
in the House of Representatives.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:03.890
The alarm was sounded of
course by Thomas Jefferson,

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.380
vice president of the United States

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.917
as well as the Republican
Party's acknowledged leader.

00:29:08.917 --> 00:29:12.597
"If this goes down," he wrote,
sounds very 21st century.

00:29:12.597 --> 00:29:16.537
"If this goes down we shall
immediately see attempted

00:29:16.537 --> 00:29:19.647
"another act of Congress
declaring that the president

00:29:19.647 --> 00:29:21.847
"shall continue in office for life.

00:29:21.847 --> 00:29:24.657
"Reserving to another
occasion the transfer

00:29:24.657 --> 00:29:27.517
"of the succession to his
heir and the establishment

00:29:27.517 --> 00:29:30.640
"of the Senate for life."

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.263
Was Jefferson serious?

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:37.100
Could monarchy be established
under our Constitution

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.180
by the amplification of
Congress's granted powers

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:44.370
and the nature of federal jurisdiction.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.290
Well Jefferson apparently thought so.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:48.850
I think he exaggerated a bit though.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:52.390
If in 1798 anything seemed possible

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.160
with a mode of constitutional construction

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.150
grounded on the law of nations
and the English common law.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:02.410
Both of which presuppose the legitimacy

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:06.070
of both monarchy and aristocracy.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.700
Now James Madison was
ordinarily less impulsive

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.770
than his Virginian partner in politics

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:13.240
and more inclined to use
circumspect language.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.260
Still the fourth Virginia
resolution of 1798

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.430
relied on the same slippery slope

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:24.350
and the same destination
posited by Jefferson.

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:27.327
Here's what Madison
said, he said, he wrote,

00:30:27.327 --> 00:30:31.707
"That the General Assembly
expressed deep regret

00:30:31.707 --> 00:30:34.477
"that indications have
appeared of a design

00:30:34.477 --> 00:30:36.187
"to destroy the meaning and effect

00:30:36.187 --> 00:30:39.487
"of the particular
enumeration and to consolidate

00:30:39.487 --> 00:30:42.477
"the states by degrees
into one sovereignty.

00:30:42.477 --> 00:30:46.217
"The obvious tendency and
inevitable result of which

00:30:46.217 --> 00:30:48.987
"would be to transform the
present Republican system

00:30:48.987 --> 00:30:51.777
"of the United States into an absolute

00:30:51.777 --> 00:30:55.070
"or at best a mixed monarchy."

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.473
That's James Madison.

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:01.260
Jefferson and Madison had
been down this road before.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:05.500
In 1791 they stood arm and
arm against consolidation

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.090
during the bank debate and they'd lost.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:13.680
But this time the chances of
victory seem much greater.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.340
They were up against John Adams

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:18.060
instead of George Washington.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.840
What is more Federalist
arguments about inherent powers

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.040
and coextensive powers
seem much more vulnerable

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.100
than Alexander Hamilton's
artful deployment

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.920
of the Necessary and Proper
Clause in the bank controversy.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.430
Consequently the Republicans assailed

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.580
from the very outset first
the notion that Congress

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.470
could exercise anything so
fuzzy as inherent powers.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:42.710
They assailed the idea
that the Constitution

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.210
authorized federal courts to adjudicate

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:47.310
criminal cases at common law.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:50.250
And they insisted that
Federalist claims to the contrary

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.040
put the very federal structure
of the Union into jeopardy.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.800
The outstanding republican
performance in this vein

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.200
was Madison's in his famous 1800 report

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.460
to the Virginia legislature.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.920
Article one of the Constitution
which enumerated powers

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.487
of Congress he wrote, "Was
logically incompatible

00:32:10.487 --> 00:32:13.477
"with the notion that
the common law was part

00:32:13.477 --> 00:32:14.977
"of federal law.

00:32:14.977 --> 00:32:16.967
"Because the authority of Congress

00:32:16.967 --> 00:32:20.030
"was necessarily coextensive
with the federal judiciary."

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:23.997
So he accepted the premise
of coextensive powers,

00:32:23.997 --> 00:32:27.097
"To hold that federal courts
had cognizance of matters

00:32:27.097 --> 00:32:32.097
"as vast and multifarious
as those in the common law

00:32:32.667 --> 00:32:37.057
"would invariably overspread
the entire field of legislation

00:32:37.057 --> 00:32:39.947
"and sap the foundation
of the Constitution

00:32:39.947 --> 00:32:43.700
"as a system of limited
and specified powers."

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.760
Madison saw the common law
as a lever for Congress

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.823
to enact statutes on
all matters whatsoever.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.520
Now the principle of states
rights cut a much larger figure

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.050
in the Republican appeal of 1798 to 1800,

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:00.573
abandoned the first amendment.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.050
Still the Sedition Act
brought the relationship

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.430
between free government and a free press

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.040
into sharper focus than ever before.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.130
A focus that produced
what Leonard levy called

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:15.230
a new libertarianism.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:17.670
Now the major premise of
the new libertarianism

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.150
was that the common law of seditious libel

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:23.470
was incompatible with the
republican form of government.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.070
Pamphlets by George Hay and Tunis Wortman

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.080
a couple of fellows from New York City,

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.910
pointed out the common law had developed

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:33.330
in a nation where the legitimacy
of public authority flowed

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:36.340
from a compact between
the ruler and the ruled.

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:39.130
Between the sovereign and the people.

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.270
In England the crime of seditious libel

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:45.070
protected the authority,
dignity and exalted position

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.590
of the sovereign.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.900
But such an offense made
no sense, they argued,

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.860
in the United States because
here sovereignty resided

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.220
in the people themselves
and public officials

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.890
were rightfully regarded
as the mere servants

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:58.563
of their Republican masters.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.220
Madison grasped this claim
and turned it brilliantly

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.770
to Republican advantage
in the Virginia report

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:07.867
in the spring of 1800.

00:34:07.867 --> 00:34:10.197
"The people, not the
government," he wrote,

00:34:10.197 --> 00:34:12.967
"Possess the absolute
sovereignty in America.

00:34:12.967 --> 00:34:15.677
"And it followed that
rights here are secured by

00:34:15.677 --> 00:34:19.817
"not by laws paramount to
prerogative but by constitutions

00:34:19.817 --> 00:34:21.820
"paramount to laws."

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:25.060
It followed that the
American idea of a free press

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.757
was very different from that
postulated in the common law.

00:34:28.757 --> 00:34:32.147
"The crabbit doctrine of no
prior restraint," said Madison

00:34:32.147 --> 00:34:35.217
"Can never be admitted
in a republic since a law

00:34:35.217 --> 00:34:38.427
"inflicting penalties
on printed publications

00:34:38.427 --> 00:34:40.907
"would have a similar effect
with the law authorizing

00:34:40.907 --> 00:34:43.327
"a previous restraint on them.

00:34:43.327 --> 00:34:46.657
"It would seem a mockery to say
that no law should be passed

00:34:46.657 --> 00:34:49.067
"preventing publications from being made

00:34:49.067 --> 00:34:52.177
"but that laws might be
passed for punishing them

00:34:52.177 --> 00:34:54.820
"in case they should be made."

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.780
Thus were born two observations
that figured prominently

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.890
in the First Amendment
jurisprudence of William Brennan

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:05.890
and the case of New York Times
in Sullivan in particular.

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:08.720
The idea that libel law has a tendency

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.850
to follow self-censorship and
the resulting chilling effect

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:16.450
on the Free Press on free
expression is incompatible

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.823
with the Republican form of government.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.403
Now the Sedition Act
contained a sunset clause,

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:26.440
which means that this
lecture will eventually

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.693
get to a sunset.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:33.223
It expired by the acts own
term on March the 3rd, 1801.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.980
24 hours late Thomas
Jefferson was inaugurated

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.370
as the third President
of the United States.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.780
Jefferson dared say nothing
about the sedition question

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.440
in his inaugural address, choosing instead

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.550
to hold out an olive
branch to the Federalists

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.517
with the famous quote,
"We are all Republicans,

00:35:51.517 --> 00:35:54.180
"We are all Federalists."

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.460
But soon afterward Jefferson pardoned

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.510
all those who had been
convicted under the Sedition Act

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:03.080
and quietly dismissed the
prosecution still pending

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.493
against journalist, Republican
journalist James Duane.

00:36:07.997 --> 00:36:10.607
"I discharged every
person under punishment

00:36:10.607 --> 00:36:12.680
"or prosecution under the Sedition Act."

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.887
Jefferson wrote to
French shortly afterward,

00:36:14.887 --> 00:36:18.707
"Because I considered
and now consider that law

00:36:18.707 --> 00:36:20.467
"to be a nullity.

00:36:20.467 --> 00:36:23.227
"As absolute and palpable a nullity

00:36:23.227 --> 00:36:26.557
"as if Congress had
ordered us all to fall down

00:36:26.557 --> 00:36:29.437
"and worship a golden image.

00:36:29.437 --> 00:36:33.087
"And that it was as much my
duty to arrest its execution

00:36:33.087 --> 00:36:36.637
"as it would have been to
rescue from the fiery furnace

00:36:36.637 --> 00:36:38.887
"those that should have been cast into it

00:36:38.887 --> 00:36:41.950
"for refusing to worship the image."

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:42.783
End of quote.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:47.250
Yet for all this the revolution of 1800

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:51.710
did not necessarily mean the
end of trials for sedition.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.500
Except for the new libertarians

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.770
who were a distinct minority in the party.

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:57.770
Republicans had condemned the Sedition Act

00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.920
primarily on states rights grounds.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:04.090
And Jefferson himself in an
1804 letter to Abigail Adams

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:07.217
flatly stated and I quote,
"while we deny that Congress

00:37:07.217 --> 00:37:09.577
"have a right to control
the freedom of the press,

00:37:09.577 --> 00:37:12.347
"we have ever asserted
the right of the states

00:37:12.347 --> 00:37:16.010
"and their exclusive right to do so."

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:19.090
So was it possible that
the revolution of 1800

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:22.300
would mean nothing more
than Republican prosecution

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:26.820
of Federalists as a matter
of state law in state courts?

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.240
And what about the possibility
of prosecuting Federalists

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.860
for seditious libel at common
law in the federal courts?

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.880
The Sedition Act had expired
but federal jurisdiction

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.660
over common law crimes
cognizable by the United States.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.680
Though much contested
during the campaign of 1800,

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.500
remained a live issue in our
law of the federal courts

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.410
and the federal system.

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:51.290
Now answers to the
questions came in due course

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:54.370
though often with a
surprising cast of characters,

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:58.280
a surprising plot or a
surprising they knew them all.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.840
Consider first the resolution
of the free press question

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.510
in the state courts.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:07.400
Ironically the leading case
pitted Federalists libertarians

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.780
against Jeffersonian Stan patters

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.833
on the common law of seditious libel.

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:14.820
When Jefferson became president,

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.780
his most powerful ally in New York

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.850
was Governor George Clinton.

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:21.910
And in 1803 Clinton's
administration obtained

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:25.290
a common law indictment
against Harry Croswell,

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:29.420
editor of an upstate
newspaper called The Wasp.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:33.050
Croswell's crime was an
accusation that Thomas Jefferson

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:36.810
while serving as vice president
had paid another journalist

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:40.310
named James Callender to
denounce George Washington

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:43.210
as a traitor and a robber and a perjurer.

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:46.603
And John Adams as a
hoary headed incendiary.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:51.870
In point of fact the
accusation for which Croswell

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:53.923
had been indicted was true.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.490
James Callender was on
Thomas Jefferson's payroll

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:02.310
in 1798 and 1799 when Callendar

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:04.743
wrote those things in his newspaper.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:07.520
Nevertheless the New York Trial Court

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.150
refused to allow the defendant
to subpoena witnesses

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:12.610
who could have established
the truth of the words.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:16.560
And Chief Justice Morgan Lewis
who presided at the trial

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.530
and was the leading a
Republican who was end up

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:20.900
succeeding George Clinton
as governor of New York.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.970
He instructed the jury
that at common law truth

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:27.720
was not a good defense in an
action of seditious libel.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.910
Such that in New York at
least freedom of the press

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:33.560
was still defined as the
absence of prior restraint.

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.940
And the jury after hearing that charge

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.163
convicted Mr. Croswell.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.420
Now on appeal to the New
York's highest court,

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:44.883
Croswell was represented
by Alexander Hamilton.

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:49.080
In vain did that the great
Federals leader urge the court

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.080
to grant Croswell a new trial
in the defense of truth.

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.590
So that the people might know

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.670
whether President
Jefferson had been guilty

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:58.520
of what Hamilton called
the foul act of libeling

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:00.950
President George Washington.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.810
Hamilton maintained that freedom

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:06.530
of the press rightly
understood common law.

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:09.447
Quote, "Consists in the right
to publish with impunity,

00:40:09.447 --> 00:40:11.947
"with good motives and
for justifiable ends

00:40:11.947 --> 00:40:15.827
"though badly reflecting
on government, the Magestry

00:40:15.827 --> 00:40:18.510
"or particular individuals.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:21.150
Without proof of the
defendants actual malice,

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.250
not his presumed malice at Hamilton.

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:25.570
The journalist's statements
merited protection

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:29.750
from the state constitutions
guarantee of a free press.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:31.920
Well it turns out that
Hamilton lost the battle

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:32.963
but won the war.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:38.280
The two Republican judges
rejected his argument.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:40.390
James Kent, a prominent Federalists

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:42.930
and Smith Thompson a former Federalist,

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:46.400
a former student of Kent's
voted for a new trial.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:50.413
So the conviction was sustained
by an equally divided court.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:55.460
But in 1805 the New York
legislature settled the matter

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.190
by enacting a statute
providing that every state

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:03.120
in the Union soon emulated
in one way or another.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.640
This statute, the New York act of 1805,

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.980
shifted the burden of proof
and actions of seditious libel.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.780
So that it became the state's obligation

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.960
not only to prove that
the material was false,

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.580
but also to prove that
it had not been published

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.970
for good reasons and justifiable ends.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:23.340
And by this tortuous path
the new libertarianism

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:28.020
produced by the Sedition Act
of 1798 finally got translated

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.830
into effective protection of press freedom

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:32.720
as a matter of state law.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.120
In fact the resulting legal regime lasted

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.560
until the civil rights era
generated new challenges

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.640
and a new doctrinal response to preserve

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.640
what Brennan called the central meeting

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.790
of the First Amendment.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.720
What then about federal prosecutions

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.583
for sedition at common law?

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:52.660
The Supreme Court considered this question

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.700
in the remarkable case of
United States versus Hudson

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:59.150
and Goodwin decided in 1811.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:00.320
At issue was the indictment

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.870
of two Hartford Connecticut newspaper men,

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:05.420
who had published an
article accusing Congress

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.950
of secretly appropriating
2 million dollars

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:10.040
at the request of President Jefferson

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.620
as a bribe of Napoleon.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.610
Upon a division of the trial judges

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:17.190
over whether United States
Circuit Court had jurisdiction

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:19.940
the case was certified
to the Supreme Court.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.500
And President Madison
Jefferson's successor

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.810
declined to defend the
indictment with either

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:27.470
a government brief or a government defense

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.250
of the prosecution in oral argument.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:33.890
And so the result was predictable
Justice William Johnson,

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:36.880
a Jefferson appointee
dismissed the indictment

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.510
and held that federal courts
did not have jurisdiction

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:42.810
over crimes at common law now.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:45.280
The decision in this
case Hudson and Goodwin

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.540
was extraordinary all the same.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.930
It was remarkable first because of the way

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:53.677
Justice Johnson justified the result.

00:42:53.677 --> 00:42:55.887
"Although this question is brought up now

00:42:55.887 --> 00:42:58.840
"for the first time to
be decided by this court,

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:03.527
he said, "We consider it as
having been long since settled

00:43:03.527 --> 00:43:05.187
"in public opinion."

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:10.660
I don't think the court
said that in a long time.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.260
That this question had been
decided in public opinion.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:16.720
It had been settled in other
words by the political upheaval

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.700
that Jefferson called
the revolution of 1800.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.420
But that's not the only reason Hudson

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.560
and Goodman was remarkable.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.530
It was remarkable for
still another reason.

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:27.740
In their campaign against the Sedition Act

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.730
Republicans had denounced the concept

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:33.070
of a federal common law
because it provided a lever

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:36.380
when fused with Hamilton's
coextensive powers doctrine

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.460
for the constructive amplification

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.170
of the powers of Congress.

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:43.580
They made an argument in
other words about federalism.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.070
The new libertarians on the other hand

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:47.170
had denounced the concept
of a federal common law

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:49.240
because it provided a means for government

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.350
to do what it had no business of doing.

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:53.690
Of deploying the criminal law to subvert

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:55.716
freedom of the press and
hence the sovereignty

00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:59.800
of the people, the first
principle of republicanism.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.240
They made an argument
about individual rights.

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.820
But in Hudson and Goodwin Justice Johnson

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.700
did not breathe a word about rights

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.810
or a word about federalism.

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:12.420
The courts holding
hinged on public opinion

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.150
in the first instance and ultimately

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:17.387
on the separation of powers.

00:44:17.387 --> 00:44:19.247
"The legislative authority of the Union

00:44:19.247 --> 00:44:21.437
"must first make an act of crime.

00:44:21.437 --> 00:44:23.807
"A fix of punishment to it and declare

00:44:23.807 --> 00:44:26.560
"that the court shall have
jurisdiction of the offense,"

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.410
said Justice Johnson for the court

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:33.410
before it could become
cognizable in federal courts.

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:35.390
Now the problem with this sweeping holding

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:37.020
was that there were a great many offenses

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.720
over which no state
court had jurisdiction.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.590
That now could not be
punished in the federal courts

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:45.220
unless Congress had acted.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.400
And Congress had other
more important things to do

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.820
than specifying with precision the scope

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.453
of the federal criminal law.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:55.760
Could somebody get away with
arson, bribery, extorsion

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.550
or grand theft committed on the high seas?

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:01.210
Or at federal installations
such as navy yards,

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:05.230
post offices, light houses
and the United States Mint?

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.440
The impossibility of such a
thing had been at the foundation

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.950
of the Federalist argument
concerning the federal

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.350
common law of crimes and for the closely

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:16.320
related argument pioneered by James Wilson

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.687
for the inherent powers of Congress.

00:45:18.687 --> 00:45:21.290
And it came home to
roost in the great case

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:23.840
of United States and Coolidge.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:26.280
An issue in the Coolidge case was an event

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.270
that occurred during the War of 1812.

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:32.680
American privateers
holding a letter of marque

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.240
authorizing them to seize enemy shipping.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.320
Holding a letter of marque
from President Madison

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.950
seized a British vessel
in the North Atlantic

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:41.760
and started for an American port

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.610
where the vessel could
be liable as a prize.

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.740
They didn't make it home with their prize.

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.820
Because the second American vessel

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.920
captained by the defendant Coolidge

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.880
seized the British ship in open water

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:56.291
and beat the American privateers to port.

00:45:56.291 --> 00:45:58.500
And so in 1813 the United States Attorney

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.850
for Massachusetts indicted Coolidge

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:05.323
at common law for grand
theft ship on the high seas.

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:08.410
He had to be indicted in federal court

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:11.320
because no state had
jurisdiction over a crime

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.560
that occurred on the high seas.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.280
And so justice Joseph
story, a Madison appointee

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.790
believed that in this instance
the Federalist argument

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:22.000
about inherent federal
jurisdiction was sound.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.610
And so he voted to sustain the indictment.

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:26.820
But his colleague, another
Republican appointee,

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.410
District Judge John Davis did not agree

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:32.220
and nor did the Supreme
Court which heard Coolidge

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:36.290
on the resulting certificate
of division in 1817.

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:39.000
Justice Johnson again spoke for the court

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.917
and he stuck to his guns.

00:46:40.917 --> 00:46:43.327
"Offenses at common law did not exist

00:46:43.327 --> 00:46:46.790
"in the courts of the United
States," he flatly stated

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:50.020
and as a result Coolidge walked.

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:54.100
His unmerited Liberty
was also a consequence

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:56.193
of the revolution of 1800.

00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:00.523
What then about the Federalist
doctrine of inherent powers?

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.290
The claim that certain powers

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:05.950
that had not been enumerated
in the Constitution,

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:08.210
but which could not possibly be exercised

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:10.460
by the several states or any of them.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.330
In which the law of nations established

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:15.280
as incident to all
national states necessarily

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.640
belong to the Congress
of the United States.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.140
What happened to that
Federalist principle?

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.460
Well the answer of course
is that the Republicans

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.430
invoked that very principle
in support of their power

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:28.960
to acquire Louisiana in 1803.

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.110
Robert Livingston of
New York who negotiated

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:33.160
the Treaty of Session with France

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.330
denounced the doctrine of
inherent powers in 1798.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:41.310
But broadcasted widely in
support of his treaty in 1803.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:43.790
A great many other Republicans,
leading Republicans,

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:46.890
made the exact same conceptual somersault

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:49.440
between the one event and the other.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.990
Jefferson's views were more complicated.

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:56.040
At the very outset of
the Louisiana treaty,

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.310
he presumed that a
constitutional amendment

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:01.870
could and should be adopted
that expressly authorized

00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:05.287
the purchase of territory
from another national state.

00:48:05.287 --> 00:48:08.520
"Let us not make blank
paper by construction,"

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.587
he wrote, one republican associate.

00:48:10.587 --> 00:48:14.537
"Let us our peculiar
security is in the possession

00:48:14.537 --> 00:48:16.890
"of a written constitution."

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:21.620
But as year 1803 wore on
Jefferson changed his tune.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:24.500
And in a fascinating letter
to Wilson Carey Nicholas,

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.850
the junior member of the
Senate from Virginia,

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:29.830
Jefferson confessed now
while he thought it important

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:32.520
to set an example against
broad construction

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.490
by appealing for new power from the people

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:38.070
he was prepared to accept the treaty

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:40.143
without a constitutional amendment.

00:48:41.997 --> 00:48:44.637
"The good sense of the country," he said,

00:48:44.637 --> 00:48:47.227
"Will correct the evil of construction

00:48:47.227 --> 00:48:50.357
"when it shall produce evil effects.

00:48:50.357 --> 00:48:52.927
"But this evil construction was producing

00:48:52.927 --> 00:48:55.707
"wonderful, wonderful effects."

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.390
This was the first time
in American history

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:00.460
when a professed strict constructionist

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.450
allowed reasons of state to trump

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:05.590
his own constitutional first principles.

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:07.453
And it would not be the last.

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:10.760
Now Republicans always
regarded the acquisition

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:13.370
of new territory, whether by purchase

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:17.770
or annexation as an exception
to the salutary principle

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:19.510
of strict construction generally

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:21.610
in opposition to the federalist doctrine

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:24.240
of inherent powers in particular.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.130
In their judgment the robust form

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:29.340
of inherent powers
doctrine had been exploded

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.123
by the revolution of 1800.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.500
But in the aftermath of the Civil War

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:38.050
an entire generation of
jurists shared the impulse

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:41.460
to extirpate from American
constitutional law,

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:45.210
every corollary of Antebellum
southern rights theory.

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:48.140
Much of which was
traceable to the Virginia

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.250
and Kentucky resolutions of 1798.

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:53.350
They were also inclined
to confirm the national

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:56.580
government's authority
to exercise every power

00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:59.200
whether enumerated or
not, that was necessary

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:02.530
to maintain its very existence.

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:06.670
And the result was a revival
of inherent powers doctrine.

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:10.360
The revival climaxed in the
Supreme Court's 1889 decision

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.830
upholding the Chinese Exclusion Act.

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:16.160
Where Justice Stephen Field
speaking for unanimous court

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.970
explained that it didn't
matter that the Constitution

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:21.160
did not enumerate a power of Congress

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.130
to control the nation's borders

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:26.270
or to enumerated a power
to determine what person

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:28.570
should be denied entry
to the United States

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:31.147
and what persons should be admitted.

00:50:31.147 --> 00:50:33.217
"These powers," said Field,

00:50:33.217 --> 00:50:36.440
"Are inherent in the national government."

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.830
In support of the court's
ruling Field invoked

00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:41.940
every single reason that
James Wilson had invoked

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.890
in the bank debate of 1781.

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:45.280
And the Federalists that invoked

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.960
in the Sedition Act debate of 1798.

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.510
Field might have added, though he didn't,

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:55.710
that in America constitutional revolutions

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:57.853
sometimes do go backward.

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:01.490
Time has come for me to conclude.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:05.300
The stories I have told about
the Sedition Act of 1798

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.220
and the ramifications of Jefferson's

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.520
victory in the election of 1800,

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.940
established at least
two general propositions

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.900
about constitutional politics

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:17.040
and constitutional change
in American history.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.960
First constitutional change rarely begins

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.490
in the Supreme Court.

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:23.960
Political movements often grounded

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:27.470
in distinctive constellations
of constitutional thought,

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:31.280
shape what public officials
do and why they do it.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.030
Even public opinion
that most elusive thing,

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:38.240
modifies what the Constitution
means from time to time.

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.430
This is because
constitutional law is in part

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:44.120
a function of constitutional practice.

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.860
Which in turn reflects and reproduces

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:49.310
the conventions of constitutional thought

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:52.940
established by dominant
political coalition's.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.250
Second, the process of constitutional

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:58.660
change seldom conforms
to the ideal typology.

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:01.210
Lawyers and political
scientists tend to use

00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:03.770
in analyzing American constitutional law.

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:05.290
No offense Bob.

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:08.760
It is often said that
the basic building blocks

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.690
of constitutionalism in
America are protection

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:14.180
of individual rights,
the division of authority

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:15.197
between the national government

00:52:15.197 --> 00:52:16.760
and the several state governments,

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:20.000
and the separation of
legislative, executive,

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.620
and judicial functions, and so they are.

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.840
But when constitutional
claims are contested

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.640
across the board as they were

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.490
in the Sedition Act controversy,

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:32.140
every domain of constitutional law

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:34.020
is eventually implicated.

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.920
It may take two or three decades or more

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:40.280
for courts and commentators
to work out every implication

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.890
of the constitutional upheaval at hand.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:45.880
And in some instances the
process of consolidating

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.300
the results of one upheaval
may not have been completed

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:52.060
before the next upheaval begins.

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:55.220
All this is to say that
American constitutional law

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:59.110
has always been relatively
contingent on circumstances.

00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:02.790
So much so that doctrines
presumed to be exploded

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:06.950
at one point in time have
made unexpected comebacks

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:09.140
at other points in time.

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.610
Woodrow Wilson, another statesman

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:15.150
from my adopted state
of Virginia once made

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:17.780
a similar observation with a phrase

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.837
that still seems exactly right.

00:53:20.837 --> 00:53:23.247
"The Constitution of
the United States is not

00:53:23.247 --> 00:53:25.937
"a mere lawyers document," he said.

00:53:25.937 --> 00:53:29.247
"It is a vehicle of life and its spirit

00:53:29.247 --> 00:53:32.067
"is always the spirit of the age."

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:34.772
Thanks for your patience.

00:53:34.772 --> 00:53:37.022
(applause)

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.960
- Well thank you very much
that's a wonderful talk.

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:50.210
And I'm happy to say
that Professor Mccurdy

00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:52.310
is gonna to take some questions.

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:53.143
Thank you.

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:57.320
- So do you request for
you to say a little more.

00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:00.340
I'm interested in what
happens to the relationship

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:03.300
between the federal courts and common law

00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:04.520
as the nation grows.

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.110
And I'm also wondering if you could say

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:07.910
a little more about this,

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:11.490
what seems like a rediscovery
of the Republican tradition

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:15.463
for Brennan and other
judges during the 1960's.

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.460
- The first question is what
happened to the relationship

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:25.370
between the common law and

00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:29.310
the federal government's
power to prosecute crime.

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:31.980
In the aftermath of the
Sedition Act controversy

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:34.430
which in turn generate that
crazy case of Coolidge,

00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:37.300
where the grand theft
ship guy walked, right?

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:40.340
You remember that the
Supreme Court justice

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:43.030
on circuit in that case
was Joseph's Story.

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:46.060
And Joseph Story spent
the next eight years

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.300
in a long correspondence with the senior

00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:51.110
United States senator of Massachusetts,

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:52.853
his good buddy Daniel Webster.

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.670
They made a kind of parlor
game, it lasted eight years,

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:58.520
of trying to conjure up crimes

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.060
which should be cognizable
by the federal courts.

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:04.120
But Congress had not yet
defined them as a crime.

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:07.480
And the result is the first
codified federal statute

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:11.820
of crimes, known as
the Crimes Act of 1825.

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.320
It's only nine pages long.

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:15.960
So a federal crime bill in our time,

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:18.580
you need a hand truck to move it around.

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:20.550
But it was, it consisted of every crime

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:22.250
that they could imagine that had not been

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:24.480
yet specified by Congress.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.910
And that took away the opportunity

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:30.850
for guys like Coolidge to
get away with grand theft

00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:32.370
on the high seas with impunity.

00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:33.610
Now there are other relationships

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:36.770
between the common law on the civil side

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:39.600
and the law of the United States,

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:42.320
that's a really long story.

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.230
Professor Schreiber said
that I once shared a prize

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:47.130
which I did with a very
good friend who teaches

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:48.360
the New York law school.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.920
And he's written three
books on this issue.

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.580
The question of Swift and Tyson.

00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:57.330
And the question of Erie and the--

00:55:57.330 --> 00:55:59.813
Erie Railroad and was?

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:02.283
Tompkins yes.

00:56:02.283 --> 00:56:03.970
Tompkins in the Erie Railroad

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:06.970
and it's an incredibly long complex.

00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:08.765
And in the end (audience laughs)

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:10.880
not very exciting story.

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:12.420
The second question is what accounts

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:15.190
for Brennan's rediscovery
of the Jeffersonian

00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:19.930
new libertarian tradition of 1800

00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:23.200
as late as 1965 in New York
Times in Sullivan case.

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.190
And the answer is that at
issue in New York Times

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:27.920
and Sullivan was a editorial published

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.170
in the New York Times by Harry Belafonte

00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:32.190
and a great number of
other African-American

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:35.450
intellectuals and activists.

00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:37.320
That made a lot of denunciations

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:41.580
of what the Alabama police
had been doing in Birmingham.

00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:44.110
And there was a lot of
stuff that was wrong.

00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:47.620
Like they said the police
had encircled Alabama state.

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.680
Well God there was just a few
people I could see their gate.

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.650
And maybe somebody over on Hurst.

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:54.620
They hadn't completely encircled it.

00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:56.683
So there were these errors of fact.

00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:02.370
And that meant that they could
not rely on a truth defense.

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:06.430
And moreover the jury would have control

00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:08.630
and these were 12 white guys listened

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:11.410
to a lawsuit filed by this guy Sullivan

00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:14.240
who was on the Board of
Supervisors of Birmingham.

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.980
Now this was a slam dunk
that they were gonna

00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:18.520
bring in a verdict of
liability and indeed,

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.130
I think New York Times
says total liability

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:23.010
at the time of that lawsuit

00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:28.010
for that ad in various
state court decisions

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:30.223
was many millions of dollars.

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:34.183
So they needed to say that,

00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:36.840
somebody need to make
a constitutional claim

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:41.840
that a private libel could
have such public consequences.

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:43.590
That it should be barred
by the First Amendment

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:46.221
of the Constitution of the United States.

00:57:46.221 --> 00:57:48.380
And they hired a guy named Herbert Wexler

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:49.680
who made that argument.

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:52.237
And the way he did it was he said,

00:57:52.237 --> 00:57:54.817
"The practical effects of
this lawsuit in Alabama

00:57:54.817 --> 00:57:56.567
"are just like the practical effects

00:57:56.567 --> 00:57:59.360
"of the Sedition Act
prosecutions the 1798."

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:03.050
And what he did was
link this Sedition crime

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:04.770
from the 18th century

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:08.430
to the 20th century reality of the 1960s.

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:09.920
And Brennan went for it.

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.630
Hook line and sinker and I think probably

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:13.290
had more fun writing that opinion

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:15.470
than he had writing any
other opinion he wrote

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:17.080
during his long and distinguished career

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.130
on the Supreme Court.

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:22.710
- Thank you very much Professor McCurdy.

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:25.990
Thank you all for being here
and enjoy the reception.

00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:27.023
Thank you Charles.

00:58:27.023 --> 00:58:29.273
(applause)

00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:33.893
(gentle music)
