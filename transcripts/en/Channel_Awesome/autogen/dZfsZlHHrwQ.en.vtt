the explanation of Oh Jake becoming the
 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.899 align:start position:0%
the explanation of Oh Jake becoming the
conductor<00:03:45.680><c> is</c><00:03:45.739><c> just</c><00:03:45.949><c> this</c><00:03:46.069><c> little</c><00:03:46.340><c> bit</c><00:03:46.639><c> of</c><00:03:46.760><c> him</c>

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 align:start position:0%
conductor is just this little bit of him
 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.719 align:start position:0%
conductor is just this little bit of him
goes<00:03:47.269><c> -</c><00:03:47.720><c> yeah</c><00:03:47.870><c> into</c><00:03:48.229><c> the</c><00:03:48.260><c> of</c><00:03:48.799><c> the</c><00:03:49.190><c> train</c><00:03:49.430><c> and</c>

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:49.729 align:start position:0%
goes - yeah into the of the train and
 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.219 align:start position:0%
goes - yeah into the of the train and
then<00:03:49.819><c> turns</c><00:03:50.060><c> into</c><00:03:50.269><c> the</c><00:03:50.419><c> conductor</c><00:03:50.870><c> you</c><00:03:51.079><c> know</c>

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 align:start position:0%
then turns into the conductor you know
 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:52.780 align:start position:0%
then turns into the conductor you know
so<00:03:51.440><c> it's</c><00:03:51.620><c> I</c><00:03:51.799><c> think</c><00:03:52.099><c> there's</c><00:03:52.310><c> definitely</c><00:03:52.430><c> some</c>

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 align:start position:0%
so it's I think there's definitely some
 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.979 align:start position:0%
so it's I think there's definitely some
fun<00:03:52.940><c> things</c><00:03:53.090><c> but</c><00:03:53.209><c> you're</c><00:03:53.419><c> right</c><00:03:53.599><c> there's</c><00:03:53.900><c> a</c>

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 align:start position:0%
fun things but you're right there's a
 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.539 align:start position:0%
fun things but you're right there's a
for<00:03:54.260><c> something</c><00:03:54.620><c> like</c><00:03:54.769><c> adventure</c><00:03:55.159><c> time</c><00:03:55.310><c> that</c>

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 align:start position:0%
for something like adventure time that
 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.490 align:start position:0%
for something like adventure time that
it's<00:03:55.669><c> just</c><00:03:55.879><c> so</c><00:03:56.120><c> you</c><00:03:56.750><c> could</c><00:03:56.900><c> never</c><00:03:57.079><c> predict</c>

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 align:start position:0%
it's just so you could never predict
 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
it's just so you could never predict
where<00:03:57.650><c> it's</c><00:03:57.799><c> going</c><00:03:58.190><c> and</c><00:03:58.609><c> here</c><00:03:59.090><c> it's</c><00:03:59.239><c> like</c><00:03:59.419><c> for</c>

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 align:start position:0%
where it's going and here it's like for

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 align:start position:0%
a few minutes you can know what its
 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.719 align:start position:0%
a few minutes you can know what its
gonna<00:04:02.239><c> do</c><00:04:02.510><c> where</c><00:04:02.780><c> it's</c><00:04:02.900><c> gonna</c><00:04:03.049><c> go</c><00:04:03.260><c> and</c><00:04:03.590><c> I</c><00:04:03.889><c> mean</c>

gonna do where it's gonna go and I mean
 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
gonna do where it's gonna go and I mean
you<00:04:04.849><c> can't</c><00:04:05.030><c> predict</c><00:04:05.329><c> all</c><00:04:05.419><c> the</c><00:04:05.540><c> jokes</c><00:04:05.810><c> but</c><00:04:06.199><c> yeah</c>

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 align:start position:0%
you can't predict all the jokes but yeah
 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.619 align:start position:0%
you can't predict all the jokes but yeah
at<00:04:07.220><c> the</c><00:04:07.310><c> same</c><00:04:07.489><c> time</c><00:04:07.699><c> it's</c><00:04:07.909><c> like</c><00:04:08.030><c> yeah</c><00:04:08.180><c> you</c><00:04:08.329><c> kind</c>
