00:00:00.298 --> 00:00:02.885
- [Voiceover] I wanna take a
look at our two op amp circuits

00:00:02.885 --> 00:00:05.015
and make an interesting observation about

00:00:05.015 --> 00:00:08.245
how this things are behaving
when they are working properly.

00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:09.525
When they're hooked up right,

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:11.279
there's something these things do

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.446
that is really helpful and
makes life simple for us.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.570
Let's let the gain of our
op amp be 10 to the third,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.892
or 10 to the sixth.

00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:24.729
Really high gain, a million.

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:26.660
And we're gonna let the
output voltage here,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.493
V out,

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:30.872
let's say six volts.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.336
And you remember, what's not
shown here in this circuit

00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:35.919
is the power supply

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:39.809
is going to both of these op amps.

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.951
Plus or minus, let's say
it's plus or minus 12 volts.

00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:44.639
Those power supplies are implicit.

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:48.500
They're not shown in the diagram
but we know they're there.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.888
Alright, now, if V out is six volts

00:00:50.888 --> 00:00:52.704
and A is 10 to the sixth,

00:00:52.704 --> 00:00:53.658
then what's V in?

00:00:53.658 --> 00:00:57.944
V in is the difference between
these two voltages here.

00:00:57.944 --> 00:00:59.756
Let's call this the usual thing.

00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:01.385
We'll call this V plus.

00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:04.267
I'm gonna call this V minus.

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:06.100
And we know that V in,

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:08.693
we know that V in

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:13.018
equals V plus minus V minus.

00:01:14.458 --> 00:01:15.825
And now what the question is

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:17.453
what is V in in terms of V out?

00:01:17.453 --> 00:01:18.286
Well, V in

00:01:20.693 --> 00:01:22.860
equals V out divided by A.

00:01:25.744 --> 00:01:27.302
If we fill in the values we had,

00:01:27.302 --> 00:01:28.469
it's six volts

00:01:29.814 --> 00:01:31.981
divided by 10 to the sixth,

00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:33.481
or six microvolts.

00:01:35.302 --> 00:01:38.782
So this is six microvolts
between here and here, okay?

00:01:38.782 --> 00:01:40.485
So with six volts here,

00:01:40.485 --> 00:01:42.249
there's six microvolts over here.

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:45.332
Okay, this is a really small voltage.

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:48.862
In order for this op amp

00:01:48.862 --> 00:01:50.494
to have an output voltage

00:01:50.494 --> 00:01:52.905
that stays between plus or minus 12 volts,

00:01:52.905 --> 00:01:55.759
this voltage over here
has to be really small.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.023
It has to be down to the microvolts level.

00:01:59.023 --> 00:02:00.731
So because I'm a practical engineer,

00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:04.921
I'm just gonna say this
is pretty much zero volts.

00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:05.954
And if I say this is zero,

00:02:05.954 --> 00:02:07.929
that's pretty much the
same thing as saying

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.346
that V plus approximately equals V minus.

00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:18.982
So that's a little observation
we're gonna make right there.

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:22.984
So in this circuit,
when it's working right,

00:02:22.984 --> 00:02:27.210
these two voltages are
pretty much the same.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.832
So let's take this idea of V
plus pretty much equals V minus

00:02:30.832 --> 00:02:32.799
and apply it to this circuit over here.

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.693
Now this is our inverting
configuration for an op amp.

00:02:36.693 --> 00:02:38.193
So this is V plus.

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:42.126
And this is V minus in this circuit.

00:02:43.178 --> 00:02:45.526
And let's do the same
analysis that we did before.

00:02:45.526 --> 00:02:49.769
If this is V out, and
if V out is six volts,

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.769
that means that V plus minus V minus

00:02:56.044 --> 00:02:58.687
divided by 10 to the sixth

00:02:58.687 --> 00:03:01.011
equals six microvolts,

00:03:01.011 --> 00:03:02.928
and that says that this

00:03:03.978 --> 00:03:05.395
is six microvolts

00:03:06.572 --> 00:03:08.116
in this direction.

00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:10.653
When we did this over here,

00:03:10.653 --> 00:03:13.008
because the signs of
the inputs are flipped,

00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:15.758
this was six microvolts this way.

00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:22.121
So again, because of the
enormous gain of this amplifier,

00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:25.244
this is always gonna
be a tiny, tiny number,

00:03:25.244 --> 00:03:28.161
and so, heck, why not make it zero?

00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:31.973
So if I treat this as
zero, what it means is,

00:03:31.973 --> 00:03:35.046
I'm gonna go right in here,

00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:37.379
and I'm gonna change this to

00:03:40.406 --> 00:03:41.323
zero volts.

00:03:43.734 --> 00:03:45.739
So let's make a couple
more observations, okay?

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.471
Right now, it says right here,

00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:48.971
V plus equals zero

00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:51.236
because it's grounded.

00:03:51.236 --> 00:03:54.069
So what does that mean V minus is?

00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:57.370
Well, V minus is also zero.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.083
V minus is zero.

00:03:59.083 --> 00:04:01.166
So that point right there

00:04:02.028 --> 00:04:03.445
is at zero volts.

00:04:05.728 --> 00:04:07.200
Okay, so that's pretty cool.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.911
So, that point's at zero volts.

00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:12.230
Now, is it connected to ground?

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.107
It's not connected to ground.

00:04:14.107 --> 00:04:15.269
But at zero volts,

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.167
because of what this op
amp is doing it for us,

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:22.134
this op amp is making sure,
by this feedback path,

00:04:22.134 --> 00:04:25.568
that this node is always next to this node

00:04:25.568 --> 00:04:27.829
and that means it's always zero.

00:04:27.829 --> 00:04:29.823
There's a really cool
word that we use for this

00:04:29.823 --> 00:04:31.823
and the word is virtual.

00:04:37.224 --> 00:04:38.718
And what does the word virtual mean?

00:04:38.718 --> 00:04:42.635
Well, virtual means that
something is not there

00:04:45.315 --> 00:04:47.315
but it seems like it is.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.226
So in this case, this node
is not connected to ground

00:05:03.226 --> 00:05:04.758
but it seems like it is.

00:05:04.758 --> 00:05:07.091
So this is referred to as a,

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:12.506
a virtual ground.

00:05:22.327 --> 00:05:25.009
So these two ideas say the same thing.

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.918
V plus equals V minus
is always the situation

00:05:27.918 --> 00:05:29.928
around the input to an op amp,

00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:31.611
when it's running properly,

00:05:31.611 --> 00:05:35.271
and in the case particularly
of this op amp configuration,

00:05:35.271 --> 00:05:38.454
where the plus terminal
is connected to ground,

00:05:38.454 --> 00:05:40.797
we say that the other terminal, V minus,

00:05:40.797 --> 00:05:44.714
is at a virtual ground,
or is a virtual ground.

00:05:45.593 --> 00:05:47.459
In the next video, I'm gonna go back

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:50.095
and do this inverting
configuration of the op amp.

00:05:50.095 --> 00:05:51.928
I'm gonna do the analysis again

00:05:51.928 --> 00:05:54.075
with this idea of a virtual ground

00:05:54.075 --> 00:05:55.625
and it's gonna be really easy

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:57.792
compared to doing all that algebra.
