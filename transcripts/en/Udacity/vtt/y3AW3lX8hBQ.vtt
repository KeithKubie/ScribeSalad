00:00:00.552 --> 00:00:02.358
Now with this in place, now here comes the

00:00:02.358 --> 00:00:04.600
really interesting question. It’s assignment

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.637
number two. And again it’s a programming

00:00:06.638 --> 00:00:09.939
assignment – free to skip.

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:12.016
Now that we have a function of flip, it gives

00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:15.898
me this list of a thousand outcomes from which

00:00:15.898 --> 00:00:18.512
I cannot derive things like the mean. Run this

00:00:18.512 --> 00:00:21.638
thing itself a thousand times and each time you

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:25.927
get a different mean, so this means zero, mean

00:00:25.927 --> 00:00:29.962
one and so on all the way to a mean nine, nine,nine.

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:32.759
And these means are continuous values

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.563
obviously, between zero and one and give you

00:00:35.563 --> 00:00:37.800
the same function as before, mean, variance,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.595
standard deviation, and flip and as I scroll

00:00:40.596 --> 00:00:44.130
down, I find this function sample, I want you

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.421
to put in code over here so that when I sample

00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:52.230
with the same n, I run the flip experiment a

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.982
thousand times and every single time I compute

00:00:54.982 --> 00:00:58.109
the mean and now I assemble a list of all the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.601
means into this thing called outcomes.

00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:04.191
The means will be continuous, I can do a history

00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:07.019
plot, it’ll be better with many bins, so this

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:09.814
notation over here gives me 30 bins. And to

00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:13.798
give you a feel for what to expect, this is

00:01:13.798 --> 00:01:16.632
a typical histogram I get out as a result.

00:01:16.632 --> 00:01:20.325
It’s really beautiful. If I increase n to 2000,

00:01:20.325 --> 00:01:23.010
I get this histogram over here. Apologize some

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.230
numbers are a little illegible over here but

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.892
the center of it is 0.5 and it falls off to

00:01:28.892 --> 00:01:32.300
smaller number to the left, to the right. You

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.857
can think of it as a distribution over the

00:01:34.857 --> 00:01:38.768
means outcomes of large numbers of coin flips

00:01:38.768 --> 00:01:41.626
and has an interesting shape. So go ahead and

00:01:41.626 --> 00:01:43.271
program it and see if you can reproduce these

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:47.000
results.
