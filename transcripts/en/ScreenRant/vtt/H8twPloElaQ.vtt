00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.670
Where movie trailers are used tease audiences
with a glimpse or action or adventure, taglines

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.859
have become an art form of their own, using
humor, terror, or mystery to convince moviegoers

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.250
to buy a ticket with just a single sentence.
But sometimes, a studio comes up with a tagline

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.560
so confusing, so boring, or downright pathetic,
they may have been better off without it.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.050
Here are Screen Rant�s 10 Worst Movie Taglines.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.800
A Good Day Day to Die Hard

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.780
The Die Hard series is best known for its
unapologetic action and John McClane's attitude

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.950
- and the taglines of the films tended to
reflect it. But with A Good Day to Die Hard,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.339
things took a different turn. The film�s
Russian setting may have been worth mentioning,

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.929
but we find it hard to believe that McClane
would approve of his catchphrase being twisted

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.340
into some eye-rolling wordplay. In the end,
�Yippee Ki-Yay Mother Russia� was all

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.149
fans needed to hear to steer clear entirely.

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.039
Basic Instinct 2

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.050
The original Basic Instinct made Sharon Stone
a superstar, pushing the envelope in more

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.049
ways than one. The sequel�s marketing made
it perfectly clear that Stone�s sex appeal

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.280
was the key selling point, but its tagline
� �everything interesting begins in the

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.390
mind� � is downright meaningless. Anyone
who saw the original movie could come up with

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.630
a more clever reference to the original film,
meaning the little time spent on the tagline

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.130
matched the effort put into the sequel perfectly.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.130
Alex Cross

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.710
There�s a time and place for almost any
pun, but in the case of Alex Cross, a dark

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.200
adaptation of James Patterson�s novel, wordplay
seemed more than a little out of place. �Don�t

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.060
ever cross Alex Cross� wasn�t just clunky,
since �Don�t cross Cross� would be a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.700
simpler version, but it framed the movie�s
psychologist/detective as some kind of action

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.640
hero. In the end, that promised an attitude
and story that the movie couldn�t deliver.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.640
Clash of the Titans

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.369
The original Clash of the Titans wowed audiences
with its stop motion battles and mystical

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.340
beasts, and its tagline, promising �An Epic
Entertainment Spectacular� in its marketing.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.569
So how did the remake excite audiences with
a brand new tagline? By confirming that in

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:10.170
the film, �Titans will clash.� Thankfully,
this painfully uninspired tagline was only

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.360
used in the first trailer before being scrapped.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.830
Avatar

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.440
James Cameron�s Avatar forever changed blockbuster
filmmaking � shattering box office records

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.260
and kicking off a new age of 3D filmmaking.
Its tagline was a little less impressive.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.450
For a movie that opened into movie history,
�Enter The World� is, sadly, a tagline

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.440
that could be attached to nearly every genre
movie ever made.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.960
Lethal Weapon 2

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.400
The Lethal Weapon series came to define the
�buddy cop� genre as a whole, and began

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.840
with taglines every bit as thrilling as the
action. Warning audiences to �pity the bad

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.750
guys� among other one-liners, the sequel
dropped the ball big time. �The magic is

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.040
back!� may seem a suitable tagline for a
fantasy adventure, but not an action film.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.750
�Still too old for this� would have made
at least some sense, but even if Lethal Weapon

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.849
3�s �the magic is back again� marked
a new low, it�s the sequel we have to blame

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.909
for it.

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.890
Star Trek V: The Final Frontier

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.459
Star Trek fans may accuse J.J. Abrams of swapping
smarts for action, he wasn�t the first to

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.790
try to draw audiences in with the promise
of big screen spectacle. That began with Star

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.790
Trek V: The Final Frontier, a movie promising
action so wild, movie theaters would need

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.000
to install seatbelts. The marketing apparently
worked, bringing the movie a bigger opening

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.180
weekend than the prior installments. But it
remains a poor fit for the actual film, meaning

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.280
the tagline, like the Enterprise crew, really
did go too far.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.280
Earthquake

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.231
These days, the term �event film� is thrown
around quite often, along with. But back in

00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:43.500
the 1970s, the term was brand new, as disaster
films overtook the American box office. Earthquake

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.489
was just one example, but the audience�s
demand for any and all disasters meant even

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.670
the most boring tagline imaginable was deemed
good enough.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.110
Citizen Kane

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.680
Director and star Orson Welles left a permanent
mark on cinema with Citizen Kane, hailed by

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.890
many as one of the greatest movies ever made.
The studio clearly wasn't aware that the film

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.010
would become a Hollywood treasure, since it
was also given one of the most uninspired

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.340
taglines in movie history. Telling moviegoers
that it's simply "terrific" is a far cry from

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.940
advertising Welles' unforgettable performance,
and sells short the truly revolutionary picture

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.989
Citizen Kane turned out to be.

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.310
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.980
The first Indiana Jones tagline promised that
the era of "Great Adventures" had returned,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.010
and Raiders of the Lost Ark didn't disappoint.
But when The Last Crusade called Indy back

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.170
into action, the studio decided to ignore
the film's plot, action, or even its fitting

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.860
send-off for the franchise hero. Aside from
the fact that "the man with the hat" is a

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.780
terrible nickname, it was never applied to
Jones in the first place, and the claim that

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.250
he "brings his dad" makes the film sound more
like a cheesy gimmick.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.730
