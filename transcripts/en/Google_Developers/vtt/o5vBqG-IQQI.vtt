MATT GAUNT: We're now going to
do the Material Design Panel.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.880
Come on.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.360
Jake should be here
to introduce me,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.450
but he got pulled
into a HR meeting.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.090
That could either
be great or his kind

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.020
of subtle hints of a promo
or fire may have gone sour.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.220
So if you could go cross
your fingers for him.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.500
I mean, I've seen his work.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.280
I'm kind of assuming I'm
never going to see him again.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.520
So, yeah, Material
Design and the Web.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.860
That's what we're going
to be talking about.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.080
Now, I have a slight confession.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.810
Jake's said like
Pauls do performance.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.800
I think I landed
this not for being

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.800
like Doug Designer, but
just Matt Material Design.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.450
They were scraping
the barrel a bit.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.990
Because I'm essentially
kind of a design noob.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.910
That's how I describe myself.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.720
But I'm obviously working
with the material design team

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.510
with Web Starter Kit.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.580
And I used to do a lot of
native app development.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.960
And it's interesting,
the culture there,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.710
because you're really
strongly encouraged.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.450
Like you follow the
design guidelines

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.110
that these native
platforms define.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.370
And it makes a lot of sense.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.130
Users get to this point where
they know what they're doing

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.760
and know what to expect.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.280
So I find material design really
interesting from that point

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.090
of view.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.310
So on the panel,
we have Zach, who

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.170
is one of our
material design team.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.330
You work on Android
and Polymer, I believe.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.530
ZACH GIBSON: Yeah, both things.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.880
MATT GAUNT: We have my
doppelganger, Rob Dobson,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.520
US version of me.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.310
He works on Polymer as
well, all the design.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.420
Then we have Josh, he's one of
our staff software engineers.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.360
I'm told he fixes all
the things for everyone.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.540
JOSH ESTELLE: That's
a slight exaggeration.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.570
MATT GAUNT: It's not.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.170
We have Roma Shah.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.840
Roma is the one who basically
made all the awesome theme

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.350
color stuff in
Chrome, as well as

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.090
the integration with recents.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.050
Tons of cool stuff.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.510
And then we have Paul Lewis.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.260
PAUL LEWIS: Hello.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.919
MATT GAUNT: Who is
a performance wonk.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.639
But he actually has an amazing
flair for design an animation.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.430
You wouldn't expect it
from looking at him.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.746
PAUL LEWIS: No, you
really wouldn't.

00:02:15.746 --> 00:02:16.700
Hidden talents.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.658
ROB DOBSON: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.300
MATT GAUNT: You may
not have heard that,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.090
but Rob just actually had
a really quite harsh dig.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.890
You should feel bad about that.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.110
PAUL LEWIS: At me?

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.320
I hope not, Rob.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.990
Or Matt, whichever one you are.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.676
MATT GAUNT: Ha, ha.

00:02:32.676 --> 00:02:34.050
So the first thing
I want to say,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.591
if you've got a question that
you actually want to ask anyone

00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:38.310
on the panel, please
do go to the mic.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.110
I will be looking at that
mic desperately hard.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.570
If no one is standing
there, I might cry.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.420
But you can also
tweet @ChromiumDev

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.140
and we will be getting
all of this through.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.970
And I'll ask them as
we're going along.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.830
I have to call out
Rahal, who actually asked

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.360
a question on the panel going,
Polymer is very heavyweight,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.590
like hundreds of kilobytes.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.322
If you just want to use material
design styling behavior,

00:03:01.322 --> 00:03:02.780
are you working on
addressing this?

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.754
What can we expect?

00:03:03.754 --> 00:03:05.170
And then after the
Polymer panels,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.440
he very kindly went in and added
a comment, never mind, I guess.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.790
So thank you very much
for asking the question

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.920
then, B, commenting afterwards.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.520
So first genuine question
is from Rachel Nabbers.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.940
And I really like this
because she describes herself

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.640
as an animation wonk.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.300
I love seeing Google putting
animation front and center

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.580
in material design
documentation.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.790
How would you suggest other
UXes and designers prioritize

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.560
animation at their companies.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.490
Or rather, why was it
a priority for Google?

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.465
And I'm going to consult a bit
of a wider question of like,

00:03:40.465 --> 00:03:42.590
what kind of made Google
realize that it needed

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.060
this strong design guideline?

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.180
I'm guessing Zach?

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.420
ZACHARY GIBSON: Yeah.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.200
So a lot of the way that we've
been thinking about design

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.610
right now is that it's no longer
important to just think screen

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.410
by screen.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.040
In that we have
to really consider

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.460
how you get from
screen to screen.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.230
So when we're doing a lot
of wireframes and UX design,

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.040
we're constantly trying
to draw the screens

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.130
in between what
we'd normally do.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.890
And because it's the
consistency in our animation

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.120
that makes us feel like we're
in a familiar environment.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.780
And that if we're doing motion
right, we, our users and us,

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.860
we can kind of predict the
future of like where things

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.750
will go when I touch something.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.960
So it's really important that
we're consistent with motion

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.460
and not overdoing it,
which we get a lot.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.690
MATT GAUNT: So it's funny
that you mentioned that.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.899
Because Ashuana S.,
from Mountain View,

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:54.690
they asked a question
that essentially that

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.720
was I'm going to basically
get the gist of it too.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.720
Given all the animations
in material design,

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.920
they look great.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.280
Like no one argues that.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.170
And when you first using
it, it's really nice.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.890
Eventually though, some people
may find that they dislike them

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.430
because it's getting in the way.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.650
So they were actually
suggesting like the idea

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.860
of having a novice
and advance mode.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.040
Like you've seen it,
you like it, cool.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.282
But, eh, get out of the way,

00:05:21.282 --> 00:05:22.740
ZACHARY GIBSON:
Yeah, I don't think

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.180
anyone disagrees
that we need to be

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.550
catering to what our users want.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.610
Whether it's slower animations
or faster animations

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.050
or no animations.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.300
I think that's a valuable
criticism that we're definitely

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.410
taking and thinking about.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.872
And Roma?

00:05:40.872 --> 00:05:42.580
ROMA SHAH: One thing
I would say in terms

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.350
of do we want to have different
toggles for novice users

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.220
or advanced users.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.280
I think what we need to do is
just evolve the specs to make

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.580
animations work better
for most people.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.220
And have the right
defaults, basically.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.678
I think one thing
that we try to do

00:05:57.678 --> 00:06:02.100
is simplify things and not
make it so that users are now

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.200
with the burden and the
onus of figuring out

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.200
what works for them.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.440
Like we want to help
people out with that.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.315
ZACHARY GIBSON: Yeah.

00:06:08.315 --> 00:06:12.470
And the spec is not a
finished things by any mean.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.290
And I think we're constantly
refining it, and working it,

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:22.000
and making things better,
and faster, and more smooth

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.659
as well.

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:24.950
ROMA SHAH: And I'll just to
add to that one more thing.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.381
That we are continuing
to work on desktop more.

00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:31.130
Zach is actually doing
a lot of this work.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.910
But a lot of the
things that you see

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.900
in motion on phones, in
tablets, make a lot of sense

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.710
because you have a
smaller real estate.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.100
Things are moving
a shorter distance.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.960
And those don't
necessarily translate well

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.810
to bigger screens.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.690
And so we are
keeping that in mind

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.610
and trying to figure out
what works across devices.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.180
One animation or transition
doesn't necessarily

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.571
work from phone to
like a 30 inch monitor.

00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:58.867
MATT GAUNT: Live question, go.

00:06:58.867 --> 00:06:59.450
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.670
So yesterday, Roma,
during her presentation,

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.900
spoke to the little
callout circle.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.220
That you should only ever
have one and sometimes none.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.100
What if I have two main things?

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.180
Like if I have a slide show,
I'm going back and forward.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.090
Is it ever OK to put
two of them on there?

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.060
And what is the reasoning
behind only having one?

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.990
MATT GAUNT: That's actually
a really good question.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.170
I just remember, I was
at an android event.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.570
Someone at literally
materialized their app.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.600
And they literally had the
exact same thing, two callouts.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.575
And it was kind of like, well do
they live up to the top or do I

00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:33.220
put one at the top,
down at the bottom.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.626
And yeah, it's a fair thing.

00:07:34.626 --> 00:07:36.250
You kind of want to
tweak a little bit.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:36.892
So yeah.

00:07:36.892 --> 00:07:38.350
ZACHARY GIBSON:
Yeah I think you're

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.600
talking about what we call
the floating action button.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.620
And it's something
that we see-- the way

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.380
that we describe is that
it should encapsulate

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.250
the hallmark of what
your application does.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.100
And maybe it's not
application based,

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.800
but it's contextual to
whatever screen or thing

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.910
that you're doing.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.910
So we feel that having one
gives our users less decisions

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.300
to make and is ultimately a
better thing for our users.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.260
And it also challenges us
as designers and developers

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.620
to make decisions about what
our apps should be doing,

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.470
and what their
purpose is, and trying

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.210
to boil that down
into one thing.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.470
Obviously, you can't always
get it down to one thing.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:24.090
And like, Google Maps has two.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.150
So I think that
what we're saying

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.560
is that we're trying
to boil things

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.910
down to a foundation that
are our recommendations.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:39.320
And if those aren't working,
I don't think anyone

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.190
on our team is
striking down them

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.220
as spec, as a policing
type thing too much.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.640
Hopefully not too much.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.320
But I think that
we're just trying

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.260
to make the best
recommendations to build

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.100
a really strong foundation for
all the stuff that we're doing.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.370
MATT GAUNT: So got a
little bit of beef.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.550
ZACHARY GIBSON: Yeah.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.220
MATT GAUNT: So you kind of
said like it's evolving.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.770
And the material
design side, it kind of

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:09.770
feels like its concrete.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.740
It's kind of like, here it
is, it's done, like boom.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.790
You've said it's not,
and it's evolving.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.650
But how?

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.990
If I were to implement it
or I wanted to follow it,

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.420
how do I stay up to date
with what's changed?

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.660
And also, how do I figure
out what's changed?

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.410
Like even if you just
tweaked it and said,

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.160
actually we've updated the spec.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.510
Like you need to know
what parts have changed.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.560
ZACHARY GIBSON: Sure.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.290
JOSH ESTELLE: So the spec
is definitely evolving.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.109
Right now the couple times
we've made big changes,

00:09:36.109 --> 00:09:38.650
I think we've done announcements
on the Google Design Twitter

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.870
and on the Google Design+ page.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.220
One thing we're working
on that's not quite

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.990
where we want to be, but is
to have more of a change log,

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.950
diff, of like here's
what changed in the spec

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.370
to have that be really
explicit and really clear.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.980
We know the spec needs an
easier way to search it too.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.220
So there's things coming
just for our own tools

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.940
and how we're communicating
this out that we think

00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.606
will get better.

00:09:59.606 --> 00:10:01.580
And will help communicate
some of these things.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.996
ZACHARY GIBSON:
And just to add, I

00:10:02.996 --> 00:10:05.790
think we'd be in
a worse situation

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.250
if we were saying, all right.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.180
It's done.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.450
We've solved it.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.850
Because everything is
constantly changing.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.860
And people are taking the
foundation that we've built

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.770
and doing really innovative
things on top of it.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.080
And that is defining
new patterns and things

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.710
about how we're using
our applications.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.420
And so we need to embrace that.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.889
Otherwise, it's going to
be obsolete before we know.

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:32.680
JOSH ESTELLE: A lot of
the changes too come

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.930
in the form of additions.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.180
So they're there
hasn't been too much in

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.444
like, we thought something
would be this way,

00:10:38.444 --> 00:10:39.360
but now it's this way.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.196
It's more, we thought
something was this way.

00:10:42.196 --> 00:10:43.570
But then someone
asked about what

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.360
about this thing, this thing,
and that thing that are all

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.560
related but we didn't
actually cover before.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.916
So a lot of the things
that we change in spec

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:51.420
are really adding
more clarification

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.160
to things that weren't specced
out as completely or fully

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.094
as we originally wanted to.

00:10:56.094 --> 00:10:59.020
MATT GAUNT: I have a question.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.520
AUDIENCE: So Polymer
material design

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.170
itself is very
opinionated In the sense

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.810
that there's specify breakpoints
that have been cited on.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.769
Do these breakpoints
correlate to Android as well?

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:12.310
And what's the
decisions behind them?

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:17.854
Is it metrics based
or why, basically?

00:11:17.854 --> 00:11:19.270
ROB DOBSON: Yeah,
my understanding

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.072
is that the
breakpoints follow what

00:11:23.072 --> 00:11:25.650
are the breakpoints
inside the spec.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.150
The spec has a kind
of grid that tells you

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.367
the spacing for everything.

00:11:30.367 --> 00:11:31.950
And we've just tried
to adhere to that

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.450
with our own breakpoints.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.040
Having said that,
those breakpoints

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.960
can be configured if it's
not quite working for you.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.582
You know, if you feel
like maybe you need,

00:11:43.582 --> 00:11:45.040
for instance, for
the drawer panel.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.980
You want the drawer panel to
come out at a different time.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.521
Perhaps it's making
your content look

00:11:48.521 --> 00:11:50.284
weird at the current breakpoint.

00:11:50.284 --> 00:11:52.700
You can always set that with
responsive width or something

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.180
like that.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.596
So some of these you should
be able to configure yourself.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.787
MATT GAUNT: Does material spec
actually define breakpoints?

00:12:01.787 --> 00:12:03.370
ROB DOBSON: I'm not
100% sure on that.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.290
I would have to ask Frankie.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:04.640
I don't know.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.390
Zach, do you know?

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:10.210
ZACHARY GIBSON: Yeah, no.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.200
MATT GAUNT: So Polymer--

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.670
ZACHARY GIBSON:
It's something that

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.070
is like, literally
before I walked in,

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.820
I am working on that right now.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.390
So I think that how we
handle responsive design,

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:29.820
and how our applications
and websites adapt

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:35.160
to different screens
is in progress.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.590
And we're just working on a
system right now that's just,

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.830
we're refining it, we're trying
to build responsive components,

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.760
and things that work
better crossover

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.880
huge variety of screen sizes.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.917
So I don't think
it's solved yet.

00:12:49.917 --> 00:12:51.500
ROB DOBSON: I should
clarify, actually

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.040
now that I think about it.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.290
The only components that I
think even have breakpoints

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.249
are core drawer panel
and core scaffold, right?

00:12:56.249 --> 00:12:58.289
Is there another one they
were using that had it?

00:12:58.289 --> 00:12:59.700
Yeah, those are the two.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.230
And I think those
breakpoints were decided on

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:06.820
based on as we were building
some of the material samples

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.690
internally.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.148
We were like this looks like
about where it needs to break.

00:13:10.148 --> 00:13:12.212
And perhaps that's where
we came up with it.

00:13:12.212 --> 00:13:14.420
JOSH ESTELLE: So then that's
why we need Zach's work.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.806
So it's not just everybody
thinking this is about right.

00:13:18.806 --> 00:13:20.730
PAUL LEWIS: But
that's OK, right?

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.320
If somebody knows their app
well enough, they can be like,

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.370
this doesn't look right
when it's like this.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.800
I should have the freedom
as the designer/developer

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.050
to kind of go in another
100 pixels is good by me.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.110
JOSH ESTELLE: Right,
but the point I'm making

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.455
is that if you're just not sure.

00:13:35.455 --> 00:13:36.830
If you're just
like, I don't know

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.780
where I should
put my breakpoint.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.720
Then following the spec
is a huge advantage.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.176
To just being
like, OK, someone's

00:13:42.176 --> 00:13:44.050
probably thought about
this more than I want.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.799
PAUL LEWIS: Your
sensible defaults, right?

00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:48.710
And then from there you
get to kind of go off road

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.417
if you think you
know the way better.

00:13:50.417 --> 00:13:51.750
MATT GAUNT: Nice metaphor, Paul.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.040
And I don't want to cut
this conversation off,

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.456
but literary this question has
come in on Twitter, though.

00:13:55.456 --> 00:13:58.290
No, [? anthemchris ?] says,
do any variation slash options

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.910
exist of material design?

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.860
Or is it case of one
size fits all philosophy?

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.980
And by the sounds of it, no
it's not one size fit all.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.285
Is that not fair to say?

00:14:06.285 --> 00:14:07.660
ROMA SHAH: Yeah,
we were actually

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.500
talking about this a lot
yesterday at the booth.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.170
But material design
is a system, right?

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.310
And there are some things
that if you take them

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.382
outside of the system
and use them one off.

00:14:18.382 --> 00:14:20.840
Like for example, there's three
different types of buttons.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.465
There's a button
that looks like text,

00:14:22.465 --> 00:14:25.290
it has absolutely
nothing around it.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.860
There's a floating button that
it's encased in something,

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.607
and it's like
popped off the page.

00:14:30.607 --> 00:14:32.440
And then there's the
floating action button.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.140
But if you take
that one button that

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.110
is literally capitalized text
with nothing encasing it.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.530
And say like, I'm
going to go off

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.780
and do my own thing with this.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.900
And not follow
where in the spec we

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.250
say this is probably where
this make sense to go.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:46.899
You should probably
stick to that.

00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:48.690
There are some cases
where things will just

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.660
break if you just kind of
go and use them randomly,

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.250
but there's also a
lot of flexibility

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.530
in the material design spec.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.210
I would say in terms of
structure, and app layout,

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.930
and like so many different
things that you could--

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.570
you know, who was asking about
the floating action button?

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.220
Like that's one thing
where we are probably

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.880
more strongly saying you should
have one thing everywhere.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.980
But obviously, there's always
going to be room to have

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.750
to have flexibility based on
the complexities of your app

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:24.180
and stuff that we cannot
possibly upfront consider just

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.960
sitting in our
offices at Google.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.310
MATT GAUNT: Nope,
that's all fair.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.700
So the next question I'm
going to ask is interesting.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.957
So it's from
[? Francis Berman. ?]

00:15:36.957 --> 00:15:39.290
It sounds like there's an
interest material design being

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.510
best practice for some UIs.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.660
How are design patterns being
validated, i.e., user tested?

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.850
And what are the
implications of encouraging

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.775
wide, non-Google
adoption of material?

00:15:51.775 --> 00:15:53.150
So the first part
of that I guess

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.990
is what are doing
for user testing.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.930
And then second part
is kind of what is,

00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:59.450
let's say everyone's
using material.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.800
What is the result of that?

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.890
Who wants to go?

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:03.600
JOSH ESTELLE: I'll
talk about user

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.724
testing a little bit first.

00:16:04.724 --> 00:16:08.010
So we have a user
experience research team

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.440
that's worked on material
design from the beginning.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.900
And they've user tested
all sorts of pieces,

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.387
sort of early in
the design process

00:16:14.387 --> 00:16:15.720
and later in the design process.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.805
And that's definitely influenced
some of the decisions.

00:16:18.805 --> 00:16:20.430
There are probably
things that we still

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:21.610
need to do more testing on.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:24.242
So I won't say that everything
has been perfectly tested

00:16:24.242 --> 00:16:24.950
and it's perfect.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.340
Because it's
probably not, right?

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.280
That's to the point of
how a lot of this stuff

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.113
is still going to be
changing and iterating.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:36.260
We also have been working with
all of the Google products

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.552
that are implementing
material design.

00:16:38.552 --> 00:16:42.120
And they have their own UX
testing and their own metrics.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.112
So maybe in their first version
where they launched something

00:16:45.112 --> 00:16:46.570
using some material
design concept,

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:48.270
they might collect a
bunch of data for us,

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.395
collect a bunch of metrics.

00:16:49.395 --> 00:16:51.679
And tell us that, we tried
this thing you had in spec,

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:53.970
but our click through rate
on this thing dropped a lot.

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.620
And that'll give us something
to take back to our design team

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.470
and recheck over those things.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.940
So we're both doing it on
those kind of smaller scale UX

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.420
studies and on the larger
scale metrics collected

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.210
at the product level.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.020
ZACHARY GIBSON: Yeah,
the second part.

00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:12.455
We get the question
a lot of where

00:17:12.455 --> 00:17:16.849
is my brand if I
follow this back.

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:22.030
And we've been reviewing a ton
of third party Android apps

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:22.700
right now.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.750
And it's really, it's
actually like so much

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.119
more exciting to see
how people are injecting

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:29.520
their brand into
their apps right now.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.980
Because we're no longer
saying, at least on Android,

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.930
like your logo is
this big, and it's

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.830
on the top left
corner in the toolbar.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.120
We're saying like, we're
leaving a little more open.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.130
It's flexible.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.170
You can express your brand
through color, through content,

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:47.570
through the way that you talk
about things in your app.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.460
And there are
other opportunities

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.930
for just like big, bold, brand
decisions that are not just

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.380
like a 50, 60 dip
thing in the corner.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.280
And so I think there are
definitely aspects of it

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.550
that like there
are similarities.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.000
And in those similarities,
like I said in the beginning,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.845
our users know where things are.

00:18:06.845 --> 00:18:09.220
And they know how things will
react when they touch them.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.500
And they know where certain
things will bring them

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.834
after they interact with them.

00:18:13.834 --> 00:18:16.000
And it's through those
patterns that people are just

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.037
learning about how to just whip
through the internet quicker.

00:18:21.037 --> 00:18:22.870
MATT GAUNT: And I guess
there's a little bit

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.100
of a dark art to it, right?

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.474
Because if you've got your
brand, you have a design team.

00:18:26.474 --> 00:18:29.340
They always want to get certain
things across to their user.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.866
To then apply that to something
else, it is kind of a fine art.

00:18:33.866 --> 00:18:35.240
That's always the
impression I've

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.440
got from any of the
designers I've worked with.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.980
So [? Francis Berman ?] has
also asked the next question.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.440
And this is right about when
it went a little bit Jerry

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.770
Springer during
the Polymer talk.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.100
When Alice was just
like, accessibility what?

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.310
What's going on with
focus states and stuff

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.960
like that in material?

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.910
So [? Francis Berman ?]
asked, what's

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:58.990
materials approach for
accessibility support?

00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.920
Silence.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.440
JOSH ESTELLE: We should
have accessibility support.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.080
ZACHARY GIBSON: Yeah.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.797
Yeah, totally.

00:19:05.797 --> 00:19:06.880
MATT GAUNT: That was easy.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.020
ZACHARY GIBSON: I
mean, I don't think

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:14.100
anybody is saying that we don't
want accessibility standards.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.330
Obviously, when our
goal is to organize

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.100
the world's information
for everyone,

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.690
everyone is included in that.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:26.790
And I think that we
are doing our best to--

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.740
and maybe it's not
totally apparent yet--

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.600
but we're doing our
best to make everything

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.704
that we're doing accessible
and work for everyone.

00:19:34.704 --> 00:19:36.995
JOSH ESTELLE: It's worth
noting somethings have already

00:19:36.995 --> 00:19:37.900
been worked on a lot.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.620
Like part of the
stuff behind the color

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:44.010
palette and some of the
suggested colors for typography

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:48.021
are directly aligned to
accessibility contrast ratios.

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:49.520
And we've thought
about those a lot.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.711
So a lot of that's
gone into there.

00:19:51.711 --> 00:19:53.210
Some of the things
like focus states

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.501
are things that we need to
spend a little more time on.

00:19:55.501 --> 00:19:57.230
We haven't completely
figured out

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.310
how that should work to hit
all the accessibility angles we

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:06.175
want to hit and also
fit within the design.

00:20:06.175 --> 00:20:08.800
MATT GAUNT: So one of the things
I was is going to add to that.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.530
I'm moderator, I can
say whatever I want.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:14.340
So in the Web
Starter Kit project,

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.990
we've already-- like
I said in the talk

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.073
yesterday-- we've been
working the material design

00:20:18.073 --> 00:20:21.190
team to bring in stuff
that's just not there.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.880
We're pretty much
already hitting

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.310
the accessibility stuff.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.134
Because obviously,
like Addy Osmani.

00:20:26.134 --> 00:20:27.300
He's working on the project.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.674
He knows what the
Polymer team is

00:20:28.674 --> 00:20:30.000
going through with all of this.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.470
And we're going to get
to that point as well.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.928
Where we're going
to go, hey, we've

00:20:32.928 --> 00:20:35.690
done this kind of like
materials design style guide.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.350
And we've also go
keyboard support.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.142
But what do we do with that now?

00:20:39.142 --> 00:20:41.350
Because we're ready to go
ahead and style that stuff,

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.184
but what do we do?

00:20:42.184 --> 00:20:44.850
So I think there's going to be a
point where if it's not clearly

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.305
defined, it's going to
be one of these things

00:20:47.305 --> 00:20:49.430
where each project's going
to start kicking people.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.750
Until then, people are probably
already building it in.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.125
But they're doing
their own thing

00:20:53.125 --> 00:20:54.720
and it's just not standardized.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.136
ZACHARY GIBSON:
Yeah, I definitely

00:20:56.136 --> 00:21:00.188
agree that standardizing
is beneficial.

00:21:00.188 --> 00:21:01.700
In progress.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.050
MATT GAUNT: I've got
so many questions here.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.990
No one live, damn it.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:08.640
So the next question
I'm going ask.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.850
And this is from
sil, but I'm assuming

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.410
that's Stuart Langridge,
because I follow him on Twitter.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:19.670
But basically his
question is saying,

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:21.560
if you work on a
native platform,

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.700
you're kind of encouraged
to follow certain design

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.760
guidelines.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.650
And one of the really
big Anti-Patterns

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.980
you can just never follow is
like, don't take an iOS app

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.510
and then just move
it onto Android.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:35.140
That's seen as a
massive Anti-Pattern.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.380
So why is it that
material design

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.480
can be pitched as
this kind of one size

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.000
fits all in terms of
just design language

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.241
across different platforms?

00:21:44.241 --> 00:21:46.490
And is that something that
we should encourage or not?

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.090
And then is there any problem
with doing the reverse?

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.460
Like taking some like
metro and moving that

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.740
onto Android and the web.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.489
So it's kind of, yeah, it's
an interesting question.

00:21:56.489 --> 00:21:58.030
Because it isn't
massive Anti-Pattern

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.130
within some communities,
and yet material design

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.489
is kind of like the opposite.

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:04.530
JOSH ESTELLE: I would say
something some of those

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:08.570
are Anti-Patterns because those
design guidelines were baked

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.400
in an environment
for a specific thing.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.430
Like most the iOS
design guidelines

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.905
are kind of specific
to mobile platform.

00:22:15.905 --> 00:22:18.530
Where a lot of the things we've
tried to do for material design

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.210
is really taking
a broader approach

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.650
to trying to design
across mobile and desktop

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:25.940
all at the same time.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.940
We haven't hit all
those things we need it,

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.700
but it's coming at that
from a broad angle.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.484
So I think that helps make it
apply more across the board

00:22:34.484 --> 00:22:36.900
than just taking something
that was designed for one thing

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.270
and putting it somewhere else.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.186
We're trying to design
something that's really

00:22:40.186 --> 00:22:42.290
designed for all things,
and help give people

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.920
guidelines to design your own
apps with that perspective.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.917
So when you're designing
an app, you're not

00:22:47.917 --> 00:22:50.000
designing your mobile app,
and then thinking like,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.625
oh how do I make a
website out of this?

00:22:51.625 --> 00:22:53.860
You're designing one app
that works well on a phone

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:59.582
and works well on a big monitor,
and everywhere in between.

00:22:59.582 --> 00:23:01.040
MATT GAUNT: So
[? Francis Berman ?]

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.250
has come back with
another question.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.910
You cheeky little pebble.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.480
So why wasn't accessibility
a priority at the start?

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.950
Now I think that's
already unfair.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:11.990
Because we heard
from the Polymer team

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:15.390
that there was like a blinking
thing involved, or pulsating.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.811
So it sounded like it was
thought from the start.

00:23:17.811 --> 00:23:18.810
At least, I hope it was.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.476
ZACHARY GIBSON: Yeah,
it definitely was.

00:23:20.476 --> 00:23:31.330
And sometimes, when doing
things in design first,

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.160
we push things a little
too far sometimes.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.170
Which is like--

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.070
MATT GAUNT: You have
too much coffee.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.986
ZACHARY GIBSON: Yeah,
we have too much coffee,

00:23:37.986 --> 00:23:39.200
whatever it is.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.010
And I think that is how
people should be designing.

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:46.200
Is to say, let's keep pushing
this further, and further,

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:46.700
and further.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.070
And sometimes you make decisions
that are, in that process,

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.540
not accessible.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.860
And so then it's like, OK,
where do we start to step back?

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.360
How do we reign
this in a little bit

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.916
to make sure that
everyone can use it?

00:24:01.916 --> 00:24:03.540
JOSH ESTELLE: I would
say accessibility

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.200
was a priority at
the start and--

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:05.330
ZACHARY GIBSON: Definitely.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:06.920
JOSH ESTELLE: --has been an
important priority through.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.580
I think focus states are an
example of something that

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.940
weren't prioritized as much
early on because we were

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.110
focusing on more towards mobile
and to touch interfaces, where

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.080
focus states are
just less important.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.440
Moving towards the
web and keyboards,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.850
then focus states are
much more important.

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:26.630
And that's why they've probably
come a little bit later.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.580
MATT GAUNT: That's
fair enough, I think.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.316
So we have a question
from someone called Pete.

00:24:35.316 --> 00:24:36.940
What lessons have
you learned from apps

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.810
that you've currently
switch to material?

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.240
I'm going to start
with Mr. Lewis

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.300
because you've been
awfully quiet, sir.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.680
PAUL LEWIS: That is because
I am feeling rather unwell.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.090
Do forgive me, folks.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.050
It's remarkable--

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.000
MATT GAUNT: If
you've got to run.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.660
PAUL LEWIS: If I've got
to run, don't judge me.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.580
It's just remarkable.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.520
I think jet lag.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.956
So I had the
challenge, I suppose,

00:24:56.956 --> 00:24:59.330
of taking the Chrome Dev Summit
site that I did last year

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:00.910
and materializing it.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.020
And it's really hard
because it's a content site.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.580
And the spec doesn't say
much about content sites.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.110
And so you look at it, and it
kind of goes, I'm material.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.370
But at the same time, I probably
got loads of things wrong.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.760
And so the challenges?

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.024
I don't know.

00:25:15.024 --> 00:25:17.440
It's to put in from the people
who do know material better

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.490
than you and ask them.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.073
And I'm in a fortunate
position that I

00:25:20.073 --> 00:25:22.030
can ask people who worked
on material and say,

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.010
is this wrong?

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.080
And they go, yes it is.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.690
And then you try and
fix it as best you can.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.100
You try and make it make sense.

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.207
And I hope I've
struck that balance.

00:25:32.207 --> 00:25:33.290
I did follow the keylines.

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:34.880
And so you're
trying, in my case,

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.120
I think it's like there
are some immutables.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.020
Like the keylines,
the contrast ratios,

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.790
the things that
you should make it

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.930
feel material, even
if you go and make

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.280
other mistakes or changes.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.440
And there are the things that I
think you have the flexibility.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.250
And you should take
advantage of the flexibility

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.041
and try and just make
it work for the thing

00:25:52.041 --> 00:25:53.160
that you're building.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.743
So that's probably
the thing I learned

00:25:54.743 --> 00:25:56.150
with it is, it's not immutable.

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:57.730
It's flexible.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:01.470
You just have to be the right
kind of flexible with it.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:04.420
ROB DOBSON: Yeah, I'll
sort of second that.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.430
In particular, there's
some immutable parts,

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.700
as Paul was saying,
that are really nice.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.760
When I did the first
pass at the contacts app.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.550
I sent it Zach.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.841
And then Zach was like,
there's a lot of things in here

00:26:16.841 --> 00:26:18.772
that we have in
the don't column.

00:26:18.772 --> 00:26:19.730
And I was like, OK, OK.

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:21.890
And he's like
follow the keylines.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.060
And the keylines, for those
of you who don't know,

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.226
they're just the guidelines.

00:26:25.226 --> 00:26:27.950
Basically saying, we have these
things that are like 8 dip

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.640
apart or whatever, or
16 dip or whatever.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.600
And it's really,
really, really nice

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:37.360
because they start
answering questions for you.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.940
Like you're looking
at your thing.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.930
And you're like, how far is this
things supposed to be apart?

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:41.950
And then you're just
like, oh yeah, OK.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:43.790
8 dip, 8 dip, 16 dip, whatever.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.370
And it's really nice because
then just rationalizing

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:47.940
how you should structure
your page and everything

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:48.773
becomes very simple.

00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:49.990
And it becomes very clean.

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:52.550
And your design just
starts to unify itself.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.650
So I actually really
like the guidance

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:57.410
that's there in the materials.

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.970
PAUL LEWIS: When you
look at the don'ts.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.562
I mean, I look at the don'ts,
and I'm like, ooo, that's ugly.

00:27:02.562 --> 00:27:04.520
It's like it's trying to
do the material thing,

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.610
but it looks so wrong.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:10.380
And the don'ts are just as
helpful as the dos for me.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:15.210
Because often when you look
at something, you're like, OK,

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.170
I get you what you
mean in this context.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:19.541
But the don'ts kind of
give you the Anti-Patterns.

00:27:19.541 --> 00:27:21.790
They give you the context
of the things you definitely

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:22.664
should not do.

00:27:22.664 --> 00:27:24.330
And when you look at
them, you go, yeah,

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.250
I see why I shouldn't
do that visually.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.070
At least, I hope.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.332
I mean, that's
helpful for me anyway.

00:27:29.332 --> 00:27:30.790
ROMA SHAH: Zach is
actually working

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:34.180
on more grids and layouts
for content oriented sites

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.830
verses like very appy sites.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.080
ZACHARY GIBSON: It's too late.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.800
It's coming.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.240
PAUL LEWIS: Next year, I get it.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.760
ZACHARY GIBSON: No, I mean
when you work on mobile first,

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.110
something has to come second.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:52.980
So every everything
has been in flight.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.455
And we've been thinking
about things all along

00:27:55.455 --> 00:27:56.290
and how it scales.

00:27:56.290 --> 00:28:00.800
But especially when we're
focusing so much focus

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:06.020
on the apps, content sites
like have come second.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.340
And we're working on
that stuff constantly.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.880
And getting back to just the
responsive grid solutions.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.414
Like it's included in
that content sites.

00:28:15.414 --> 00:28:16.580
PAUL LEWIS: I mean, you can.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:20.330
I mean the material spec site is
a site and it looks materially.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.820
There are clues there.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.940
It may be more work than
perhaps I would have liked,

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.810
but that's not to
say you can't do it.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:30.144
I don't believe it's impossible.

00:28:30.144 --> 00:28:31.768
And like you say,
you're working on it.

00:28:31.768 --> 00:28:33.310
So I'm high-fiving
from over here.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:35.393
ZACHARY GIBSON: I think
what we're doing right now

00:28:35.393 --> 00:28:37.890
is that the grid
that's on the spec site

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.090
is a very simple grid.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.430
And there's a very
simple logic to it.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:45.690
And what we're
trying to do is run

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.880
a lot of different
types of content

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.710
through it to see
how it holds up.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.870
And see where we
need to revise it

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:57.512
and turn it into something
that we can use systematically.

00:28:57.512 --> 00:28:59.720
MATT GAUNT: And it should
be quite fun because then I

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.360
can steal all of his hard work,
stick it in Web Starter Kit,

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.510
and steal all the glory.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:05.450
No.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:06.260
ZACHARY GIBSON: What
we're trying to do

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.950
is just build a really strong on
foundation for all this stuff.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:09.690
I keep saying it.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:15.970
But if we have that really
strong foundation, and tools

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:18.044
to help us get to that
strong foundation,

00:29:18.044 --> 00:29:19.710
then we don't have
to think about things

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.691
like how big should
make this type?

00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:24.190
How far should I put this thing
from the edge of the screen?

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.010
What should happen when
I touch this thing?

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.843
And we can think about
other, bigger, things

00:29:27.843 --> 00:29:30.350
like why are people
using our apps?

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.500
What should they
be using them for?

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.300
And what's next.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.730
MATT GAUNT: So Roma,
I was kind of hoping

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.500
you'd jump into some the stuff
you've been doing with Chrome.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.250
Because in my head,
the whole change

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:46.670
of Chrome around when
material design came out.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.900
Like Chrome now compared
to what used to be

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.839
is actually pretty different.

00:29:50.839 --> 00:29:52.380
And in my head, I
was like how do you

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.100
approach materializing Chrome?

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.190
Because ultimately material
can be in the web and Chrome

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:00.710
for Android is on a
thing that is material.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.730
And you're trying to
materialize the thing that

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:04.540
sat right in the middle.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.550
So do you any input on what
the hell happened there?

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:09.474
Like the process?

00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:10.140
ROMA SHAH: Yeah.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.306
So I mean, I touched on
this a little bit yesterday.

00:30:12.306 --> 00:30:16.890
But we don't think of
Chrome as an individual app,

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:17.980
like a single app, right?

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.590
It's a platform,
as a meta platform

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:21.810
within other platforms.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:26.450
And we're there for
other people's content.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:30.060
So the idea that we would
have a very material toolbar

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.400
and then right below it
would be a material toolbar

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.210
was like a little
too meta for us.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:39.720
So I think that we have taken a
lot of the material principles

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.930
and applied it to things
like pre L for Chrome

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:46.040
for Android that still
has its own tab switcher

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.610
and stuff like that.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:51.560
We have taken a spin on
material in the sense

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.030
of trying to give
developers the ability

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:59.060
to give theme color
to their toolbar.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:03.830
And like materialize the Chrome
parts of things for themselves.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:04.864
It's kind of desire.

00:31:04.864 --> 00:31:07.530
MATT GAUNT: You actually went to
level more meta than I actually

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:08.154
had considered.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.910
ROMA SHAH: One of the things
that we're thinking about

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:16.110
is what we do on desktop.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:17.900
So the easiest thing
for us to think about

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.950
is how to materialize the
content UI that we have.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.146
Like bookmarks, and
settings, and history,

00:31:24.146 --> 00:31:25.020
and all those things.

00:31:27.522 --> 00:31:28.980
But we still actually
haven't quite

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.000
figured out what to do
for things like desktop.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.710
Or things where we have this
like very, very old school

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.490
metaphor of tabs, you know.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:39.810
Which basically the
material design spec

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.450
doesn't cover a
lot of the things

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:44.500
that we do because we're
so weird and different.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.879
So we have to kind of figure
out where we do fit in there.

00:31:48.879 --> 00:31:49.920
The other thing that we--

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.378
ZACHARY GIBSON: I
just want to say,

00:31:51.378 --> 00:31:53.430
I bet that applies to
a lot of the ideas that

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:54.360
are floating around.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.510
That maybe we can't find the
specific thing in spec that

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.770
relates exactly to what
we're trying to redo.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.550
But I think what's most
exciting about all this stuff is

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:09.350
that, everyone is
rethinking what exists.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.980
And saying, how do
we do this better?

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:17.040
And even if not like-- even
if the icon is 25 dip instead

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.546
of 24 dip, it's still
challenging what exists

00:32:20.546 --> 00:32:21.920
and trying to make
things better.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.100
And I think that's the
really exciting part

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:24.982
about all of this.

00:32:24.982 --> 00:32:26.440
ROMA SHAH: One of
the things that's

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.356
come up that's resonated
with me because we've

00:32:28.356 --> 00:32:30.240
thought a lot about
this on the Chrome team

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.000
is like, we are on a bunch
of different platforms.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.620
We're on OS X, Windows,
Linux, iOS, Android.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:44.310
And because we're the
container for other apps,

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.570
we have to figure out
what the right balance is

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:50.610
between being consistent
across all our platforms

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:54.100
and also fitting into the
platforms in a way that doesn't

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.410
make us stand out
more than we want to.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.610
MATT GAUNT: That
all sounds fair.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:02.110
So meta.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.970
Live question.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:04.406
Yes, sir.

00:33:04.406 --> 00:33:05.822
AUDIENCE: So first
of all, I don't

00:33:05.822 --> 00:33:07.510
think this happens
enough in the industry.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:09.593
But I just want to say
props to the material team.

00:33:09.593 --> 00:33:11.330
I think it looks phenomenal.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:14.080
And you know, I think Google
has got a lot of flack

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.230
in he past for not
having enough design.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:18.050
So just, I think,
really great job.

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:22.610
So thanks for all the work
that you guys have done.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:27.400
It really is beautiful.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.480
My question is
more around how do

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.190
you see the process for
these kind of-- you know,

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:36.770
Paul, he did a lot of work
for some custom elements.

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:39.370
How do you see that involving
to getting to a point

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:41.010
where maybe they
become paper elements.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:44.590
And then maybe somehow get
into the specs somewhere.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:46.310
What is that process?

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:50.100
Do you see a [INAUDIBLE] request
happening in GitHub on Polymer,

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:50.620
or?

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.120
I'm just kind of curious how you
see new elements and new things

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.029
coming in from the community?

00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:58.570
ROB DOBSON: Yeah, I mean, right
know there are still actually

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.486
parts of the spec that
we haven't implemented.

00:34:00.486 --> 00:34:02.501
There's like certain
kinds of containers.

00:34:02.501 --> 00:34:04.750
One thing that people bring
up a lot is, they're like,

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:05.561
where's the card?

00:34:05.561 --> 00:34:07.060
How come you don't
just have a card?

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.500
Like that's all over the spec.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.654
And I'm like, eh.

00:34:09.654 --> 00:34:11.820
And I ask the team all the
time, can we have a card?

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:12.370
And they're like it's just--

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:14.110
PAUL LEWIS: I can
give you a card now.

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:14.380
ROB DOBSON: Yeah?

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.830
PAUL LEWIS: Now you want
to Polymerize my stuff?

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.040
ZACHARY GIBSON: Well we
have a card, actually,

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.020
but it's hidden.

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.090
It's in Polymer Labs.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:19.380
MATT GAUNT: What?

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.349
ROB DOBSON: Yeah,
it's swipeable card.

00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:21.974
It's in Polymer Labs
or something that.

00:34:21.974 --> 00:34:22.647
But it's hidden.

00:34:22.647 --> 00:34:23.980
But I want that to get promoted.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.570
I want that to be an
official paper element.

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:27.070
So, yeah.

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.278
There's some stuff that
actually is still in the spec

00:34:29.278 --> 00:34:31.743
that we have not pulled in yet.

00:34:31.743 --> 00:34:34.659
As far as an external pull
request for that, I don't know.

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:37.526
That's not something that I
guess we haven't-- I don't know

00:34:37.526 --> 00:34:38.650
if we've even seen any yet.

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:40.483
Someone being like,
here is a paper element,

00:34:40.483 --> 00:34:41.495
I made it for you.

00:34:41.495 --> 00:34:42.620
I guess we'd be open to it.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.059
I mean, we do everything
out in the open.

00:34:44.059 --> 00:34:46.659
And if it follows the spec, and
it's something that's missing,

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:48.560
that would be pretty cool.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.610
But yeah, I guess we
haven't even seen that yet.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:52.199
But if there's something
that the team is working on

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.929
that they want us to build, we
sit like next to each other.

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:58.210
So they just can tell us
and then we add it that way.

00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:59.630
JOSH ESTELLE:
We've interestingly

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.000
seen this even
just within Google.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.100
So the Polymer guys are
building their stuff.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.267
But there's other teams
building on other frameworks

00:35:06.267 --> 00:35:08.433
within Google, and they've
built different variants.

00:35:08.433 --> 00:35:10.450
And some people come along
and they're like, oh,

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:11.700
nobody built this thing.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.430
And so even just
within the company,

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:17.490
we're working a lot with
these different teams

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.700
to do things such that
they're following spec,

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:20.867
if it is outlined in spec.

00:35:20.867 --> 00:35:22.242
And if it's not
outlined in spec,

00:35:22.242 --> 00:35:24.030
we're trying to get them
in touch with designers.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.780
Now that doesn't scale
to the whole world,

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.210
to all the third party stuff.

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:32.400
But we've seen that happen
a little bit externally

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.990
with our icons.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:38.030
So we released the set of
all the material icons.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:41.320
And I feel like the day after we
released it, someone popped up.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.310
Like a totally third
party, unrelated site,

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:46.575
but it had all of our icons.

00:35:46.575 --> 00:35:47.950
And then they were
already making

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:50.130
like community
contributions to that

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:53.400
of icons done in our style.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.930
And that's something that's
really interesting and exciting

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:56.110
to me.

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.240
To see how we can leverage
the whole community

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.180
to contribute to these things.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.250
I do think it's a challenging
organizational problem

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.480
to keep the quality
and the to specness

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.860
of things, where
we want it to be.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.092
But I think it's something
interesting for us to look at.

00:36:13.092 --> 00:36:15.050
MATT GAUNT: One thing
that was in your question

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.840
that I don't think was answered.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.208
So what happens if someone
wanted to add something?

00:36:20.208 --> 00:36:21.582
Like say they felt
that something

00:36:21.582 --> 00:36:24.950
was missing in the spec and they
wanted to actually add that in?

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:26.480
How does that look
internally and it

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.890
could be made to work
externally as well?

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:34.550
ZACHARY GIBSON: I don't know.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:36.180
MATT GAUNT: I'll
take that as a no.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.055
ZACHARY GIBSON: Yeah.

00:36:37.055 --> 00:36:42.040
I mean, we're currently
doing a lot of app reviews.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.870
And those are both third
party reviews and internal app

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:46.696
reviews.

00:36:46.696 --> 00:36:48.070
And there are a
lot of stuff that

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:50.660
comes from those app reviews.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:55.590
Like we do need to think
about pagination or something.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:58.320
Maybe we need to get that in.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.770
And I don't know, there's
a lot of communities

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.630
that we all follow.

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:10.040
Like the Google design
Twitter and G+ and all the dev

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.810
relations like stuff
that's happening.

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:15.850
Like where we're watching
and in a non creepy way.

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:21.270
JOSH ESTELLE: With a
lot of it, just do it.

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:24.010
Like if you think there's an
article missing from the spec,

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.740
write the article and put it
on your blog, put it somewhere.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.274
And get the attention around it.

00:37:29.274 --> 00:37:31.190
And if the people latch
onto it, we'll see it.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.840
And I think that's--

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.090
The same thing with like, say
you build some new component.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:39.030
Just built it, creative
it, put it out there.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.800
Let people use it.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.280
And I think that
contributes back

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.880
to the whole
community doing this.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.380
MATT GAUNT: And
there was actually--

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.390
this is something that happened
in the Android community.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:49.480
Because you had the nav
drawer coming from the side.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.560
And basically there was a
ton of third party libraries.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.380
And Google didn't
actually have a voice

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.390
of whether to do it or not.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:58.810
And it was kind of
frustrating to watch

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:02.140
the community basically try
and do different things.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.580
And it got even worse
because each Google product

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.750
had a slightly different
version of the drawer.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.660
And everyone was like, oh, I've
done a library for this one,

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.100
I've done a library
for that one.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.180
And it was kind of frustrating.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.780
But eventually, the
fact the community

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.290
latched on to these libraries
and were literally like look,

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:18.990
this is actually a navigation
pattern that works for us,

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:21.460
and users seem to like it.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.543
We listened and then we
just went and did it.

00:38:23.543 --> 00:38:25.292
I don't like how long
it took us to do it.

00:38:25.292 --> 00:38:25.870
I'd say that.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.650
But it happened.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.220
So it could easily be like that.

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.600
I also really like the
analogy that someone still, I

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.420
think some of our products.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.615
And they literally
took a nav drawer

00:38:34.615 --> 00:38:35.780
and went here's
the different ways

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.020
that they do it in
different products.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.770
And this is great because if
you have to sell something

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.395
to a client, you pick
one, and then use

00:38:40.395 --> 00:38:41.970
this as an actual guide for it.

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:44.320
And validate it that way.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.864
That's bad.

00:38:45.864 --> 00:38:46.780
So we should fix that.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.830
But yeah, thank you
for your question.

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:51.460
So this is from Roman Nurik.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.310
He's on the dev rel design team.

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:58.060
Since material design
is focused on touch,

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.950
should anything change
when designing primarily

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:02.960
for keyboard and mice?

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:06.750
And I'm going to open it up to
TVs as well, because why not?

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:08.960
Keypad.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.060
ZACHARY GIBSON: Yes.

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.020
Our stuff should
adapt to the way

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.730
that our users are using them.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:17.630
We do try and keep a lot
of stuff similar though.

00:39:20.697 --> 00:39:22.280
The Chromebook pixel
is a touch screen

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.113
so it should have minimum
touch targets that

00:39:24.113 --> 00:39:26.230
are the same as any
other touchscreen.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:29.800
And I think with
those things in mind,

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.180
we have taken into
careful consideration

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:37.700
how stuff looks and feels on
different screens and devices.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:42.305
And so yes and no.

00:39:42.305 --> 00:39:43.680
MATT GAUNT: I
remember an article

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.930
from Luke W. He actually
made the point if you tried

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:50.600
to change what kind of UI
you do based whether it was

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.840
on the touch screen or
a mouse and keyboard,

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.860
it actually became really
hard to do on the web.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:59.010
That's-- I want to say
borderline impossible to do

00:39:59.010 --> 00:39:59.870
perfectly.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.337
ZACHARY GIBSON: Yeah.

00:40:01.337 --> 00:40:03.670
MATT GAUNT: Do Polymer, do
you touch anything like this?

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:06.210
Or is it just like, you're
still in the realm of web

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:08.195
and this is just the
state of the nation?

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:12.940
ROB DOBSON: No,
that's all right.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.360
I don't know if we're
significantly changing anything

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.620
when you-- like our UI isn't
changing or anything like that

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:24.890
for elements drawn on like a
mobile screen or a desktop.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:27.910
In practice, I mean when
I was pulling the contacts

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:30.680
app for instance, there wasn't
this thing where I was like,

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.634
oh there's this missing piece.

00:40:32.634 --> 00:40:34.550
It didn't feel like there
was a missing piece.

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:36.510
I didn't feel like it
was a problem I actually

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.339
even ran into.

00:40:38.339 --> 00:40:39.880
So I'd be interested
to see why Roman

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.660
was particularly
curious about this.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.670
If there's something
specific that

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:46.250
is happening to him in his app
or his work where he's like,

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:48.437
hey, this is actually
a problem for me.

00:40:48.437 --> 00:40:49.770
MATT GAUNT: That's a good point.

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:52.700
Roman, get on the Twitter.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.980
So the next question is
from Marcus from Toronto.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.981
Material design looks
slash feels great.

00:40:58.981 --> 00:41:01.230
But there is a worry that
over use will result in apps

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:03.063
that all look and feel
the same, as happened

00:41:03.063 --> 00:41:05.550
with other properties UI
libraries like jQuery UI

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:07.080
and Bootstrap.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:10.550
What should devs slash designers
do to keep it feeling unique?

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.020
And this kind of
lends itself to,

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.446
if you were going to deviate
from the spec, when, how,

00:41:16.446 --> 00:41:19.850
and what sort of parameters
should they stick to?

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:22.032
Or is it kind of like
deviate because you want to

00:41:22.032 --> 00:41:23.240
and you feel that it's right.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.980
ZACHARY GIBSON: I
think my opinion

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.140
on that is like some
of the best design

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.780
comes from a really
deep understanding

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.360
of a grid and a structure.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.250
And then it breaks that.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:37.210
That's when the
best things happen.

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:42.010
Because there's an awareness
of what exists and breaking

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:43.150
it can be really exciting.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:44.940
PAUL LEWIS: Learn the rules
like a pro so you can break them

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:45.730
like an artist.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:46.630
ZACHARY GIBSON:
There you go, yeah.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:47.755
MATT GAUNT: Call him Pablo.

00:41:47.755 --> 00:41:49.730
PAUL LEWIS: Bring
out Picasso-- again.

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:50.700
Nailed it.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:51.575
ZACHARY GIBSON: Yeah.

00:41:51.575 --> 00:41:56.230
And I think we're all sort
of true believers in that.

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:58.140
I think the floating
action button thing then

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:01.620
we have now is a good example of
like where were pushing people

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.190
to do innovative things with it.

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:06.360
And I think anyone
on L will start

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.480
to see like some of
that stuff happening.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:12.205
And hopefully on
the web as well.

00:42:12.205 --> 00:42:13.580
PAUL LEWIS: I do
think that there

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.910
is a-- like I said
before, I think

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:16.118
there are some of immutables.

00:42:16.118 --> 00:42:19.170
There are good reasons why
a lot of those things exist,

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:20.560
the recommendations exist.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.200
And there is a time
and place for branding.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.284
But if I think if
you break rules,

00:42:25.284 --> 00:42:26.450
a bit like with development.

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:29.120
I think you break them for good
reasons, and noble intentions,

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.400
and you have to be
able to justify.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.420
It wasn't just, I
did it for the laugh.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.170
I did it because I
wanted to feel special.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:36.878
You do it because you
believe that you're

00:42:36.878 --> 00:42:38.310
doing the right
thing by your user

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:39.900
by breaking that convention.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.860
Otherwise I don't believe it's
a convention you should break.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.330
Because you've now
forced the users

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:49.039
to relearn how to use your app
when they were happy using all

00:42:49.039 --> 00:42:51.330
the other apps that did the
same thing in the same way.

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:52.246
ZACHARY GIBSON: Right.

00:42:52.246 --> 00:42:55.420
I mean I don't want to discount
like patterns because patterns

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.500
are good.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:00.220
And like my mom can go
from using her Android

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.800
phone to her iPad
and know where things

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.442
are because there's a
consistent structure.

00:43:05.442 --> 00:43:07.900
JOSH ESTELLE: And there's a
lot of flexibility in the spec.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.590
So the idea that you
have to break out

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:12.161
of the spec to make your app
look different is not true.

00:43:12.161 --> 00:43:13.660
You can make your
app look different

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.650
and still completely
follow the spec.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:17.466
There's a lot of room in there.

00:43:17.466 --> 00:43:19.340
MATT GAUNT: So I'm afraid
we are out of time.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.800
I'm very, very sorry.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:25.700
But everyone give a round of
applause to the lovely panel.
