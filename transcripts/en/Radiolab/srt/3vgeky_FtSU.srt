00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,190
Kaye I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,220
This is Radiolab our topic today is
mathematics mathematics and mathematics.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,410
This post is our topic but actually we
do have a gripping story for you coming

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:15,800
up now from our producer
Shawn Wheeler. Hey sorry. Hey.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,670
And this is about math right. Yeah.
Well math and friendship really.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,950
And I heard it from Steve Strogatz.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,310
He's a mathematician at Cornell University
and he's been on the show once or

8
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:27,540
twice. OK.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,590
And we sat down in the studio and he
told me about you back up and tell me a

10
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:35,820
little bit about high school and about
his high school math teacher Don Jaffrey.

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,290
Well there were several striking
and peculiar things about him.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,880
I mean probably the first thing is that
he was physically incredibly impressive.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,560
You hold the chalk between his enormous
fingers and right on the board the chalk

14
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:53,040
would pulverize with each stroke so that
there would be this cloud of chalk dust

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,550
all over him and his big sweater and
another thing that was very unusual about

16
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:00,240
him.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,020
He'd be in the middle of the calculation
standing at the board chalk dust all

18
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:05,010
over him as usual.

19
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,070
Then he would space out and he'd get a
look in his eye a kind of faraway look

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,920
and then he'd say Oh this reminds me with
the hushed tone This reminds me of the

21
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:20,190
time Jamie Williams calculated the formula
for the end of term and the Fibonacci

22
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,024
sequence.

23
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,770
Who's Jamie with Jamie
Williams was a student at.

24
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,720
He was just a couple of years ahead
of Stephen and Mr. Jeffries Clark.

25
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,470
And that was part of the mystique.

26
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,180
You know that now he was graduated
and it was as if the secret was.

27
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,280
Was lost to the ages.

28
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,880
But the point was that he would talk
about a student with reverence with

29
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:43,714
reverence. Yeah.

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,310
What was very thrilling about that is
that there was this kind of chain that we

31
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:49,750
were now becoming part of.

32
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,280
Yeah. So then I'm off to college.

33
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,770
And it was it started very
early I started to write to him.

34
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,530
It was sort of like an annual tidbit.

35
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,620
Dear Mr. Joffrey here's the gem
that I learned this year in.

36
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,000
So Steve would write to him Mr. Joffrey
would write back add something ask him a

37
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:17,200
new question and then went on like that
for a while with Steve kind of still

38
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:20,740
being like a student and Mr.
Joffrey still like a teacher.

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,570
There was one moment though where.

40
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,860
Something new happened
where he wrote to me.

41
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,670
Asking for help.

42
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,690
He said a question came up in his class
about an elliptical swimming pool.

43
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,120
So you know picture a swimming pool.

44
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,740
Often there's a little border on the
edge of the swimming pool like a piece of

45
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:45,300
concrete that lines the pool you
stand on that part before jumping in.

46
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,250
And so the question was if you had an
elliptical swimming pool with a one foot

47
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,350
boarder around it is the outer edge
of the border. Also on the lips.

48
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,270
Something about that really appealed
to me it was a very nice math problem.

49
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,950
Probably there was a little bit of a show
off in me like I thought if I could do

50
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:07,730
this he's going to say something
nice. You'll become part of the panel.

51
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,990
Maybe he'll enter the pantheon they'll
start talking about me like they used to

52
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,250
talk about Jamie Williams.

53
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,450
So I stopped whatever I was doing and I
worked hard on that ellipse problem and

54
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:19,750
I figured out two or three different ways
too. Turns out it's never an ellipse.

55
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,230
If it cannot be an ellipse so sat down
and wrote back to Mr Joffrey about this

56
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:26,284
puzzle.

57
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,150
But I didn't just show him the answer.

58
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,810
I wrote the answer in a very loving
and gentle way that was meant to be

59
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,093
empathetic.

60
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,150
That is I know where you're coming from
and I'm going to just start from scratch

61
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,110
to lead you from where you are to where
you need to be to solve this problem.

62
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,820
In other words Steve acted like he was
the teacher and Mr. Joffrey played along

63
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,280
and this was such a generous
thing in retrospect.

64
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,050
The humility the modesty the kindness
in playing the role of a student.

65
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,530
It's like he knew that that's what I
needed and man I loved it. I would.

66
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,360
I couldn't wait for the next question.

67
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,160
And as Steve went off to graduate school
to become a math professor himself he

68
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:08,260
and Mr. Joffrey kept
writing to each other.

69
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,410
In fact they were writing
to each other quite a lot.

70
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,640
There was one sequence in March of 1989
where we wrote to each other almost

71
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:16,474
every day.

72
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,650
He sent me a puzzle. I worked on it. I
showed him a really beautiful answer.

73
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,130
He expressed kind of ecstasy
and seeing this answer

74
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,480
it was kind of a mathematicians dream
correspondence of puzzles and equations.

75
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,130
And Steve loved it. But every so often.

76
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,160
Mr. Joffrey would.

77
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,150
Break the routine a little bit.

78
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,230
He would say things about that
he was doing some jazz piano gig.

79
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,520
He would sometimes write
about he had three sons.

80
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,600
He would talk about them a little
bit and you know I feel embarrassed.

81
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,520
It feels mean but I remember not liking
those parts of the letters and I didn't

82
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:00,300
write about that.

83
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,300
I mean I would say maybe I was playing
some tennis or but I have lines in some

84
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:09,600
of my letters that say after a few of
those sentences. Okay enough stalling.

85
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,733
Here's the math problem.

86
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,710
But then in later years he would almost
pointedly ask me things like there was a

87
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:21,610
time when he said that rumor has it that
you're engaged. We wish you the best.

88
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,463
If this is true.

89
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,530
And guess what I got
my letter back to him.

90
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,030
I didn't say anything. You remembered
like thinking not to respond or just.

91
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,270
Well I I I can tell you what was going
on which is that I was already in couple

92
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:44,061
therapy with my fiance say you know like
in that time the letters were a kind of

93
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,710
refuge from all that.

94
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,030
That is we could go into this pristine
world of math where things are simple and

95
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,913
logical and.

96
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,893
Well-ordered.

97
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,490
There may have been part of me
that felt like I'll come on it.

98
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,440
This is the one place where it's all.

99
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,513
Perfect

100
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,360
but over the years that perfect world
got a little less perfect because his

101
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,430
older son died Marshall died

102
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,510
Marshall died when he was only
27 and uh I didn't ask about it.

103
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,530
Can you believe this. I feel so sick
about this when I think about it now.

104
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,320
So you were just right back.
Oh I've got another poll.

105
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,780
Got another math problem for you.

106
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,643
Look at this.

107
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,093
Yeah

108
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,030
and then more than 20 years
into this relationship.

109
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,920
Letter writing Mr. Joffrey retired and
now that he couldn't teach anymore he'd

110
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:47,921
write to me he'd show me these beautiful
math problems that he would make up for

111
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:52,010
himself usually about hawks flying
over the earth and you know how much

112
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:55,520
spherical area can the hawks see
if it's at such and such altitude.

113
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,410
And what is happening at this time is
that now I have just gotten married and

114
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:03,800
we've started having kids and I'm
not answering his letters anymore.

115
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,800
They're sitting in their
envelopes stacking up.

116
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,530
He's writing them faster than
I can answer him a lot faster.

117
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,920
And then at one point I got
one more letter from Mr.
Joffrey except as soon as I

118
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:21,281
looked at the envelope I could see
that something was really very wrong.

119
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,470
His handwriting didn't look normal.

120
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,530
That my address my name was written in a
craggy like shaky shaky and I knew what

121
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:34,470
that looked like because my dad wrote
like that when he had Parkinson's.

122
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,960
So I thought what what is this.

123
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,250
And I opened the letter and the first
sentences eek. I just had a mild stroke.

124
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,970
I didn't write back to him right away.

125
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,493
I didn't call him

126
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,870
and then just a couple
months later my brother died

127
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,690
very suddenly. And.

128
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,000
He heard about it from someone else and
immediately wrote to me how you know

129
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:02,300
that he was very he and his wife had heard
and they were very sorry to hear that

130
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,760
my brother had died. That to me was

131
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,580
you know I still had never said I'm sorry
about Marshall all those years ago and

132
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,270
it kept nagging at me.

133
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,530
Why won't you talk to him beckoning
and you obviously care about him.

134
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,660
It's sort of like an in math.

135
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,370
There's this concept of bifurcation
which really means a fork in the road a

136
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,500
splitting when the forces
on a system get too large.

137
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,490
There can be a moment when the
dynamics of that system change.

138
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,103
Abruptly.

139
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,790
This was a moment of bifurcation.

140
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,740
I should have just said how sorry
I was to hear about about Marshall.

141
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,060
So I I thought I gotta go talk to him
and ask him Can I come to your house.

142
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,300
You know he seemed a little reluctant
about it but you know. Okay fine.

143
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,630
So I bought a little pocket tape recorder
just a cheap thing drove up Route 95

144
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:08,970
to his house in Connecticut on the shore
knock on the door here the piano that

145
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:10,260
was playing inside Stop.

146
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,340
He comes and rushes to see me and we
give each other hugs take out a big plate

147
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:17,880
of cold cuts and say let's
sit out on the porch.

148
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Does that work well.

149
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,580
So we're we're eating and be recording
and then he takes out his journal.

150
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,740
I decided that I would keep a journal
since I was retired where he's drawn

151
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:32,520
pictures of all kinds of birds and here's
a picture of me doing an eagle watch

152
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:33,810
out in the Connecticut River.

153
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,710
And there's a lot of stuff back
in his typical way. I don't know.

154
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,670
This is a bird it's moved up from
the south too. You never saw these.

155
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,840
Well what some people call buzzards.
Yeah they've they've moved up here and.

156
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,240
This is one of my favorite birds.

157
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,440
It's a Marsh Hawk and it
flies low over the meadows.

158
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,990
More about that.

159
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,690
Hank says I'm going to take you over
to see a rough legged Hawk. Now.

160
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,450
He didn't say we're going to see
if we can see a rough legged hawk.

161
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,940
He produced.

162
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,770
And I'm thinking to myself I don't
not really interested in this.

163
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,570
I want to talk about him about all these
things that are that we never talked

164
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:20,200
about that are emotional hard things
like what happened. How did your son die.

165
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,270
Have a lot of work.

166
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,070
They're just trying to make eyes for
it in extra hours to pay guys extra.

167
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,670
There was a fidgeting feeling inside
me and benefits and right other stuff.

168
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,230
And there was a pause.

169
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,720
My heart was beating fast.

170
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,190
Then I thought I'm gonna ask him.

171
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,850
So I don't think we ever talked
about Marshall but I want it I I did.

172
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,703
I asked what.

173
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,870
I didn't really know him either but I
know that he died very young and I know

174
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,890
what what happened.

175
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,020
You know what happened to Marshall. Well.

176
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,443
You know.

177
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,650
That's not what I want to talk about.

178
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,650
And I think he's gonna say that's
something we don't talk about.

179
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,790
Well it was he he had ever as a star.

180
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,703
Energy.

181
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,100
He did. He had a wonderful 27 years.

182
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,330
Music was gone. It was so beautiful.

183
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,340
And so and so we went to
mass so uplifting and sweet.

184
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,950
He'd be at home and we'd sit around
the piano and I'll get out there.

185
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,930
Cole Porter songbook I just turned to
a page something that he'd never seen.

186
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,350
He could sight read it play it
and sing it all in one time.

187
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,350
Well that's an I thought.

188
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,660
This guy's got a multi-channel
line that I wish I had.

189
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,960
You know he talked about what a
great what a great life he had.

190
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,750
In his 27 years in the waning moments.

191
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,750
He'd stay up all night long playing the
piano just the house which is filled

192
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,100
with beautiful music

193
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,980
and he had made plans to get a job at
the New England Conservatory and things

194
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:10,130
like that. But. The fates were wrong.

195
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,250
Oh yeah. We miss.

196
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,190
Was was that I mean in that moment
did it change the way you see him.

197
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,230
Well

198
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,690
change I have to tell
you how that day ended.

199
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,820
So we talked more record and I asked him
at one point do you think Marshall had

200
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:48,821
a religious feeling and he said oh yeah
he does think he felt close to having to

201
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:51,560
come to terms with somebody out there.

202
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,870
Yeah that was a good thing that
that I think he went peacefully.

203
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,860
Then and actually conversation drifted
to easier things like calculus problems.

204
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,910
And we talked to more about math and
then he said How about a swim or let's go

205
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,380
to gym I should go out to the beach and
I'd like to do something where I get

206
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:10,214
outdoors a.

207
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,140
So we did go to the beach and it was a
beautiful evening and there were waves.

208
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,750
Coming in from Long Island Sound.

209
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,660
In fact we were talking
about a math problem about
waves about 40 analysis which

210
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,340
is really about well infinity and the
fact that if you take an infinite number

211
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:33,200
of simple waves you can create any shape
of wave you want as long as it's a wave

212
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,063
that repeats.

213
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:39,310
But then Mr. Jaffrey asked But how do
you create waves that don't repeat waves

214
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:43,100
that change sometimes
waves don't exactly repeat.

215
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,650
They can grow or die out.

216
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,250
And Steve told them that to
deal with those kinds of waves.

217
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,680
You need a different kind of infinity.

218
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,090
Not the kind where you just keep adding
and adding and adding numbers but the

219
00:13:56,091 --> 00:14:01,091
kind that sits in the space between two
numbers this higher kind of infinity

220
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,640
then than Don had thought about before.

221
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,980
Thanks to Susan Miller because you
interviewed Steven produced that story.

222
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,660
Thanks to Steve Strogatz who has a book
out now which tells this very story

223
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,290
called the calculus of friendship.

224
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,360
I'm Jad Abumrad. Three
seconds to do you are Robert.
