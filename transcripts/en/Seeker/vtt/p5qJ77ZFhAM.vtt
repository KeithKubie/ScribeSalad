00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.460
A couple years ago, comet 67P held the world's
attention as humanity landed its first tiny

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.720
robot on its face.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.110
We cheered, we hugged, we tweeted.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.400
But… then what happened?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.390
Howdy DNews friends and relatives, Trace here.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.891
Back in November 2014, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
got its first manmade visitor in the form

00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:26.640
of a washing-machine-sized lander named Philae.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.770
It was supposed to live for a month, but it
landed badly bouncing on the surface into

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.770
a shady crater.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.950
Without sunlight, Philae had only 57 hours
until the battery died.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.250
In that time, the scientists gathered reams
of data, which they've been analyzing over

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.540
the last year; so what have we learned?

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.390
Well, firstly, even though it was unplanned,
scientists learned something just from analyzing

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.460
the sound of Philae's bounce: comets are much
harder than previously thought! 67P is probably

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.520
made of "rock-solid ice beneath a four- to
eight-inch layer of dust."

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.760
We thought comets were soft, obviously we
were wrong.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.820
Once it landed, Philae famously discovered
"organic" molecules like acetone, propionaldehyde,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.690
methyl isocyanate, and formaldehyde.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.510
They don't sound great, but formaldehyde is
implicated in the creation of ribose which

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.740
is found in DNA…

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.870
This means if a comet crashed into a planet
with the right conditions (like water, and

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.730
warmth) these molecules might help life along.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.730
Maybe.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.440
A major goal of the Philae/Rosetta mission
was to FIND water on this comet, and find

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.440
it they did!

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.760
Unfortunately, a paper in Science stated the
Rosetta's Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.670
Analysis found the molecular makeup of 67P's
water wasn't quite right.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.230
Here’s why: All water molecules are two
hydrogen and an oxygen, H-two-O. Here on Earth,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.880
all water has three heavy water molecules
for every 10,000 regular water molecules.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.100
Heavy water is also called deuterium, and
it simply has an extra neutron in its nucleus.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.440
This is completely normal.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.150
The water on 67P, however, has three times
the deuterium of our water.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.140
This means the comet's water isn't compatible
with ours.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.611
Since these ratios don't really change, this
shows comets probably didn't bring water to

00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:10.611
Earth.

00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:15.640
The same instrument also made the most surprising
discovery on 67P a few months later, molecular

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.640
oxygen!

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.830
Published in Nature the discovery of oxygen
was completely unexpected.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.900
Astronomers have detected oxygen only twice
outside of our solar system, and never on

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.000
a comet.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.750
Some scientists felt the presence of both
oxygen and hydrogen combined with ultraviolet

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.720
radiation from the sun could cause these atoms
to recombine into H-two-O and O-three: water

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.720
and Ozone!

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.000
But unfortunately, that didn't happen either.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.730
As a comet approaches the sun, it warms and
develops a tail!

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.050
The tail is spews about 100kg (220lbs) per
second in comet material!

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.260
But unfortunately, the ratio of H2O and O2
stayed the same, showing oxygen permeated

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.860
all of 67P and wasn't combining to make water
and ozone.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.860
Dang.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.310
But it does indicate that comets might PREDATE
our solar system altogether!

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.040
And, remember, 67P is just one comet.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.160
And studying which features come from the
formation of the universe and which came later

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.512
is one of the many puzzles --aside from the
presence of water, hydrogen, oxygen and all

00:03:15.512 --> 00:03:16.512
these other molecules.

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:21.290
Maybe once we go to another comet with more
robots or even people, we could learn EVEN

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.290
MORE!

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.570
Look, if you have no idea how we even GOT
to this comet thing with Rosetta or Philae:

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.570
1.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.310
I'm proud of you for sticking around, but
2.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.730
I did a video on it.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:44.020
Check 
it out here.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:52.830
Landing on a comet, then an asteroid, then
TO THE MOOOO---MARS!!

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.730
To M
