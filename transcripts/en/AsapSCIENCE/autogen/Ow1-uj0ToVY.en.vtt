00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.350
 Everyone says "Learning to learn" so that you can enter the best universities. 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.009
 Success. But what kind of school is really important? 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:15.049
 Let's take a look at the SAT scores of a regular school. 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.420
 50% of students who successfully achieved a degree have achieved the best SAT scores. 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.869
 Only 18% of the graduates are born to those with low SAT scores. 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.019
 This is not surprising. 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.340
 Now let's look at the situation at top universities, such as Harvard University. 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.280
 At Harvard, those with low SAT scores are better than the best students in ordinary schools. 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.520
 But their graduation rates are surprisingly similar to ordinary schools. 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.710
 SAT high scores account for more than 50% of graduates. 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.420
 Low score students account for about 15%. 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.450
 What? This is the "big fish and small pond" effect. 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.880
 It's very simple, we are just comparing with people around us, not people around the world. 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.719
 Therefore, students in top schools are only compared to their peers. 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.200
 If you are a middle and lower reaches student, then you can easily feel that you are not qualified. 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.390
 Although compared to other people in the world, you are still a top student. 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.710
 Which countries do you think have the highest suicide rate? Those developed countries that claim to be happy, 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.369
 Such as Switzerland, Denmark, Canada 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.859
 Or those who claim to be unhappy, such as Italy, Greece and Spain. 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.990
 If you are very depressed and the people around you are equally unhappy, then you will feel that you are no different from others. 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.020
 But if the people around you are more happy than you, then you become more depressed. 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.409
 The same, if you are in a top school, although you are very smart, but you are ultimately unremarkable. 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.689
 The idea that "I am very poor" will largely affect your confidence and motivation. 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.770
 Need data proof? Among American science and engineering students, 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.799
 50% of students will decline in the first or second year of college. Average grade of school SAT 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.719
 For every 10 points dropped, students who earn a degree will increase by 2%. this means 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.649
 If you don't choose the first-volunteer school, the probability of getting a degree is greatly increased. 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.850
 Who is more successful in the "real world"? Someone about economists 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.500
 The publications within 6 years after graduation were studied. research shows, 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.550
 The 99th percentile top student is almost smarter than anyone else in the school. 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.920
 They are the ones who publish the most articles in five schools. 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.470
 But those 75th percentile students, although the top 1/4 of the students, basically did not publish any articles. 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.820
 They have failed. 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.060
 The same country, from the worst 30 schools, good students, published articles 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.280
 More than the top 1/4 of the students in the school. 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.360
 Obviously, the surrounding environment and peers have played a big role. 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.920
 However, the above studies did not cover all aspects of studying top universities. 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.690
 It is a glory to get a degree certificate from a top university. 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.110
 It's also easy to find a job for you, but only if you graduate. 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.290
 So when you apply for a school or when you are in a new school, you have to remember 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.710
 Regardless of whether you are in the best or the worst school, there are many factors for success. 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.320
 Believe in your abilities. Remember, good students in ordinary schools 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.800
 Can be more important than school. 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.860
