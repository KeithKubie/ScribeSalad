TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's
talk a little bit

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.590
about timeline cards.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.340
Now these can be text, images,
they can be rich HTML, and

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.920
they can be video.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.980
They can also be bundles
of items.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.850
You'll notice the fold in
the upper right-hand

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.190
corner of this item.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.480
Well that means it's a bundle.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.960
And if the user taps on it,
they'll get a sub-timeline of

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.610
sorts of multiple items.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.120
Now there's two ways that
this can happen.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.740
One, if you inserted a single
timeline item with multiple

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.670
pages, or if you inserted
multiple items with a single

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.380
bundle ID that links
all of them

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.390
together in a single thread.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.700
Now let's look at all
of that in code.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.895
A simple timeline insert
looks like this.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:47.820
I just add some text into a post
request on the timeline

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.140
collection.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.560
If I were to do an image, it
will look like this-- again, a

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.490
post request in the timeline
collection.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.740
But in this case, it's a
multi-part request with the

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.990
image data added.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.810
I can also do HTML
and bundling.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.010
Now this is the bundling for
paginated bundle, where it's a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.850
single timeline item.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.410
And you can see I'm specifying
the HTML and I'm also

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.880
specifying the HTML pages that
will show when the user taps

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.090
into the bundle.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.830
If I wanted a threaded bundle,
it'll look like this.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.710
It's a single timeline item
with a bundle ID.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.030
Now I make the same bundle ID.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.020
I add it to the payload of all
the other timeline items that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.010
I want linked together in
this single bundle.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.660
Now this is a RESTful web
service, so of course, we can

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:53.240
also do updates, deletes, and
we can get a list of all of

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.240
the timeline items we have
access to or more details

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.520
about any one particular
timeline item.
