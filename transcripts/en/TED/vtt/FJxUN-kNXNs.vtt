00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.522
It was a Thursday,

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:19.414
June the 23rd, 1994.

00:00:23.086 --> 00:00:24.245
(Sighs)

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.117
"Collect your belongings.
You are free to go.

00:00:28.808 --> 00:00:32.909
When escorted outside,
go directly to your car.

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.717
Do not talk to reporters."

00:00:36.983 --> 00:00:38.527
My head is spinning,

00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:40.030
my heart is racing,

00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:41.700
I can't get a breath.

00:00:43.108 --> 00:00:44.894
I just want out of there.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.497
When I get to my car,

00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:51.469
I throw everything on the back,

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.755
and I just collapse
into the driver's seat.

00:00:55.637 --> 00:00:57.344
"I can't do this.

00:00:57.368 --> 00:01:01.026
I can't go home to my family

00:01:02.231 --> 00:01:05.280
that I haven't seen in a week

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:08.230
and pretend to be happy."

00:01:10.764 --> 00:01:14.213
Not even their love and support

00:01:14.237 --> 00:01:16.987
could help me at this particular time.

00:01:19.592 --> 00:01:22.725
We had just sentenced a man to death.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.504
Now what?

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.255
Just go home and wash dishes?

00:01:32.772 --> 00:01:36.238
You see, in Mississippi,

00:01:37.423 --> 00:01:41.234
the death penalty is like a part
of our unspoken culture.

00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:47.448
The basic logic is, if you murder someone,

00:01:47.472 --> 00:01:50.163
then you're going to receive
the death penalty.

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:56.722
So when the jury selection
process took place,

00:01:57.623 --> 00:01:59.142
they asked me,

00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:03.481
"Could you,

00:02:03.505 --> 00:02:09.004
if the evidence presented
justified the death penalty,

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:11.362
could you deliver,

00:02:11.386 --> 00:02:13.886
rationally and without reservations,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.508
a penalty of death?"

00:02:17.545 --> 00:02:20.716
My answer was an astounding "yes,"

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:24.279
and I was selected as Juror Number 2.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.936
The trial started.

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:30.883
From the evidence being presented

00:02:32.106 --> 00:02:34.926
and from the pictures of the victim,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.909
my first response was,
"Yes, this man is a monster,

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:42.388
and he deserves the death penalty."

00:02:44.082 --> 00:02:48.726
For days, I sat and looked at his hands,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.532
the ones that yielded the knife,

00:02:53.883 --> 00:02:57.724
and against his pasty white skin,

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:00.028
his eyes ...

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.176
Well, he spent endless days in his cell,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.782
no sunlight,

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:09.693
so his eyes were as black
as his hair and his mustache.

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.393
He was very intimidating,

00:03:14.424 --> 00:03:18.783
and there was absolutely
no doubt in his guilt.

00:03:21.037 --> 00:03:22.853
But regardless of his guilt,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.636
as the days passed,

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:29.620
I began to see this monster

00:03:30.684 --> 00:03:32.550
as a human being.

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:38.325
Something inside of me was changing
that I just didn't understand.

00:03:39.106 --> 00:03:41.560
I was beginning to question myself

00:03:41.584 --> 00:03:45.879
as to whether or not I wanted
to give this man the death penalty.

00:03:47.713 --> 00:03:49.893
Jury deliberations began,

00:03:50.556 --> 00:03:54.834
and the judge gave us jury instructions

00:03:56.397 --> 00:03:59.154
and it was to be used as a tool

00:03:59.178 --> 00:04:01.897
in how to reach a verdict.

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:07.530
Well, using this tool
only led to one decision,

00:04:07.554 --> 00:04:09.433
and that was the death penalty.

00:04:10.506 --> 00:04:12.585
I felt backed into a corner.

00:04:13.176 --> 00:04:16.600
My head and my heart
were in conflict with each other,

00:04:16.624 --> 00:04:18.759
and the thought of the death penalty

00:04:18.783 --> 00:04:20.279
made me sick.

00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:28.148
However, following
the judge's instructions,

00:04:28.172 --> 00:04:30.574
being a law-abiding person,

00:04:31.972 --> 00:04:33.268
I gave up.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.678
I gave up and voted along
with the other 11 jurors.

00:04:40.608 --> 00:04:42.008
And there it was:

00:04:42.754 --> 00:04:46.948
our broken judicial system at work.

00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:52.386
So here I am in my car,

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.017
and I'm wondering:

00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:58.147
How is my life ever going to be the same?

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:04.497
My life was kids, work,
church, ball games --

00:05:04.521 --> 00:05:07.967
just your average, normal, everyday life.

00:05:08.998 --> 00:05:11.442
Now everything felt trivial.

00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:13.723
I was going down this rabbit hole.

00:05:14.978 --> 00:05:18.350
The anger, the anxiety,

00:05:18.374 --> 00:05:21.208
the guilt, the depression ...

00:05:21.232 --> 00:05:22.867
it just clung to me.

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:27.737
I knew that my life had to resume,

00:05:29.038 --> 00:05:30.680
so I sought counseling.

00:05:31.252 --> 00:05:34.539
The counselor diagnosed me with PTSD

00:05:35.217 --> 00:05:39.825
and told me that the best way
to overcome the PTSD

00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:42.370
was to talk about the trauma.

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:48.952
However, if I talked or tried
to talk about the trauma

00:05:48.976 --> 00:05:50.400
outside her office,

00:05:50.424 --> 00:05:52.261
I was shut down.

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:54.571
No one wanted to hear about it.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.545
He was just a murderer. Get over it.

00:05:59.513 --> 00:06:04.644
It was then that I decided
to become a silent survivor.

00:06:06.263 --> 00:06:09.208
Twelve years later, 2006,

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:15.029
I learned that Bobby Wilcher
had dropped all of his appeals,

00:06:15.053 --> 00:06:18.659
and his execution date was approaching.

00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:21.473
That was like a punch in the stomach.

00:06:22.143 --> 00:06:25.634
All of those buried feelings
just started coming back.

00:06:27.943 --> 00:06:32.800
To try and find peace,
I called Bobby's attorney, and I said,

00:06:32.824 --> 00:06:35.311
"Can I see Bobby before he's executed?"

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.261
Driving to the penitentiary
on the day of his execution,

00:06:41.285 --> 00:06:42.829
in my mind,

00:06:42.853 --> 00:06:45.215
Bobby was going to be manic.

00:06:45.975 --> 00:06:50.331
But, surprisingly, he was very calm.

00:06:50.967 --> 00:06:56.139
And for two hours, he and I sat there
and talked about life,

00:06:56.753 --> 00:07:03.195
and I got to ask him to forgive me
for my hand in his death.

00:07:04.212 --> 00:07:06.080
His words to me were:

00:07:06.748 --> 00:07:08.972
"You don't have to apologize.

00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:10.926
You didn't put me here.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.215
I did this myself.

00:07:14.032 --> 00:07:15.861
But if it'll make you feel better,

00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:17.464
I forgive you."

00:07:19.097 --> 00:07:20.875
On my way home,

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:24.885
I stopped by a restaurant
and bought a margarita.

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:28.596
(Laughter)

00:07:29.107 --> 00:07:31.204
I don't think I could
get one big enough --

00:07:31.228 --> 00:07:32.423
(Laughter)

00:07:32.447 --> 00:07:34.448
to try and calm down.

00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:37.286
My phone rang.

00:07:38.244 --> 00:07:39.990
It was Bobby's attorney.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.182
Within two minutes of his execution,

00:07:44.206 --> 00:07:46.300
they had given him a stay.

00:07:48.456 --> 00:07:51.631
This stay gave me time

00:07:52.377 --> 00:07:54.081
to reach out to Bobby.

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:57.460
And as crazy as it may sound,

00:07:57.484 --> 00:07:59.386
we became friends.

00:08:00.936 --> 00:08:02.920
Three months later,

00:08:02.944 --> 00:08:05.786
he was executed
by the State of Mississippi.

00:08:07.415 --> 00:08:12.004
I'm here to tell you my story,

00:08:13.163 --> 00:08:18.225
because it was precisely 22 years later

00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:21.923
that I even wanted to open up
enough to talk about it,

00:08:23.148 --> 00:08:25.176
when a friend encouraged me.

00:08:26.109 --> 00:08:30.224
"Hey, perhaps you need to talk
to the other jurors.

00:08:30.248 --> 00:08:32.624
You've been through the same experience."

00:08:33.859 --> 00:08:36.523
Uncertain of what I was after,

00:08:36.547 --> 00:08:38.355
I did need to talk to them.

00:08:39.198 --> 00:08:41.272
So I set out on my quest,

00:08:42.587 --> 00:08:44.525
and I actually found most of them.

00:08:45.117 --> 00:08:46.874
The first juror I met

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:49.757
thought that Bobby got what he deserved.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.030
Another juror --

00:08:53.339 --> 00:08:57.052
well, they just kind of regretted
that it took so long

00:08:57.076 --> 00:08:58.773
to carry the sentence out.

00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:02.115
Then one juror, and I don't know
what was wrong with him,

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:04.502
but he didn't remember
anything about the trial.

00:09:04.526 --> 00:09:06.425
(Laughter)

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:07.671
Well,

00:09:08.902 --> 00:09:10.602
I'm thinking in my mind,

00:09:10.626 --> 00:09:14.743
"Jeez, is this the response
I'm gonna get from everybody else?"

00:09:15.898 --> 00:09:19.116
Well, thank God for Allen.

00:09:19.598 --> 00:09:21.835
Allen was a gentle soul.

00:09:22.956 --> 00:09:26.659
And when I talked to him,
he was genuinely upset

00:09:26.683 --> 00:09:28.566
about our decision.

00:09:29.121 --> 00:09:33.915
And he told me about the day
that the devastation

00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:37.164
really set in on him and hit him.

00:09:37.927 --> 00:09:40.171
He was listening to the radio,

00:09:40.195 --> 00:09:45.562
and the radio had a list of names
of men to be executed

00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:47.450
at Parchman Penitentiary.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.427
He heard Bobby's name,

00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:55.077
and he then truly realized
what he had done.

00:09:55.101 --> 00:09:59.779
And he said, "You know, I had
a responsibility in that man's death."

00:10:01.325 --> 00:10:03.940
Now here it is, 20-something years later,

00:10:03.964 --> 00:10:07.432
and Allen is still dealing
with that issue.

00:10:08.134 --> 00:10:11.922
And he's never told anyone about it,
not even his wife.

00:10:14.065 --> 00:10:15.479
He also told me

00:10:15.503 --> 00:10:18.649
that if the State of Mississippi
wanted to keep the death penalty,

00:10:18.673 --> 00:10:23.780
then hey, they needed to provide
counseling for the jurors.

00:10:24.941 --> 00:10:27.910
Then the next juror I met was Jane.

00:10:27.934 --> 00:10:30.666
Jane is now totally
against the death penalty,

00:10:31.273 --> 00:10:32.639
And there was Bill.

00:10:33.394 --> 00:10:38.653
Bill said he had this
crushing depression for weeks,

00:10:38.677 --> 00:10:40.760
and when he went back to work,

00:10:40.784 --> 00:10:44.091
his colleagues would say
things to him like,

00:10:44.115 --> 00:10:45.899
"Hey, did you fry him?"

00:10:45.923 --> 00:10:47.694
To them, it was just a joke.

00:10:48.885 --> 00:10:50.677
Then there was Jon.

00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:55.080
Jon said his decision weighed on him,

00:10:55.104 --> 00:10:57.050
and it burdened him daily.

00:10:58.558 --> 00:11:01.619
The final juror that I spoke to was Ken.

00:11:01.643 --> 00:11:03.916
Ken was the foreman of the jury.

00:11:05.078 --> 00:11:06.747
When we sat down to talk,

00:11:08.485 --> 00:11:14.751
it was apparent that he was deeply
saddened by what we were required to do.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.890
He relived the day
that he left the courthouse

00:11:19.914 --> 00:11:21.744
and he drove home

00:11:21.768 --> 00:11:24.854
and he went to put his key
in his door and unlock it,

00:11:24.878 --> 00:11:28.268
and he said he literally broke down.

00:11:30.237 --> 00:11:33.389
He said he knew that Bobby was guilty,

00:11:33.413 --> 00:11:35.508
but the decision he made,

00:11:35.532 --> 00:11:39.445
he did not know
if it was the right decision.

00:11:40.098 --> 00:11:43.320
And he said that he played it
over and over in his head.

00:11:43.989 --> 00:11:45.728
Did we do the right thing?

00:11:46.777 --> 00:11:48.525
Did we do the right thing?

00:11:49.554 --> 00:11:52.576
Did we do the right thing?

00:11:55.966 --> 00:11:57.132
(Sighs)

00:11:58.395 --> 00:11:59.964
All those years,

00:12:00.738 --> 00:12:06.027
and I finally realized that I was not
the only disillusioned juror.

00:12:06.778 --> 00:12:11.610
And we talked about sharing our experience

00:12:11.634 --> 00:12:14.043
with potential jurors

00:12:15.392 --> 00:12:18.940
to give them some insight
into what to expect,

00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:23.100
and to tell them do not be complacent;

00:12:23.703 --> 00:12:26.611
to know what you believe;

00:12:26.635 --> 00:12:30.495
to know where you stand and be prepared,

00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:37.454
because you don't want
to walk in one morning as a juror

00:12:37.478 --> 00:12:41.151
and leave at the end of the trial
feeling like a murderer.

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:46.588
Now, through this storm in my life,
I did find some inspiration,

00:12:46.612 --> 00:12:49.268
and it came in the form
of my granddaughters.

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:53.029
My 14-year-old granddaughter, Maddie,

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.147
was writing an essay
on the death penalty for school,

00:12:57.171 --> 00:12:59.194
and she was asking me questions.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.196
Well, it dawned on me
that this child was being raised

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.247
in the same eye-for-an-eye culture

00:13:08.003 --> 00:13:09.568
as I was,

00:13:09.592 --> 00:13:11.070
or had been.

00:13:12.467 --> 00:13:16.094
And so I explained my experience
to her this way:

00:13:16.927 --> 00:13:20.901
that I had sentenced someone to death

00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:24.120
as I served on a jury.

00:13:24.144 --> 00:13:25.561
And I asked her,

00:13:26.479 --> 00:13:28.329
"Did that make me a murderer?"

00:13:29.602 --> 00:13:31.014
She couldn't answer.

00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:36.387
I knew then that this topic
needed to be open for discussion.

00:13:36.411 --> 00:13:37.909
And guess what happened?

00:13:38.574 --> 00:13:41.733
I got invited to speak, just recently,

00:13:42.358 --> 00:13:44.557
in an abolitionist community.

00:13:45.503 --> 00:13:48.313
While I was there, I got a T-shirt.

00:13:48.706 --> 00:13:51.387
It says, "Stop Executions."

00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:56.141
Well, when I get home, my 16-year-old
granddaughter was there, Anna,

00:13:56.746 --> 00:13:59.335
and she says, "Can I have that shirt?"

00:14:00.065 --> 00:14:01.718
Well, I looked at her dad --

00:14:02.557 --> 00:14:04.324
her dad is my son --

00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:09.184
and I knew that he is still dealing
with this death penalty issue.

00:14:09.812 --> 00:14:12.483
So I turned around
and I looked at her, and I said,

00:14:12.507 --> 00:14:14.202
"Are you gonna wear this?"

00:14:14.726 --> 00:14:18.126
So she turned and she looked
at her dad, and she said,

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.436
"Dad, I know how you feel,

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.473
but I don't believe in the death penalty."

00:14:24.337 --> 00:14:27.448
My son looked at me,

00:14:27.472 --> 00:14:30.096
shook his head, and said,

00:14:31.719 --> 00:14:33.371
"Thanks, Mom."

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:37.485
And I knew it wasn't a nice "Thanks, Mom."

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:38.659
(Laughter)

00:14:39.964 --> 00:14:44.492
So I learned that life
had taught me some lessons.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.729
It taught me, if I had
not served on that jury,

00:14:51.596 --> 00:14:55.502
that I would still be of the same mindset.

00:14:57.002 --> 00:14:59.618
It also gave me confidence

00:14:59.642 --> 00:15:03.855
to be able to see through
the eyes of my granddaughters,

00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:09.006
that this younger generation,
they're capable and they're willing

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:13.403
to tackle these difficult social issues.

00:15:14.201 --> 00:15:16.569
And because of my experience,

00:15:16.593 --> 00:15:18.091
my granddaughters,

00:15:18.859 --> 00:15:23.906
they're now more equipped
to stand on their own

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.373
and to think for themselves

00:15:26.397 --> 00:15:31.097
than to rely on cultural beliefs.

00:15:32.134 --> 00:15:33.344
So:

00:15:34.115 --> 00:15:37.658
being from a conservative,
Christian family

00:15:38.452 --> 00:15:42.835
from a very conservative state
in the United States,

00:15:44.415 --> 00:15:45.898
I am here to tell you

00:15:45.922 --> 00:15:51.168
that the death penalty has new opponents.

00:15:51.542 --> 00:15:52.716
Thank you.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.129
(Applause)
