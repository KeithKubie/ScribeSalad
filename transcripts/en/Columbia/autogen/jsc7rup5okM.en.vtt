00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:21.999
risk-takers you're all risk-takers and I
think you're taking a risk at a

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:22.009
think you're taking a risk at a

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550
healthcare rep healthcare effort what
 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.640
healthcare rep healthcare effort what
I'd like to do today is to give you what

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650
I'd like to do today is to give you what
 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.010
I'd like to do today is to give you what
I personally this is biased but I

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020
I personally this is biased but I
 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.780
I personally this is biased but I
personally think is a glimpse into the

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790
personally think is a glimpse into the
 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.819
personally think is a glimpse into the
future and and what I think is is going

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829
future and and what I think is is going
 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.619
future and and what I think is is going
to represent at least the functional

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629
to represent at least the functional
 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.950
to represent at least the functional
outcome for a huge amount of our health

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960
outcome for a huge amount of our health
 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.810
outcome for a huge amount of our health
care provision in health care payment

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820
care provision in health care payment
 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.500
care provision in health care payment
over the next X 5 to 10 years how that

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510
over the next X 5 to 10 years how that
 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.389
over the next X 5 to 10 years how that
happens is not necessarily going to be

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399
happens is not necessarily going to be
 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.569
happens is not necessarily going to be
templated like like we've templated at

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579
templated like like we've templated at
 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.729
templated like like we've templated at
geisinger but i think that the

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739
geisinger but i think that the
 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.590
geisinger but i think that the
functional outcome is is what you have

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600
functional outcome is is what you have
 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.759
functional outcome is is what you have
to look at we have a particular we have

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769
to look at we have a particular we have
 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.150
to look at we have a particular we have
a particular organizational advantage

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160
a particular organizational advantage
 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.520
a particular organizational advantage
and fiduciary advantage in that we have

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530
and fiduciary advantage in that we have
 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.980
and fiduciary advantage in that we have
both payer and provider essentially

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990
both payer and provider essentially
 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.950
both payer and provider essentially
working for the same directors and that

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960
working for the same directors and that
 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.569
working for the same directors and that
allows us to create a sweet spot where

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579
allows us to create a sweet spot where
 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.640
allows us to create a sweet spot where
both on the insurance side and on the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650
both on the insurance side and on the
 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.859
both on the insurance side and on the
provider side we can ask questions about

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869
provider side we can ask questions about
 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.649
provider side we can ask questions about
improving care for various cohorts that

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659
improving care for various cohorts that
 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.719
improving care for various cohorts that
we're responsible for whether they're

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729
we're responsible for whether they're
 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.789
we're responsible for whether they're
hospital-based caregiving cohorts or

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799
hospital-based caregiving cohorts or
 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.330
hospital-based caregiving cohorts or
whether it's ambulatory care and then

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340
whether it's ambulatory care and then
 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.270
whether it's ambulatory care and then
the question is if if there's a way of

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280
the question is if if there's a way of
 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.310
the question is if if there's a way of
reengineering that care and getting to a

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320
reengineering that care and getting to a
 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.959
reengineering that care and getting to a
more optimal short-term and long-term

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969
more optimal short-term and long-term
 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.980
more optimal short-term and long-term
outcome is there also a cost advantage

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990
outcome is there also a cost advantage
 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.870
outcome is there also a cost advantage
so that's what these three balls mean

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880
so that's what these three balls mean
 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.020
so that's what these three balls mean
basically now we're not as we're not as

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030
basically now we're not as we're not as
 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.749
basically now we're not as we're not as
closed as Kaiser we're heterogeneous so

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759
closed as Kaiser we're heterogeneous so
 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.560
closed as Kaiser we're heterogeneous so
we reach out to 25,000 non non employed

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570
we reach out to 25,000 non non employed
 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.399
we reach out to 25,000 non non employed
non guising our providers we reach out

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409
non guising our providers we reach out
 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.279
non guising our providers we reach out
to 12 hospitals that are not part of the

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289
to 12 hospitals that are not part of the
 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.920
to 12 hospitals that are not part of the
geisinger system so if we do something

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930
geisinger system so if we do something
 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.069
geisinger system so if we do something
that's very innovative in that core we

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079
that's very innovative in that core we
 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.050
that's very innovative in that core we
can then ask questions about whether it

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060
can then ask questions about whether it
 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.900
can then ask questions about whether it
can be taken out to the much more usual

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910
can be taken out to the much more usual
 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.670
can be taken out to the much more usual
kind of market where there's not a

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680
kind of market where there's not a
 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.740
kind of market where there's not a
direct connection to the total cash

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750
direct connection to the total cash
 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.240
direct connection to the total cash
compensation

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250
compensation
 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.220
compensation
and the payment incentives for the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230
and the payment incentives for the
 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.230
and the payment incentives for the
providers so it's a very interesting

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240
providers so it's a very interesting
 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.800
providers so it's a very interesting
model we're designed we're in the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810
model we're designed we're in the
 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.040
model we're designed we're in the
boonies basically I'm not sure I'm not

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050
boonies basically I'm not sure I'm not
 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.710
boonies basically I'm not sure I'm not
sure you could do this in the city and

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720
sure you could do this in the city and
 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.870
sure you could do this in the city and
it gives us a huge advantage we're we're

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880
it gives us a huge advantage we're we're
 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.620
it gives us a huge advantage we're we're
in in in in post-industrial and rural

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630
in in in in post-industrial and rural
 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.680
in in in in post-industrial and rural
Pennsylvania and we've basically through

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690
Pennsylvania and we've basically through
 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.050
Pennsylvania and we've basically through
a consolidation process in the market

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060
a consolidation process in the market
 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.640
a consolidation process in the market
both on the insurance and the provider

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650
both on the insurance and the provider
 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.670
both on the insurance and the provider
side got great market share on both ends

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680
side got great market share on both ends
 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.340
side got great market share on both ends
of the of the spectrum and we've

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350
of the of the spectrum and we've
 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.050
of the of the spectrum and we've
designed our program as a hub-and-spoke

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060
designed our program as a hub-and-spoke
 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.260
designed our program as a hub-and-spoke
so in order to take care of patients

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270
so in order to take care of patients
 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.140
so in order to take care of patients
close to where they live we will admit

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150
close to where they live we will admit
 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.750
close to where they live we will admit
them to actually non guising our

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760
them to actually non guising our
 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.690
them to actually non guising our
hospitals unless they need to come to

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700
hospitals unless they need to come to
 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.820
hospitals unless they need to come to
one of the hub hospitals for specialty

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830
one of the hub hospitals for specialty
 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.280
one of the hub hospitals for specialty
subspecialty care and obviously the hub

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290
subspecialty care and obviously the hub
 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.860
subspecialty care and obviously the hub
hospitals are very expensive and those

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870
hospitals are very expensive and those
 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.100
hospitals are very expensive and those
hospitals that are not dealing only in

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110
hospitals that are not dealing only in
 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.170
hospitals that are not dealing only in
that high intervention high severity

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180
that high intervention high severity
 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.150
that high intervention high severity
care are less expensive and less anxiety

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160
care are less expensive and less anxiety
 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.360
care are less expensive and less anxiety
prone so it's it's a concept of trying

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370
prone so it's it's a concept of trying
 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.759
prone so it's it's a concept of trying
to be centrifugal and cared getting

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769
to be centrifugal and cared getting
 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.229
to be centrifugal and cared getting
patients care for close to where they

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239
patients care for close to where they
 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.330
patients care for close to where they
live rather than sucking them in to a

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340
live rather than sucking them in to a
 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.080
live rather than sucking them in to a
very high anxiety high expense hub

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090
very high anxiety high expense hub
 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.729
very high anxiety high expense hub
unless we have to the entire system

covers about 70 sites a tremendous

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830
covers about 70 sites a tremendous

these so the question really was what

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:00.530
these so the question really was what
 

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:05.770
these so the question really was what

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.680
patients were taken care of in this way
there was a significant decrease in the

even done the economics on this but you

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440
even done the economics on this but you
 

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.770
even done the economics on this but you
can bet that when we do the economics on

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:41.780
can bet that when we do the economics on
 

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.450
can bet that when we do the economics on
this you'll see that the cost has also

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:43.460
this you'll see that the cost has also
 

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.420
this you'll see that the cost has also
gone down dramatically for that 25,000

cross that barrier and so one of the
 

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:14.800
cross that barrier and so one of the
things that we did is we took the

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:14.810
things that we did is we took the
 

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:18.220
things that we did is we took the

so that nurse was the general manager of
 

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:00.490
so that nurse was the general manager of
the patient and the question was would

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:00.500
the patient and the question was would
 

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.550
the patient and the question was would
we successfully benefit those patients

we successfully benefit those patients
 

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.070
we successfully benefit those patients
with four or five chronic diseases would

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080
with four or five chronic diseases would

with four or five chronic diseases would
it have an effect on total cost of care

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:08.150
it have an effect on total cost of care
 

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:11.410
it have an effect on total cost of care
now if you get that twofer it's terrific

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:11.420
now if you get that twofer it's terrific
 

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.020
now if you get that twofer it's terrific
for the patient the insurance company

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.030
for the patient the insurance company
 

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.880
for the patient the insurance company
gets a wonderful financial benefit

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:15.890
gets a wonderful financial benefit
 

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.040
gets a wonderful financial benefit
because total cost of care goes down and

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:18.050
because total cost of care goes down and
 

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:20.350
because total cost of care goes down and
because it's all in the same structure

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360
because it's all in the same structure
 

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.350
because it's all in the same structure
in the same fiduciary in our system we

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360
in the same fiduciary in our system we

in the same fiduciary in our system we
can do the internal transfer pricing

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:25.250
can do the internal transfer pricing
 

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.730
can do the internal transfer pricing
getting some of that profit that would

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:27.740
getting some of that profit that would
 

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.380
getting some of that profit that would
go to the insurance company back to the

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:29.390
go to the insurance company back to the

go to the insurance company back to the
people who actually produce the change

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:31.550
people who actually produce the change
 

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:35.830
people who actually produce the change
and what we found and this has now been

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840
and what we found and this has now been
 

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.350
and what we found and this has now been
sustainable and it's spread way beyond

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360
sustainable and it's spread way beyond

those sickest patients we found that
 

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.450
those sickest patients we found that
there is about in general about a twenty

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:43.460
there is about in general about a twenty

percent decrease in admissions per
thousand which is significant we also

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:48.710
thousand which is significant we also
 

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.640
thousand which is significant we also
found that compared to the expectations

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:51.650
found that compared to the expectations
 

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:55.060
found that compared to the expectations
for our cost curve we were looking at at

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:55.070
for our cost curve we were looking at at
 

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:59.350
for our cost curve we were looking at at
about about seven percent decrease per

00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360
about about seven percent decrease per
 

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.040
about about seven percent decrease per
year seven seven percent decrease per

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:03.050
year seven seven percent decrease per
 

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.920
year seven seven percent decrease per
year below our cost curve where we are

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:05.930
year below our cost curve where we are
 

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.860
year below our cost curve where we are
now below steady state

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:08.870
now below steady state
 

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.900
now below steady state
now if you recall during the ACA

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:10.910
now if you recall during the ACA
 

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.240
now if you recall during the ACA
political run up the questions were

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:13.250
political run up the questions were
 

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.930
political run up the questions were
whether we could get one percent out of

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:16.940
whether we could get one percent out of
 

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.960
whether we could get one percent out of
our cost escalation over ten years and

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:19.970
our cost escalation over ten years and
 

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:24.120
our cost escalation over ten years and
this is this is seven percent per year

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:24.130
this is this is seven percent per year
 

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:27.630
this is this is seven percent per year
so I I don't think we're anywhere near

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:27.640
so I I don't think we're anywhere near
 

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.450
so I I don't think we're anywhere near
what we could do if any of this is

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:31.460
what we could do if any of this is
 

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.549
what we could do if any of this is
generalizable so here here are the

00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:33.559
generalizable so here here are the
 

00:24:33.559 --> 00:24:38.160
generalizable so here here are the
caveats most of the immediate effect in

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:38.170
caveats most of the immediate effect in
 

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.810
caveats most of the immediate effect in
benefiting patients and decreasing costs

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:40.820
benefiting patients and decreasing costs
 

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.320
benefiting patients and decreasing costs
is is taken out of the hospital so if

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:44.330
is is taken out of the hospital so if
 

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.810
is is taken out of the hospital so if
you are a hospital centric organization

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:46.820
you are a hospital centric organization
 

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.330
you are a hospital centric organization
you better have a business model to make

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:49.340
you better have a business model to make
 

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.520
you better have a business model to make
up for the fact that you will have an

up for the fact that you will have an
 

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.640
up for the fact that you will have an
effect on your volume your volume will

effect on your volume your volume will
 

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:56.169
effect on your volume your volume will
go down so you're either going to have

00:24:56.169 --> 00:24:56.179
go down so you're either going to have
 

00:24:56.179 --> 00:24:58.600
go down so you're either going to have
to build market share by stealing from

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:58.610
to build market share by stealing from
 

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.540
to build market share by stealing from
others or you're going to have to have a

others or you're going to have to have a
 

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:03.160

timeliness of the data the data has to

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360
terms of Medicare Advantage and that's
 

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.540

probably a little bit to detail to get

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:09.550
probably a little bit to detail to get
 

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.340
probably a little bit to detail to get
into now but i think that the

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:11.350
into now but i think that the
 

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:14.100
into now but i think that the
fundamentals of the cost trajectory and

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:14.110
fundamentals of the cost trajectory and
 

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:17.130
fundamentals of the cost trajectory and
the fundamentals of the of the need to

the fundamentals of the of the need to
 

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.200
the fundamentals of the of the need to
create value here are apparent to

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:19.210

in the intermediate term by the election
 

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:26.760
in the intermediate term by the election
and i think the bottom line is we're

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:26.770
and i think the bottom line is we're
 

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:28.200
and i think the bottom line is we're
going to have much more increasing

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:28.210
going to have much more increasing
 

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:31.140
going to have much more increasing

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:33.390
demand over the next few years we're
going to be monitoring kind of the

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:33.400
going to be monitoring kind of the
 

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.450
going to be monitoring kind of the

schizophrenic standoff between the
 

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.120
schizophrenic standoff between the
fee-for-service incentives and something

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:39.130
fee-for-service incentives and something

quasi capitation who knows i think i

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:47.050
quasi capitation who knows i think i
 

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:49.050

think the real bottom line here is to

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:49.060
think the real bottom line here is to
 

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.180
think the real bottom line here is to
increase value by reengineering the care

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:51.190
increase value by reengineering the care
 

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:52.350
increase value by reengineering the care
and then figuring out how to

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:52.360
and then figuring out how to
 

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.110
and then figuring out how to
redistribute that and i think we'll

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120
redistribute that and i think we'll
 

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.810
redistribute that and i think we'll
probably have either quasi capitation or

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:57.820
probably have either quasi capitation or
 

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.470
probably have either quasi capitation or

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.240
fee-for-service working harder to
produce more more services and having

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:22.230
produce more more services and having
those fees go down that's a bad thing so

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240
those fees go down that's a bad thing so
 

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.260
those fees go down that's a bad thing so
