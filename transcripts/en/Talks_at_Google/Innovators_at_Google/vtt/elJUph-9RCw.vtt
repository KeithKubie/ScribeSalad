00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.430
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon. I'm really pleased to introduce
Kaj Ahlmann. Kaj is a big supporter of Six

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:19.970
Sigma Process and he was implementing Six
Sigma in General Electric for many years.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:29.119
And he decided to use his experience in the
wine business, and in 1999, he purchased a

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.449
piece of land and started growing wine and
making perfect wine using Six Sigma principles

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:42.649
which always was a mystery for me. So, Kaj
is here to talk to us about how he does it

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.569
and any interesting details about that. Please
welcome Kaj Ahlmann.

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:59.999
&gt;&gt; AHLMANN: Thank you very much, Dennis, and
thank you very much for those of you who came

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:03.649
here. There will be two sections, we will
talk a little bit about Six Sigma and how

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.710
we use it in the wine business and then we
will taste the product so you can see that

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.120
it actually works. But first a question, how
many of you know anything about Six Sigma?

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:25.869
Any black belts, any green belts, any master
black belts? I just want to know how much

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.909
you know about it and get a feel for the audience.
The next thing...

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.630
&gt;&gt; AHLMANN: Okay. Great. The next important
question is how many of you know how to make

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.210
wine? Oh, that's more serious, huh? Really?
Something about it?

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.929
&gt;&gt; We also harvest.
&gt;&gt; AHLMANN: Wow. That's a real practitioner.

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.840
Well, let's get on with--what I plan to do
is to talk a little a bit about how we created

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.880
the company, then talk a little bit about
the product we have, then gradually take you

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.570
through the process of making wine and then,
finally, show you a little bit about how we

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:18.030
put the Six Sigma Processes around it. The
company was created in '99. We bought 4,300

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.830
acres in the northern part of California,
up north of Napa Valley. It was an old cattle

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.770
ranch and we decided to start to develop some
vineyards, not all of it because we were shooting

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:41.330
for high class wines so, and not mass production.
And by now, we have received a lot of good

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.331
press. We have received some good ratings.
There's a professional magazine for Six Sigma

00:02:46.331 --> 00:02:51.900
folks called iSixSigma, it goes to all what
they call belts in corporate America and we've

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.959
been featured there a couple of times. The
last month, there was a big article about

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.530
how we used some of the principles and they
come out and visit us and use us as a test

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.349
case. We are a pretty interesting test case
for Six Sigma, not that we are perfect Six

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.129
Sigma at this stage, but we have structured
the company as a Six Sigma company. Most other

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.360
companies are companies that have been around
for a number of years, and when they get into

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.770
Six Sigma, they have to start to break things
up in the old tradition of the company; they

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.959
can't build it from scratch, so we've been
lucky that way. It has been a little easier

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.700
for us. I'll talk a little more about that
when we get to that. But our vision for the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.920
company is to create exceptional wine, but
we don't see it just as wine; we see wine

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.930
as an experience. It's not just about having
a glass of wine, it's maybe coming to the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.290
ranch, sitting in a nice spot and having a
nice meal or whatever it is, whatever your

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.019
experience is. But we are selling an--of course,
we have to make a good wine, but we think

00:03:53.019 --> 00:04:01.020
we are selling an experience, not just another
bottle of wine. We offer education. We have

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.109
put a conservation easement on the ranch.
We protect the land so it will stay as a natural,

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:12.549
national park basically. And we also spend
a lot of time on improving the land and offering

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.371
education, environmental education to kids
in the area because we think it's very important

00:04:17.371 --> 00:04:22.910
that kids grow up as good stewards of the
land going forward. There's so much going

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.750
on in the world today so, if you can chip
in and do a little education for the children;

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.530
that would work really well. The strategy
is to consistently produce high quality wine,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.640
and that is, right out of the core of Six
Sigma because you all know the lock, the normal

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.840
curve and the standard deviation and the last
thing you want when you produce something

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.160
of quality is to have too much standard deviation
in there. And, when you add the six-level

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.310
with the standard deviation, well, you have
very little deviation from where you want

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.780
to be, so that is one of the core things that
we look at. But let me talk a little bit about

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:08.150
what I find is very important in the Six Sigma
world. The two keywords up there, the first

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.510
one is focus on your customer and the other
one is to think process. If you think about

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.890
most traditional corporations in the world
or in North America, they are structured the

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.250
old fashion way with departments or silos
and they have a hierarchy, and they produce

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.350
something, and then they spent millions of
dollars in promoting that to the marketplace.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:37.900
When you are in the Six Sigma world, you try
to understand what your customer wants, and

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.370
then you design your company internally with
processes that are geared to meet what is

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.890
critical for that customer. We failed it big
time, and let me just get forward to the next

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:56.360
slide. When we move from the manufacturing
side at General Electric to financial services,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.470
half of General Electric is financial services
and while it's easy to measure a defect or

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.800
something that is not right in manufacturing,
I mean, we, here we are truly a company that

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.990
are making sticks and the sticks have to be
two feet long, and if they're not two feet

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.140
long but deviate from that you have a defect,
everybody can understand that. But what is

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:21.310
a defect in a financial service company, a
bank, an insurance company? And we went out

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.240
and we started to focus on the customer, we
interviewed the customer; it doesn't sound

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.610
like a novel idea but trust me, for many financial
institutions it is. They produce something

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.600
and then they try to force people to buy it.
So, we talked, for example, to automobile

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.020
customers. Automobile customers will tell
you, listen, guys, basically, we don't want

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.400
to talk to you, guys, because we don't like
insurance, we don't like insurance companies.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:49.100
But there's one moment of tension where we
have to talk to insurance companies and that's

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:55.250
when we have a claim. And what is critical
for us when we have a claim, two very basic

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.110
things and now I'll exaggerate a little bit,
but the first one is that when they call you

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.020
with this claim to report it, you pick up
the phone because we are frustrated. We want

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.520
to talk to somebody who knows how to handle
a claim. The second thing that is critical

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.650
to quality for the customer in that process
is that we pay them pretty fast. If you have

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:18.180
a claim of $3,000, you don't want to negotiate
with the legal department for six months about

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.940
whether it's 2,800 or 3,200, you just want
a check within 48 hours and get it over and

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.810
done with, get on with your life and forget
that you even have an insurance company. So

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:34.690
those are--that's the voice of the customer
in this process here. When it comes to the

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:41.410
grape business, we, we'll get back to the
sorting of grapes and a number of other things.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.520
But we started to introduce that in the business
and I'll talk to you about the voice of the

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.430
customer because it's a lot more difficult.
I could go around here and ask each and every

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:56.920
one of you what is important for you as a
wine customer and I'll probably get 14 different

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:02.970
answers, I guess, because you have different
views on what's important. Let me just get

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:09.490
back because I skipped one little step here.
The message at the bottom here, DMAIC: define,

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:14.371
measure, analyze, improve and control, that's
another corner stone of the Six Sigma process.

00:08:14.371 --> 00:08:21.110
Whenever you do something, you go back and
then you try to analyze what you really did

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:26.120
and then you improve it again until you get
to the right level. It's common sense, but

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:32.240
what really make Six Sigma work is that you
get data around the different steps in the

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:40.310
process so you can measure whether you made
the improvements you were talking about. Let's

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:44.229
talk a little bit about the product and let's
talk about what I mentioned to you, the voice

00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:50.829
of the customer. There are a lot of different
criteria; some people will tell you it's price.

00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:56.529
I have an old friend, he's retired now. He
loves wine, he drinks wine every day and I

00:08:56.529 --> 00:09:00.750
said to him, "Mike, what's important for you
when you buy a bottle of wine?" He says, "Well,

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.769
if it's just me and my wife, I will not pay
more than $15 for a bottle of wine, so that's

00:09:05.769 --> 00:09:14.300
my quality criteria for wine. If we have visitors
over dinner, I would go up to $25 and I buy

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.689
a recognized brand." And I said, "Why do you
that?" "Well, I don't want to be criticized.

00:09:18.689 --> 00:09:23.029
I want to feel safe." And that's an interesting
thing about the wine because some people are

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:28.399
uncomfortable with the wine, they don't feel
that they know enough unless you make it yourself,

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:34.769
of course, to branch out and try something
so they will play safe, and that's a very

00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:40.569
good criteria. I would say however that I
would drink the $25 bottle with my wife and

00:09:40.569 --> 00:09:45.240
give the $15 bottle to my friends, but that
would be my criteria. The other criteria is

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:52.360
here, people say wine is an experience, sit
with a good bottle of Cabernet in front of

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:58.269
the fireplace on a cold evening. Or, sit under
a tree somewhere, the wine tastes a lot better

00:09:58.269 --> 00:10:01.839
if you have a good friend, so there are a
lot of different things. We have talked about

00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:09.800
the price, we've talked about the taste, it's
a tough one because that's up to you. The

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:16.470
only thing we can try to do is to make wine
without any flaws in it from a technical point

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.600
of view, and then we can try to cover a wide
spectrum, so we have something for different

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:30.290
segments of wine drinkers. Then we also use
a lot of research; the Wine Market Council

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:36.899
does research in restaurants with sommelliers,
with the consumers, use all the normal interview

00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:42.629
companies like Nielsn Studies and stuff like
that. We use taste evaluation programs and

00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:46.829
we do a lot of reviews for our wine clubs
because they are close to us and they are

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:53.980
normally willing to talk about the wines.
Today, we have seven different wines on the

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:59.130
market and we can do elaborate tasting notes,
but what we've done here is, basically, we

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:04.890
started with a couple of the whites then over
the light Rose' to a Pinot Noir down to a

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:09.990
Bordeaux-style, we call it Cuvée Pique-Nique
and the Cabernet, and then the heavier guys

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:16.879
at the bottom,the Cabernet Sauvignon and the
Tempranillo. And the releases we have, three

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:23.529
wines in '06, '07, we had five and in '08,
we had them all seven on the market place.

00:11:23.529 --> 00:11:29.670
But, you can see there are different flavors,
different styles. These two guys, they have

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:35.389
spent two years in oak, the French oak barrels.
This one has literally no oak because the

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:41.199
people prefer without that, the two whites
is one with oak and one without. And we have

00:11:41.199 --> 00:11:47.449
people coming in stating their criteria for
what they want to try and taste, so that's

00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:51.690
our way of getting closer to the voice of
the customer. I'll only admit that it's the

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:57.319
toughest thing, we work on it every day and
we get more and more analysis from the customers.

00:11:57.319 --> 00:12:02.910
Let's talk a little bit about the market place
of wine and where our focus is in that, before

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:11.930
we get into the actual wine making process.
And today, Italy is still the biggest wine

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:18.600
consumer in the world with 16% of all wine
consumed; United States is catching up fast.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:27.560
The last year was for reasons that we all
know a little downturn, but strangely enough,

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:34.589
the forecast was an increase every year over
the next couple of years of 8%. So far, we

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:43.970
are 4.7 this year despite the downturn, so
it's still moving. And what is happening in

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:49.730
the U.S. is that the consumers are getting
a more normal attitude to wine like they have

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:54.050
in the Mediterranean part of the world where
you have a glass of wine with your dinner.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:58.309
It's not some, the wine is not something you
drink on special occasions, when you drink

00:12:58.309 --> 00:13:02.220
maybe a lot of it and then you don't drink
it for a long period of time. It becomes more

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:11.420
part of the day to day culture for a lot of
people. We are very focused on our segmentation

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:17.259
because of our name Six Sigma, we really focus
on corporate America and get it into companies

00:13:17.259 --> 00:13:23.180
where they use Six Sigma, the Six Sigma Academy
which is the biggest training institution

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:31.209
in the world for Six Sigma people is working
with us. I'm on the advisory board and I help

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:36.199
them in various segments of the business,
so that's a strong hitch for us, and it's

00:13:36.199 --> 00:13:43.129
a little different from what other wineries
do. Some people sometimes say that by using

00:13:43.129 --> 00:13:48.309
Six Sigma are we trying to take the romance
out of the business. Actually, I think that

00:13:48.309 --> 00:13:53.809
making wine lends itself to Six Sigma because
a lot of things that you can measure in the

00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:59.800
process. The other area is the direct to consumers,
where we focus on people who, of course, enjoy

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.189
wine and who are willing to pay a reasonable
price for a good bottle of wine, and who likes

00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:09.209
the lifestyle that comes with drinking good
wine and who love to come in and spend time

00:14:09.209 --> 00:14:14.320
with us on the land. About the market, you
have two lines here and this is, I think a

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.869
very interesting chart. The pink line shows
the production, or if you like the capacity

00:14:19.869 --> 00:14:28.720
of the vineyards planted in California. The
blue line shows the consumption, and what

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:34.499
you see here is that when--there has been
an over production and the pink line crosses

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:39.309
the blue line, all the growers of grapes get
scared, so they pull back and stop planting

00:14:39.309 --> 00:14:45.329
vineyard, and then that will be a deficit
of wine a couple of years later. It's normally

00:14:45.329 --> 00:14:50.269
about a three years cycle, because when you
plant a vineyard it takes three years before

00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:54.550
you get any fruit off it and during the first
year you only get one third of the fruit.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:59.180
Give or take, the next year two thirds of
the fruit, and the, in the sixth, seventh

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.689
year you'll have full production. But you
can see how it moves up and down, and it takes

00:15:03.689 --> 00:15:11.019
three years for the vineyard to catch up.
Right now, the vineyards are behind backed

00:15:11.019 --> 00:15:19.589
by the last peak that you see there in 2006,
growers became very careful with planting,

00:15:19.589 --> 00:15:26.490
and some wineries are not producing this year
because of the prices. So, the production,

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:35.410
or the inventory of wine will be behind in
the next two to three years. There'll be quite

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.589
a bit of scarcity, and I'm not saying that
they're trying to sell wines because I'm so

00:15:39.589 --> 00:15:49.819
small that I can't feel the gap anyway. The
process of making wine. Let's do a pictorial

00:15:49.819 --> 00:15:58.100
first, the best soil for red grapes are red
volcanic soils as you find them up in Northern

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.879
California where you have at least three volcanoes.
You have Mount Saint Helena, you have Mount

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:07.809
Konocti and you have Cap Mountain in our area.
The problem with the red soils is that they

00:16:07.809 --> 00:16:13.809
have a lot of rocks, so sometimes it's not
enough to just to rip the soil. We rip the

00:16:13.809 --> 00:16:19.709
soils with big Caterpillar Dozers five feet
down so we could stake it and put in our irrigation,

00:16:19.709 --> 00:16:24.310
but sometimes we have to bring in the big
hammer to get the rocks out. We pull out the

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:31.279
rocks the size of a car sometimes, but that
is soil that really drains well. The fertility

00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:39.720
is not too high and it works really well for
the red grapes. Then you stake your vineyard,

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.910
you plant it and then you take good care of
it for three years, starts to look like that,

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.170
and then finally you get to your first harvest
and you are very happy because maybe one day

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:54.300
you'll get some return for all of your hard
work, but that was the first truck of Timpanio

00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:03.119
grape that we took off that vineyard in 2005.
Then you get to the winery, and one of the

00:17:03.119 --> 00:17:08.000
things we get back to when we talk about the
production of wine is the consistency. So,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.250
we spend a lot of time making sure that we
have very consistent fruit. If you go out

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:17.610
into the vineyard you will see all kinds of
clusters hanging there. Maybe some sunburn,

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:23.740
maybe some bird damage, maybe some overripening,
maybe some underripening, but once your grapes

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:28.339
are getting off the final sorting table here
and hit the crusher that breaks the skin open

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:33.010
before fermentation, you want to make sure
that you have complete consistency in what

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:40.510
you use as a base. Then, after you've crushed
the grapes, you pump them over into these

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:45.860
tanks here, the fermentation tanks; they are
stainless steel so you can keep it absolutely

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:53.070
clean. And they also have what you call a
jacket, you can barely see these little boxes

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:58.620
here, but we can go in and punch in the temperature
to make sure that it's constant during fermentation,

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:04.760
and we can also control that remotely now.
So, anywhere in the world you can go in on

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:11.420
a laptop and check and adjust and do whatever
you have to do to the wine. With the red wines,

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.830
the high-end wines, we store them in French
oak barrels and we do that for two years,

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:22.180
we have a little cave on the ranch where we
do that. We, of course, take care of it during

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:27.790
that process, taste it, analyze it, make sure
that everything is going right, and then finally

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:35.890
we bottle it. So, now you can make wine at
least at the high level. Let's try to put

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:41.800
a few Six Sigma processes around this, because
the main processes, and I said to you, we

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:47.500
have organized the company along Six Sigma
processes and basically the three processes.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.390
The grape growing, the farming or whatever
you want to call it, the first section of

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:56.870
it. The second one is the actual wine making
after you get the fruit to the winery. And

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:03.400
the last process is the wine selling, the
marketing, the public relationships and whatever

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:11.500
it goes with that. And we have three process
owners at the winery, one for each of these

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:17.910
major steps here. Let's try to break it down
even further. If we look at the first step,

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:24.410
the farming side, the first thing you do is
to do your research. You go out and you monitor

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:35.170
the climate for at least a year, you do all
the soil reports, and you dig down and check

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:47.270
both the chemical and the physical aspects
of it. You check the elevation; you look at

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:54.020
the aspect which way it's faced. Is it facing
northeast or southwest, and you also start

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:59.040
to talk how you want to direct your rows.
We use some NASA computer models for that

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:04.370
because we want the same sun exposure on both
sides, again back to consistency of the fruit.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:09.250
So, once you do all that, you'll check the
water and temperature and stuff like that.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:15.190
One important thing about temperature is the
month of April because that's the month when

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:20.740
you get the bock [ph] break and if you get
frost in--during bock [ph] break, you can

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:25.860
lose most of your crop. There were a couple
of big vineyards in Napa Valley lost 80% of

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:32.311
all their crops last year which of course
is a disaster. Then you go in a new stock

00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:38.670
to prepare your vineyard, you select the kind
of clones you want and given the soil composition,

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:46.110
you can adjust the growth by selecting different
root stocks. Every vine is crusted on a root

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:52.060
stock and that happened originally because
there were some serious attacks on, on vineyards

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:58.570
with various diseases like phylloxera. So,
people started to find root stocks that were

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:03.140
resistant to that, and with that also came
different kinds of root stocks that had different

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:09.430
capabilities when it came to taking out of
the soil when they had to take out, so we

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:15.180
use that a lot. And let me drill down even
further and give you a couple of examples,

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:24.650
here's a more detailed breakdown of the processes
and [INDISTINCT] research where we'll do the

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:30.890
temperature of the soil and all that good
stuff and that goes into a SIPOC process in

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:37.621
the Six Sigma language supplier input process,
output customer, and that's where the process

00:21:37.621 --> 00:21:44.740
is taking. Every process has a supplier and
you have some output that goes to the next

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:53.340
customer in the chain which is the next process
step until it finally reaches the ultimate

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:58.200
customer, and that's why it's so important
to think process when you think Six Sigma

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.470
because you have to have all your process
steps aligned, so one feeds into the next

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:08.250
one and you measure that you're offering the
right level all the way through. A lot of

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.160
big companies stepping away form the wine
business for example, have discovered that

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.400
once they start to do that, they have a lot
of processes that they don't need, they just

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:24.240
used to do them. Some big banks did analysis
of their processes and it came out that they--40%

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:29.930
of what they did was basically redundant,
they had, it had just evolved over time and

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:35.330
it was not really used, so by cleaning it
up and streamlining the process, they saved

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:43.090
an awful lot of money. So, one of the steps
is the soil analysis, and we try to dig down

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:49.320
and get a physical profile of the dirt and
we avid out in different kinds of, of dirt

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:58.100
here at different layers. We stopped here
at this case, at 40 inches and we stopped

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.170
there because it was base rock, we couldn't
get down any further. We also stopped if we

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:08.150
know that two feet further down is going to
be exactly the same. And then we do a chemical

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:15.140
test ad then we decide how we can mediate,
if for example, the pH is too high or it needs

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:20.920
magnesium or whatever the thing is, we will
adjust for that. Or, we will decide that this

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.000
is not a site that can be used at all. There's
just too much to do. It's too far away from

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.820
where we, we normally would be. One chemical
that is critical is boron and we have sites

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:37.490
on the ranch where we just have too much boron
to even think about mediating. But in every

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:43.350
step, we get the data around the process and
then we decide whether we can get to the consistency

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:49.910
that we want in our production or whether
we want to do something else. And then we

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:56.400
have the usual dashboards where we, that's
the Six Sigma thing, you have dashboards for

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.630
everything so you could make sure you see
whether you arrive on or whether you are out

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:07.590
on the sides and of course we have numbers
around this as well. When it comes to the

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:13.250
wine making, I talk a little bit about the
sorting of the grapes which is very important,

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:19.000
and the way we do it is to send our workers
into the vineyard several times per year.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.720
June, July we cut off the fruit where we can
see at that point in time that it's not going

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:31.810
to make it, the first harvest will normally
be at the end of August but it can stretch

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:38.710
into late fall. The night before harvest when
we feel that the fruit is ready and we have

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:43.810
done all the chemical analysis, we have done
the tasting in the vineyard, we will go in

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:48.290
and cut off fruit that doesn't look good and
then go bring it into the winery in small

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:54.550
bins; these are 40 pound bins to protect the
fruit so it doesn't get squeezed. And we will

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:59.500
put the clusters on a sorting table, pull
out leaves the stuff that doesn't look nice.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:06.220
The next sorting table is more of a--after
the de-stemming is a shaking table so if there's

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:12.930
small unripe berries still around they will
shake out to a grid that fits that particular

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:17.870
grape type and then they'll go to a long sorting
table which hopefully I have a picture of

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:22.380
here and that's the one you've seen before
where we have ten people just picking out

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:30.740
the fruit before it hits the crusher at the
end and gets into the fermentation. So we

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:37.090
have very consistent fruit when we get to
that level. We train the sorters at the sorting

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:42.880
tables, so we make sure that they have the
same standards, because one sorter might think

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.040
that that's good enough but we actually compare
them and put them all in parallel and make

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:57.160
sure that we have the reliability in the sorting
of the fruit. When it gets into the chemical

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.120
part of the wine making, that's sort of, for
Six Sigma, the easy part because you have

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.960
all the things that, that you can measure
in the lab. The acidity, the sugar, the alcohol

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.660
and they use these one shots that I use a
lot in Six Sigma and you have your levels

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:17.380
for being with in Six Sigma, which a is basically
a standard deviation on both sides so, we

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:26.170
use these one shots for controlling all of
that. So far, I hope I've convinced you that

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:30.530
we are pretty careful of what we do and we
produce good wine, but we've had our issues,

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:35.680
so this is an example of where you don't want
to be and we have corrected it and it is a

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:42.350
couple of years old. But after the alcoholic
fermentation, you get the malolactic fermentation

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:50.760
and the malolactic fermentation transforms
malic acids into lactic acids and that's a

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:57.140
more mellow acid so if it does go that way,
you get a smoother wine, a nicer wine from

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:02.120
a, from a taste point of view, so, so it's
an attractive thing. The wine starts that

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:09.201
process itself, the issue with it is that
it can be very slow and it can attract a lot

00:27:09.201 --> 00:27:16.520
of bacteria in the process, and if you do
that, you can get an infection in the wine

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:22.140
and you get a high VA, you can't control the
[INDISTINCT] acidity, so you get all over

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.890
the chart as you can see with the black curve
here, we want to be within the red, but we

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:32.870
were basically outside and if you don't stop
that, you can stop it but the wine turns into

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:38.440
vinegar and you certainly don't want that
to happen because that was not the business

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:49.430
we were set out to do. The last process is
the sale of the wine, and in the, the alcohol

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:56.310
business in the U.S. is heavily regulated.
It goes back to Prohibition where the government

00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:01.990
said that you have to go through wholesalers
in different areas. You could not go directly

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:07.410
to customers and you need a license per state
and you need a wholesaler per state or you

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:11.790
need it. A couple of years ago the Supreme
Court said that that was unconstitutional,

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:16.700
so now some of the states are opening up and
today, we can use brokers, we can use wholesalers,

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.130
we can sell directly to corporation, we can
sell directly to consumers and we do that

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:26.180
through the tasting room for our wine crop
and to our website of course and we try to

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:33.330
manage all that. The most interesting thing
for us is the website because on the website

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:41.680
we can track the data, we, these are old data
so it's small for illustrative purposes, but

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:50.190
you can really track consumers' behavior and
we use one of your tools to analyze the data

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:53.190
here and in an extreme helpful. But you can
see on the website where they go, how they

00:28:53.190 --> 00:29:00.720
behave and what to adjust and we are in the
process now of updating our website according

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.270
to the data we got out of that. Right now,
we get a lot of traffic because of the Six

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:12.120
Sigma name. We have traffic from 79 countries
around the world and that's okay. But, of

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:19.490
course, we don't expect Six Sigma users, of
the process Six Sigma in India to buy wine

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:24.500
online and have a trip to India for five times
the price of the wine. So, it's okay they

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:30.200
get on but that's not whom we want to cater
to. We really need to drill down and understand

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:35.020
how we sell wine and that's what we're going
now so that's one of our improvement projects.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:44.100
We have two black belts working on that. Here
are a couple of things that we stand for.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:51.180
We think that having a 4,300 acre ranch is
a wonderful experience for everybody. We are

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:55.640
building a "bed and breakfast" out there so
people can come and stay for a long weekend,

00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:02.150
do hiking, riding or whatever they want to
do. We also market heavily our Black Belt

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:09.190
ideas to corporations like shirts, and what
have you. We really try to put data around

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:17.990
all our processes and we focus on the outdoor
experience. We still have a lot of work to

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:25.900
do. We still have to improve a number of our
processes. And we still have to work on the

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:31.370
training of the people. One of the things
that we said from the beginning is that we

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:37.450
will train people in the Six Sigma process
thinking and the way to do business; but we

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:44.030
are not General Electric by any measurement.
It's more important for us that people understand

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:49.500
the culture and the whole concept behind Six
Sigma and the quality concept than it is that

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:53.980
they hand in five projects and gets marked
off and say, "Well, now, you're Green Belt."

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:58.071
It's a thinking, it's a corporate culture
of producing quality that is important to

00:30:58.071 --> 00:31:05.800
us. So, yes, we train people but we don't
test them as such. Myself, I'm--my master

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:11.400
degree is mathematical statistics so, I have
the training that is needed for it. But I

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:17.760
think it's important to understand that the
three keys for us is to focus on the customer,

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.450
that we think Six Sigma and everything we
do and we will continuously try to improve

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:29.610
our processes in every step. And here are
some of our wines and some of our products

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:35.290
and some of the key buzz words. Thank you
very much for listening. And if you have any

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:41.860
questions, I'll try to answer them. Or we
can proceed and taste some wine.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:47.490
&gt;&gt; So you were discussing, you know, we have
standards for, you know, soil consistency

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:51.780
and grape size and you know, ripeness and
things like that. I'm curious how you came

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.860
up with those? You know, as you said, "It's
not like you need a two foot log, you know,

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.770
you need a wine at the end." So, where do
you go about benchmarking for the different

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:07.620
steps in the process?
&gt;&gt; AHLMANN: I think the best way to answer

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:18.230
is to pick an example. And, for example, before
we harvest, we run lab results, we take some

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:24.330
grapes that we pick at random across the vineyard
and we want to make sure that they are within

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:29.730
certain parameters. So, there's one measurement
that you do called "Bricks", it's named after

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:37.410
a professor who invented the—a way to measure
sugar and juice. And you want to make sure

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:44.760
that you have enough sugar to produce the
alcohol level as an example. So, depending

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:54.920
on the style of wine you want, you say, "Well,
it probably has to be between 24, 23 to 28

00:32:54.920 --> 00:33:01.620
for the heavy Zinfandel, something like that.
So, you know that per grape. But that's not

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:07.730
quite enough because the sugar tells you something
but you also have to make sure that you get

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:15.150
other things in the—in the final wine. So,
what we will do after we have acidity breaks

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:21.940
and a couple of other things in the juice,
we will go in and we will at random pick grapes

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:27.090
from across the vineyard and we will taste
them. And we basically go after two things

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:35.080
when we do that tasting. We crush the seeds
between our teeth and of course, it have to

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:39.440
be brown because they're not ripe unless they're
brown, but we also taste them. And if there's

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:44.260
the slightest touch of bitterness, they're
not ready. But you can measure that--well,

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:50.670
some new things coming out, well, maybe you
can. But, when you try to measure that or

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:54.930
taste that a couple of times, you know exactly
whether it's right or wrong. So, it's like

00:33:54.930 --> 00:34:01.970
zero, one. The other thing you try to do when
you taste the grapes at the end is to crush

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:08.250
the skin and see if there's any flavors coming
out of that because that flavor that translates

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:16.590
to the wine is the last thing that happens
with the grapes before you pick them. When

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:21.649
it comes to the soils, they're very exact--I
mentioned boron is something you don't want

00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:29.230
and there's a very exact limits for when it
starts to damage the wine. And my son is sitting

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:33.339
down there; he could probably answer this
better because he is into the vidiculture

00:34:33.339 --> 00:34:39.629
side of it. But if you, for example, in an
area have too much or too little magnesium,

00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:44.190
not within where you want to be, you can just--if
you fly up in a helicopter and look down at

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:50.230
the vineyard, you can see it. It just affects
the growth that much. Was that a good enough

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:57.609
answer, son? Okay, I passed.
&gt;&gt; What's your production, your yearly production?

00:34:57.609 --> 00:35:02.960
&gt;&gt; AHLMANN: Right now, we, at around 7,000
cases and we have enough planted to get up

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:09.930
to close to 10,000 for now. We have a two-year
old vineyard, it goes to 20 acres that will

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:11.539
kick into the first year of production next
year.

00:35:11.539 --> 00:35:17.740
&gt;&gt; Are you
on [INDISTINCT] Mount or Red Hills or...?

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.839
&gt;&gt; AHLMANN: We are just in between the Red
Hills and Cup Mountain.

00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:28.109
&gt;&gt; Hi, great presentation. When you present
your methods to be more traditional wine makers,

00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:40.579
have you got any reactions out of them and
if so what, positive, negative, bewildered?

00:35:40.579 --> 00:35:43.970
&gt;&gt; AHLMANN: That's a good question. Well,
first of all, I've tested it on my own wine

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:50.089
maker before I went public with it. But it's
a balance between talking about the wine making

00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:57.109
and talking about Six Sigma. As I said upfront,
people like it because it's a Six Sigma Company

00:35:57.109 --> 00:36:03.079
from the beginning to the end. It's built
that way, and that's a good test case. And

00:36:03.079 --> 00:36:09.190
then, also, when I speak to corporations or
I've done a lot of presentations, some presentations

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:15.960
to the Department of Defense lately, you know,
we finished off with the wine tasting and

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:24.260
that has some attraction. But from a technical
point of view, some wine makers like to make

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:33.589
it a little more romantic. And--but, you know,
I would argue that what we just discussed

00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:38.411
with the seed and the skin, that's science.
You have data around it. If you have the right

00:36:38.411 --> 00:36:43.099
pattern and you've tried it a couple of times
you know exactly how that should be. Another

00:36:43.099 --> 00:36:49.660
example is I mentioned that the making process
where you define measure and try to improve

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:55.130
what you're doing; we taste with our barrel
makers. You saw those French oak barrels,

00:36:55.130 --> 00:37:03.609
every year about five years into the storage
and we say, "Well, there's too much of that

00:37:03.609 --> 00:37:08.369
kind of oak and too little of that one, we
want a little more vanilla, for example, so

00:37:08.369 --> 00:37:12.990
we need more of that kind of oak, so could
you replace a couple of staves next year?

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:18.049
And people would say that that romantic nonsense.
But if you have a wine maker with a really

00:37:18.049 --> 00:37:23.509
good palate, it's like a measurement tool.
He knows exactly, he can--a good wine maker

00:37:23.509 --> 00:37:30.029
can--I sometimes use the analogy that, remember
the old days, very old days when people have

00:37:30.029 --> 00:37:36.019
cameras with rolls of films in them, and you
took the picture and you had an impression,

00:37:36.019 --> 00:37:39.700
but the wine maker develops the film for you
and says, "Well, this is what you're tasting;"

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:45.170
this is why. And he can do that. And then,
you have all of a sudden data that you can

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:51.900
work on and you can start to change and improve
your process. Do you have a question as well?

00:37:51.900 --> 00:38:00.230
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; AHLMANN: Okay. Anybody else? Well, let's

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:01.609
try some wine.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:02.949
&gt;&gt; AHLMANN: You're welcome.
