00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.750
You are listening to radio lab radio from W N Y.

2
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:08.850
S e n n.

3
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:12.800
P. R. Everybody level check.

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.770
We're going to start the show with this fellow. His name's Ben Zimmer.

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.250
He's the on language columnist for the New York Times magazine because we

6
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:23.300
figured since we wanted to do a show called at right,

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.160
we thought we should call Ben.

8
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.660
And so we came into the studio and he brought with him a bunch of his favorite.

9
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.320
<v 1>Oops. As an example. I just wanted to give one of my favorite examples of a,</v>

10
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.810
<v 0>the first one that he hit us with, uh, began its life. Was it in an AP,</v>

11
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.703
a news article?

12
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.870
<v 1>Mm. Well, it was an AP story,</v>

13
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:46.871
but the AP story was fine when the AP story appeared on a news site from the

14
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:52.160
American family association, which by the way is a conservative Christian group.

15
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.600
Um, the headline, first of all,

16
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.670
said homosexual eases into 100 final at Olympic trials

17
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.350
and then kissing guys or something that could be good at, well, if you read on,

18
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:10.620
if you're confused by that headline, very, here's how it starts.

19
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:15.450
Tyson homosexual easily won his semi-final for the a hundred meters at the u s

20
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:18.510
Olympic track and field trials. And it goes on to say, you know,

21
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.120
throughout the entire article, you know, on Saturday,

22
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.580
homosexual misjudge the finish in his opening heat,

23
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.240
the entire article had the word homosexual in place of gay.

24
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:30.650
The sprinters name is Tyson [inaudible].

25
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.750
<v 0>Yes. According to Ben, this is a classic,</v>

26
00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:37.840
classic example of a search and replace, oops.

27
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.700
This group apparently did not like the word gay because gay makes homosexuality

28
00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:45.310
sound very nice and they're gay, gay, gay.

29
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.510
So what they did was they ran a search and replace every instance of the word

30
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.040
gay with the word homosexual,

31
00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:55.060
but then you get Tyson gay becoming Tyson homosexual.

32
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.150
This was just a one that they were a little careless with.

33
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.080
Just to be fair, here's a contrasting example. In 1990,

34
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.860
the FRIZZ Newbie ran martyr.

35
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.870
<v 1>What about the, uh,</v>

36
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.910
Massachusetts budget crisis and it made reference to new taxes that will help

37
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.740
put Massachusetts quote back into the African American. Um,

38
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.810
and they had to issue a correction saying it should have said back in the day,

39
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.490
<v 0>Black, oh no, this one might've been a newsroom prank. We're not sure,</v>

40
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.300
but it didn't get into paper just for the hell of it. Here's one last one.

41
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:32.990
This one happened after the famous broadcast, or Walter Cronkite died

42
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.110
<v 1>when the Chicago Tribune did their online obituary for Cronkite.</v>

43
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.420
What happened was every instance of Cronkite got replaced by Mr Cronkite.

44
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.000
You can understand the thinking behind that. They deciding, okay,

45
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.170
for deceased males, they should be referred to with the title Mister.

46
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.270
But then what this turns into is a,

47
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:59.030
an obituary where it says he was born Walter Leland, Mr Cronkite,

48
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.360
<v 0>and he refers to his radio show, Walter, Mr [inaudible], the 20th century.</v>

49
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.930
It's got things about his family has his son, Walter, Mr Cronkite, the third,

50
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.750
his daughter, his daughter Kathy, Mr Cranky,

51
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.000
<v 2>my heart went, Ooh, Jed. The moment that my heart went, Ooh,</v>

52
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.910
and I'm Robert, I never will forget to this episode of Radio Lab.

53
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.570
The moment that I'm mad for

54
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.660
oopses starting with a tree, oops. Then we've got a goose

55
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.380
and an entire town that, oops. And a Harvard professor

56
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.810
<v 0>that really it. Yeah. No, we should just say before we start, oops. Oops.</v>

57
00:03:42.811 --> 00:03:45.030
Is oops, can be a misleading term.

58
00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:49.010
Really what we're talking about here is something Greek. Well,

59
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.530
you try hard to prevent one thing and then you get exactly what you didn't want

60
00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:56.130
to get back at you. Right. And our first story falls into that category.

61
00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:57.510
Back a few seasons ago,

62
00:03:57.511 --> 00:04:02.270
we were doing a show on deception and we ended up talking with a professor. Yes.

63
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.940
Named Ruben Gore. Hello. Hi. Is this professor Gar? Yes. Speaking.

64
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.910
He's a psychiatrist. Works at the University of Pennsylvania.

65
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.490
And I'd called them to talk about his research on self deception,

66
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.260
self deception. It's fascinating stuff.

67
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.140
And I'm not going to go into it now because somewhere along the way,

68
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.340
the conversation took a really weird turn. No. Oh yeah.

69
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.620
Get it out. Yeah. Yeah.

70
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.350
And it happened when he began to tell me about some studies,

71
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:29.400
range off studies done by a, uh, what was the guy's name?

72
00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:30.570
His name is hanging on it.

73
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.500
<v 3>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.920
<v 0>I don't remember. Second.</v>

75
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.840
<v 3>MMM. MMM Marie.</v>

76
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.830
<v 0>What's his name? Henry Murray.</v>

77
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.930
And the reason we want to hear about Henry Murray is what? I built it up.

78
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.490
Don't you want to know more than this yet? No. You gotta tell me why. Okay.

79
00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:53.970
I'm going to let it unfold because we were so interested in what rubigard told

80
00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:56.790
us that we found a guy. Oh, hi. How's it going?

81
00:04:56.791 --> 00:05:00.210
Who knows a whole lot about professor. Mary's name is Austin Chase.

82
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.740
Very windy day today, isn't it?

83
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.880
And he lives in a remote cabin in Mon Danna.

84
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.100
Got another one in the woods in the foothills.

85
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.910
Professor Murray was a very prestigious scholar.

86
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.990
He had been a professor of psychology at Harvard before the Second World War.

87
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.260
During the war. He, uh,

88
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.170
went to work for the [inaudible] office of strategic services,

89
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:25.830
which was the forerunner of the CIA in a couple of years into his government

90
00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:28.350
service, says Austin. Something happened.

91
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.600
It really spooked him and spooked the country during the Korean War.

92
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.460
Uh, there were some Gis, he said he'd been captured in Korea and afterwards,

93
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.390
after the Korean War, they refused to come home. They appeared to have,

94
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.430
I betrayed their country.

95
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.700
We know their own country and disappeared behind Red China.

96
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.670
<v 2>Benton boob. Correct. Anybody wants to go home.</v>

97
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.780
<v 0>Gia and their military establishment was very much concerned that the communists</v>

98
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.430
had found techniques for brainwashing.

99
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.020
And so Marie and other psychiatrists in the government were charged with

100
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:09.410
preparing XO soldiers to resist that kind of brainwashing.

101
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.890
And Marie himself developed a style of interrogation.

102
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.150
Stressful interrogation was the term used at the army could use on its pilots.

103
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.850
Yeah.

104
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.900
<v 4>He developed this method of kidnapping them before they were sent them to</v>

105
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.350
mission. Yeah.

106
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.050
<v 0>And then says Ruben Gore, he'd run them through a battery of tests.</v>

107
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.370
<v 4>Let's just see if they break and if they didn't break, they were fine to fly.</v>

108
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.630
<v 0>This kind of psychological training was most kind of a new front in the Cold War</v>

109
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.590
and in the 1950s Marie's back at Harvard and he's thinking of ways to fine tune

110
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:42.140
his techniques and this is where things get interesting.

111
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.520
He took a clash of Harvard undergraduates, 20 some odd sophomores,

112
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:51.260
mostly students were told to write an autobiographical essay, like a diary.

113
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.680
And he told them, you know what, make it very personal, right, your deep,

114
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:58.040
his thoughts in their harsh aspirations and hopes while you're at it,

115
00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.900
right about your sexual fantasies.

116
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.010
Go ahead or class and after the students were done he said to them,

117
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.600
now I'm going to pair you up into groups of two to debate or discuss what they'd

118
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:13.010
written. Students were like, okay, we'll share.

119
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.450
No big deal, but they were duped.

120
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.420
They were walked into this very brightly lit bro.

121
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.560
We just turned out to be an interrogation room with a one way mirror,

122
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.330
put in a chair strapped

123
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.670
electro to attach to their arms, chest,

124
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.980
their heart to measure stress basically,

125
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:38.750
and they were also filming through the mirror and then instead of a classmate in

126
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.060
walks, a total stranger, older man, this guy was holding their essay,

127
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:43.731
they didn't know it,

128
00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:48.731
but Marie had trained to do everything he could to anger and humiliate the

129
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:54.311
undergraduate and he just tore them apart piece by piece using the essay,

130
00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.580
the mock shooting aspirations and thoughts.

131
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.090
Then after this was done,

132
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.120
the students have to come back week after week to view themselves on film being

133
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:15.710
humiliated. That to me seems like the worst part. After they'd been humiliated,

134
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.640
they had to watch themselves being humiliated over and over.

135
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.650
<v 4>People became tearful and miserable and he was proud how he destroyed people.</v>

136
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.130
What, what

137
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:29.870
<v 0>kind of person is this? Like why did he do it? Yeah, why Bari did it.</v>

138
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.920
There were any one of a number of explanations and they all could be true.

139
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.160
One is it was a grant grabbing. He was getting money to do these things.

140
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.620
I'll say, you know, this was the Cold War.

141
00:08:39.621 --> 00:08:42.890
He was fighting communism may have thought it was justified. Yeah, but, but he,

142
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.530
but he just said he was proud of this. Well,

143
00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:50.531
it also happens to be the case that he was having an affair for about 30 years

144
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.700
with a woman, not his wife,

145
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.790
and they had a sexual relationship that bordered on the shadow mash.

146
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.320
In fact, wash sadomasochistic another words,

147
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.460
Moorish interest in these was intentionally personal,

148
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.020
whatever the case in those Harvard experiments,

149
00:09:08.021 --> 00:09:11.530
there was one student who is just not prepared for any of it.

150
00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:13.690
His code name was lawful, lawful.

151
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.350
They gave each of these students our code name because he was considered so

152
00:09:17.351 --> 00:09:20.140
conventional. He was really still just a boy.

153
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.740
Graduated High School at 16 I was living a thousand miles from home,

154
00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.080
two shirts and two trousers to his name and lawful.

155
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.050
Apparently within especially lonely kid notes,

156
00:09:30.051 --> 00:09:34.280
I found Marie did refer specifically to lawful chache,

157
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.300
which she shies highly a eight and eight so when lawful walked into that room,

158
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.520
sat across from that stranger.

159
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.620
<v 4>The guy really did a job on him. He was young,</v>

160
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:48.540
so he was barely growing a beard. So the first thing that guy tells him is,

161
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.630
what is this on your chin? Something trying to look like a beard.

162
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.880
<v 5>Then the guy opens up lawfully essay and lets him have it. Meanwhile,</v>

163
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.820
like all the students, lawful had been hooked up to all these stress monitor.

164
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.860
<v 4>I analyzed his data,</v>

165
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.220
compare it to all the other participants he had firing await strongest response.

166
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.650
Physiologically, you mean like his heartbeat, the fastest beat everything.

167
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.433
<v 0>Amazingly,</v>

168
00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:22.890
this experiment went on for three years and decades later a lot of the subjects

169
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.160
were still upset and considered it one of the most traumatic experiences they'd

170
00:10:27.161 --> 00:10:31.320
had in their 20s lawful never forgot it. That's right.

171
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.440
It was resentful at the way he was treated at Harvard.

172
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.430
He had nightmares about Professor Murray after he left Harvard.

173
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.350
So what happened to this guy? Oh,

174
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.980
well he finished up his four years at Harvard,

175
00:10:43.981 --> 00:10:46.200
got his degree and got a phd in math.

176
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.250
Then he began to teach math and then he became a household name.

177
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.130
What do you mean? Well, I mean this,

178
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.680
<v 5>yes,</v>

179
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.770
Bi raid began just afternoon in a remote mountainous area called Stemple pass

180
00:10:57.771 --> 00:11:00.710
about five miles outside the town of Lincoln, Montana.

181
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.940
Turns out that lawfully real name your door [inaudible]? No.

182
00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.350
Oh yeah. [inaudible] was, no. Yeah.

183
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:12.200
<v 0>P I dubbed him the Unabomber in nearly 18 years.</v>

184
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.120
He found targets all over the country.

185
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:18.700
He is meticulously made bombs or killed three people and injured another 23.

186
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.920
<v 5>Blew my arm off to the side like this. And, uh,</v>

187
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.520
the first thing I thought was why did they do that? Do you think that this study

188
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.940
<v 0>he had anything to do with, uh,</v>

189
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.620
Ted Cruz in skis subsequent very infamous acts?

190
00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:38.030
<v 4>Well, I think he probably would have, if it hadn't been for that experiment,</v>

191
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:38.450
he still,

192
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:43.450
it probably would've been maybe reclusive living somewhere in a cabin in one

193
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.340
time, regardless.

194
00:11:45.341 --> 00:11:49.840
But I think the evil twist was what was done there.

195
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.220
<v 0>Years later, while he was researching a book, Austin corresponded</v>

196
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.053
<v 6>with Kozinski</v>

197
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.480
<v 7>and one of his letters,</v>

198
00:11:56.481 --> 00:12:01.481
he mentioned that he participated in some psychological experiments conducted by

199
00:12:02.031 --> 00:12:04.250
profession. Marie, of course,

200
00:12:04.251 --> 00:12:08.210
I was very curious and I wrote it back to tell me a little bit more about it.

201
00:12:08.211 --> 00:12:11.840
And he shed while you really don't,

202
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.900
I don't know if you want to go into that can of worms.

203
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:24.120
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

204
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.120
<v 6>Rubin Gore is a professor of psychiatry at University of Pennsylvania and Austin</v>

205
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.180
Chase is the author of the book Harvard and the making of the Unabomber.

206
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:35.023
<v 9>Hello?</v>

207
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.410
[inaudible].

208
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.330
<v 10>Oops. Oops. Oops.</v>

209
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:47.903
Here's one more

210
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.080
<v 1>from Ben Zimmer. What is the Cupertino effect?</v>

211
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:56.140
The Cupertino affects is the name given to the phenomenon of when you rely on a

212
00:12:57.501 --> 00:12:59.300
spellchecker too much,

213
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:04.270
it will give you a suggestion and very often it's a suggestion that you really

214
00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:08.500
shouldn't take. Why is it called the Cupertino effect? Well,

215
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:12.850
in early spell checkers, if you wrote cooperation,

216
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.540
the word cooperation, c, O, O, p, e r, a, T, I, o. N,

217
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:21.370
it perfectly typical spelling of the word cooperation in early spellcheckers.

218
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.260
Um, that word was not there because it expected you to spell it c o Hyphen.

219
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:31.530
And so what it would do is it would give you a suggestion and the suggestion was

220
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:34.960
Cupertino in another town in California.

221
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:40.050
So if you look at documents that are still online from the UN,

222
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.560
from the EU, from NATO,

223
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.600
you'll find dozens and dozens of Cupertino's that have found their way in there.

224
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.740
For instance, a here's a German NATO officer was quoted as saying,

225
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:55.300
the Cupertino with our Italian comrade proved to be very fruitful.

226
00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.100
And then there was a proposal from the EU scientific and technical research

227
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:04.360
committee. They proposed quote, stimulating cross-border Cupertino.

228
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.090
<v 6>Oops. Number two, you go the the next,</v>

229
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.150
this is the next one is just a different flavor entirely.

230
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.030
We're going to meet someone. I don't know.

231
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.380
I can't really say they did anything wrong. It's just,

232
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.440
I mean this one is more like, like what'd you say? Luck mixed.

233
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:25.470
Supposed you just picked up a toothbrush and it was connected to a snake that

234
00:14:25.471 --> 00:14:29.280
was connected to a monster that was connected to the devil himself.

235
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.900
Now you wouldn't know. You're just picking up a tooth.

236
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:35.220
So this is a case where we really bad things happen. The story comes from our,

237
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:40.350
our own reporter. Pat Walter's. Yeah, it concerns. Why don't you go ahead and,

238
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.460
okay, so just to start, I want you to imagine you're on a mountain top.

239
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.820
Okay. This mountain is in western Nevada.

240
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.970
The second highest peak in the state of Nevada got a name,

241
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:55.100
it's called wheeler peak and it was this, this is Michael Cohen.

242
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.360
I go by Michael Pico and he's a nature writer and he tells me that up on top of

243
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:02.480
this mountain there is a grove of old trees.

244
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.390
You can see the trees from a distance and Eric Wood is so bright that it

245
00:15:08.391 --> 00:15:12.320
actually glistens in the sun. What do they call it? Oh,

246
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:16.000
bristle cone pines. Yes. Can you describe what they look like? Sure.

247
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:20.900
They tend to be shorter, broad at the base. They get very,

248
00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:25.040
very old and as they get old they become towards your door.

249
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.950
[inaudible] they sort of twist up towards the sky.

250
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.320
The overall effect is sort of electrical.

251
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:33.110
They look kind of like what you'd seen a Tim Burton movie.

252
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.070
So you have that picture? Yeah, I combined. Yup. Okay,

253
00:15:37.071 --> 00:15:40.970
so the story is about the scientist named Don Curry.

254
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.610
I'm going to take a drink of water. Wait, I'm going to take a drink of water.

255
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:46.610
Okay.

256
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:51.610
Story starts in 1964 don curry was a graduate student from North Carolina and he

257
00:15:52.611 --> 00:15:54.620
was young. Do we know how old he was?

258
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.460
He was 30 years old and he'd just gotten a big grant from the national science

259
00:15:58.461 --> 00:16:01.130
foundation to do some climate change research.

260
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:05.090
Not like climate change now though climate change thousands of years ago because

261
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:07.640
he learned that you could actually sort of travel back in time,

262
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:12.670
go back into the past using this spacing between tree rings,

263
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.410
the annual rings. This is Ron Lanner,

264
00:16:15.411 --> 00:16:19.430
he's a retired forest service scientist and he says you can use the width of the

265
00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:24.410
tree rings to determine whether it was colder at one time or Rainier at one

266
00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:26.690
period in the tree's life or whatever.

267
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.500
So curry is up on top of this mountain up amongst these trees and he needs to

268
00:16:30.501 --> 00:16:34.610
find one that he can look inside and kind of see what the weather was like.

269
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.630
Way Back in the,

270
00:16:35.631 --> 00:16:40.190
the past five minutes of looking is all it was involved.

271
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.990
This is from a Nova documentary.

272
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.370
Carrie died a few years ago and this is actually the only time that he ever

273
00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:50.320
talked about this story on tape. Literally, he found a tree there,

274
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:55.230
first old tree that we find too, that uh,

275
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.640
he had described as looking super, super old.

276
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.740
So curry takes out this special drill,

277
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.470
which scientists used to take like a core sample to look at the rings. Yeah,

278
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.110
I'll press it up against the tree,

279
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.330
give it a good push to get it through the bar.

280
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.360
And he starts twisting it in clockwise into the tree.

281
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.410
But he wasn't having much luck.

282
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.440
The normal approach to coring the tree wasn't working.

283
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.920
It becomes harder and harder for him to turn this thing into the tree.

284
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.120
And eventually

285
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.650
the bit of his drill broke off in the tree. Oh,

286
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.080
this isn't just any drill.

287
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.630
He ordered it from Sweden and the whole time he's thinking,

288
00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.790
if I can't get this thing out of the tree,

289
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.750
that would mean the research project would be lost for the year.

290
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.220
So at this point,

291
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.300
he kind of lumbers back the mountain and a dejected.

292
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.480
He managed to find the, uh,

293
00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.480
district ranger and told him the problem guys might drill.

294
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:01.780
It got stuck in the tree, what should I do? And they tell him,

295
00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:05.740
don't worry about it. Then we'll just cut the tree down. This is one tree.

296
00:18:05.741 --> 00:18:07.690
There are dozens of these trees all around,

297
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.860
<v 11>so they start slicing into the tree.</v>

298
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.830
It takes awhile to cut it down cause it's really dense or not.

299
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.810
Some are old and eventually the tree

300
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:22.263
<v 6>falls over.</v>

301
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.470
Then they cut some slabs out of the lower part of the tree.

302
00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.010
Curry gets one of these slabs back to his lab, throws it on a big desk,

303
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.390
find a magnifying glass because the rings are really small and he starts

304
00:18:34.391 --> 00:18:37.780
counting one, two, three and as he counts,

305
00:18:37.781 --> 00:18:42.700
he's making little pin holes or pencil marks every 50 year, a hundred years,

306
00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.740
three 17 by the end of the first day nine he gets back to a thousand years like

307
00:18:49.871 --> 00:18:53.820
the dark ages where in Europe eating raw pasta.

308
00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.530
Day Two,

309
00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:00.910
2006 by the middle of the day he gets back to like Jesus,

310
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.920
Roman Empire, gladiators and Centurion.

311
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.810
But even at that point he was only like halfway finished. He kept counting.

312
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.880
We can begin to see that we were getting over 4,000 years.

313
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:19.210
Over 4,500 over 4,600 and we ended up around 4,900 years.

314
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:25.230
4,844 annual rings in it.

315
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.430
And at that point,

316
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.520
the oldest tree that anyone had ever found was 4,600 years old.

317
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.510
In other words, he had himself the oldest tree ever,

318
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.440
but he had killed it. And you've got to think,

319
00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:46.450
I've got to have done something wrong. I better recount. I better recount again.

320
00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:51.190
But no matter how many times he counted the rings, the number never went down.

321
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:53.960
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

322
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.510
<v 6>the world's oldest tree was dead.</v>

323
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:06.110
It was. It was truly, it was horrifying. It was a,

324
00:20:06.111 --> 00:20:09.350
it was a like a family tragedy.

325
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:11.893
<v 8>Uh,</v>

326
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.980
<v 6>people had given these trees names.</v>

327
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.280
There was Buddha and Socrates and Methuselah.

328
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.430
They called Curry's tree, the prometheus's tree.

329
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.170
And the guy who named that particular tree was so angry that he wrote a magazine

330
00:20:25.171 --> 00:20:29.010
article where he called Don Curry, a murderer all across the country.

331
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.280
There is a tremendous uproar. Same thing.

332
00:20:32.281 --> 00:20:37.281
What about killing the world's oldest living organism?

333
00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.350
What I thought we would just say he was, I think was the oldest living tree.

334
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.580
It's, it's both.

335
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:47.950
It's the oldest tree and it's the oldest organism. It wait, wait, wait.

336
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.760
You mean that the oldest continuously living

337
00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.300
<v 2>okay.</v>

338
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:58.250
<v 6>And [inaudible] shrub mushroom, eh. Oh,</v>

339
00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.940
you making you sure about this? [inaudible] get his head with,

340
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.960
this is the oldest living continuous individual alive on the planet.

341
00:21:05.961 --> 00:21:09.740
I know what I said. This true was older than any other tree on the planet.

342
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.660
Older than the oldest sponge,

343
00:21:11.661 --> 00:21:15.920
which is like 1500 years old and older than the oldest animal.

344
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:19.490
Just some sort of oyster, which is 405 years old.

345
00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.580
Older than any other living thing on the entire planet.

346
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.333
<v 2>Oh God.</v>

347
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:34.350
<v 6>Where do we go? Here we go from there. So where does that leave? Mr. Curry. Oh,</v>

348
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.420
so what happened to him? Well, right after this happened,

349
00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.790
curry pretty much stopped doing research on trees.

350
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:44.120
He basically studied salt flats for the rest of his career.

351
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.180
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

352
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.700
<v 6>big treeless salt flats.</v>

353
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.880
And aside from that little Nova clip that we played before,

354
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:54.550
he hasn't really ever gone on record talking about this.

355
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.820
It's hard for us to say like how we really felt about it.

356
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.110
There was this one moment he was being interviewed by a TV reporter,

357
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.060
like about his salt flats research,

358
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:09.110
and this would have been in the 19 probably the late eighties early nineties

359
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.170
years and years after the whole tree incident.

360
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.360
All of a sudden they out of a clear blue sky

361
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:15.370
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

362
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.770
<v 6>the television reporter asked him, oh,</v>

363
00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:21.370
aren't you the curry who killed the world's oldest tree?

364
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.440
<v 2>[inaudible] he was completely</v>

365
00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:29.840
[inaudible].

366
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.500
<v 6>Curry just turned his back and ran away.</v>

367
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:36.970
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

368
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:40.790
<v 6>who is it? That's a stage. Just pick for forever. We're off somebody.</v>

369
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:41.560
Look on your, the need.

370
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.820
He did have the incredible Mr switching to kill the oldest living organism on

371
00:22:45.821 --> 00:22:46.720
our planet. Yeah,

372
00:22:46.721 --> 00:22:51.610
but this is 25 years later and he's still getting hassled about this tree.

373
00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:56.500
We're talking about one tree here. Well, no, we're talking about the tree here,

374
00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:56.921
right,

375
00:22:56.921 --> 00:23:01.921
but thing about a tree that lasts for four almost 4,000 more than that.

376
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:08.380
5,000 almost five years. Sure. Is that the, it is a repository.

377
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:13.150
It is a talisman for 5,000 years of earth history. But I mean, would it be,

378
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.590
would it be any less bad if the tree were three and a half thousand years old?

379
00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.380
This is just one more old thing. No, it is.

380
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.820
It's the oldest of all taking like the Guinness Book of World Records. Oh,

381
00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:27.880
you keep making me into like a Ripley's believe it or not guy. But no,

382
00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.130
that's exactly what you were being. No, no, no. There's a,

383
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.340
when you've been around longer than everybody else,

384
00:23:34.341 --> 00:23:38.480
there's a certain number of her experience. Yeah. Well,

385
00:23:38.481 --> 00:23:40.950
I'm older than you. I,

386
00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.640
I walk in here and I look at you and I feel pity for other things.

387
00:23:43.641 --> 00:23:45.980
You don't know your shit or what tree must have

388
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.960
<v 12>fell in. Right.</v>

389
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.370
But it must've been around Jack that was your boy and Pat Walters.

390
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.740
But a mother use the route and we're happy to say that since our original

391
00:23:59.811 --> 00:24:04.130
broadcast, that the story, a new oldest living tree has been found,

392
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:09.020
it's also a bristle cone pine also in the white mountains, and it's current age.

393
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:12.980
According to Dr. Peter Brown of the Rocky Mountain Tree Ring Research Group is

394
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.190
just about 5,060 years old,

395
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.730
which makes it actually older than don Curry's tree when it was cut down.

396
00:24:19.731 --> 00:24:22.670
So Don Curry, if you're out there listening from the afterlife,

397
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:25.790
you can now rest in peace. We'll continue in a moment.
