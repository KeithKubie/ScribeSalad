00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.330
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Ken has
been a longtime supporter of

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.030
and participant in the
National Book Festival.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.330
I remember interviewing him

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.410
at I think it was the 2007 festival
we decided when he was talking

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.080
about the war, his
documentary on World War II,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.270
which started conversations
with veterans

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.040
in households all over the country.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.010
A reminder that you can support the
festival with a gift of a donation

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.820
by checking the information in the
festival program and on the app.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.410
The organizers welcome your help

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.310
in making the festival possible
next year and every year.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.280
This amazing gathering would not
be possible without the support

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.380
of sponsors and book
lovers like you.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.280
If you would, please turn your
cell phones off, lest I be forced

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.740
to quote the late Oliver
Sacks whose sharp response

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.310
to a beeping phone while he was
giving a talk, reminded me happily

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.050
that CSPAN doesn't
censure rough language.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.610
Some of you may have seen that.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.500
The way we'll precede is that
I'll ask a few of the 10,000

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.170
or so questions I have for Ken

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.610
and then invite you
to ask some of yours.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.280 position:56%
There are microphones, I think if
I'm seeing right, in the aisles here

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.790
and here and so please line up
at those when the time comes.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.710
Be advised that our gathering is
being recorded for the archives

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.100
so if you're a spy or
an international person

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.480
of mystery you may
want to remain seated.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.960
Otherwise be brave
and step right up.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.520
I'm really not going to give
Ken a very long introduction,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.080
although he's worthy of
one, because I do think most

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.290
of you know his work by now.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.690
Don Hewitt, who created 60 minutes

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.550
at CBS was often asked
about his philosophy.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.390
His response was simple,
tell me a story.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.950
Ken Burns is a storyteller.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.250
He's also a historian who
understands that a great way

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.850
to tell a story is
to make it personal.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.190 position:56%
A big important story can be told by
finding the small important stories.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.880
The famous Sullivan
Ballou letter you heard

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.830
in the Civil War is
a perfect example.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.130
You can't hear it and not be
moved by it and come to understand

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.110
that terrible war in
a very personal way.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.660
Ken has a new book, which is
here on the table behind us,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.920
Grover Clever Again, a
Treasury of American Presidents.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.340
It's beautifully illustrated
by Gerald Kelley.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.590
It's intended for younger readers
but I define older readers not

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.900
to take great pleasure in it too.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.930
It's the latest addition to Ken's
wonderful body of work and I ask

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.290
that you join me in
welcoming him, Ken Burns.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.590
[applause]

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.890
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: Thank you.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.190
Thank you.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.490
Good afternoon.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.810
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Ken, we're
at the National Book Festival,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.260
do you remember a time
when books became important

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.920
in your life for the first time?

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.580
I was lucky enough to have a father
who read to me before I could read.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.210
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: My answer is
that I don't remember a time

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.380
when books weren't important
to me because I was read

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.560
to from the moment I was
born by both my parents

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.440
and it became a huge part of it.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.070
And though my mother was sick I was
able to also spend a lot of time,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.240
very precious time, with my father
who would read me long novels

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.880
that would take several
weeks to read,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.910 position:56%
books that he had gotten as a child.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.950
And so I felt that
they connected me.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.860
I was speaking earlier this
morning and remind people

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.610
that often children born in
poverty have a deficit by age 3,

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.750
they hear 30 million
fewer words than people

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.050
who are not born in poverty.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.410
And we begin to understand

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.050
that despite all the other
obvious economic pressures

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.390
that we have this lasting deficit
that is going to be very difficult

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.420
to make up and I feel so
extraordinarily fortunate

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.400
that not only was I read
to but I've also been able

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.970
to read to my own kids.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.240
I have four daughters
ranging in many ages

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.480
and I think the intimate
connection I have

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.650
with them has been
foraged over books.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.820
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: I understand
the family was an influence

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.350
in the origins of Grover
Cleveland again.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.590
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: So you are talking
about a person who makes films

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.530
about American history, who
tries to define those stories,

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.650
thank you very much for
your generous introduction,

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.670
and when it was time for bed, when
the books were finished reading,

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.490
when the lights were off and I was
either lying next to my daughters

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.360 position:56%
in bed or in a chair next to them, I
would drill them on the presidents.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.720
So I would say George,
they would say Washington.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.950
I would say John, Adams, Thomas,
Jefferson, James, Madison, James,

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.930
Monroe and we would go through
and halfway through you get

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.890
to this wonderful anomaly

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.170
which always delighted
them as they remembered.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.360 position:56%
In the beginning I would tell them
stories about each of the presidents

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.680
or just say who was next and
some important circumstance.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.640
But when you get to Grover
Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.630
Grover Cleveland again, and each
daughter, one is now turning 35,

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.050 position:56%
when she first memorized it, when
we finished it I said you know what,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.060
Sarah, we should write
a children's book.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.640
That was 30 years ago.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.100
Her sister, four years
younger, Lilly, same thing,

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.590
I said we should do
a children's book.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.980
I'm really serious this time.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.150
Olivia, who was 11 six years
ago, committed all the presidents

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.330
to memory that way and I said now
it's time actually to do something.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.130
And my youngest, Willow, who's 5,
the same age as my granddaughter

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.440
who I haven't yet drilled the
presidents on, she did it.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.180
And if you go to the Random
House Children's Book website

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.150
and look this up you
will see Willow Burns,

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.860
age 5, reciting the presidents.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.660
Which means anybody can do it.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.680
But the idea was to originally
do kind of an [inaudible],

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.490
something that would just
be presidents to memorize.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.330
But as we got into it we realized
that these were all human beings

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.420
and somehow that they had
been placed at and removed

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.210
from us, put up on pedestals.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.120
They were no longer human beings.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.070
They were the sum total of their
successes or their mistakes.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.250
And these were all people who
had parents, who had siblings

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.740
for the most point, who had pets,
who had hobbies, who had kids,

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.440
and that it was important
to humanize them.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.070
And so the book became you know
richer and richer and denser

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.640
and denser in that so that
like a kind of Grand Canyon

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.460
of many layers it's
possible to just use it

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.810
to help you memorize the presidents
and know what the number is.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.830
Abraham Lincoln, by the way, is 16.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.170
That it was also possible to learn
a little bit more about them.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.710
And so we have what we call the
baseball card, the information

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.150 position:56%
of when they were born, when they
died, when their administration was,

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.620
their brothers, their sisters,
but then a large section

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.840
that would be helpful for kids
a little bit older writing book

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.440 position:56%
reports and even older than that
writing more extensive book reports.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.950
And so we think we have, as Random
House calls it, Knopf calls it,

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.660
a treasury of the America.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.750
That this is something
that you could hold on to

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.900
and last for a long time.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.380
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Part of
the problem for a historian

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.230
or a documentarian or a writer

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.140
in general it seems is
knowing what to leave out.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.440
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: Yes.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.520
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: This book
could have been 1200 pages long.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.300
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: You know it's pretty
interesting, this took a lot longer

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.440
than I thought it would take.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.900
It was a lot harder than
I thought it would be.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.600
I'm used to working on
projects for many, many years.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.120 position:56%
I have a film on the history of the
Vietnam War that's coming out a year

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.460
from now and when it comes
out I will have worked

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.070
on it more than 10 years.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.600
So we're used to that.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.100
But I had thought that you could
just scoop in and you can't.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.750
You have to do as much work
for this book as you had to do

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.690
for even a biography
of the president.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.550
And we had it vetted by a number
of distinguished historians who do,

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:51.380
are great, great happiness said, I
learned stuff that I didn't know.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.830
And they're folks who have spent
their lives studying the presidency

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.430
and writing, you know, big,
huge, thick books about it.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.570
So in order to figure
out what to leave out,

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.030
you know I live in New Hampshire.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.330
We make maple syrup there.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.910
And it takes 40 gallons of sap to
make one gallon of maple syrup.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.420
And I'm sure the amount of
material that we collected for each

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.720
of these presidents was at least 40
times what we could possibly use.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.330
And then the work was how to tell a
story that didn't make them wrong,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.740
that made them interesting
and humanized them,

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.870
but also let you know that there
are some very potent issues going

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.970
on in American history about
race, about money, about honesty,

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:37.320
about all sorts of things and
that's part of the book as well.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.700
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Are you
a merciless self editor?

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.780
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: Yeah, we're
pretty tough on each other.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.720
I should say from the start, I
should have said from the start

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.660
that David Blistein, who is my
oldest friend, and Cauley Powell

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.950
who works in my office
were both instrumental

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.850 position:56%
in making this book happen and their
names are listed on the title page.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.010
So we would spend a great deal of
time together sifting and digging

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.370
and chapping and writing
and rewriting.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.780
But yeah, you want
to get it just right.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.080
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Do
you love research?

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.380
You must at this point.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.680
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: I love it, love it.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.140 position:56%
I mean I just had the great pleasure
of meeting the new Librarian

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.200
of Congress and you know I think
it's the Librarians of Congress

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.830
who should be billionaires.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:22.010
[laughter] You know and teachers.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:26.450
[applause] Our values are
little bit upside down.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.930
But you know I've spent my
life in libraries and archives

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:34.640
and museums trying to figure out
how to make the past come alive.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.440
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Do you
always find a surprise

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.740
when you're digging through stuff?

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.040
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: Every, every,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.870
every single project
is a constant surprise.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.340
You know I was working on the
Civil War series and you know

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.830
that is the most important event
in American history but as you said

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.860
in your introduction, sometimes
the smaller detail is more telling.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:58.280 position:56%
If you think about it, the
architecture of the atom is the same

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.650
as the architecture
of the solar system.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:04.240
So that you could find, as
the poet William Blake said,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.090
the world in a grain of sand.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.350 position:56%
And that's what we try to do, to
make something, to personalize it is

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.580
to often go down to
the tale in detail.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.280 position:56%
So not too far from here is a little
town called Winchester, Virginia.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.880
It changed hands 72 times
during the Civil War.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.580
We don't think of American towns as
changing hands, let alone 72 times,

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:31.320
and that always is the thing that
I go back to to just be reminded

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.020
that these little nuggets are
also incredibly instructive.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.920
Humor is also another thing
that is very helpful, you know,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.880
alligators in bathtubs and
working in your dads saloon

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.980
as Martin Van Buran
did, these are all stuff

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.920
that helps us understand
these complicated people

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.460
that we more often abstract and
make the subject of term papers

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.250
and not the fact that they
were flesh and blood like us,

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.270
that they had to put on their pants
one leg at a time or hopefully

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.450
at some point put on
their dresses, you know.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.280
[laughter] [applause] Sam
Litzinger: A reminder,

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:14.040
if you'd like to ask a question you
can in just a couple of minutes.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.330
You might even want to kind of
cue up at the microphones now just

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.890
to avoid a frenzied
rush to get up here.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.150
I just have a couple more questions
before I open it up to those of you

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.310
who have them from the floor here.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.240
You're best known as
a documentarian.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.250
Do you tend to think
visually when you write?

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.680
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: No, as a matter of
fact, that's a wonderful question

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.300
and I never really have
a chance to explain this.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.300
I am drawn to visual things.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.110
But I will go out, say to the
Library of Congress working

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:46.080
on the Civil War, and I will
just film all the photographs

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.280
from the Brady collection
that I'm drawn to, visually,

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.580
because they tell good stories,

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.810
unconcerned with whether
they're going

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.610
to illustrate some
part of the script.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.850
And too often films
are made that way.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.990
Let's just look for the
image that's going to get us

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:06.110
through paragraph 2 of
page 7 of episode 6.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.600
And that's a horrible way to do it.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.530
You miss a lot of good
stuff that way.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.010
So I go and try to
film the good stuff.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.220
Meanwhile as the left hand
is doing that the right hand,

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.480
unaware of what the left hand
is doing, is writing stories

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.010
with writers so that
we are unconcerned

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.720
with whether we have visual
material to illustrate it,

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.800
we just want to tell that good
story in an literary sense.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.500
And then editing, the most critical
period for us as it is you know

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.240
for most of us, is where
the horse trading goes.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.830
And sometimes we find ourselves
with an abundance of image

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.130
for which there are no stories
to use but then you find a way

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:45.530
to use them and create new scenes
and sometimes you have a story

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.190
that you have to have but there are
no images and you invent new ways

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.500
to do it, using some of those
images or some equivalency.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.810
It's incredibly exciting.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:59.400 position:56%
It tends to lengthen and attenuate
our process but that's the best way.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.050
And then there's a
kind of durability

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.870 position:56%
and evergreen nature to the stories.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.810
I mean mostly when you say
documentary most people think

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.540
of people who are advocating
a particular point of view,

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.550
exposing something that's
very relative in that moment.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.900
But quite often history
is addressing all

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.370 position:56%
of the same issues we're addressing
today but it's doing it about events

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.890
that took place seemingly before
and unrelated to us but are

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.380
so resonant with human nature.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.720
History doesn't repeat itself.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.150
We're not condemned to
repeat what we don't remember

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.220
but human nature never changes.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.000
And understanding the patterns
and the themes and the motif

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.290
of the past arm you in
the best possible way

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.800
to understand the present.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.370
You know Ecclesiastes
said it better than me,

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.970
what has been will be again, what
has been done will be done again.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.170
There's nothing new under the sun.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:51.620
And that means that human
nature super imposes itself

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.250
over the random chaos of events

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.440
and we can perceive those
patterns and that's what we do.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.090
Mark Twain is supposed to have said

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.220
that history doesn't
repeat itself but it rhymes.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.110
[laughter] And it's a wonderful
phrase if in fact he did say it.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:10.140
But I spent my entire
professional life, 40 years,

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.870
trying to hear those rhymes,
trying to hear that stuff.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.610
And so quite often when you take
a subject that seems safely,

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.750
distantly in the past it
is resonant with today.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.720
I'll give you a simple example,
our recent film this past spring

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.150
on Jackie Robinson, which
was sort of exploding some

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.720
of the sentimental myths about him
and telling a much more dynamic

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.460
and complicated person, is
speaking to the themes that are

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.250
on the front page of today's
paper, about Black Lives Matter,

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.850
about driving while black,
about stop and frisk,

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.450
about integrated swimming
pools, about integration,

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:49.730
about housing disparities, about
wage disparities, all of the things

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.040
that are still omnipresent
in our discussion

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.660
about race today are happening
in the context of a story

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.970
that we've normally just
relegated to a happy story of a guy

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.480
who turned the other cheek.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.920
He did and it's impressive
but the story

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.330
of the real Jackie
Robinson is more important.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.460
That's why I think coming
to terms with these guys

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:14.110
in a human dimension allows them
to remain fresh and new to us just

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.750
as we deal with many
of the same themes.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.540
George Washington and Thomas
Jefferson were dealing

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.350
with the same themes of race
we're dealing with today.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.300
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: At a conversation
we are probably, are we ever going

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.670
to finish that conversation?

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:27.970
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: I don't think so.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.070
I mean and we have to be
pretty honest with ourselves.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:36.000
This is our original sin, we
know as a country that we,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.280
where we were founded and when,
July 4, 1776 in Philadelphia

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.120
and we know what our catechism is,

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.970
it's the second sentence
of the declaration.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.830
It begins, we hold these
truths to be self-evident

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.470
that all men are created equal.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.620
Yet I have to stop right
there, a third of the way

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.630
through that wonderful sentence,

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.830
arguably the second greatest
sentence in the English language,

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.560 position:56%
the first is obviously I love you,
but after that you'd be hard pressed

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:06.080
to find a better statement,
sentence, because the guy who wrote

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.110 position:56%
that owned more than 100 human
beings and didn't see the hypocrisy,

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.350
the contradiction or see fit
in his lifetime to free any

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.550
of those human beings and set
in motion American narrative,

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.830
symbolically but also literally,

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.950
that is constantly
struggling to deal with that.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:25.220
And as what's going on today, it
happens to be Charlotte or Tulsa

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.550
but you know a year and a half ago
it was Charleston, North Charleston

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.920 position:56%
or Ferguson or wherever, it's there.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.680
So we've got to deal with it.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.490
And many of these people, most of
those people, were in some way,

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:43.780
shape or form either having to deal
with it or consciously trying not

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.730
to deal with it but then moved as
closer to Civil War or into some

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.660
of the problems we suffer today.

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:54.210
So you can get to the heart of who
we are by picking up almost any one

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:58.240
of these mini biographies
and understanding, wow,

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.230
as William Faulkner said,
history is not was but is.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.280
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: I have a lot
more questions but you have a lot

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.470
of questions too so let's
get to some of those

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.790
and then I'll wrap things up
with a final question of my own.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.950
I think you have a book
signing up, I think, at 1:30 so

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.250
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: I do, at 1:30.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: So for those of
you who would like to have your copy

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.630
of Ken's book signed by Ken,
1:30 is the time for that.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.290
Let's start over here.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.480
&gt;&gt; As a middle school
librarian who has to try

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.770
and teach students the
art of doing research

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.760
and the benefits when it's hard.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.730
I was wondering were you a student
that fought that or did you find

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.560
that that was something
that drove you

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.200
and that's why you became a writer?

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.520
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: I think
it's hard for everybody

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.510
and there's some resistance
to it to not just,

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:48.610
I mean today we have the luxury
but also the deficit of being able

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.420
to sort of look it up on
Wikipedia and get something.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.720
&gt;&gt; Information overload.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: But it's not just that
but when I first went to my site

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.880
at Wikipedia it gave me
three films I'd never made

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.490
and took away four that I had.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.780
[laughter] And it took a year
and a half to correct that.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:10.520 position:56%
So those of you who are about to
trust that, one of the key hallmarks

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.800
of not only research but of
journalism and history is

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.680
to triangulate, to get a couple
of different things right.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:23.230
And I always found, as I got older,
the hunt was actually more exciting

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:27.160
than the final thing because you
discovered stuff you never realized

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.460
you were interested in.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.090
I was at the Museum of the
Confederacy in Richmond going

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.460
through all the photographs.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.760
We finished.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.060
I said do you have others?

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.360
He said only seconds,
do you want to see them?

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.940
And I said sure, meaning
duplicate copies.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:43.150 position:56%
So he brought out a box, a cardboard
box, filled randomly, not filed away

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.360 position:56%
in acid free paper, and we went
through and I said nope, nope, nope,

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.630
a couple times I said
yeah and I filmed them.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.350
At the bottom, tucked under
the flap, I pulled it out

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.760
and it was a picture of
Robert E. Lee with this sort

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.340
of enigmatic Mona Lisa smile.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.050
And I said I've never seen
this photograph before.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:03.300
And I heard the greatest
thing I've ever heard

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:07.470
from a librarian archivist
ever which is neither have I.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.870
[laughter] I was like, you
know, it was like striking gold

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.950
in the California gold rush so.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.290
&gt;&gt; I need you to call my
superintendent and tell them

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:18.050
that you can't teach students
to be curious in 30 minutes.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.350
[laughter]

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.970
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: Yeah, yes, thank you.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:22.990
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Also Ken
did not direct Casablanca,

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.020 position:56%
for those of you who were wondering.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.320
[laughter]

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.620
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: Yeah that's right.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:28.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: We're running out
of time, I'm sorry, to talk so much.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.650
Here we've got, what, about 10
minutes, something like that?

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:35.000
No, even shorter than that, oh,
Ken they're cutting our time.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.590
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: A lightening round.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.080
&gt;&gt; Ken, first of all,
thank you so much

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.680
for the Civil War documentary,
absolute masterpiece.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.360
I'm a huge, huge fan.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:46.610
But the talk earlier was focused
on how it was a challenge for you

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.540
to make the historical
record personal to people.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.080
You're trying to tell a story.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.980
I'm curious about your own personal
experience when you're immersed

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.140
in the research and you're
looking at primary source material,

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:03.290
have you ever had a personal
struggle or an emotional kind

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.080
of reaction to the material
you've been working with?

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.380
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: Always.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.680
&gt;&gt; And had that immediately?

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.400
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: Always and in
fact every film is a struggle

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.700
as it should be.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.780 position:56%
It ought to obliterate, assassinate,

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.270
conventional wisdom
and preconception.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.970
And so you come in, all of
us are burdened by that,

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.720
and then all of a sudden when you
dig down it's much more complicated

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.440
and therefore challenging
but much more interesting.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.210
And as you say, sometimes
emotionally startling.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:31.970
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Last question
from me, Desert Island books at sort

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.130
of the National Book Festival.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.350
You can have some books to
take to your desert island.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.730 position:56%
You can also have some documentaries
because you're good at that.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.330
What do you want to take with you?

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:45.890
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: Oh my
goodness, I don't know.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.380
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: You can
change this in a year.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.890
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: And can I pack
a lot of books, you know?

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.190
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: You
can have a couple.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:55.640
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: Abraham Lincoln used
the vinyl Old and New Testament

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.310
and the Works of William
Shakespeare,

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:01.710
that was basically his education
until he was reading for the law.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.470
You know these are great stories.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:09.540
Some are made up, some are
fanciful and sort of allegorical.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.030
But that's the way we intuit them.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:16.440
So I, you know, I, an American,
all of my subjects are Americans.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.850
I don't think that Mark
Twain wrote a bad sentence.

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.810
He said the difference
between the right word

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.260
and almost the right
word was the difference

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.940
between lightening and
the lightening bug.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.710
But more to the point,
if we're going to go

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.060
out on a literary figure,
Mark Twain said,

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.900
it's not that the world
is filled with fools,

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.420
it's just that lightening
isn't distributed right.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.390
[laughter] That will be
funny in a thousand years

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:47.120
if there's still civilization
to talk about, right?

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.420
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Absolutely.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.350
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: And think of any
other 19th century humorist,

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.620
whatever they said
isn't funny anymore

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.910
but that will be funny
a thousand years

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.050
from now and everybody gets it.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.460
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Ken Burns
has to sign some books.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.760
He's got to get there.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.060
Thank you very much.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.360
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: Thank you very much.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.680
I'm so sorry I couldn't
get to your questions.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.980
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Thank you.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.280
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: Thank you.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.580
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Thank
you very much.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.880
&gt;&gt; Ken Burns: Thank you very much.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.180
[applause]

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.570
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
