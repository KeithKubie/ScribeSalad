00:00:00.076 --> 00:00:05.136
&gt;&gt;Cantor: Sense of belonging is one
of the most important activators

00:00:05.236 --> 00:00:08.456
of a child's engagement in learning.

00:00:08.816 --> 00:00:09.956
&gt;&gt;Darling-Hammond: As human beings,

00:00:09.956 --> 00:00:13.836
one of the most essential needs
we have is the need to belong.

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:18.116
When that sense of belonging is
there, children throw themselves

00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:22.536
into the learning environment and when
that sense of belonging is not there,

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:27.986
children will alienate, they will
marginalize, they will step back.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:32.676
&gt;&gt;Cantor: Norms are a way that
we know whether we belong or not.

00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:40.186
&gt;&gt;Shaddox: What does social
studies today look like, feel like,

00:00:40.186 --> 00:00:43.076
and sound like when we're
supporting the norms?

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:47.066
&gt;&gt;To begin nearly every
class, I start with the norms.

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.456
&gt;&gt;We developed this list
of about ten adjectives.

00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:57.246
&gt;&gt;Abdurrahmani: Our norms are
communicative, collaborative, zealous,

00:00:57.696 --> 00:01:01.076
and the most important
ones: focused and serene.

00:01:01.456 --> 00:01:06.186
&gt;&gt;Cantor: This teacher engaged the
class in establishing a set of norms.

00:01:06.626 --> 00:01:12.196
So, by having children themselves create
the norms you are creating a pathway

00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:17.576
toward belonging for every single child
in that class and they have a role

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:21.056
in this learning community that
they had a share in building.

00:01:22.136 --> 00:01:24.286
&gt;&gt;Shaddox: Come up with a statement.
What does social studies look like?

00:01:24.716 --> 00:01:28.886
What does it feel like and what does
it sound like? And use those adjectives

00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:30.506
that we brainstormed
together for our norms.

00:01:34.246 --> 00:01:37.356
&gt;&gt;Student: Social studies is
collaborative. Everybody's kind

00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:38.006
of working together.

00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:40.816
&gt;&gt;Ali: We get to choose
norms we think will help us

00:01:41.406 --> 00:01:43.166
with our work and get it done.

00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:47.456
&gt;&gt;Cantor: This teacher created a
common language with which to talk

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:49.296
about our learning community.

00:01:50.236 --> 00:01:51.546
&gt;&gt;Shaddox: Let's start
at this table right here.

00:01:51.826 --> 00:01:53.606
&gt;&gt;Abdurrahmani: It looks
and should feel focused.

00:01:53.606 --> 00:01:56.586
&gt;&gt;If we weren't focused we
wouldn't get any work done.

00:01:56.586 --> 00:01:59.506
If we weren't communicative,
you might, like,

00:01:59.506 --> 00:02:01.156
have someone struggling in the group.

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:06.406
&gt;&gt;We can suggest to the group we should
be able to stay at a controlled tone.

00:02:06.406 --> 00:02:08.536
&gt;&gt;Shaddox: Great, thank you guys
for reflecting on those norms

00:02:08.616 --> 00:02:11.616
and we're going to think about
those as we continue our work today.

00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:16.516
&gt;&gt;The classes that go really well are
the classes when I start off reflecting

00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:20.736
on the norms and using those norms to
articulate how our class will run well.

00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:24.866
&gt;&gt;Abdurrahmani: But sometimes it's
good to take some of the norms outside.

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.716
&gt;&gt;Shaddox: All right, we want
to do just a quick circle,

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:32.796
set the norms for the game
today, for Capture the Flag.

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:36.026
&gt;&gt;One of our norms is to be
serene. But there might be a class

00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:39.756
where there's an activity that requires
a lot of walking around, movement,

00:02:40.236 --> 00:02:43.246
even noise, and, you know,
on those days we recognize

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.756
that today that's not
going to be our norm.

00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:48.566
&gt;&gt;Abdurrahmani: You have to be
inclusive. You have to include everyone.

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:51.186
So, like, it could make
the game better, more fun,

00:02:51.826 --> 00:02:54.336
and you could have a
better chance of winning.

00:02:54.936 --> 00:02:55.936
&gt;&gt;Shaddox: Sweet, inclusive.

00:02:56.226 --> 00:02:59.006
&gt;&gt;It helps us own the
behavior in the classroom.

00:02:59.406 --> 00:03:04.586
Instead of a top-down list of rules that
a teacher gives a class, these are words

00:03:04.586 --> 00:03:05.676
that we generated together.

00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:07.386
These are words that we believe in.

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:09.906
&gt;&gt;Shaddox: Inclusive,
focused, considerate.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.600
&gt;&gt;Abdurrahmani: Zealous.

00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:11.716
&gt;&gt;Shaddox: Being zealous. Great.
