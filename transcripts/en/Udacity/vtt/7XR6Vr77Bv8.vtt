00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We now know that the search tree, if we design it this way,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
doesn't have to branch into eight possible assignments

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but only five possible assignments--those here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So now my question is, if we design a search tree using this branching here,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
how large is that going to become?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm going to give you two hints; the first one is

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the height of the search tree--that will be n thirds.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Again, we have to take a little bit of care about the details

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.500
if we can find such a structure here, but I think I've shown you often enough

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.000
in this unit that this is possible, so hopefully you'll just believe me this time

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that it's also possible to always find the structure or, at least,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
if you don't find one, decide for certain vertices

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
if they are going to be in the vertex cover or not.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now how much wider does this search tree get?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It gets very wide, actually; each time you go down into a new level,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
you branch into five additional cases times five, times five, times five, and so on.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.500
Now what I would like to know from you--how big is that search tree?

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.000
And I would like you to enter your answer here.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It will be some number to the power of n, and I would like you to provide

00:01:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
two digits after the decimal and round up.
