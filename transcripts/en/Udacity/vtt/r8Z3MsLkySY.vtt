00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.300
Now recall that a minute ago I said that we had no spontaneous transitions and

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.090
yet we have what looks like a spontaneous transition between the none state and

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.110
the clock state. We'll see that we are going to need that distinction because

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.379
the user can actually have an event here like hitting the arrow

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.640
button which causes us to move from the none state into the clock set state.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.460
So we'll come back to that when we get to these other events.
