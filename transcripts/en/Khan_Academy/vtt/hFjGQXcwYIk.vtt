00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.740
- [Instructor] Most of us
are familiar with dogs,

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.430
often times known as man's best friend.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.330
And what's fascinating about them is that

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.760
they are one species, even
though different types

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.660
of dogs, different breeds could
look very, very different.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.550
And the fact that they're
one species says that

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.180
if you have a male and a female dog,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.930
any two, that in theory
they could reproduce

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.290
and produce viable offspring.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.950
Although in, for example,
the case of this character

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.120
and this character, the mechanics
could get quite difficult.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.890
But an interesting question
is, is where do dogs come from

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.440
and why do we have these seemingly

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.630
specialized breeds amongst dogs?

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.180
You might have things like
a Rottweiler that's better

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.320
for protection, you might
have things like terriers

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.390
that have been specialized
to maybe go after rodents.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.830
You have things like border
collies that are good at

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.250
herding other types of animals.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.790
The simple answer is,

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.940
through artificial
selection and domestication.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.390
Remember, in any population of a species

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.200
there's variation in that species.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.630
And when we talked
about natural selection,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.220
that's where the environment might select

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.660
for certain of those variants.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.560
Certain of those variants might
make it a little bit easier

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.660
to survive or reproduce, and
then those would predominate

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.890
and that's how evolution happens.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.440
Artificial selection and
domestication is where

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.080
humans take matters into their own hands.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.770
And instead of waiting
for nature to do things,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.810
they are the selection factor.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.570
They pick which of the
species get to reproduce

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.910
and which ones don't.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.930
And when you have that type
of artificial selection,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.040
the change can happen much, much faster.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.160
Breeding is essentially
artificial selection.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.410
So dogs like this, and
all the dogs we know of

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.750
had ancestors that looked like this,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.230
that looked like a wolf, that were a wolf.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.690
And what we theorize is
that the early stages

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.920
of some wolf eventually evolving into dogs

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.850
might have been more
traditional natural selection

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.990
where tens of thousands of years ago

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.880
our hunter gatherer ancestors
as they hunted and gathering

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.510
they might have left
over food here or there,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.880
and some of the wolves that
just happened to be the variants

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.720
that were a little bit more
comfortable getting close

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.520
to humans might have
benefited from being able

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.130
to get some of that left over food,

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.450
being able to get some of the remains

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.510
that the human beings left behind.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.020
But then over time, human
beings probably realized

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.110
that hey, these wolves
are useful to have around.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.600
Maybe they provide some
form of protection,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.650
maybe over time they
started breeding the wolves

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.430
so the wolves that were
especially friendly,

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.480
the wolves that were especially
good at a certain task,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.250
say protection, or going
after some type of an animal

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.790
or retrieving things, they allowed those

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.760
to reproduce together and over time,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.530
over tens of thousands of years,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.080
we went from wolves to dogs.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.580
And even once we had dogs,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.740
the breeding got even more specialized.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.020
As I mentioned, things
like border collies,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.550
this was many years, many
generations of breeding

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.270
where sheep herders
might have selected dogs

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.970
that were good at herding sheep.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.480
That terriers came from
dogs that were good

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.040
at going after rodents,
things like rottweilers

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.200
or dogs breeding the dogs
that were especially good

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.260
at providing protection or defense.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.760
And it isn't just dogs that are products

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.940
of artificial selection and domestication.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.928
Pretty much any animal that you might see

00:03:17.928 --> 00:03:20.350
on say a farm would be the product

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.190
of artificial selection and domestication.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.010
A wild pig looks like this, while the ones

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.400
that you would see on
a farm look like that.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.790
And once again, they would
have selected for things like

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.320
docility, things where
they're less aggressive

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.830
and they're easier to take care of.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.860
And artificial selection and domestication

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.110
does not apply just to animals.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.890
Pretty much anything you might
see in the produce section

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.500
of your supermarket is the product

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.930
of artificial selection and domestication.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.210
There might be wild
variants of these different

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.020
vegetables or these different fruits,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.190
but over roughly 10 or 15,000 years

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.310
of human agriculture,
every generation of crop

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.150
they would have selected for the crops

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.550
that are more robust, that tasted better,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.770
that were able to grow
in different climates

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.250
and by allowing those
variants to reproduce,

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.530
we eventually ended up
with the domesticated crops

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.443
we see today.
