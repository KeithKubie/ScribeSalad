BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
So Kenny Werner

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.390
has been a world-class
pianist and composer

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.710
for more than 40 years.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.550
And I have known him for
about the last 20 years.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.580
And that very, very
generous introduction

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.190
classified me as a musician.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.570
That's a stretch.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.870
I did play music and
even perform music--

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.240
high on passion and
the effortless part,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.690
less so on the mastery
and musicianship part.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.760
And in the same way,
Kenny, as far as I know,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.700
unless he's holding back,
is not a computer scientist.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.790
But somehow we have
forged this friendship

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.620
based on respect for
each other's disciplines.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.980
And that's really why I'm
so excited to bring him here

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.970
to YouTube today.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.640
It's because I think
what he's offering is not

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.110
only about music.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.840
Incredible music is created,
but it's about much,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.330
much more than music.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.660
It's about bringing this quality
to all aspects of our work

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.069
and all aspects of our lives.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.070
And I hope you tune into that.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.860
Kenny wrote his
landmark book in 1996,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.260
"Effortless Mastery, Liberating
the Master Musician Within."

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.550
And we have a limited
number of copies over there.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.440
I'm sorry we don't
have one for everyone.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.290
But if you're deeply curious,
please help yourself to a copy

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.210
after the performance.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.230
And it's widely read and studied
amongst musicians everywhere,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.120
but especially young musicians.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.210
And you heard that the Oakland
School of the Arts is here.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.550
I wanted to share a little
bit about the story of how

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.170
they got here.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.680
Kenny is a mentor to a
young student there, Lucas.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.760
Lucas, would you please stand?

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.110
All right.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.660
And so we gave a special
welcome to those students,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.920
and I couldn't be more
delighted that they are here.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.890
As you guys all know,
Kenny has a prolific output

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.570
of compositions,
recording, publications.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.070
He's an incredible musician
as well as educator.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.359
The qualities of his work--
what I really love is not only

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.650
listening to Kenny-- and I've
had the chance to see him

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.060
perform in many, many settings--

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.430
but also watching Kenny.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.750
I think while he performs, he
really embodies these qualities

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.450
that he's teaching us--
the effortless part,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.770
the spontaneity, the
joy, the fearlessness,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.700
and the discipline.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.750
All of that is sort of manifest
as you watch Kenny perform,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.940
and so I'm super happy
to share that with you.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.420
As you may or may not know,
we will have a special guest

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.590
joining Kenny for at least
part of the performance,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.050
vocalist Claudia
Villela from Brazil,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.480
who will also demonstrate
some of her amazing gifts

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.870
and techniques as well.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.960
So without further
ado, let me welcome

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.372
to the stage, Kenny Werner.

00:02:47.372 --> 00:02:50.228
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.615
KENNY WERNER: I thought it
was kind of interesting--

00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:56.390
Sara Beth's introduction
of Bradley--

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.882
he did all these things that
actually changed the world.

00:02:58.882 --> 00:03:00.590
But the most interesting
thing is he used

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.510
to be a musician from Detroit.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.790
I somehow think the most
interesting thing is--

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.480
there's some other interesting
things about Bradley.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.220
So I'm going to play
something first,

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.830
and then I may be speaking.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.959
It's a distinct possibility.

00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:23.444
[PLAYING PIANO]

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.539
Thank you, thank you.

00:08:38.366 --> 00:08:38.990
That was short.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.031
Maybe I'll play one more.

00:08:45.748 --> 00:08:48.742
[PLAYING PIANO]

00:13:26.685 --> 00:13:29.679
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:30.930
Thank you.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.140
It's a great privilege
to play for all of you.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.050
And I know I have so many
friends in the audience, too.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.900
So, so much love around
me I can feel right now

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.490
that it's really cheating.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:41.895
You know?

00:13:41.895 --> 00:13:44.270
Everybody loves me already,
because I know so many people

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.940
here that love me that--

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.820
I thank you for coming,
and I thank those of you

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.320
who don't know me for coming.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.360
And I thank you kids for coming.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.690
And Lucas has already
learned the main lesson.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.180
Because before we
started, I did a trick--

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.390
I do a thing with
students, just to see

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:04.850
if they can figure out their
relationship to music, right?

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.460
So I said, OK, you know you're
going to play today, right?

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.546
And usually they'll
go, like, what?

00:14:09.546 --> 00:14:10.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.990
Me?

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.620
Like, when?

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.480
Now.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.912
Uh, what am I going to play?

00:14:15.912 --> 00:14:18.370
I usually go, oh, you know,
something you know really well.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.870
Then they go, oh.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.943
Because nobody knows
anything really well.

00:14:22.943 --> 00:14:23.617
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:23.617 --> 00:14:24.450
So that's the trick.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.158
And then I said, is
that the relationship

00:14:26.158 --> 00:14:28.460
you want to have with music
for the rest of your life?

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.460
Something you have
to-- with consequences?

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.470
I mean, one of the biggest
delusions about music

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.410
is that there's consequences.

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.400
It's only music.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.790
And the verb "to
play" is a big clue.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.610
I think you don't play painting,
and you don't play dance.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.530
Well, you do dance
dancing, that's nice.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.050
But it's the only
thing where you play.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.090
And I think that's a
big clue, you know?

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.576
So anyway, he passed the test.

00:14:54.576 --> 00:14:55.700
I said, I was only kidding.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.741
I said, so you're going
to play it, right, Lucas?

00:14:57.741 --> 00:14:58.420
He says, yeah.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.080
Yeah, I want to play, yeah.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:00.920
I said, really?

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.128
You're going to get up there?

00:15:02.128 --> 00:15:03.770
Yeah, man, let's go.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.190
That's the best lesson you can
learn that it would be better

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.990
to play and sound terrible--
not that Lucas would--

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.810
than to think of this
as some kind of test

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.520
that you can pass and fail.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:21.380
That's a real perversion of
the gift of music, you know?

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.900
So what Effortless Mastery--

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.802
it kind of came about by
me just talking to people.

00:15:26.802 --> 00:15:29.010
And then people asked
questions, and I answered them.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:30.050
Next thing you know
I was teaching,

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.130
and then I was lecturing.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.010
And now I have my own
Institute at Berklee College

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.240
of Music in Boston called the
Effortless Mastery Institute.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.480
And the whole concept is
basically a lot of things

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.670
that people in other
careers can relate to,

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.780
for example, making mistakes.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.140
This is almost a cliche now.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.710
But perfection, to me, is
celebrating the mistakes.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.900
The idea of avoiding
mistakes may

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:58.910
be the thing that makes you miss
the most important discovery,

00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:59.480
you know?

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.160
So when you touch the
instrument, trying

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.190
to avoid mistakes, it's kind
of like touching a hot stove,

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:04.970
you know?

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:08.360
But if you touch the instrument
celebrating mistakes,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.820
it's more like putting
your hands in warm water,

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.260
and you go, ah.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.290
Really, this should feel--
and it's not just the piano.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.110
Every instrument, when
the body forms a relation

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.650
to the instrument, now you
have your real purpose.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:25.100
It's this instrument that
plays that instrument.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.420
And really, it's such
a neat thing to know.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.049
For example, this
sound, you know.

00:16:29.049 --> 00:16:32.043
[CRASHING PIANO CHORD]

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.780
Sorry, I just have to
take that in for a second.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.280
That's such a great
sound, isn't it?

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.887
But you don't think of it.

00:16:45.887 --> 00:16:47.470
It's a piano, and I
put my hand on it.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.338
[CRASHING PIANO CHORD]

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.510
But just think-- let's say
you were in your kitchen,

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.176
and you kicked your
stove, and it went--

00:16:59.176 --> 00:17:01.864
[CRASHING PIANO CHORD]

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.930
You'd be going in the kitchen
kicking your stove all

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:08.430
the time.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:09.349
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:10.890
You'd be calling
your friends saying,

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.780
man, you got to come over
to hear my stove, wow.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.310
We don't realize the miracle.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.310
Well, in every way we
don't realize the miracle

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.349
that we're in every moment.

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:23.514
And I address it with music,
because I have kind of

00:17:23.514 --> 00:17:24.680
gotten it together in music.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.369
But like you all, I'm a
student of it in life.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:32.230
But I feel like I have a
lot I can pass on to you

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.190
from the musical point of view.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.700
And one of the things is
to celebrate your mistakes.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.170
That is perfection.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:42.910
Another thing is to start from
nowhere, not trying to do it--

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.230
I was talking to someone
before, and they said,

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.380
I'd really like to
apply effortless mastery

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.840
to my writing.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.679
And I said, it's
really this simple.

00:17:50.679 --> 00:17:52.720
You're only having trouble
writing because you're

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.640
trying to write something good.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.024
Write something bad,
you'll be writing all day.

00:17:58.024 --> 00:17:59.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.410
You'll just fill page
after page, you know?

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.690
And that's a good way
to approach anything.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:12.207
It is the fear of mistakes that
actually stunts the creativity.

00:18:12.207 --> 00:18:14.540
And a lot of people say, I
want to let go of that stuff,

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.639
and OK, they really do,
but they really don't.

00:18:16.639 --> 00:18:19.180
Because a lot of times, you'll
play this sort of new age game

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.790
with yourself, saying,
OK, I give everything

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:26.410
up to the power or whatever, the
higher power, the grand poobah.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:31.210
And I turn all the
results over, and I just

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.230
give gratitude, right?

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.280
And you're sitting there like
this, and then look like--

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.650
did my abundance come yet?

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:37.562
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:37.562 --> 00:18:38.980
Is it here yet?

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.020
Because if I surrender, the
abundance is supposed to come,

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.630
but that's not surrender.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.370
I mean, surrender is really--

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:51.200
it goes good, it goes
bad, it doesn't matter.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.990
I mean, that's the only
way it becomes really real.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:58.130
There are three forms of action
that I like to talk about.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.980
Two of them are a success,
and one is a failure.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.915
One is, let's say--

00:19:02.915 --> 00:19:04.290
well, I'll give
the best example.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.230
Musicians may live
in a certain town.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.380
And there's one club in
town that if you play there,

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.350
you're a professional.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.250
And if you don't get a gig
there, you're still an amateur.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.220
So people will be meaning to
call that club all the time,

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.420
and they never quite get
around to it, you know?

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.700
Because they're
afraid of the answer.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.490
So in that situation,
there are three actions.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.470
Two of them are a success,
and one's a failure.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.740
One, you call the club,
the guy hires you--

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.390
success.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.870
Two, you call the club,
the guy doesn't hire you--

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.620
success.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.400
Three, you don't call the club
because he might not hire you.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.710
That's a failure.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.720
Do you guys get that?

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.670
So an action taken is a success.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.540
An action not taken because
you're afraid you'll fail

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.061
is a failure.

00:19:55.061 --> 00:19:57.560
If you could get that straight--
and I mean, for all of us--

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.460
if we could get that
straight in our experiments--

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.430
I don't know what kind
of work you guys do here.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:08.025
Like Bradley outed me, I'm
not a computer scientist.

00:20:08.025 --> 00:20:10.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.530
So I don't have any
idea what you do.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.630
But I do know that
your state of mind

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:18.620
will absolutely make
the whole difference.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:24.170
For example, with musicians,
the basis of effortless mastery

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:25.280
is this.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.940
Most of our problems are
in our thoughts, you know?

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.530
A musician wakes
up-- and people think

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.200
that musicians are special
because they're musicians.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.090
Let me tell you,
that's not the case.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.970
Musicians are at least as
neurotic as everybody else,

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.050
easily.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.592
A musician who gets into a cab,
and he sits there in the cab,

00:20:41.592 --> 00:20:43.674
and the cab driver says,
so what do you do, buddy?

00:20:43.674 --> 00:20:44.780
He goes, I'm a musician.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:45.960
You can always see
it, the cab driver

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.340
looks in the rear view mirror.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.090
Oh, he's a musician, oh, wow.

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.980
And then they tell you
they played the piano

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.430
when they were 11.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.950
And he's thinking, god,
all I do is drive this cab,

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.690
and this guy is a musician.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.020
And the musician's sitting
in the backseat going,

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.100
god, I wish all I had to
do is drive a cab, man.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:04.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.590
It would be so much simpler.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.280
My life would be
so much simpler.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.510
So believe me, everybody
suffers from being in one place

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.610
and thinking they should
be somewhere else.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:16.100
It's a pretty common thing.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.600
But the basis of
effortless mastery

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.670
is that most of those
problems are in our thoughts.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.900
So for example, you
could be walking down

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.570
the street on a
beautiful sunny day,

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.195
and a musician will
do this to himself.

00:21:27.195 --> 00:21:29.270
Oh, it's a great day,
man, I feel so good.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.196
I really should practice more.

00:21:31.196 --> 00:21:32.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.520
And now it's not such
a nice day anymore.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.010
Or if it is, they don't
notice it anymore.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.080
I know I've walked on
the beach in Hawaii

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.288
and continued to be imprisoned
because of something I

00:21:41.288 --> 00:21:43.670
was thinking about.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.800
Everybody kind of knows
about that, right?

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.490
So in music, I said
we want to transition

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.640
out of the conscious mind
where all the thoughts are

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.290
and into what I call the space.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:22:00.650
Now, every religion, and
every path, and psychology,

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.150
and neuroscience
has a name for this.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.170
I just call it the space,
the space beyond, above,

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:10.059
below, aside, wherever you see
it, beyond the conscious mind.

00:22:10.059 --> 00:22:12.350
Because most of the problems
are in the conscious mind.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.750
We are small because
of the thoughts

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.790
we have in our conscious mind.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:21.180
Like, I'm not very
talented is a thought.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.182
So I might as well
say I'm a genius.

00:22:27.182 --> 00:22:28.890
I don't know which
one is true, but which

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:30.760
one will get me more mileage?

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.175
You know?

00:22:33.175 --> 00:22:35.550
But there's the other thing
that's coming from the space.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.682
The space is a place where it's
not your mind playing anymore,

00:22:39.682 --> 00:22:41.640
or it's not your my
writing, or it's not your--

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.540
I mean, it is part
of your mind, but not

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.550
that part you identify
as a conscious mind.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:46.270
[PLAYS PIANO]

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.190
So right now, I'm
really talking to you.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.860
And I'm concentrating
on talking to you.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.880
And if anything, I'm even more
concentrated on talking to you

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.830
while my hand is
playing the piano.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:06.710
So from the space, I don't play
the piano, my hand plays it.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.700
There's so many
benefits to that.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.280
And I believe that this is
a therapy for non-musicians.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.370
Put a person's hand on
a piano and just commit

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.890
to pressing the buttons.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:19.690
But as you hear the sound,
instead of you thinking,

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.970
what am I doing playing
the piano, you go,

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.771
that's the most beautiful
sound I've ever heard.

00:23:26.771 --> 00:23:28.437
[PLAYS PIANO]

00:23:28.437 --> 00:23:29.770
And you're kind of in the space.

00:23:32.397 --> 00:23:34.730
And then it begs sort of the
spiritual question-- that's

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:36.146
where the spiritual
part comes in.

00:23:36.146 --> 00:23:40.111
Because if I'm not
playing, who's playing?

00:23:40.111 --> 00:23:42.395
[PLAYS PIANO]

00:23:42.395 --> 00:23:44.520
And it doesn't matter how
you answer that question.

00:23:47.255 --> 00:23:49.630
But as long as you answer it
to what makes sense for you,

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.960
sort of a higher power
of your understanding,

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.820
or a power beyond
the conscious mind,

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.770
that power will take over.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:24:00.730
And once it takes over,
there are no mistakes.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.610
Once that power takes
over, every sound

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.400
is the most beautiful
sound I ever heard,

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.914
and I don't have to
make choices anymore.

00:24:08.914 --> 00:24:11.330
Now, it doesn't excuse you
from practicing the instrument,

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.705
for those of you young guys
saying, oh, wow, that's all I

00:24:13.705 --> 00:24:14.360
have to do?

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.285
That's great.

00:24:15.285 --> 00:24:16.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.680
I would be hopeful if
I was you right now.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.725
But the thing is,
I balance that--

00:24:21.725 --> 00:24:23.600
and I won't have time
to talk about it today,

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.190
I want to talk more
about the space.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.830
I balance it with a method
of practicing that is

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.339
so clear and so finite--

00:24:31.339 --> 00:24:33.380
like, one thing I can tell
you, even for teachers

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.170
and everything, the larger
the swath of material

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.600
you have to study,
the less likely

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.300
you are ever to play it well.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.780
The smaller the example, the
more you can go into the space

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.080
and master it.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.510
And why do you
want to master it?

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.514
Because even if you're playing
something highly complex,

00:24:51.514 --> 00:24:52.430
it has to play itself.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.954
[PLAYS PIANO]

00:24:53.954 --> 00:24:55.370
So then you can
go into this space

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.703
where you can receive the music.

00:24:56.703 --> 00:24:58.130
So I'm just dropping my--

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:01.290
I forgot I was
dropping my fingers.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.630
It's a great thing to feel
like you're not doing it.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:05.380
Someone comes up to
you after the concert,

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.730
they say, man,
you really sucked.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.765
I go, wasn't me.

00:25:09.765 --> 00:25:10.655
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:10.655 --> 00:25:12.440
[PLAYS PIANO]

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.910
Don't blame me.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.350
(SINGING) Don't blame me.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:16.780
That's a good song.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.350
Was that a raised hand?

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.420
OK.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:25.500
But I mean, effortless mastery
means precision with ease.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.770
So if you're a
computer scientist,

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:33.060
you train the way a monk study
scriptures over and over again.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.180
You train with
complete devotion,

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.110
but you perform with
complete detachment.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.290
And if you can get
those two things going,

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.038
you can do something
really profound.

00:25:43.038 --> 00:25:46.440
[PLAYS PIANO]

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.510
There's all sorts
of lessons that I

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:52.920
learned from that kind
of detachment, you know?

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:57.880
For example, for one
thing, I did my studies

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.750
so I could do the same thing
I just did from the space

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.190
but play something
highly complex.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.900
So let me just try that.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.390
Now that I said that, my
mind wants to go, oh, yeah,

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:07.570
who are you kidding?

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.750
Man, now you've got to do that.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.530
But luckily, the space
is what Lucas said.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:14.732
Yeah, let's do it.

00:26:19.692 --> 00:26:22.668
[PLAYING PIANO]

00:26:56.396 --> 00:26:58.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.020
It happens, but you need to take
that technology to the level

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.460
of effortless mastery.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.500
It has to be
effortlessly absorbed,

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.980
which is why the smaller
the amount of material,

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.870
the more possible
it is to absorb it.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.840
And that has a collateral effect
on everything in your playing.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.820
But the same thing works
for any walk of life.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.180
But the first thing is learning
to respect the space above all

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.810
else.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.970
Sorry, this keeps going out.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.746
Practicing doing
things from the space--

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:29.120
when you're
practicing the space,

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.440
you have to allow for mistakes.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.080
So if you're
writing, or whatever

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.760
it is computer scientists
do, do it from the space,

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.190
and let it go as wrong
as it needs to go.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:43.160
And if nothing else,
it stretches the mind

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:47.480
to be extremely fertile when
it's time to be more exact.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.290
And not only that, it is
like irrigating creativity.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.512
Creativity is receiving
whatever's coming.

[CRASHING PIANO CHORD]

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:58.760
I mean, you can
have a limited form

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.659
of creativity by
trying to control it

00:28:01.659 --> 00:28:02.700
right from the beginning.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.880
But if you receive it,
you'll find something's

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.020
flowing through you.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.950
This is the ultimate creativity.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.550
This is probably the
value of musicians,

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.210
or certain musicians, talking to
people in other walks of life,

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:17.270
and helping them find that
flow within themselves.

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.250
And in order to find
that flow, you just

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.630
have to surrender the results.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.430
I know you hear
that all the time,

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:26.960
but really, maybe you can't
do that when the money is

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.160
on the line or whatever.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.840
But you can always
take some time

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.060
and practice the
flow at the expense

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:36.050
of playing the right notes
or doing the right things.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:39.050
And if you do that, you
expand your mind, you create,

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.080
you make a greater
fertilization of creativity.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.650
You also have a lot
more self-generosity,

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:47.160
which is really important.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.150
And if you beat
yourself up for failing,

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:53.000
then you're going to
try harder not to fail.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.780
Can everybody think
about when you try--

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.110
I'll say this to musicians.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:59.484
Think about the time when you
really needed to play well.

00:28:59.484 --> 00:29:01.640
How did you play?

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.670
Right, in your mind,
it was very important

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:05.900
that you really score today.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.260
These people are listening,
and this guy's in the audience.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.650
And I want to play
with that guy.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.442
And I want the club
owner to hire me again.

00:29:11.442 --> 00:29:13.441
And then think about the
time when you were just

00:29:13.441 --> 00:29:15.702
fooling around, and for
some reason, in your mind,

00:29:15.702 --> 00:29:16.910
you didn't think it mattered.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.540
Then how'd you play?

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.070
Better.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.540
Everybody says that.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:26.050
It's the same thing
with anything you do.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:29.350
If you're willing to
at least experiment

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:33.920
with not needing to succeed
but connecting with the flow,

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.560
you'll probably have an
awful lot of success.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.560
So those are the things
that are relative to it.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.790
The other lessons I learned
in music is that music works.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.560

I wanted to show you something.

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:49.482
This is a sort of
a harmony lesson.

00:29:49.482 --> 00:29:50.940

recognize that.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.420
So you see Dorian,
Phrygian, Aeolian.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.350
Yeah, you all see it, right?

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:00.850
Everybody thinks there's such
a thing as a right progression

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.020
and a wrong progression.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.520
But how do you think you
find a new progression?

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.330
Randomly.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.520

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:59.410

If the voices lead, you can
glue any two chords together.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.440
They could have no
relationship whatsoever.

That's got to be
useful in other ways.

But you have to have
the detachment to do it.

You throw some stuff down, and
if you're immediately judging

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.370

So I thought we'd do
that little thing.

And I want to give you another
example of a simple structure.

But if you just
manipulate one thing,

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.070
it becomes something original.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:44.200

Now, that's not-- it's
a simple structure,

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.700
but they changed one
thing, and that's

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.450
why it is so distinctive.

oh, it didn't go back, huh.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:10.390
starts rolling a cigarette.

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:12.400
And in an Upper
East Side apartment,

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.290
you do not even
smoke a cigarette,

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:16.130
let alone roll
your own cigarette.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.350
So everything is going wrong.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.391
And then they go into the
living room for coffee,

00:35:19.391 --> 00:35:21.550
and he sees a piano.

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.007
He goes, do you mind?

00:35:23.007 --> 00:35:24.340
You know, if he plays the piano?

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.720
And this was a very hip moment.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:30.430
Because in fact, the avant
garde is very identified

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.350
with Paris, the
Pierre Boulez school.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.370
And this could have
easily been the case.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.020
But he goes into
the living room,

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.154
and he sits down at the
piano with this lady

00:35:39.154 --> 00:35:40.570
and Andie MacDowell
sitting there.

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:41.320
And he does this.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.810
He goes--

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:46.798
[CRASHING PIANO CHORDS]

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.311
Even with the hair falling, like
the Beethoven look, you know?

00:36:03.311 --> 00:36:05.560
He gets done, and they show
a picture of the old lady,

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.810
and she is in shock.

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:11.490
Because she actually heard
music for the first time.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:14.680
And she probably had been to
the symphony and to the opera,

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.380
but she just heard music
for the first time,

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.270
experiencing his passion.

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:22.470
But you don't actually know
if he can play the piano.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:23.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:25.940
Isn't that kind of amazing?

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.790
So anybody can
have this feeling.

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:30.010
And I believe even
non-musicians,

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:33.040
if they receive the sound,
and they use their hands

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.230
to make the sound, they're
going to open a pathway

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.590
to the heart and a pathway
to the brain that's

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.424
going to have its effect
on everything else.

00:36:39.424 --> 00:36:41.214
And that's some of the
stuff I'm working on

00:36:41.214 --> 00:36:42.290
with effortless mastery.

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:44.590
And that's the Effortless
Mastery Institute.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.540
So that's more or less the case.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.990
Now, I would like to bring
one more situation where

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:56.890
complete random creativity just
might lead to music by bringing

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:57.850
up to you--

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:00.460
and I have to say, this is
one of the most brilliant

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.630
performers I've ever met.

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:03.174
I'll tell a quick
story about her.

00:37:03.174 --> 00:37:05.090
And I know, Claudia,
it's never exactly right,

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:07.298
but I'm going to tell it
the way I know it, you know?

00:37:07.298 --> 00:37:08.700
She wanted me to--

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.165
years ago-- do an album
with her, Claudia Villela.

00:37:12.165 --> 00:37:14.710
And so I came out.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:16.030
I don't know if we did gigs.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:18.040
We went right to the
studio, and we start.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:22.840
And then she told me also, she
said, I really need a stove,

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.740
you know?

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.150
She needs to buy a stove.

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:26.830
And I'm starting,
like, feeling guilty.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:30.096
Oh, gosh, you're paying
me to make a record,

00:37:30.096 --> 00:37:31.720
but you kind of need
a stove, you know?

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.969
So I said, so what kind of
music are we going to play?

00:37:33.969 --> 00:37:35.500
She said, no, no
music, we're just

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.510
going to play free together.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:40.109
I went-- because not too
many people can do that.

00:37:40.109 --> 00:37:41.650
Because there are
not too many people

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:43.960
that will give themselves
permission to do that.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.580
She says that, and I
don't even know her?

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.090
I said, may I just suggest
you go buy a stove?

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:50.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:51.820
Don't do this.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:52.860
Go buy the stove.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.810
She said, no, no, no.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:54.310
It's cool.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.809
It's cool.

00:37:54.809 --> 00:37:56.530
And she just blew me away.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:38:03.190
She can make music from
this space at will,

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.710
and that's not that easy.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:07.360
Claudia Villela.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.526
We just did a tour in the area.

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:17.400
And then I thought, I've
got to bring Claudia

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.538
down so that you guys
could check this out.

00:38:20.538 --> 00:38:22.032
You have your own mic, right?

00:38:36.347 --> 00:38:36.972
[PLAYING PIANO]

[APPLAUSE]

00:45:58.758 --> 00:46:01.350
KENNY WERNER: Thank you.

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:02.100
Claudia Villela.

00:46:06.484 --> 00:46:10.920
I wish we could do a whole
hour for you or for 60 minutes.

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.000
Are you going to--

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.820
before you do it, I want to
do one little experiment.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.770
I kept talking about the space?

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.600
Now, everybody's got a lot
of meditation exercises.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.170
But my favorite book
about spirituality

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:26.340
was "Lazy Man's Guide to
the--" what was it called?

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.300
Enlightenment, yes.

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:27.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:29.350
Really, that easily.

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:33.390
So I found a really easy,
lazy way to find this space.

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:36.190
And before we finish, I'd
just like you to do this.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:37.440
I know everybody is breathing.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.660
I can see it.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.125
All I want to do is notice
that you're breathing now.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.020
You don't have to exaggerate it.

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.940
It's like watching
the traffic outside.

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.910
It was happening already.

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:00.803
Just notice your breathing.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.370
OK, now let's see if
we can't live our life

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:17.320
and do our work from that space.

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:18.682
Thank you.

00:47:18.682 --> 00:47:21.568
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:29.264 --> 00:47:33.250
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: OK, so we
have time for a few questions.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.900
We have a mic set up there.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:36.770
And just for the people--

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:38.660
this is being live
cast and recorded.

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:42.310
So if you could step up to the
mic, that would be helpful.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.560
And in the meantime,
let's take one more moment

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.064
to thank Kenny and Claudia for
that amazing performance, yeah.

00:47:51.064 --> 00:47:55.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.980
And in fact, it's helpful if
people line up at the mic.

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.030
And we'll have time for
three or four questions.

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:04.865
So why don't you state your
name and then ask your question?

00:48:04.865 --> 00:48:06.720
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is Gabriel Mesa.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.880
I'm from Oakland
School for the Arts.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:13.080
So my question-- and I
ask this to the hosts

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:17.280
of every single talk or
performance that I go to.

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.010
As far as creating
one's own music--

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:23.880
what's your advice
for the general idea

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.820
of finding your
sound and finding

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:30.565
what seems most like you?

00:48:30.565 --> 00:48:32.395
KENNY WERNER: Is this working?

00:48:32.395 --> 00:48:33.360
Is that on?

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.140
Yeah.

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:37.020
You know, it's funny how people
say, how do I find my voice?

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.540
You already have your voice.

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:42.870
The way you find
your music is by stop

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:45.000
expecting things of
yourself and start

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.640
to go towards the
sounds that attract you.

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.140
And we are humans,
not computers,

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:52.050
so it's only a few different
things that attract us.

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:55.410
It's not like we have
thousands of different options.

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:57.210
We're attracted to the
same sounds, sounds

00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:58.680
that make us start to vibrate.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.350
And as we choose those
sounds habitually,

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:05.220
they become what other
people define as our voice.

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:09.180
The hardest way to find your
voice is by looking for it.

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:13.020
What should I be that
seems original, you know?

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:16.540
And then this all-pervasive
thing, a need to sound good.

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.410
See, that's the thing that if
we can take that out of it--

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:22.140
musicians say, well, yeah, when
I play, I want to sound good.

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:23.700
Sounds reasonable enough, right?

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.997
But what if we were just
talking, and I said--

00:49:25.997 --> 00:49:26.705
what's your name?

00:49:26.705 --> 00:49:27.560
AUDIENCE: Gabriel.

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.280
KENNY WERNER: Ariel?

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.030
AUDIENCE: Gabriel.

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:30.600
KENNY WERNER: Gabriel?

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.577
When I talk to you,
what do you want?

00:49:32.577 --> 00:49:34.410
When you're talking,
what do you want to do?

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:37.410
You say, Kenny, when I talk
to you, I want to sound good.

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:38.160
AUDIENCE: I mean--

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:38.640
KENNY WERNER: You
know what I mean?

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.410
It's so irrelevant,
but in music, that's

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.150
somehow acceptable.

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:44.430
So go to the sounds
that attract you,

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:46.300
and they'll attract
you all the time.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.870
And you'll develop
something within the sounds

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:52.290
that attract you that will
be someone else identifying

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:53.770
your voice.

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:54.270
OK?

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:56.421
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:49:56.421 --> 00:49:58.972
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Great question.

00:49:58.972 --> 00:50:01.107
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:01.107 --> 00:50:02.190
AUDIENCE: Hi there, Kenny.

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:03.450
Thank you.

00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:04.920
My name is Grier Cooper.

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.030
I'm a photographer.

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:10.260
I like the piano,
but it's a side job.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:11.640
Anyway, my question is this.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:16.500
You gave us wonderful insight
about experimentation and play

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.510
and how to do that.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:20.100
But we didn't talk
as much as I would

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:23.280
have hoped about what to do
when the money is on the line.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:27.790
How does your approach differ
when the money is on the line?

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:29.900
KENNY WERNER: OK,
well, first of all, we

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.710
were talking about
practicing something.

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:33.840
Like meditation, you
don't practice it

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.090
and expect to meditate
while you cross the street.

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:38.400
But it has an effect
on everything you do.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:44.340
So by practicing this open,
creative, self-generosity,

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.020
you open to creative things.

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:47.400
But very good question.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.520
Out in the world, you don't
try to do anything like that.

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:54.390
You continue to study so
that the technology of what

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:57.381
you're doing doesn't fail
you even if you are nervous.

00:50:57.381 --> 00:50:59.880
So for example, sometimes I'll
have people come play for me.

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.130
And they'll say, I usually
play much better than that,

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:02.890
but I was nervous.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:04.260
I said, well, that's not why.

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:07.560
If you were nervous, and that's
why you made certain mistakes,

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.660
why did you play anything right?

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:14.320
Because some things are known so
well that they play themselves,

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.260
and other things--

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.080
what doesn't play right
when you're nervous

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.030
or it doesn't work
right tells you

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:20.380
you need more work on that area.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.689
Now, that's one part.

00:51:21.689 --> 00:51:22.480
The other part is--

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.140
I'll just relate
it to you twice.

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.810
Two classical musicians--
different, unrelated--

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:28.810
called me and said, I've
been reading your book,

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:29.620
and I love it.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.870
And I'm auditioning
for the first oboe

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:33.520
chair of the Chicago Symphony.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.992
How do I do effortless mastery?

00:51:35.992 --> 00:51:37.450
And I said, well,
you don't exactly

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:39.460
just do effortless mastery.

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:41.430
You keep practicing
within yourself,

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:43.714
and it more and more
over time shows up.

00:51:43.714 --> 00:51:45.130
But I will give
you an assignment.

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:46.990
When you go to that
audition, no matter

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:49.030
how it goes, whether you blew
it, whether you did great,

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:50.350
whether you get
it or you don't, I

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:51.790
want you to commit
to me right now

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:54.560
you're going to go out
and celebrate afterwards.

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:58.180
And if you celebrate afterwards,
regardless of the audition,

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.080
you're doing effortless mastery.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.470
Because you're taking
away consequences.

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:05.339
In both cases, they got it, but
they realized how loose they

00:52:05.339 --> 00:52:06.880
felt, because they
already knew there

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.255
were going to go celebrate.

00:52:09.255 --> 00:52:11.255
So there's a couple of
thoughts on that subject.

00:52:11.255 --> 00:52:11.760
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:12.551
KENNY WERNER: Yeah.

00:52:14.842 --> 00:52:16.008
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Wonderful.

00:52:16.008 --> 00:52:17.896
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:17.896 --> 00:52:20.570
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm
Joaquin Reeves.

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:22.540
I also go to OSA.

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:26.500
When and why did you start
playing an instrument

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:27.700
and music?

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:30.830
And did anyone make
you, and then you--

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:31.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:31.750
KENNY WERNER: No.

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:33.580
AUDIENCE: --and then
you started enjoying it?

00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:36.015
KENNY WERNER: No, but after I
started, they made me continue.

00:52:36.015 --> 00:52:36.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:37.227
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:37.227 --> 00:52:38.810
KENNY WERNER: It was
my idea to start,

00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:40.393
but after that, they
made me continue.

00:52:40.393 --> 00:52:44.080
Because they saw
a talent, I guess.

00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.420
I started because I went
to a friend's birthday.

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:49.172
His father was playing piano
in the middle of the room.

00:52:49.172 --> 00:52:51.130
And I had never saw a
piano played live before,

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:53.410
and I was like, spellbound.

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:54.640
I was like, wow!

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.620
Not only that, I was
really noticing how

00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:58.510
he was the center of attention

00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:59.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:01.030
And that was very
attractive to me.

00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:02.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:06.160
So I went home, and I
said, Mom, get me a piano.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.510
And to tell you the
truth, though, I sat down,

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:10.630
and I could plunk out
songs I heard on the radio.

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:11.670
And I went back
into the kitchen,

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:13.060
and I said, good
news, Mom, I won't

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:14.351
be needing those piano lessons.

00:53:14.351 --> 00:53:15.820
I already figured
out how to play.

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:16.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.259
And I've actually
believed that ever since.

00:53:19.259 --> 00:53:19.759
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:19.759 --> 00:53:21.208
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:26.690
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is Frances Lao.

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:28.610
I'm also from OSA.

00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:32.942
Is jazz the only genre you play?

00:53:32.942 --> 00:53:33.650
KENNY WERNER: No.

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:37.220
I don't really-- this is crazy,
but I don't really consider

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:38.750
myself a jazz musician.

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:40.160
I learned that language.

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.760
It's a very colorful language,
very hip rhythm, and harmony,

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:44.990
and melodies.

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:49.790
But in my mind, I
think my actual best

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:50.780
job would have been--

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.040
and may still happen--

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:53.900
scoring movies.

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:55.340
Because I play very visually.

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:56.970
I always have a visual in mind.

00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:59.230
It's just that when
I came out of school,

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:02.000
I didn't pursue
specifically what I wanted.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.370
And jazz musicians
called me for gigs,

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:07.820
so 10 years later, I found
myself being a jazz musician.

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:11.180
But I did play some
classical music.

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:14.930
I love old '60s and '70s rock.

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:17.220
I actually think
before I learned jazz,

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.130
I was more like an
Elton John or something.

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:20.590
I liked to play
that way, you know?

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:21.980
And I still love that.

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:26.590
But it's just that jazz an very
accessible language to me now,

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:28.640
and it's a very
interesting language.

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.905
So I guess that's what
I ended up mostly doing.

00:54:31.905 --> 00:54:33.280
I'm actually trying
to get away--

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.910
in my own mind--
get away from the--

00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:36.620
I like to think of it
as improvised music

00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:41.940
rather than jazz, which
suggests a whole mindset.

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:42.490
OK?

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:42.740
Yeah?

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:43.573
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:43.573 --> 00:54:45.419
KENNY WERNER: You're welcome.

00:54:45.419 --> 00:54:47.884
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:47.884 --> 00:54:50.820
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: OK, we're
a little bit over time.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:54.500
So before we wrap, I want to
thank the many, many people who

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.580
contributed to making
this event successful,

00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:01.730
Monica, Sara Beth, Andrea,
the whole tech team, James.

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:04.358
So let's give around of applause
for all those who contributed.

00:55:04.358 --> 00:55:07.202
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:13.050
And I want to give one more
special thank you to Claudia.

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:15.435
Thank you for joining
us and contributing.

00:55:15.435 --> 00:55:18.225
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.840
And finally, one
more time, let's

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.540
give it up for the
amazing Kenny Werner.

00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:26.440
Thank you.

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:29.190
[APPLAUSE]
