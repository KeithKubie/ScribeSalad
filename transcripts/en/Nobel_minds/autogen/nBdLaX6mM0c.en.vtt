because in ours
and<00:00:50.360><c> these</c><00:00:50.540><c> are</c><00:00:50.720><c> two</c><00:00:51.100><c> scientists</c><00:00:52.150><c> Laden</c><00:00:53.150><c> Vic's</c>

and these are two scientists Laden Vic's
 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
and these are two scientists Laden Vic's
who<00:00:54.080><c> actually</c><00:00:54.380><c> wrote</c><00:00:54.860><c> the</c><00:00:54.920><c> theory</c><00:00:55.880><c> in</c><00:00:56.180><c> the</c><00:00:56.510><c> 60s</c>

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 align:start position:0%
who actually wrote the theory in the 60s

who actually wrote the theory in the 60s
1964<00:00:58.730><c> so</c><00:00:59.360><c> then</c><00:00:59.600><c> I</c><00:00:59.630><c> had</c><00:00:59.840><c> to</c><00:00:59.870><c> wait</c><00:01:00.170><c> even</c><00:01:00.200><c> longer</c>

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 align:start position:0%
1964 so then I had to wait even longer
 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.170 align:start position:0%
1964 so then I had to wait even longer

to understand that my attitude church
theorist<00:01:12.470><c> is</c><00:01:12.800><c> okay</c><00:01:13.760><c> so</c><00:01:14.630><c> there's</c><00:01:14.840><c> a</c><00:01:14.930><c> fear</c><00:01:15.200><c> there</c>

it's the interplay between experiment
 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's the interplay between experiment

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 align:start position:0%
and theory which decides what nature has
 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.020 align:start position:0%

chosen as the grand scheme of things and
 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.290 align:start position:0%
chosen as the grand scheme of things and

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 align:start position:0%
so it took 15 years for the prediction
 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.830 align:start position:0%
so it took 15 years for the prediction

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.090 align:start position:0%
true and the thing which makes the prize

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 align:start position:0%
interesting right now you asking why 50
 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.969 align:start position:0%
interesting right now you asking why 50
years<00:01:43.340><c> is</c><00:01:44.060><c> because</c><00:01:44.420><c> of</c><00:01:44.930><c> this</c><00:01:45.080><c> observation</c><00:01:45.860><c> of</c>

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 align:start position:0%
years is because of this observation of
 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.980 align:start position:0%
years is because of this observation of
a<00:01:46.070><c> new</c><00:01:46.220><c> particle</c><00:01:46.790><c> at</c><00:01:47.180><c> CERN</c><00:01:47.570><c> where</c><00:01:47.900><c> the</c>

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 align:start position:0%
a new particle at CERN where the
 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.310 align:start position:0%
a new particle at CERN where the
properties<00:01:48.500><c> expected</c><00:01:49.280><c> them</c><00:01:49.720><c> by</c><00:01:50.720><c> the</c><00:01:50.780><c> theory</c>

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 align:start position:0%
properties expected them by the theory
 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.770 align:start position:0%
properties expected them by the theory
so<00:01:51.950><c> this</c><00:01:52.100><c> is</c><00:01:52.280><c> why</c><00:01:52.490><c> sometimes</c><00:01:53.030><c> I</c><00:01:53.360><c> have</c><00:01:53.479><c> to</c><00:01:53.630><c> wait</c>

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 align:start position:0%
so this is why sometimes I have to wait
 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.080 align:start position:0%

this is this was an ongoing harness so

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 align:start position:0%
narrow the range of mass and what did so
 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.180 align:start position:0%
narrow the range of mass and what did so
