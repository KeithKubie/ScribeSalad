00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.640
So the answer to this question is that we would

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.500
expect the heritability to be higher in population one. Now why

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.060
is that? Well let's think about this for a second.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.660
In the first population the environment is very consistent between everyone

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.492
in the population. So more of the differences in height

00:00:15.492 --> 00:00:18.120
that we're actually able to measure are going to be due

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.410
to genetic factors than environmental ones. In the second population

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.140
though. There are a lot of environmental factors going on that

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.580
could potentially also effect height. Economic status can effect

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.540
how much food you get to eat, the quality

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.040
of that food. How much stress you're under. All

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.700
things that can impact your development, and adult height. So

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.560
more of the differences in height in the second

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.752
population are likely due to the environment more so

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:45.550
than in the first population. This is going to

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.070
be reflected in the overall heritability values between the populations.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.842
Obviously genetics is still playing a role

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:56.691
on the population two, so the heritability

00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:58.693
won't be zero but its likely to

00:00:58.693 --> 00:01:02.133
be lower than the heritability in population one.
