00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:16.629
which we had made in my group he said we
must collaborate we are for the

00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639
must collaborate we are for the
 

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:19.980
must collaborate we are for the
physicists and for the chemists you are

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:19.990
physicists and for the chemists you are
 

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.470
physicists and for the chemists you are
molecule makers in a way and so let's

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480
molecule makers in a way and so let's
 

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.720
molecule makers in a way and so let's
collaborate and we collaborated we made

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:25.730
collaborate and we collaborated we made
 

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.680
collaborate and we collaborated we made
a copper complex of this type containing

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:29.690
a copper complex of this type containing
 

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.810
a copper complex of this type containing
two diphenyl fin and Rollins so this is

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:33.820
two diphenyl fin and Rollins so this is
 

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.129
two diphenyl fin and Rollins so this is
financially this is jargon you can

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:36.139
financially this is jargon you can
 

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:38.800
financially this is jargon you can
forget about it but there are two

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:38.810
forget about it but there are two
 

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.800
forget about it but there are two
nitrogen atoms here which are able to

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:41.810
nitrogen atoms here which are able to
 

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.579
nitrogen atoms here which are able to
interact with copper so we we made this

00:11:45.579 --> 00:11:45.589
interact with copper so we we made this
 

00:11:45.589 --> 00:11:47.370
interact with copper so we we made this
complex and it turned out to be very

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:47.380
complex and it turned out to be very
 

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.290
complex and it turned out to be very
exciting in terms of photochemical

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:50.300
exciting in terms of photochemical
 

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.930
exciting in terms of photochemical
properties in terms of photo physics

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:52.940
properties in terms of photo physics
 

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.850
properties in terms of photo physics
it had a long large time for its excited

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:57.860
it had a long large time for its excited
 

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.850
it had a long large time for its excited
state it could transfer electrons it

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:00.860
state it could transfer electrons it
 

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.889
state it could transfer electrons it
could do many many very interesting

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:02.899
could do many many very interesting
 

00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:05.850
could do many many very interesting
things so that was the very beginning

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:05.860
things so that was the very beginning
 

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.620
things so that was the very beginning
because if you look carefully at the

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:08.630
because if you look carefully at the
 

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.470
because if you look carefully at the
structure you realize that if you

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.480
structure you realize that if you
 

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.370
structure you realize that if you
connect this point to that point

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:14.380
connect this point to that point
 

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.860
connect this point to that point
separately this point to that other

point here you make a cut a name very
 

00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:24.160
point here you make a cut a name very
very simple let me do it with a better

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.170
very simple let me do it with a better
 

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:28.420
very simple let me do it with a better
laser pointer if you start from here you

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:28.430
laser pointer if you start from here you
 

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.329
laser pointer if you start from here you
will connect this point to that point

00:12:30.329 --> 00:12:30.339

point and you have a catenin and so we

00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:36.199
point and you have a catenin and so we
 

00:12:36.199 --> 00:12:40.059
point and you have a catenin and so we
decided to in a way to stop Mijares in

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:40.069
decided to in a way to stop Mijares in
 

00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:43.090
decided to in a way to stop Mijares in
organic photochemistry and we jumped

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:43.100
organic photochemistry and we jumped
 

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.420
organic photochemistry and we jumped
towards organic synthesis and towards

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:46.430
towards organic synthesis and towards
 

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.540
towards organic synthesis and towards
the making of katha names and I think

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:49.550
the making of katha names and I think
 

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:53.590
the making of katha names and I think
the the main requirement was to be

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600
the the main requirement was to be
 

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.069
the the main requirement was to be
experimental II able to jump from in

00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079
experimental II able to jump from in
 

00:12:57.079 --> 00:12:59.350
experimental II able to jump from in
organic photochemistry to organic

00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360
organic photochemistry to organic
 

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.769
organic photochemistry to organic
synthesis and at the time I had a very

00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:02.779
synthesis and at the time I had a very
 

00:13:02.779 --> 00:13:06.550

and this very good friend was a CNS

00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:09.529
and this very good friend was a CNS
 

00:13:09.529 --> 00:13:13.269
and this very good friend was a CNS
researcher in another group and she

00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279
researcher in another group and she
 

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:16.290
researcher in another group and she
decided to come and work with me so

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:16.300
decided to come and work with me so
 

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.819
decided to come and work with me so
basically we started the the group

00:13:18.819 --> 00:13:18.829
basically we started the the group
 

00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:20.450
basically we started the the group
almost together

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:20.460
almost together
 

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.910
almost together

could be done so we published the first

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:33.780
could be done so we published the first
 

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:41.810
could be done so we published the first
paper in 1983 it's here 1983 in a let's

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:41.820
paper in 1983 it's here 1983 in a let's

say with an oblique good quality journal

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:44.970
say with an oblique good quality journal
 

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.990
say with an oblique good quality journal
but not a top journal not a high-impact

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000
but not a top journal not a high-impact
 

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.600
but not a top journal not a high-impact
journal and we published it in French

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:52.610
journal and we published it in French
 

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.870
journal and we published it in French
that could be surprising we published it

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880
that could be surprising we published it
 

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.910
that could be surprising we published it
in French because we had a feeling that

00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920
in French because we had a feeling that
 

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.060
in French because we had a feeling that
it was a perhaps it will become an

it was a perhaps it will become an
 

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:07.070
it was a perhaps it will become an
important paper I mean it's pretty easy

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:07.080
important paper I mean it's pretty easy
 

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.440
important paper I mean it's pretty easy
to understand what it means you know new

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:09.450
to understand what it means you know new
 

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.780
to understand what it means you know new
very familiar molecule the molecule they

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:11.790
very familiar molecule the molecule they
 

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.110
very familiar molecule the molecule they
made material catenin do I need to

translate so that was the very first

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:20.190
translate so that was the very first
 

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.390
translate so that was the very first
paper and I will now explain you a

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:23.400
paper and I will now explain you a
 

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.840
paper and I will now explain you a
little bit more in detail how we we

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:26.850
little bit more in detail how we we
 

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:31.400
little bit more in detail how we we
proceeded so we you know after this

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:31.410
proceeded so we you know after this
 

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.640
proceeded so we you know after this
first paper this first paper we really

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:34.650
first paper this first paper we really
 

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:38.920
first paper this first paper we really
generalize the concepts which we call a

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:38.930
generalize the concepts which we call a
 

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:43.130
generalize the concepts which we call a
transition metal templated principle so

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:43.140
transition metal templated principle so
 

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.850
transition metal templated principle so
we will use a transition metal as let's

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860
we will use a transition metal as let's
 

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.240
we will use a transition metal as let's
say the the template in species able to

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:50.250
say the the template in species able to
 

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.450
say the the template in species able to
gather various organic farm ins to

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:53.460
gather various organic farm ins to
 

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.300
gather various organic farm ins to
orient them in a three-dimensional space

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:56.310
orient them in a three-dimensional space
 

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.470
orient them in a three-dimensional space
and to maintain them in a given geometry

00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.480
and to maintain them in a given geometry
 

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.540
and to maintain them in a given geometry
so it's quite easy here we start from

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:02.550
so it's quite easy here we start from
 

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.690
so it's quite easy here we start from
the transition metal centre we have two

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:05.700
the transition metal centre we have two
 

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.600
the transition metal centre we have two
organic farm ins able to interact with

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:08.610
organic farm ins able to interact with
 

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.200
organic farm ins able to interact with
the metal we generate what we used to

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:12.210
the metal we generate what we used to
 

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.320
the metal we generate what we used to
call the end to iron structure we make a

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:15.330
call the end to iron structure we make a
 

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.380
call the end to iron structure we make a
ring here we make a ring here and of

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:18.390
ring here we make a ring here and of
 

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.930
ring here we make a ring here and of
course at the end of the day we obtain a

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:20.940
course at the end of the day we obtain a
 

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.770
course at the end of the day we obtain a
cattle name very very simple we could

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:24.780
cattle name very very simple we could
 

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.220
cattle name very very simple we could
also be a little bit more sophisticated

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:27.230
also be a little bit more sophisticated
 

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.390
also be a little bit more sophisticated
we start from a ring which contains a

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:31.400
we start from a ring which contains a
 

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.260
we start from a ring which contains a
coordinating fragment

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:33.270
coordinating fragment
 

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.790
coordinating fragment
here we mix with the transition metal

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800
here we mix with the transition metal
 

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.750
here we mix with the transition metal
the open chain fragment which is able to

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:41.760
the open chain fragment which is able to
 

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.750
the open chain fragment which is able to
interact with the metal and so we will

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760
interact with the metal and so we will
 

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.530
interact with the metal and so we will
obtain this assembly and finally we make

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:48.540
obtain this assembly and finally we make
 

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.920
obtain this assembly and finally we make
a ring from here to here using a GG

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:51.930
a ring from here to here using a GG
 

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.740
a ring from here to here using a GG
fragment and we used to call that the

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:54.750
fragment and we used to call that the
 

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.460
fragment and we used to call that the

like I think nowadays we will see the
 

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:06.170
like I think nowadays we will see the
assembling and unthreading strategy just

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.180
assembling and unthreading strategy just
 

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:10.220
assembling and unthreading strategy just
a brief look at the molecules so we

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:10.230
a brief look at the molecules so we
 

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.910
a brief look at the molecules so we
start from the molecule a very simple

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920
start from the molecule a very simple
 

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.690
start from the molecule a very simple

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840
many times as you like in silico but
 

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.320

to talk about molecular muscles but let

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:26.980
to talk about molecular muscles but let
 

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.570
to talk about molecular muscles but let
me just show you the principle so we

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:30.580
me just show you the principle so we
 

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.990
me just show you the principle so we
wanted to make a molecular system which

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000
wanted to make a molecular system which
 

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.050
wanted to make a molecular system which
is reminiscent of molecular muscles in

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:37.060
is reminiscent of molecular muscles in
 

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:42.390
is reminiscent of molecular muscles in
the sense that contracting or elongating

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:42.400
the sense that contracting or elongating
 

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.160
the sense that contracting or elongating
molecular muscles means gliding

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:46.170
molecular muscles means gliding
 

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:48.780
molecular muscles means gliding
filaments so you have filaments will

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:48.790
filaments so you have filaments will
 

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:52.560
filaments so you have filaments will
which glide along one another so you

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:52.570
which glide along one another so you
 

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:56.810
which glide along one another so you
have the relaxed form of the muscle here

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820
have the relaxed form of the muscle here
 

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.970
have the relaxed form of the muscle here
the contracted form of the muscle and

00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:58.980
the contracted form of the muscle and
 

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.400
the contracted form of the muscle and
you see that those filaments simply

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:01.410
you see that those filaments simply
 

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:06.830
you see that those filaments simply
glide and what we did was to design and

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840
glide and what we did was to design and
 

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.050
glide and what we did was to design and
make a molecule it was a relatively

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:09.060
make a molecule it was a relatively
 

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.110
make a molecule it was a relatively
complex complicated molecule we made a

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120
complex complicated molecule we made a
 

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:17.180
complex complicated molecule we made a
molecule with behaved in exactly the

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:17.190
molecule with behaved in exactly the
 

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:22.420
molecule with behaved in exactly the
same way this is a hot taxane dimer and

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:22.430
same way this is a hot taxane dimer and
 

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.190
same way this is a hot taxane dimer and
what we could show is that we can

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200
what we could show is that we can
 

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.240
what we could show is that we can
contract it and we send another signal

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:29.250
contract it and we send another signal
 

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:32.080
contract it and we send another signal
to the molecule we can elongate it and

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:32.090
to the molecule we can elongate it and
 

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.640
to the molecule we can elongate it and
contract it and this can be done you

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:34.650
contract it and this can be done you
 

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:38.960
