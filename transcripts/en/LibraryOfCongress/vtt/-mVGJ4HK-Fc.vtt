00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.030
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.330
&gt;&gt; Al Weisner: [Background
noise] I think you're very,

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.800
very lucky today, to
have Shannon here.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.260 position:56%
She's written over 20 books, many
of them New York Times best-sellers.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.010
She's written about 3 or
4 books on, for adults.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.730
You might ask her about, her small
plastic pig pet when she comes

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.520
up here for questions and answers,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.830
and her family that
lives in Salt Lake.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.450
So Shannon, thank you
for being here.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.660
&gt;&gt; Shannon Hale: Thank you so much.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.170
Hi everybody.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.620
I'm Tweeting this so
I need pictures.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.920
Everybody wave, yay.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.220
Oh, on this side wave, yay.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.310
Oh what a great, this
is an awesome festival.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.750
I was up in the, author
pavilion which is

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.380
like a perk of being an author.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.150
Because you get to go
into the secret room.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.940
And there's like Kareem
Abdul,-Jabbar and Ken Burns

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.270
and [inaudible] and I'm like yeah,
no big deal, These are my peers.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.590
We totally hung out, a few tables
away from each other but still,

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.570 position:56%
the same room, oh, I went, too fast.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.800
Oh you see cute picture?

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.340
Who is that?

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.940
Oh my God, you're like so
adorable, look at that little face.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.280
My mom told me that was making
up stories before I could talk.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.510
She said I'd sit in my
highchair, for hours on end going.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:38.190
[baby talk]

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.550
Your first question is why were you
in your highchair for hours, right?

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.890
I was a third child.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.650
But I kept telling
stories, and as I got older,

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.560
before I could write stories,
down I would draw pictures.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.410
Did you know that pictures is
just another form of storytelling?

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.480
So before I could write, this is
in kindergarten, I told a story

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.600
about a witch with
long green fingernails.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.020
And she ate children.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.920
But look at her smile.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.900
She's fulfilled in her work
and you have to respect that.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.630
As I got older, I found other ways

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.650
to tell stories, I
loved doing theater.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.570
I would do little plays with
my brothers and sisters,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.270 position:56%
and act out stories with my friends.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.240
And then when I got into
fourth grade, there we are,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.390
any children of the 80s in here?

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.280
Feathered, feathered bangs.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.570
I had a teacher who started us
writing poems and short stories.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.400
And I suddenly realized,
that you could do that.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.820 position:56%
That all those books in the library,
had, someone had written those.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.370
And I think I'd thought that,
that all writers were dead

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.560 position:56%
or like long extinct like dinosaurs.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.530 position:56%
I didn't know, until I started
writing, that maybe they were alive.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.450
When I was little we
didn't get to meet writers,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.940
we didn't have access to writers.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.180
So that was a huge revelation
for me and I decided right then,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.160
I wanted to be a writer
when I grew up.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.040
And it took a lot longer
than I thought.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.040
I was 10 years old when I
decided I wanted to be a writer.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.830
Any guesses how many more years

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.110
after that I got my
first book published?

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.410
What do you think?

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.710
3? Someone said.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.180
It was 19 years, and
that's not unusual

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.760
but it felt like forever for me.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.030
But in that time I
read thousands of books

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.120
which is the most important part
of becoming a writer is reading

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.520
and knowing what's out there.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.830
And absorbing how stories work.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.510
And I'd taken many writing classes.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.810
I decided that you needed

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.930
to do something 100 times
before you can do it well.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.290
So I wrote 100 stories, I threw
them away, and then I thought,

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.570
I'm finally ready to
be a real writer.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.400 position:56%
By the time I was in graduate school
I felt like I'd written some stuff

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.500
that was finally worth publishing.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.690
I started sending my book and
some short stories out to see

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.330
if anyone wanted to publish them.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.150
Which means, put them into book
form and have them in libraries,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.960
and bookstores where
people can get them.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.540
I waited to hear back, I got
the first response in the mail.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.010
I opened up the letter, and
what do you think it said?

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.310
No? It said no?

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.880
All right, but I wasn't
going to quit right?

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:21.160
So I sent it out again, I
waited to hear back again,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.330
I got a second response, I open it
up, what did it you say this time?

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.960
No? You, there are so
many people who are

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.900
like we know how the world works.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.870
There's like a 5 year-old
like, it says no, come on.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.210
Again, and again, and
again, I got no, no, no.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.510
Can I have a helper?

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.810
Would you help me?

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.900
No? Right here, who
wants to help me?

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.430
You want to help me?

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.730
Come here.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.070
She's like I'm not, she's smart,
she's like I'm not committing

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.910
to anything without a full
explanation beforehand.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.210
Here, come up on stage.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.340
I laminated into a role, some
of the rejection letters I got,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.320
before I ever got an acceptance.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.620
Stay back there, okay sweetheart?

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.920
Oh, you're adorable.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.420
Okay now grab that end,
it's kind of slippery.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.850
Keep pulling it out and then
when you get to the end,

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.150
hold it real tight and
we'll hold it up for them.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.580
Wow, you are doing a great
job, it's actually really hard

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.880
to do this slippery thing.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.180
So day after day, week
after week, year after year,

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.480
rejection after rejection,
after rejection,

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.780
telling me I was not good enough.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.080
It's kind of like getting letters,
every week from New York saying,

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.380
dear Shannon, you stink,
love the editors.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.680
And the next one's
like dear Shannon,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.980
you still stink, love the editors.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.330
Dear Shannon, you stink so bad
we can smell you all the way

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.300
from New York City,
love the editors.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.200
And there was just no guarantee it
was ever going to stop, you got it?

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.020
Okay, hold it tight, I'm
just going to pull it

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.880
out so that everybody can see.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.260
There we go.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.350
Thank you, sweetheart,
you did such a great job,

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.740
you can go back down now.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.250
But let me just give you
a little thank you, mask.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.650
You can give her a little
hand, isn't she wonderful?

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.180
Fearless. Eventually it
did stop, the hard thing

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.540
with rejection is you don't
know that it's going to stop.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.050
And it takes a lot
of faith and maybe,

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.000
a lot of tears and a lot of pain.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.300
And I didn't give up and
sometimes I don't why I didn't.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.500
When everybody's telling
you you're not good enough,

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.880
it's, I wanted to give up.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.800
But I couldn't bear the thought,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.060
of someday looking back
and thinking what if.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.330
It's a horrible feeling.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.720
So I did keep going and
eventually, somebody said yes.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.370 position:56%
The first thing I ever got
published was called The Goose Girl,

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.690
everybody, oh, thank you.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.010
Well, that's it I'm
out thanks folks.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.590
The Goose Girl was
rejected by everybody.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.930
And eventually a small publisher,

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.280
published it as the second book
they'd ever published in the U.S.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.840
And it went on to, be voted by
teens across the U.S. as one

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.600
of their top 10 favorite books
and recently was voted as one

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.670
of their top 100 best books
of all time for teens.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:55.920 position:56%
So all those people who said it
wasn't good enough, were they right?

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.220
Yes, they were.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.340 position:56%
Because although of course they were
wrong to say I wasn't good enough

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.280
for anybody, it wasn't
right for them.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.940
And that's what rejection
has taught me.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.470
Is it's not that you're
worthless, when you're rejected,

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.150
it's just, it's this is not right.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.780
This person, this circumstance,
this time, this is not right.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.250
It's not that you're not right,
this circumstance is not right.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.130
And we keep going and
eventually, we find a home.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.430
I published a few more books,

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.010
Princess Academy, thanks
folks, I'm out.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.560
I need to leave when
there's applause,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.120
you got to end on a high note.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.800 position:56%
There's some new covers for that but
anyway, Ever After High is a series

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.960
that I did that was a lot of fun.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.700 position:56%
In our family, we love super heroes,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.460
and I've told a lot
of super hero stories.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:49.070
This is my husband's son, Batman
and Robin, that's to scale.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.680
Here's my daughter, Wonder Woman.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.950
One thing having kids showed me is

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.010
that a kid is not just
one thing, right?

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.310
You're complicated.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.550
You've got a lot of sides to
you, you could be Wonder Woman,

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.840
you can be a princess, you can be
a fairy, you can be Spider Girl.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.500
You can be a pirate,
you can be a tiger,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.110
you can be a warrior,
all wrapped into one.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.520
And my husband and I wanted to
write a story that expressed that.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.290
That someone can be more
than just one thing.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:22.820
And we came up with the
Princess in Black, so, yay.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.800
So Princess in Black, so she's
Princess Magnolia by day,

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.170
and the Princess in Black
whenever monsters invade.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.270
This came about, one day my
daughter, who was 4 at the time,

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.750
was wearing this butterfly
skirt, and she was pointing

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.290
to different colors on it.

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:40.740
And she said, pink is a girl
color, and purple's a girl color,

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.980
and yellow's a girl
color, but not black.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.050
And I was like, what?

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.190
Girls can wear black, why do
colors have genders anyway?

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.780
It doesn't make any sense.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.090
Like, did you know 100 years ago
boys wore pink and girls wore blue?

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.340
It just doesn't make any
sense, how this happened.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.020
But I was like girls can
wear black, I wear black.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.510 position:56%
And she's like, yeah, because you're
not really a girl, you're a mama.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.550
I was like all right.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.400
But Bat Girl wears black, ah huh.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.410
I thought I had her.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.200
But she said mama,
princesses don't wear black.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.330
It's like woah, it was
one of those moments,

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.750
I couldn't stop thinking
about it all day.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.350
When my husband came home from
work, I was like the Princess

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.010
in Black and he's like yes.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.580
And so we started writing it.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.530
And I am going to, we've
done 3 books so far,

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.080
we've got the fourth
coming out in November.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.190
The Princess in Black,
the Princess in Black,

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:35.490
in the second one has a birthday
party and these are her, friends,

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.430
12 princesses come to her party.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.100
They're all named after
flowers like Princess Bluebell

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.780
and Princess Apple Blossom.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.300
The one on the top left,
is Princess Sneezewort,

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.670
and the illustrator Lay-Win Fam
based her on her own young self,

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.820
with awkward self-cut
bangs and huge glasses.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.290
She's my favorite.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:59.040
The newest one is called
the Princess in Black,

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.240
and the Hungry Bunny Hoard.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.060
And I'm going to read you
an abbreviated version

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.430
of the first few chapters.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:10.250
Princess Magnolia and her
unicorn Frimplepants rode toward

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.550
the village.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.110
Princess Sneezewort had
invited them to brunch.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.550
In anticipation, Frimplepants
had skipped breakfast.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.650
The café was so close, the smell
of hot bread rode the breeze,

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.490
Frimplepants began to prance.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:29.420 position:56%
And then Princess Magnolia's glitter
stone ring rang, the monster alarm.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.670
No time to go back to
the castle Frimplepants,

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.970
Princess Magnolia whispered.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.680
To the secret cave.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.320
His tummy grumbled, Frimplepants
hoped it would be a quick battle.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.610
Princess Magnolia and Frimplepants
rode into the secret cave

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.230
when they came out the other
side, they had become the Princess

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:50.660
in Black and her pony,
does anybody know?

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.960
What's his name?

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.260
Blackie, yay.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.050
Blackie reared on his hind
legs, look out monsters,

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:02.130
never get between a hungry pony
and an especially good brunch.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.450
Duff the goat boy was running
toward them, help, he yelled,

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.580
there are hundreds of them, it's
the worst monster invasion ever.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.530
Fly Blackie, fly, said
the Princess in Black.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.900
Blackie did not fly, but
he did run very fast.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.410 position:56%
They galloped into the goat pasture,

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.880
the Princess in Black back
flipped off the saddle,

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.910
the Princess in Black raised
her fists in battle pose.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:31.270
And then, the Princess in Black
grinned, bunnies, she said.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.150
When Duff the goat boy caught up,

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.410
the Princess in Black
was not battling beasts.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:39.160
The Princess in Black was making
kissy faces, that was not right.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.260
The Princess in Black
always fought the monsters

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.630
that threatened his goats.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.590
Never had she pet the monsters,

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.520
never had she made
kissy faces at them.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.820
Where are the monsters?

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.180
Asked the Princess in Black.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.010 position:56%
Duff was out of breath from running.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.180
He pointed at the ground, where?

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.920
Asked the Princess in Black.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.330
Duff pointed some more, there
were a lot of bunnies to point at.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.020
But I don't see anything
besides these bunnies, she said.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:07.140
The bunnies, are the
monsters, said Duff.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.060
The Princess in Black laughed,
bunnies aren't monsters.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.290
But they came from
Monster Land, said Duff,

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.690
they hopped out of the hole and
they're eating my goat's grass.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.930 position:56%
Oh Duff, said the Princess in Black,

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:23.430
they're cute little bunnies,
what harm could they do?

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:29.220
Down in Monster Land, the bunnies
had been bored, bored and hungry.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.730
They had enjoyed monster fur,
they had snacked on rock chips,

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:36.010
they had dined on toenail
clippings and lizard scales,

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.960
and still, they were hungry.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.690
There was a hole in the
ceiling of Monster Land,

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.460
an interesting smell trickled down,

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:49.090
one brave bunny had poked
its head through the hole.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.620
Grass, an ocean of green grass.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.120
I must taste it, said the bunny.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.730
The bunny munched some
grass, this is yum, it said.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.330
I should tell the others.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.160
It told the others and
soon, hundreds of bunnies

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.380
that hopped up to the goat pasture.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.490
Blackie's stomach squeaked
with a hunger,

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.970
those bunnies sure seem
to relish the grass.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.760
And Blackie wondered if it
were especially delicious.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.670
Blackie closed his eyes, he
imagined the grass would be

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.120
as delicious as brunch.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.210
He opened his mouth wide and
bit, he sputtered and coughed,

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.870
it hadn't tasted like doughnuts.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:31.460
It hadn't even tasted like grass,
Blackie had a mouthful of dirt.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.730
The bunnies had devoured
the entire patch of grass.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.630
And it looked like one was
nibbling on the end of his tail.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.480
Blackie switched his tail,
the bunny did not let go.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.670
Blackie pranced about,
the bunny did not let go.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.810
Blackie sat down, on his
tail, the bunny let go.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.180
The bunny crawled away.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:54.140
Just then a clawed paw
reached out of the hole,

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.010
the first paw was followed
by 8 more.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.760
A massive drooling 9
armed monster emerged,

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.160
it stood on its many hind legs.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.230
It opened its jaws, it said, roar.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:12.070
The bunnies stopped eating,
they looked at the monster.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:16.530
Ro, the monster started,
but it had seen the bunnies.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.630
Its eyes widened, the
bunnies noses wiggled.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:24.690
The 9 armed monster
dived back into the hole,

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.690
the bunnies resumed eating.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.340
Did you see, said Duff.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:32.590
That massive drooling 9 armed
monster was scared of the bunnies.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:37.360 position:56%
That's impossible, said the Princess
in Black, bunnies aren't scary.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.340
She pet the bunny on her lap,

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:43.710
but instead of one
bunny, now there were 3.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.010
Bom, bom bom.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.820
I'm going to stop there.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.220
What is going to happen next?

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.800
Oh my goodness.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.470
What's going to happen
with the bunnies?

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:59.790
Now some of you might be
interested in writing,

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.490
stories about super heroes.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.450
Can I have 3 volunteers come up?

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.810
Would you like to come up?

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.110
Yeah, come on up.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.410
Oh, both of you can come.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.690
How about right over
there in the, red shirt?

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.240
Yeah? Come on up.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.540
&gt;&gt; Me?

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, come on up sir.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.720
Here we go.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.660
You know what I have one more,
so why don't you come too, okay?

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.010
All right, here we go.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:28.140
I'm going to put on my
special Princess in Black mask.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.880
It's still me, it's still Shannon.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.180
I know for a second you were

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.480
like wait a minute
who's the masked person?

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.570
It was me, don't get confused.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.860
All right, now when
I write a super hero,

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.280
one thing I like to start with,
with the Princess in Black,

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.320
we chose somebody that no one
would ever suspect was secretly a

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.620
super hero.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.990 position:56%
So I want you all, you all can do
this in your heads, but up here too,

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.420 position:56%
you're going to tell us, your ideas.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:56.520
And, if you can't think of
one right away I can help you.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.330
But, because we got to be fast.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.400 position:56%
So first of all, I want you to think
of someone no one would suspect

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.800 position:56%
of secretly being a super hero, like
a princess in a fluffy pink dress.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.180
Or, the lunch lady, or your mom,
or your pet, or someone real

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.660
or someone made up,
it could be anything.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.710
All right, who are
you going to choose?

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.120
&gt;&gt; My fishy.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.800
&gt;&gt; Your fishy, what's
your fish's name?

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.100
&gt;&gt; Fishy.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.400
&gt;&gt; Fishy, all right.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.700
And who are you going to?

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.000
&gt;&gt; Lunch lady.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.290
&gt;&gt; Lunch lady, awesome, and
who are you going to choose?

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:31.890
&gt;&gt; The, Cinderella's step-mom.

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.860
&gt;&gt; Cinderella's step-mom.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.260
Who are you going to choose?

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.560
&gt;&gt; Raven Queen.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.980
&gt;&gt; Raven Queen, okay.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.100
These are people no one suspects
as secretly a super hero.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.460
Now like the Princess in Black,
she's got a super hero name, right?

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.790
Her secret identity
is Princess Magnolia.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.070
But then when she,
when there's trouble,

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.700
she puts on her super hero
outfit and has a new name.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.700
What is Fishy's super hero name?

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.110
&gt;&gt; Ultimate fishy.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.850
&gt;&gt; Ultimate Fishy.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.090
Oh my gosh, are you dying?

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.500
So, the lunch lady right?

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.630
What's the lunch lady's
super hero name?

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:07.930
&gt;&gt; Super Lunch Lady.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.980
&gt;&gt; Super Lunch Lady.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.240
Now Cinderella's step-mom,
what's her super hero name?

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.540
&gt;&gt; Blackie.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.840
&gt;&gt; Blackie.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.230
And Raven Queen, what's
her super hero name?

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.530
&gt;&gt; Midnight.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:20.830
&gt;&gt; Midnight, great.

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:25.000
Now think about what your super
hero's special skills are.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.130
Princess' Black is kind of like
a Batman or Zorro, she's got,

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.910
kind of like ninja fighting skills.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.560
What is the Flash's super power?

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.860
Really fast, right?

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.230
What is Superman's super power?

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:38.530
&gt;&gt; Laser eyes.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.470
&gt;&gt; He's go laser eyes and
he's strong and he flies, oh,

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.980
he's so full of himself, really.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.870
Enough already with
the powers, okay.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.720
So you guys think, what are,
what's your super hero's powers,

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.450
what is Ultimate Fishy's powers?

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.920
&gt;&gt; Ultimate camouflage
and laser eyes.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.000
&gt;&gt; Ultimate camouflage
and laser eyes.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.240
Obviously, okay Super Lunch Lady,

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.290
what's Super Lunch
Lady's super powers?

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.190
&gt;&gt; She has lunch related
like weapons.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.420
&gt;&gt; Lunch related weapons.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.550
Absolutely, that is fantastic, yes.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.610
And, how about, what was it?

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.780
Blackie, Blackie's super powers?

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:24.810
&gt;&gt; A lot of knives and
really sharp things.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:27.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; A lot of knives and sharp things.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.330
Ninja with lots of sharp things.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.630
You would stay away

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.640
from Cinderella's step-mother,
with lots of knives.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.530
All right, and Midnight, what
is Midnight's super powers?

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:43.680
&gt;&gt; She'd be able to do
gymnastics, but like a ninja,

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.710
and she'd use the powers
that she has.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.970
&gt;&gt; Yes, so she's got magic powers
and she can also fight like a ninja

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.000
and do gymnastics, awesome.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.370
So one more thing that you need.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.950
Do you know the word nemesis?

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.800
Nemesis is like somebody's
number one enemy.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.630
When you think of Batman,
who's his nemesis?

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.480
What do you think?

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.780
&gt;&gt; Joker.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.080
&gt;&gt; Joker, great.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.910
So think of your character's
number one enemy,

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.880
who is Ultimate Fishy's nemesis?

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.180
&gt;&gt; Batman.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.480
&gt;&gt; Batman?

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:22.440
Batman. In this world
Batman is a villain,

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:27.620
is always trying to
stop Ultimate Fishy.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:32.100 position:56%
All right how about Lunch Lady's,
Super Lunch Lady's ultimate nemesis?

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.310
&gt;&gt; A gigantic robot school bus.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.940
&gt;&gt; A gigantic robot school bus.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.890
All right, and let's see it
was the, Cinderella's step-mom

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.920
when she's super hero,
what's her nemesis?

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.520
&gt;&gt; Her real daughter.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.450
&gt;&gt; Her real daughters,
she's always battling.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:53.570
And then, Midnight, what
is, who's her nemesis?

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.870
&gt;&gt; Her mom.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.890
&gt;&gt; Her mom, oh, awesome.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.490
Let me give you guys special
super hero masks, no one will know

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.950
who you are, and you
can save the day.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.250
&gt;&gt; Can we keep it?

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.550
&gt;&gt; You can keep it, yeah.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:05.850
Thank you, give them a
hand, you're awesome.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.620
You guys can go back
down now, good job.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.420
You can go back down the
stairs, good job, thank you.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.540
All right we've got
a few more minutes,

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.260
did anybody have any
questions for me?

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.220
Is there a special microphone or
something that travels around?

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.350
Oh right here on both
sides are microphones,

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.470
if you want to ask me a question.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.770
Do you want to go over
to the microphone

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.520
so everybody can hear
you, Yeah, right there.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.520
&gt;&gt; Hi, I know that you
write a lot of series,

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.270 position:56%
like the Princess Academy, and the
new ones, how do you make the books,

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.170
keep, like your readers
will keep reading them,

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.760
like plot form [inaudible].

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.920
Like every other series
that have been written?

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.520
&gt;&gt; You're so sweet.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.570 position:56%
So, what I personally do, is I think

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.630
of every book as standing
on its own.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.510
I actually don't plot out whole
series, I have vague ideas,

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:53.670
but I want any book and any series,

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.360
that if that's the only book you
read, it would still be a good read

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.550
and have a beginning
and middle and an end.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.980
So I think about books
as one at a time.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.690
I don't know if that's
what it is or not but.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:07.370
Oh, I almost tripped on
something, yes right here.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:11.820
&gt;&gt; Why did you name
Mary after a flower?

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.980
&gt;&gt; Yes, so In Princess Academy
the main character's name is Mary,

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.560
and I said it was named
after a mountain flower.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.430
And I totally made that up.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.760
There's no Mary flower.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.990
Though maybe if there's
anybody in botanist in her,

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.690
and you discover a flower
someday you could name it Mary

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.380
and that it would be for real.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.760
I just like the word, yeah.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.750
&gt;&gt; Hi, as someone who plans
to study creative writing

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.040
and foreign languages in college,
I was wondering what inspired you

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.440
to base the magic system in
The Goose Girl on languages?

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.740
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.670
So The Goose Girl, my first novel,

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.290
was based on a Grimm's
Brother Fairy tale.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.960
And it was my favorite
fairy tale growing up.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.400
But partly because it left
me asking a lot of questions.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.080
In the fairy tale, there's stuff
that's just never explained.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.500
Fairy tales are so
brief and fragmented.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:05.220
And, so, she had this power over
wind and she had a talking horse.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.730
And how these things
worked never was explained.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.410
So in exploring, when
I'm writing a novel,

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.110
you want the magic
system to make sense.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.490
I want it to feel plausible
and real.

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:19.110
So I explored the idea of, language
since the horse could speak.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.540
What if everything has a language?

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.980
What if wind had a language?

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.190
And if you learned the language
of the wind, you would control it,

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.610
fire and water, and trees and
everything else came out of that.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.580
So that was the kernel, thank you.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:32.970
Right here.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:34.950
&gt;&gt; What would your secret power be?

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.600
&gt;&gt; What would my secret power be?

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.490
Well, it wouldn't be so
secret if I told you.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:46.570
I have 4 kids, so I
personally would like, like,

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.670
like Elastigirl, you know.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.490
Where you can just like, reach
and like grab and stop a child

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:55.120 position:56%
from falling off a banister and make
dinner at the same time, you know.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.660
That's what I would
do, is that boring?

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.450
No, come on, I would fly, right?

00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:59.750
Who wouldn't fly?

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.050
Yeah.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.090
&gt;&gt; Are you planning
any young adult books?

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:07.140
&gt;&gt; I am. I write for every
age group from The Princess

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.760
in Black up through adult.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.290
And in February, the
next book I have coming

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:12.870
out is called Squirrel Girl.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.670
It's based on the Marvel
super hero Squirrel Girl.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.960
Yes, got some [inaudible].

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.730
She's fabulous, she has
the proportional strength

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.410
and agility of a squirrel.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.560
She speaks squirrel language,
and she's unbeatable.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:31.070
She has beat every, [inaudible]
a Marvel villain including,

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.310
Galactus and Thanos and Dr. Doom.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.250
And she's hysterical,
she's so funny.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.400
I can't wait for it.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.020
Since we have a sign language
interpreter, I too want to add

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.020
that one of the main
characters in the story is deaf.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:49.230
And we have a really, a wonderful
beta reader for Squirrel Girl

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:53.200
who is deaf, developed a Squirrel
Girl name sign name for us.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.070
Can I teach it to you?

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:56.580
So I'll teach it to everybody.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.490
Take your non-dominant hand,
and make the S with it.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.100
Take your dominant hand, so if
you're right handed for example,

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:07.150
and make the G. And then coming
off the S, you do the swoop

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.810
of a squirrel tail with the
G, and that's Squirrel Girl.

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:12.460
Isn't that awesome?

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.760
I love that.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.440
All right, right over here.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.840
&gt;&gt; When is the new Princess
in Black book coming out?

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:23.310
It is coming out in,
November, number 4,

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:24.860
Princess in Black takes a vacation.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.520
And I bet you can guess that
the vacation doesn't go quite

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.820
as planned.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.120
Yes?

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.770
&gt;&gt; How did you think of the
characters in your books?

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.490
&gt;&gt; Just in all of them or do
you have a specific book you're

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.110
thinking about?

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.410
&gt;&gt; More like Ever After High.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:45.680
&gt;&gt; Okay. So Ever After
High, actually was unusual

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.460
because Mattel had
created this line of toys.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.590
And they were going to
make shows and they came

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.570
to me before it was released,
it was so secret I had to sign

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:55.870
on disclosure agreements.

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.600
We had to use code
names, it was crazy,

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.870
they flew me out to Mattel
headquarters in California,

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:02.820
it was this big building
with no windows.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.890 position:56%
We went down like secret passageways
that had all of these like,

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:07.190
codes to get in [inaudible].

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:10.140
And when I saw the dolls
they were underneath a shroud

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.890
and I could only like
peek under them.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.120
It was like, I felt like a spy.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.950 position:56%
Anyway, so they actually created
those characters and then, I came in

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.630
and wrote the first book,
and we had such a great time.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:24.910 position:56%
I ended up writing 4 books for that,
but, in that case I didn't actually,

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:28.270
I helped, I helped flush out
the characters, probably,

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.850
but they had the initial
names and ideas.

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:32.150
Right over here.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:34.690
&gt;&gt; How many super heroes
have you made?

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.450
&gt;&gt; How many super heroes
have I made?

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.200
I personally consider
every book I've written

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.220
as being a super hero story.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.520
That's kind of my secret.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.670
They all feel like
super heroes to me.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:48.030
But I would, I guess, the Princess
in Black, the Squirrel Girl,

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.330
I'm going to write a
Captain Marvel novel,

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.090 position:56%
those would be my true super heroes.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.880
I wrote a young and old
book called Dangerous

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.980
which was my super hero
science fiction novel.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.280
So, I don't know, a few dozen.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.580
I'm really good at math.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.880
Yes, right here.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.980
&gt;&gt; Why'd you name all of the
princesses after flowers?

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:09.410
&gt;&gt; Oh, so Princess Magnolia,
is named after a flower

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.960
because she's named after my
daughter whose name is Magnolia.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.590
And then when we had 12 more
princesses we thought it would be

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.580
fun to continue that theme.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.270
And I just love flower names.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:20.570
Yes?

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.820
&gt;&gt; What is Princess Academy about?

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.870
&gt;&gt; Princess Academy is about a
village, at the top of a mountain,

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.150
and the way they make a living is
they query stone, they cut blocks

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:31.500
of stone out of the mountain.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.830
They're very poor.

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.850
And one day a messenger
from the king comes up

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.770
and says their village has
been chosen as the place

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.970
where the next princess
will come from.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.710
And all of the girls, had
never been to school before,

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:45.440
and they're all sent to a school,
called the Princess Academy

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.930
to learn what they need to
know in case they are chosen.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:51.590
And they are reluctant about this,
they don't trust the low-landers,

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.320
they don't really believe one of
them has to become a princess.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.760 position:56%
But in the process of learning stuff

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.210
at the school, it changes
their life.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.510
Yes, right here.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:02.300
&gt;&gt; How did it make you feel
when you wrote the book?

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.600
&gt;&gt; When I wrote a book?

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you wrote
Princess in Black.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:07.350
&gt;&gt; When I wrote Princess in Black.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.650
It made me feel like this.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.240
Yes, I love it.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.220
The one reason why I keep writing,
even though it's really hard,

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:18.970 position:56%
for me and I make a lot of mistakes,
is there's no feeling in the world

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.660
like finishing a draft or
finishing the whole book

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.300
and feeling great about it.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.450
It's the best feeling.

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:26.750
Yes.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:31.390
&gt;&gt; Hi, what is some advice you
have for young writers or writers

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:33.300
that want to continue
writing in the future?

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.600
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.710 position:56%
My advice would be, read everything.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.970
For people, for everybody, I
would say read what you love,

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.460
for writers, I say read everything.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.820
You need to know, not just the
kind of books that you write

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.770
but everything that's out there.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.890
Write for fun, just write for fun,

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.620
don't worry about publishing
right now,

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.560
don't worry about all
that side of it.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.890
Enjoy the writing time, just
like it takes years for athletes

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.490
to become professional,
or a musician,

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.620
it's the same as developing
writing skills.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.820
So just enjoy it.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.130
Yeah, right here.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:11.630
&gt;&gt; Why did you, put it
on the first book that,

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:18.090
Duff would be helping the Princes
in Black but, it never happened?

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:19.390
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:23.800
So Duff the goat boy, we suggest in
the first book that he might help

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.230
out the Princess in Black and
become his own super hero.

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.750
And it's taken awhile, hasn't it?

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.000
But I might say book 4
might answer your question,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
it comes out in November.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.420
Yeah, right here.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.610
&gt;&gt; How did you get the idea
for Rapunzel's Revenge?

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.930
&gt;&gt; Rapunzel's Revenge
came, my husband,

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.740
I think this is actually our
last question, I'm so sorry,

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.690
but if you find me right
afterwards, I would be happy

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.300
to answer your question
and then I'm going

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.840
to be signing from
3 to 4 down there.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.790
But so, Rapunzel's Revenge was a
graphic novel like a comic book

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.920
that my husband and I wrote.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.300
He was a lifelong comics reader
and I didn't, was not interested

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.610
in comics until I married him.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:07.260
And we thought, how could
bring our two loves together,

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.660
my first love is fairy tales,

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.250
and his first love
was super hero comics.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.140
So we were like what fairy
tale character could we turn

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.130
into a comic book super hero?

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:19.310
And we decided, Rapunzel,
because she's got that long hair.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:22.230
And she, when she's locked up in
her tower, she starts to practice

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.140
with those braids ad use
them as whip and lasso.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.430
And so we set it in the
Old West and she escapes

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:28.790
from the tower and becomes a hero.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.900
So that's how we came
up with that idea.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.260
&gt;&gt; Are you going to make a
book 2, of Rapunzel's Revenge?

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.230
&gt;&gt; We did make a book 2,
today's your lucky day sir.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:40.770
It came out in 2009, it's called
Calamity Jack and it's based

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.900
on her friend who is Jack
from Jack and the Beanstalk.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:53.740
I can't believe how fast 30
minutes went, you guys are awesome.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.750
Thanks so much for my helpers,
thanks for the great questions.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:57.050
&gt;&gt; This has been a
presentation of the Library

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:58.350
of Congress, visit us at loc.gov.
