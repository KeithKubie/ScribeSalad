EVELYN GOSNELL:
OK, show of hands.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.870
Who in the room is working
on a product or an app that

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.600
is designed to improve people's
lives in some way or another?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.070
Hands are up in the room.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.740
If your hand is not up, get out.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.900
Just kidding.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.820
So if that is true,
if we're looking

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.087
to help people improve
their lives in some way,

00:00:24.087 --> 00:00:25.920
then the key question
that we need to answer

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.850
is how do we survive
over the long term?

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.580
How do we increase
long-term engagement

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.250
so that we can better
do this over time?

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.470
And that's what I'm going
to be talking about today,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.140
but I want to start
with a story--

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.250
something that happened to me
recently on a trip to Montreal

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.140
that I think everyone
can relate to.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.795
It speaks to a problem that
everyone in this room has.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.180
The story I want to tell
is about the travel portion

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.262
on a trip to Montreal.

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:55.470
Montreal is a wonderful city.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.790
I highly recommend
it, but that's not

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.960
what I want to talk about.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.170
I want to tell you about
the trip going there.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.970
I happened to check a bag.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.720
I hate doing this.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.310
It's super inefficient.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.680
But I did so because
it was a longer trip.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.836
Checked my bag, take the flight.

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:10.710
The flight's delayed.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.260
By the time we land,
everyone is just--

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.250
we just want our bags.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.190
We just want to
get out of there,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.700
and it's taking forever
for the bags to come out.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.530
What happens then?

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.920
Finally, beep, beep, beep.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.110
We hear the sound that
we all want to hear.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.860
The luggage carousel
is starting-- awesome.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.300
So everyone crowds around.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.140
I'm sure you're
familiar with the scene.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.350
Everyone crowds around
as close as they possibly

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.870
can to the luggage carousel.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.910
Now, there's only so
much room in front

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.110
of that luggage carousel.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.699
Not everyone can be
at the very front.

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:43.740
So if you're one of those
poor souls in the back,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.330
you're sort of
crouching and looking

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.880
behind, in between heads,
and trying to see where

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.380
your luggage is coming out.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.880
Finally, you see it.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.590
And again, you're blocked.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.220
Excuse me, sir.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.005
Sorry, can I get through here?

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:56.880
And you get your luggage,
and you can finally

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.720
get out of there--

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.390
great.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.940
Now, if we think about
this scenario for a second,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.940
we probably all realize it
would be better if we all

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.090
stood back maybe a foot--

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.362
a foot and a half.

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:10.820
That way, there'd be enough
room when your luggage actually

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.660
comes out.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.368
That's the real time
you need to come up.

00:02:13.368 --> 00:02:14.369
There's plenty of space.

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:15.410
You can get your luggage.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.870
You don't bruise and
bump anyone on the way.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.150
And the solution works
better for everyone.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.680
But, individually, if
you think of this idea,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.270
or if I think of this idea,
and you just want to say,

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.480
I'm going to stand back.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.345
What's going to happen?

00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:31.470
You're just going to be
that one chump in the back.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.150
Everyone's going to
crowd in front of you,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.191
and you're not going be
able to see your luggage.

00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:37.990
And we're kind of
at the same place.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.760
But some of you probably
have seen airports

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.530
where their luggage
carousels are designed

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.160
a little bit differently.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.510
They have a white line painted.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.630
Raise your hand if you've
seen this somewhere

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.620
around the world.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.870
There's a white line painted.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.820
And what happens
then is everyone

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.294
stands back a little bit, and
the whole system works better.

00:02:57.294 --> 00:02:58.710
And so this is
what I want to talk

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.080
about today is how do we create
this white line for ourselves

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.040
in our space?

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.350
And what space are we in?

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.570
The attention economy.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.820
Every single one in this room,
whether you like it or not,

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.340
you're battling for
people's attention.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.220
I would say to the
death, but maybe that's

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.800
a little over-dramatic.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.300
So we really all
have to be fighting

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.466
for people's attention, and
there's a limited amount

00:03:24.466 --> 00:03:25.300
of time in the day.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.508
There's a limited amount of
attention that they have,

00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:30.340
and we're all battling each
other for this attention.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.600
And how are we doing that?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.690
What's the main currency
in the attention economy?

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.620
It's notifications--
that is the tool

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.260
that we're using in this
fight for people's attention.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.730
And why are we turning?

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.200
Why are we relying so
heavily on notifications?

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.450
Because we learn very early on--

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.150
a lovely gentleman named
BF Skinner taught us

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.000
about the importance of
random reinforcement.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.392
So we did these
experiments with rats

00:03:57.392 --> 00:03:59.100
where you set it up
so that the rat would

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.650
come up and push a lever.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.420
And when they did that,
food would come out--

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.830
awesome.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.810
What he learned though
is that if you set up

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.360
the lever differently so
that food doesn't come out

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.300
every time but only
some of the time,

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.019
what happens then to the rat?

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.501
Exactly, I see someone
going like this.

00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:21.709
That's exactly what happened.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.320
So the rat pushes
the lever much more

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.680
frequently when it's set up to
give food not all of the time

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.710
but only some of the time.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.610
And I'm sorry to say that we--

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.050
whether we like it or not--

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.720
are much more like rats
than we might want to admit.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.199
Think of a Facebook
notification.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.740
You don't know what
it's going to be.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.090
It could be a like.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.172
It could be a comment.

00:04:47.172 --> 00:04:48.880
If it's a comment, I
got to go figure out

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.755
is it a good comment?

00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:51.010
Is it a bad comment?

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.760
Or it could just be oh,
it's your random Uncle

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.410
Tom that you never talked
to's birthday today.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.700
There's this whole range of
what this notification could be,

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.260
and it's the fact
of not knowing--

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.130
is it going to be a good one?

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.213
Is it going to be bad one?

00:05:04.213 --> 00:05:05.440
Is going to be a neutral one?

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.400
That is what creates this
really, really strong pull

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.570
of notifications.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.630
Now, we know this.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.300
The challenge though for us is
that notifications can be very,

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.014
very problematic in many ways.

00:05:20.014 --> 00:05:21.430
These are unintended
consequences.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.890
I'm not saying that anyone
is meaningfully doing this,

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.080
but there are a lot of areas.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.480
And errors is the first one
as my slide already tells you.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.070
So this is really
well researched.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.010
So, for example,
in terms of errors,

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.220
there's lots of studies that
bring people in and then

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.110
divide them into two groups--

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.820
so random assignment.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.350
Literally, if it
was this room, we

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.300
would take you half
here-- you'd be

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.330
in group A. You half here--
you would be in Group B. We'd

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.310
put you in different
rooms, but then we

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.200
would give you the same task.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.800
Usually, it's a quantitative
sort of math test--

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.140
math assignment that you do.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.230
And let's pick Group
A as the lucky group.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.190
You guys, while you're
doing your math problem,

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.170
we're going to ping
you with notifications

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.460
as you're doing it.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.630
Group B-- sorry, no
notifications for you.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.270
And what happens in
how successfully people

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.980
do this math problem?

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.650
Who thinks they're equal?

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.350
Awesome, everyone's
paying attention.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.320
Who thinks that group
A makes more errors?

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.480
You guys are a
really smart group.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.200
This is true.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.030
So Group A makes many
more errors, actually.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.600
And I'm very struck by this.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.870
Depending on the study,
it's not like 5%, 10%.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.710
It's actually about
double the error rate--

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.832
twice as many errors.

00:06:46.832 --> 00:06:48.790
So I just want to let
that sink in for a second

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.950
and especially think about the
fact that we use this term--

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.692
our users.

00:06:54.692 --> 00:06:56.150
We talk about our
users, and that's

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.730
what we say in the industry.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.920
But I want to pause
on this and say

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.100
our users are real
people, of course.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.620
Our users are our doctors.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.620
They are our teachers.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.180
They're the engineers who
are building our bridges.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.420
Do we want to be setting up a
system where we're potentially

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.420
doubling the error rate
of what they're doing?

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.790
Probably not.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.310
The second area where
notifications can be

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.010
problematic is with time cost.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.670
So specifically,
like switching costs.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.180
So you're doing one thing.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.620
You get a notification.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.370
You look at that.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.160
You open the app.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.826
You kind of get sucked down that
rabbit hole for a little while,

00:07:35.826 --> 00:07:37.800
and you come back to
what you were doing.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.290
So Gloria Mark has
shown us that it

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.920
takes us an average
of 23 minutes

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.350
to refocus on our
original task--

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.270
and that's from
one interruption.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.580
Multiply that out
through the day,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.360
and we think about
what is this total cost

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.720
on human productivity?

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.210
What are all the
amazing things we

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.630
could be doing if we weren't
incurring these switching

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.870
costs?

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.450
And related to this--

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.760
there's also measurable
stress and frustration.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.640
So we can measure
this psychologically,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.970
and that comes from this idea
of, oh, I've got distracted.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.140
And now I have to spend
this mental energy--

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.300
emotional energy refocusing
on what I'm doing.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.070
So what does all of this mean?

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:24.780
Does this mean that
notifications are all bad?

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.960
Probably not.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.640
I also actually do want
to touch on this, the fact

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.870
that we can see--

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.570
I nerded it out for a second and
told you all about the studies

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.669
because I'm a behavioral
scientist, and I do that.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.589
But we can also, even
if I didn't tell you

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:39.630
about the studies, you
probably already know this

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.270
from looking at the media.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.039
The headlines that
we see out there--

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:47.149
"Six Ways to Overcome
Smartphone Addiction," "10

00:08:47.149 --> 00:08:48.690
Tricks for Checking
Your Phone Less."

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.190
I mean these are a dime a dozen.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.160
We see these all the time.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.700
We see this trend of millennials
turning off their social media

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.850
entirely or going on
month-long social media breaks.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:07.210
We also even see it's kind of
funny and sad at the same time

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.210
that there are these
things called digital detox

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.300
retreats where people
literally pay money

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.470
to have their phones
taken away from them.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:16.840
This isn't Silicon Valley.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.380
Is there any shock on that?

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.150
So we see this in the media.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.340
We see this in the
app space even we.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.090
See more and more apps try to
help people deal with the fact

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.130
that there's this sort
of love-hate relationship

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.087
with their phones.

00:09:31.087 --> 00:09:32.920
How can I better
understand how many minutes

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.340
I'm spending on my phone?

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.330
How can I not let it
have such a strong pull

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.520
on my time and my productivity?

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.500
I was struck--
recently, I discovered

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.080
this app called Snowball.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.420
This app specifically
turns off--

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.810
kind of blocks
annoying notifications.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.390
That's its whole reason for
being and function in life.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.110
That's just one.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.750
I'm sure there will be
many more in this space.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:56.970
So what is this telling us?

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.511
There's, again, as
I was saying, this

00:09:58.511 --> 00:10:02.150
is kind of hinting at the fact
that there's a problem here.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:07.690
And it's for us to think
about how can we resolve this?

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.350
I would argue that as
designers of the system,

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.980
we have some moral
responsibility here.

00:10:15.536 --> 00:10:17.660
We could also just take
that argument aside though.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.490
We could just say
forget about that.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.360
That's nice and all.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.170
That's how it is.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.550
We don't care.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.840
You could take that
argument aside.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.870
Here's the real kicker--

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.540
over-relying on notifications
is bad for developers,

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.210
and that's what I want
to talk about too.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:38.380
So this is a study that
looked at the top reasons

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.110
that people uninstall apps.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.420
Uninstalled apps is pretty
much the worst case scenario

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.410
for any of us.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.830
That's the last thing that
we want people to be doing.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.990
This is a study in which people
were given a lot of reasons

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.987
that they could answer.

00:10:52.987 --> 00:10:54.820
They could pick more
than one, so the totals

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.860
do add up to more than 100 here.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.320
But what is the
top reason given?

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.190
Annoying notifications.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.480
This is the last thing that
we want to have happening.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.640
Combine that with
the fact, when we

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.370
think about our model
in this industry,

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.840
how sustainable is this?

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.870
This is an industry where we
know we have very high user

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.460
acquisition costs.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.860
We're spending lots of
money on the front end

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.950
to bring in new users,
new users, new users.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.160
And yet what happens is,
after the first month,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.030
we're retaining 36% of them.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.127
The second month, 25, the
third month down to 20%.

00:11:30.127 --> 00:11:31.960
So another way to look
at this is across all

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.793
industries-- this is
an average, by the way,

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:35.860
of all industries
within the app space.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.540
80% of all app users are
churning within 90 days.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.860
This is insane.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.830
And the question is, how
is this sustainable for us?

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.977
We're going to run out of users.

00:11:46.977 --> 00:11:48.560
We better repopulate
the Earth really,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.860
really quickly because
we're going to run out

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.580
of users to tap in this model.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.500
So the bigger question
is, what do we do?

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.370
Are we on this ship headed
for self-destruction,

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.291
or are there things
that we can do?

00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:04.040
I actually want to
talk about three things

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.910
that we can do starting
with the most obvious--

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:13.640
stopping the madness, stopping
the attention-grabbing madness.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.210
So I think we can actually
all agree that sending--

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.220
this is a real scenario--

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.900
sending three notifications
within one hour

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.037
about the exact same video that
wasn't going to go anywhere.

00:12:27.037 --> 00:12:28.620
This video wasn't
going to go anywhere

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.010
if I wasn't going to watch
it right that second.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:36.210
This is probably not
being a good citizen.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.040
I think we can all
agree about that.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.660
Now, as I said, I'm
not trying to say

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.490
that all notifications are bad.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.470
The question here
is what boundaries?

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:45.640
What would that look
like if we said,

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.757
this is how we want to
function in this space.

00:12:47.757 --> 00:12:49.590
This is a better way
of thinking about this?

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.360
What would that look like?

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.690
That would be things like--
let's click forward to the next

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.860
slide--

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.200
aligning with our
users' intentions.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.510
So another show of hands--

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.640
how many people in the room
have some kind of subscription,

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.100
membership, something like
that you have been meaning

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.650
to cancel, or you
probably should cancel,

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.982
but you haven't gotten
around to doing it yet?

00:13:14.982 --> 00:13:16.440
Lots of hands going
up in the room.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.390
What's up with you guys?

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.420
If you want to do that,
why aren't you doing it?

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.800
We have this a lot.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.630
We have this with health.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.980
I mean to eat healthier.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.350
I mean to exercise
more, but I don't.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.760
These are challenges.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.660
In psychology, this is called
the action-intention gap,

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.940
and our opportunity
is to say, how can we

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.570
bring these two together?

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.814
Imagine a world where we
can help people achieve

00:13:39.814 --> 00:13:41.730
what they're trying to
achieve, from healthier

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.750
eating to working out more
to being more productive

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.550
or whatever it is again--

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.860
whichever space you're in.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.960
And this would mean that
if you're Headspace--

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.450
I believe Headspace is
somewhere in the room.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.930
If you're Headspace, let's
say that someone downloads

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:01.440
your app, meditates for
the first three days,

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.470
but on the fourth
day, they drop off.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.390
Sending a notification
to ping that user

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.850
to come back and
meditate today is fully

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.000
aligned with that
user's intentions.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.330
So this would be a good example
of sending a notification.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.170
Another example-- this
probably sounds like heresy,

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.400
but we should not be forcing
the users to open the app when

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.200
we get a notification.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.540
This is a health
app, obviously--

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.570
Mango Health.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.750
It says it's time
to take care of you.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.430
You have one health reminder.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.630
Oh, and so then
you open the app,

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.960
and you discover that
it tells you to drink

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.390
water, which is very helpful.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:39.390
Great, I should hydrate.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:40.410
I should drink water.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.860
Contrast though with Argus
that tells you immediately,

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.140
directly-- drink water.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.715
This is a much more respectful
way of engaging with our users.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.520
Another example--
a positive example.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:59.120
If your Waze, you know that
someone takes 280 regularly.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.580
Hey, by the way, 280's
about to shut down--

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.526
very helpful, timely information
for that particular user.

00:15:05.526 --> 00:15:07.400
United Airlines-- you're
walking to one gate.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.050
Hey, by the way, your gate
changed to another one.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.760
You might want to
be going that way--

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.410
helpful information.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.690
Clarity Money-- hey,
you're overspending

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.250
for how you usually spend.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.230
You might want to
taper that down--

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.270
helpful timely information
relevant to me.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.040
The last example I'm
going to give you

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.650
is from an app called ShapeUp.

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.350
It's in the health and
weight management space.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:35.470
It's an app that I'm working
on, and we know from research

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:39.970
that stepping on a scale
daily, especially when it's

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:43.910
done in the morning, is
correlated with weight loss.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.540
So this is sort of our
baseline fact that we know.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.260
So my challenge is
to say, OK, great.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.430
Now that I know this, and these
people want to lose weight.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:52.720
How do I help them do that?

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.190
I need to get them
to step on the scale.

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:55.990
How do I do that?

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.417
Notification-- but how
do I do it in a way

00:15:58.417 --> 00:16:01.000
that we're maybe not going to
be dependent on the notification

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.990
forever?

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.710
I ask them to think of a
habit that they already have--

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.230
something that's already
happening in the morning.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.450
Do you want to do this
before you brush your teeth?

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.920
After you eat breakfast?

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.990
Before you do your morning yoga?

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:19.040
So they're choosing which habit
that they want to pair it with.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.500
So we give them a
list of these things.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.220
We ask them what time
do they usually do this.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.050
And so you're giving
the user choice,

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:30.810
and you're helping them
build positive habits.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.270
So that was talking
about notifications,

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.564
some quick examples.

00:16:34.564 --> 00:16:37.230
I could talk all day about this,
but some quick examples of some

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.040
dos and don'ts.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.410
The second piece
beyond notifications

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:46.350
is about aligning our metrics
with our users' goals.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:50.660
So, for example, if you
are Trello, ultimately,

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.911
what is your user trying to do?

00:16:52.911 --> 00:16:54.410
They're trying to
complete projects.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.030
They're trying to
get stuff done.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:00.380
If you are an online
dating app, which

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.240
I believe there are
many in the room,

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.530
then people are trying
to find a relationship.

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:06.920
That's what they're
trying to do ultimately.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.349
And if you are LinkedIn,
who's over there,

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:13.496
then people are trying to
find a job that they love.

00:17:13.496 --> 00:17:15.079
There's probably a
lot of other things

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:15.900
that they're doing as well.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.470
But ultimately, you have to
boil it down to the top thing

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.220
that our users are trying to
achieve, these are the things.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.910
They do not care.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.430
They are not
looking and thinking

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:29.060
about number of logins,
number of swipes,

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.070
number of LinkedIn
connections we have.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.819
These are different metrics.

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:35.360
And so the question
is what can we do

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.325
to align better with our users?

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.600
The other part that's
challenging here

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.665
is our over-reliance
on short-term metrics.

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:47.690
So I imagine that many of you--

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.655
let's say we have a
dashboard in our office.

00:17:50.655 --> 00:17:52.880
It's is really big dashboard.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.220
And really big at the top,
we have all of these metrics,

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.550
but the two that we
focus on the most--

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.050
anyone want to shout them out?

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.480
What are they?

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.780
Daily active users,
number of sessions, people

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:05.920
are completing.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.000
These are two that I
see time and time again.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.610
And if we think about
this is in our office.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:14.170
Everyday we come
in, we focus on,

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.190
how do I change
these two numbers?

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.510
What's the obvious answer?

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.970
Notifications.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.330
I can ping with
notifications right now,

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:29.120
and I will move the needle
on those two things for sure.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.740
But the challenge is that when
we're sending a notification,

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.960
two things are
actually happening.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.280
One, you're getting the short
blip in engagement right now,

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.317
but you're also getting
long-term deterioration.

00:18:43.317 --> 00:18:44.400
But we're not seeing that.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.070
We're not looking at that
with such an intense focus

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.557
that we have on these
short-term measures.

00:18:49.557 --> 00:18:51.390
And I'm not saying that
we shouldn't measure

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:52.389
these short-term things.

00:18:52.389 --> 00:18:55.320
I'm saying that we should
create a better balance.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.830
We should focus more on these
longer-term measures-- customer

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.649
lifetime value.

00:19:00.649 --> 00:19:02.940
I know that many of you in
the room are working on this

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:07.140
or have put together metrics
to do this and kudos to you.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.970
It is much more challenging.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:12.014
Part of the reason we rely so
heavily on short-term measures

00:19:12.014 --> 00:19:13.680
is because it's way
easier to calculate.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.010
You just see it.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:16.290
You build a little report.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.430
It's there.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.220
Customer lifetime value is
a lot harder to calculate.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.560
Aligning with our
users' ultimate goals

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:27.340
is a lot harder to do, but
it's the right thing to do.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.090
One more piece in terms of
driving long-term engagement

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.160
is about increasing trust.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.980
Again, a lot of research
on how to do this.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.060
I will just say briefly
think about any relationship

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.730
that you have in your life--

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.066
your spouse.

00:19:45.066 --> 00:19:45.940
It could be romantic.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.231
It doesn't have to be romantic.

00:19:47.231 --> 00:19:49.480
It could be your friendships,
work colleagues--

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.860
think about any of
these relationships.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:57.280
Now, if you only ever
in these relationships

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.712
acted in your own best
interest, how long do

00:20:00.712 --> 00:20:02.420
you think these
relationships would last?

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:09.444
Not very long if you only
ever acted for yourself.

00:20:09.444 --> 00:20:11.110
Now, what makes us
think that this would

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.720
be any different in our world?

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.530
Imagine a world
where you're Lyft.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:18.280
This is a mock-up.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.820
This is not real.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.100
Imagine a world where you're
Lyft, and you ping drivers.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:27.700
Hey, it might be a good time for
you to stop driving right now.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.532
What would we see?

00:20:29.532 --> 00:20:30.490
Remember our dashboard?

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.198
We would actually see
that number go down

00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:34.470
a little bit as some of the
drivers would sign off--

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.230
the drivers that we pinged
with this notification.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.020
Active users go down.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:45.030
But think about the long-term
effect on that driver instead

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.004
of someone who is--

00:20:46.004 --> 00:20:47.670
I'm not suggesting
that Lyft does this--

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:49.950
but instead of a
model where someone's

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:53.640
like always more minutes, drive,
more, more, more, more, more

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.185
versus hey, I care about you.

00:20:55.185 --> 00:20:56.910
You've driven probably
enough right now,

00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:00.600
and there's not that much
demand anyway in where you are.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.046
Think about how
that person feels.

00:21:03.046 --> 00:21:04.920
And so this is just one
example, and then you

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.340
can come up with
your own as well.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.740
So what is all of this about?

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.430
What I'm trying to
say here is that it's

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.390
our opportunity-- our
time to band together

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.750
to create our own code of ethics
when it comes to this attention

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.520
economy.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.960
This is going to be really hard.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.600
I'm not saying it's easy at all.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.380
But this is the future.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:33.840
Luckily for us, we don't
have to start from scratch.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.330
People have dealt
with this before.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.800
Let's think of organic food.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.860
Imagine the time--
think back if you can--

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:47.210
when before organic
food labels existed.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:50.090
So you're the
organic food farmer,

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.160
and you want to create
better product that

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.984
is healthier for
people, that isn't

00:21:53.984 --> 00:21:55.400
polluting the
environment with who

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.180
knows what kind of chemicals.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.190
You want to do this.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.780
And so you're
making your grapes,

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.840
and you're very proud of your
grapes, and they're awesome.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.610
And they go on the
shelf, and they're

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:08.193
competing with those
other grapes that

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:10.060
have pesticides on them.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.180
And what's the difference?

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.540
The only difference at
that point is price,

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.510
and you're going to lose that
battle because, at that point,

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.699
the consumer has no
understanding-- no idea.

00:22:18.699 --> 00:22:19.990
Well, why would I pay more for?

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.070
That's all I can see is
these grapes costs more.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:28.470
And yet, with the label,
this became a signifier--

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.680
a symbol of the fact
that these grapes--

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.040
this product-- was made with
a different set of standards,

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.630
with a different set of norms.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:38.720
It's in a different category.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.170
So I think this is a really nice
example for us to think about.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.540
Can we create something
similar to that?

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:49.360
The second example I want to
give you is also from food,

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.740
but it's from the UK.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:55.570
So the British government,
like our government as well,

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.060
actually, realized
that hey, we have

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.150
a problem with our population.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.130
Obesity numbers are
really way too high.

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:04.660
People are very unhealthy.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.780
How do we fix this?

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.196
And so one of the
things that they

00:23:07.196 --> 00:23:11.310
did is they turned to the
food manufacturers and said,

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.620
guess what?

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.520
We have two choices here.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.790
One, we will regulate you.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.730
We will come up with
a set of standards

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.230
that you're going
to have to follow.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:26.750
This process is going to be
very expensive, very laborious,

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.030
and because we are
an outside function,

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.764
we might not necessarily come
up with the right answers.

00:23:31.764 --> 00:23:32.680
Sorry, can we go back?

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.370
So that was option A--

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:38.900
we will regulate you.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.340
Second option, you guys
regulate yourselves.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.590
What did the British
food manufacturers do?

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.820
They said, absolutely,
we will do that.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.710
They banded together.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.580
They created standards
for sugar content

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.890
and all kinds of details
on how the products

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.120
were able to be made--

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.130
fat content, et cetera.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.020
They lowered all of these--

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:00.882
so across the board.

00:24:00.882 --> 00:24:02.090
And this was effort for them.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:03.685
There was cost involved.

00:24:03.685 --> 00:24:05.810
Any one of them couldn't
have done it individually.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.720
The whole reason why this worked
is that they did it together.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.050
But then everyone won because
consumers, in the end,

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.340
ended up with products that
were a lot less sugary.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.760
So this is, again, our
opportunity to create something

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.670
for ourselves.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.890
There's examples of this.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.720
These are just two
that I've given.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.520
But ultimately, it's time for
us to create our own white line

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.620
to design a system that
works better for everyone.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.600
