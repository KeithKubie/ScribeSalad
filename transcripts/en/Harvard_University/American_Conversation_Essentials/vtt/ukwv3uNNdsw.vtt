00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.490
I think one needs to resist crude attacks that say that anything that makes someone wealthy is problematic.

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.099
On the other hand the degree of inequality
of opportunity

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.189
that we're starting to see in the United
states really troubles me.

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.609
For two hundred years a story of America
was a story of more equality of

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:23.929
opportunity

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.349
But the data are telling us now that we are a country with more inequality than most others. 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.490
Inequality has risen very sharply.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.860
In some ways that's because we are
fortunate to have remarkable creators

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.510
here. If America had fifty more versions
of Steve Jobs

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.450
it would be a place with more inequality
but at least to my eyes, it would be a better place.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.370
A richer place; a more interesting
place as well.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.750
I think we

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.470
can accept; I think we should accept

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.409
inequality of results

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.310
recognizing that those who

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.340
earn more are in a position to contribute more
to support the society.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.010
But if you look at the last generation

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.110
The gap in the life prospects of the
child of a rich father and the child

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.300
of a poor father has widened.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.510
These questions of equality of
opportunity

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.650
are very fundamental for us over the
next generation.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.680
Now, our economy is doing better.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.610
The general trend of the numbers is up
but we're still well short of normal

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.979
levels of employment

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.080
and we need more demand for them to put
people back to work

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.390
so we need more spending on
infrastructure. We are shortchanging both

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.490
the present and the future by starving
state and local governments to the point

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.320
where schools in some places only open
four days a week

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.310
we've got investments that going unmade.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.050
this is gonna be a century of biology
like the twentieth century was a century of

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.190
physics and we're not even keeping the
NIH budget where the number of grants

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.020
to young scientists can remain constant
let alone increase

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.490
what I worry about is this could be too
long a slog, but in Washington the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.720
transition from inconceivable to
inevitable

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.930
can on occasion be rapid.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.100
I think what we get past this election

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.610
you're gonna see a recognition that on the part
of people in Washington that there's

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.309
no election soon to posture for

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:17.019
That everybody's going to be fed up with
everybody in Washington and nothing happens.

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.469
I think there's a good chance you're
gonna see

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.000
more cooperation

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.450
both on the crucial issue of getting
the economy going

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.760
and all the longer term issue of
deficit-reduction. I obviously have a preference as

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.480
to who wins the uh...

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.370
election but actually I think whoever wins

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.370
you're likely see considerable pressure
to bring people together.
