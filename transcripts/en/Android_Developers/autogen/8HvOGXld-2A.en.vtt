possibility and a small team of us

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720
possibility and a small team of us
 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.250

reason for this in a lot of cases such

00:16:30.569 --> 00:16:30.579
reason for this in a lot of cases such
 

00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:32.429
reason for this in a lot of cases such
as domestic violence situations it's

regulation the first thing we notice is
 

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:21.740
regulation the first thing we notice is
that laws are lagging regulators simply

explicitly said you can as well so this

00:33:59.270 --> 00:33:59.280
explicitly said you can as well so this

it can be useful in the emergency
