CHRIS: Meathead is the author
of the book "Meathead--

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.630
The Science of Great
Barbecue and Grilling,"

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.400
which I'm told is currently
the number four bestselling

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.120
cookbook on Amazon.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.410
He is also the founder and
editor of amazingribs.com,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.560
which is a fantastic website.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.900
Honestly, I bought my
first smoker this summer.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.040
And I cannot count the number
of times that I've ended up

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.930
on amazingribs.com just
Googling for something.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.010
Like this past
weekend, I wasn't sure

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.530
how to know when
the ribs are done.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.930
So I searched for
how ribs are done.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.020
I ended up on his website.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.950
And I learned all
about the bend test.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.621
So Meathead's here to--

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.540
So anyway, Meathead is
here to bust some myths

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.290
and to tell us all the
rest of his secrets

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.580
beyond the bend test.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.240
Please welcome Meathead.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.240
MEATHEAD GOLDWYN:
Thank you so much.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.780
It's a real pleasure
privilege to be here.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.240
I wouldn't be here
without the great love

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.535
and respect Google search
has given my website.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:10.080
And thanks, Chris, for the
first person testimonial there.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.220
The book is called "The Science
of Barbecue and Grilling."

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.830
And that, I think, might
appeal to some of you.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.860
We are in the year 2016.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.030
It is an age of technology.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.780
And we really
wanted to know what

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.630
happens under the hood of
the grill and the smoker.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.670
If you've ever been
to Austin or if you

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.010
know much about barbecue,
the hottest restaurant

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.060
in the country is
Franklin BBQ in Austin.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.390
And I was thrilled to hear
Aaron Franklin say in his book

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.220
that mine is an amazing
compendium of barbecue

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.720
knowledge.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.320
It's really a lifelong
labor of work and effort.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.310
It's about 400 pages,
400 photographs.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.730
I did most of the
photography myself.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.530
The chapter titles are
"The Science of Heat."

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.670
We talk about the three
different kinds of heat

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.270
that you'll deal
with on a grill.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.650
"The Science of Fire",
"The Science of Smoke."

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.340
There are different
kinds of smoke.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.970
There are good tasting
smoke and bad tasting smoke.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.650
We'll touch upon
that a little bit.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.510
There's some meat
science, food science.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.690
What is in meat?

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.410
What is in vegetables?

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.400
What happens when
meat hits heat?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.520
There is a lengthy discussion
of hardware, the different types

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.890
of grills and smokers.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.490
Which work?

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.610
Which don't work?

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.090
And accessories and gadgets,
because the one with the most

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.800
gadgets wins.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.660
And there's a lot of technique.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.460
It's about 400 pages, and about
the first half of the book

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.680
is this textual or
background information

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.880
that if you buy the book-- and
you should, and Father's Day is

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.230
just around the corner-- you
want to start at the beginning.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.540
Because it makes sense.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.440
It flows.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.570
As much as we all
love the internet,

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.380
I hear from a lot
of people who might

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.320
Google how to cook a brisket.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.680
They find my site.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.440
They go to the brisket page.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.410
They click on a link.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.590
They jump to another page.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.260
They click on a link.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.580
And they start
gathering knowledge.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.288
But there's big holes
when you're jumping

00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:09.210
around using hyperlinks.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.850
And the book, you know, there's
still a place for a dead tree.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.950
And it flows in a sequence.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.030
And I'm very pleased with
the way the book flows.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.990
So I'd recommend it.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.730
And then something that we'll do
today-- a lot of myth busting.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.390
I'm not a scientist.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.410
But I've worked with a number
of scientists that help me.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.180
I was a journalist by training.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.970
And journalists and scientists
have one thing in common.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.280
My wife is a scientist.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.960
She's a very high
ranking food safety

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.780
expert for the FDA, a PhD.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.400
And as a journalist,
we're both trained

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.805
to ask, how do you
know that to be true?

00:03:47.805 --> 00:03:48.680
How do you know that?

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.760
When people say, and in
this political season,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.120
that's a good question
for us all to be asking.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.870
How do you know that to be true?

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.150
Can you prove that?

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.360
And that's a question
I'm constantly asking.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.760
Because I learned to
barbecue from dad.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.420
I went out back
with him first time

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.950
probably eight, nine
years old, and watched

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.420
him grill up some beef ribs.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.570
And it was wonderful.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.580
And I loved it.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.070
And the fact that he might
have let me have a sip of beer

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.890
while he was cooking might
have piqued my interest a bit.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.839
But it was great fun.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.160
I learned to grill from dad.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.829
And he learned to
grill from his dad.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.420
And he learned to
grill from his dad.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.570
And there's these
old husband's tales,

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.520
I call them, that
are passed down

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.890
from generation to
generation of backyard cooks.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.580
And we started asking, how
do you know that to be true?

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.070
And we found that a lot of them
aren't true, that a lot of them

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.740
don't hold water, don't work.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.740
So in addition to the myth
busting and the science, then

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.030
there's about 118
recipes starting

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.130
with brines, rub sauces, all the
meat groups, and side dishes.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.750
And they kind of
exemplify that which

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.380
is in the technique section.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.720
And then, of course,
my website, if you

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.520
run into a question in the
book, I and our moderators--

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.530
and we pay our moderators, which
is most unusual for websites.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.490
We actually pay them.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.980
There's a really talented team.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.456
We're in there every day
answering questions 24/7.

00:05:13.456 --> 00:05:15.330
If you ask a question
at 2:00 in the morning,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.570
you might have to wait a
little bit for an answer.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.040
But we really try to
hold people's hands.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.530
We get a lot of
questions like, help.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.310
I've got the meat
on the grill now.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.040
And it's not going
up in temperature.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.860
And the guests are
coming in 15 minutes.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.040
What do I do?

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.870
Happy to be there.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.700
Happy to do that.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.060
We do it all the time.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.990
And the website has about
1,000 pages-- again,

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.002
recipes, technique.

00:05:39.002 --> 00:05:40.460
And we have buying
guides in there.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.960
So if you're in the market
for a grill or a smoker,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.157
here's a job description.

00:05:44.157 --> 00:05:46.740
If you ever get tired of working
at Google, which is obviously

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.910
a great place to
work-- and please

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.010
don't misinterpret this as
me trying to pirate anybody.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.210
But there's a guy who works
for me who's got the best job

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.280
title in the world.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.670
Max Good, we call him
keeper of the flame.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.746
But his job is testing
grills and smokers.

00:06:02.746 --> 00:06:03.565
That's it.

00:06:03.565 --> 00:06:04.190
That's his job.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.030
He just goes out back, fires it
up, puts in the thermometers,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.940
puts in the testing and
gear, cooks a bunch food,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.750
writes notes, writes reviews
of grills and smokers.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.860
Cool job.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.700
I wish I had it.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.660
And we also have an
electrical engineer

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.500
who tests thermometers.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.250
We'll talk about
thermometers in a minute.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.990
But thermometers are one of
the most important things

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.940
you can have as a outdoor
or an indoor cook.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.880
And we have a guy who tests
them against factory specs.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.154
So there's buying guides.

00:06:33.154 --> 00:06:34.070
And we have community.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.105
We have a section called
the pit master club.

00:06:38.105 --> 00:06:39.730
Actually, I'll talk
about this briefly.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.680
I don't get to talk about it.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.804
But this is an audience
that might appreciate this.

00:06:42.804 --> 00:06:45.050
We do not have a
major publishing

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.610
company that owns us.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.620
We do not have a network
television show that owns us.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.290
We're free standing.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.390
I founded it myself in
2005 with pocket money.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.124
I've had no debt.

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:57.290
It's always been profitable.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.040
Thank you, Google.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:07.580
And our new business model is we
set up a special section called

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.490
the pit master club.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.430
It costs $24 a year.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.552
And we have about 14,000 members
in the past year joined in.

00:07:13.552 --> 00:07:15.010
It's a little more
than a year old.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.980
You can do the math.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.420
That's a working business
model for a small business.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.590
And the pit master
club has a community

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.090
and a lot of fun stuff in it.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.570
So we are finding
ways to make a living

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.460
as advertising rates
nosedive and other revenue

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.620
streams are problematic.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.561
I wrote the book and the website
with the help of Professor Greg

00:07:34.561 --> 00:07:35.060
Blonder.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.560
His name is on the cover.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.950
He's our science advisor.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.690
He's an engineer at
Boston University.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.120
He used to be head of
research at Bell Labs.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.730
And he's a food scientist,
physicist, engineer,

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.520
really remarkable man.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.790
Dr. Mata, who's
a meat scientist.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.730
My wife, Dr. Tortorello,
who's a food safety expert.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.440
I have a Culinary Institute
trained chef to tests recipes.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.270
So it's a really good team.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.880
And anybody here know
the name Kenji Lopez-Alt?

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.410
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.900
I see a few hands go up.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.600
Kenji wrote a book that
came out last fall called

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.990
"The Food Lab."

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.700
And it is phenomenal.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.220
If you don't have
it, you need it.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.940
It's probably
better than my book.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.930
It's about 800 pages.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.297
It's really good food science.

00:08:24.297 --> 00:08:26.880
Unfortunately, when Kenji wrote
it, he lived here in New York.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.910
He didn't have a backyard grill.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.280
So there's nothing about
barbecue and grilling in there.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.630
So my book makes
a good companion.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.429
He wrote the forward.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:35.830
And it is just dynamite.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.120
It's my favorite
cookbook right now.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.890
That's it there.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.700
What's interesting going on
in the culinary world right

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.440
now is that there have
been food writers forever.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.550
But there's this new genre
of food writers emerging.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.270
It started with the food
scientist Harold McGee

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.690
and Shirley Corriher.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.960
They're are grandparents.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.770
And Alton Brown, everybody
here knows Alton Brown,

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.010
Christopher Kimball from
"Cooks Illustrated",

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:06.040
Kenji, Nathan Myhrvold
from "Modernist Cuisine",

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.400
the ChefSteps
people in Seattle--

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.560
we're all really
into teaching people

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.790
what happens when you cook.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.469
We no longer want just a recipe.

00:09:17.469 --> 00:09:18.260
How do you do this?

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.310
What do I do?

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.230
Tell me step one,
step two, step three.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.670
We want to know why.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.290
Why am I doing this?

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.100
Why is this happening?

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.250
And why call us the nerdists?

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.650
In the art world you have the
cubists and the modernists

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.760
and the impressionists.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.310
Well, we're the nerdists
in the culinary world.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.690
And there's more and
more of us coming around.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:41.420
You'll see this.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.010
It's a trend in cookbooks.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.080
So that's kind of the direction
that the website and the book

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.900
are going.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.814
So rather than give you
a chat on everything

00:09:52.814 --> 00:09:54.980
I know about barbecue--
because that's in the book--

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.350
I thought I'd take on the
subject of these old husband's

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:04.000
tales, take on a few of the
more popular endearing, enduring

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.580
myths that many of
you probably hold,

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.100
and see if we can bust
them to smithereens.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.900
Let's start with thermometers.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.246
The myth-- thermometers
are for sissies.

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:15.370
I don't need a thermometer.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:20.470
I can tell when it's done by
poking it or cutting into it.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.930
The thing you need to have
when you're cooking is control.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.710
You need control of every
little aspect of the process.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.110
But most of all, you need
control of temperature.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.650
You need to know what
temperature the oven is.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.870
You need to know what
temperature the food is.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:39.970
A medium rare steak
is 130-135 degrees.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:42.910
It's not 140 or 120.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.630
It's 130 to 135.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.030
At medium rare,
the food scientists

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:52.070
with the fake jaws that
chew meat and tell us

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.390
how much resistance and
how much moisture it

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.880
has have taught us
that medium rare

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.610
is when steak is at its
most juicy and tender.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.390
We didn't need a
machine to tell us that.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.960
If you love steak, you
know that intuitively.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.010
So if you want your
steak medium rare,

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.690
you don't put it out
there and cook it

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.650
for eight minutes on one
side and five minutes

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.090
on the next side.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.200
Because you have no idea if
that's going to be adequate.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.840
The temperature of that meat
is dependent on its thickness.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.440
The thicker the
meat, the longer it

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.550
takes for the heat to be
transmitted down to the center.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.920
Now, the hot air doesn't cook
the interior of the meat.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.550
It can't get in there.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.000
The hot air cooks the
outside of the meat

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.810
and only the
outside of the meat.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.100
As the outside of
the meat heats up,

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.250
it transmits the heat
down towards the center.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.430
So the outside of the meat
cooks the inside of the meat.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:46.990
The thicker the
meat, the longer it

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.660
takes for the energy to
move towards the center.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.170
So you can't take a recipe
that says five minutes

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.230
on one side, four
minutes on the other

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.180
unless you know how thick it is.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.520
And of course, the other big
variable is the temperature.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.250
What is the air temp?

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.000
And air temp is important.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.620
But I mentioned there's
different types of heat.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.700
When we cook on a grill,
you have air temp, which

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.040
is the convection airflow.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.700
You have conduction, which is
the temperature of the metal.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.190
The metal is about 8,000 times
more energy than the air.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.630
And then there is
radiant heat or infrared

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.210
heat that comes from the
coals or the gas jets.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.360
And they are different
heats with different levels

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.300
of energy.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.280
And the best way
to understand this

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.600
is go out and fire up your grill
and bring it up to about 225.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.600
That's not too hot.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.290
That's a good number
by the way to try

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.300
to shoot for most cooking.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.720
Now, lift the lid and
put your arm in there.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.480
You can actually hold your
arm in 225 for a little while.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.990
It doesn't burn too much.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.169
It's warm in there.

00:12:51.169 --> 00:12:53.210
But you can hold it in
there, maybe for a minute.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.190
Or do it with your oven inside.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.790
Now, put your hand on
the cooking grates.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.700
Well, it's 225.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.430
When you get back
from the hospital,

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:07.090
you'll know that
everything that's 225

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.680
doesn't have the same
amount of energy.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.230
Air conducts less
energy than metal.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.095
Water conducts energy at a
different rate than metal,

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:17.940
so does oil, frying.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.470
So they all can conduct
energy at different rates.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.390
And so you need to know
what you're doing with them.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.884
And the best way to know
is with thermometers.

00:13:28.884 --> 00:13:30.300
Now this shouldn't
come as a shock

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.160
to a technologically
oriented audience like you.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.650
But you would not believe how
many knuckle draggers there

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.440
are out there who just say,
I don't need no thermometers.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.130
They're for sissies.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.930
This is 2016.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.450
You can get really good
digital thermometers.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.450
The top of the line is
something called the Thermapen.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.860
And it takes about
two seconds to read

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.530
the temperature of your meat.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.110
So you can stick it in the
meat, and in two seconds,

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.510
you get a percentage number.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.040
And you know if it's medium
rare or not or well-done.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.330
And as you back it
out gently-- It's

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.100
got a little tiny sensor too.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.370
It's really small.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.380
So you can actually
back it out of the meat

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.390
and take progressive
readings as you go.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:13.090
It costs about $100.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.900
You don't have to spend $100.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.705
There's another one
called the Thermal Pop.

00:14:16.705 --> 00:14:18.960
It looks like a little lollipop.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.410
It costs $30.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.660
And it takes five
seconds to read.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.742
So $30 for five seconds,
$100 for two seconds.

00:14:26.742 --> 00:14:27.700
Both of them are great.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.480
You've seen the
Thermapen on television.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.970
A lot of the cooking
shows, the chefs use them.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:37.220
Go get yourself a really
good digital food thermometer

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.820
so you know exactly the
temperature of your food.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.360
Because you can't poke
the meat and tell.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.150
Now, if I work in
Morton's Steakhouse,

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.370
and I'm cooking the same
steaks, cut the same thickness

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.720
from the same cattle
in the same ovens

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.050
every night the same way,
yeah, I can poke the meat,

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.110
and I can tell.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.330
But I'm a pretty good cook.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.710
And I cook outdoors a lot.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.540
And I cannot tell
for sure by poking.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.460
Because a sirloin feels
different than a filet mignon.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.170
And my hand-- this
is the silly one--

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.810
all the books say, well,
if your hand is flexed

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.790
like this, that's medium rare.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.674
And if you clench your
fist, that's medium.

00:15:16.674 --> 00:15:18.590
And if you clench it
harder, that's well done.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.460
I mean, everybody's
hand is different.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.325
Fat guys' hands feel different
than skinny guys' hands.

00:15:24.325 --> 00:15:26.970
A person who works out feels
different than a person who

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:27.780
doesn't.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.660
So thermometer is
the only way to go.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.480
And if you really want
to do it up right,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.910
you want to get yourself
another thermometer

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.980
not just for the meat,
but for the oven.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:41.100
And a grill, by the way, or a
smoker is just an outdoor oven.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.940
So you want to get
a thermometer that

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.770
has a probe that you
can sit next to the meat

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.860
on the grill surface.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.900
That thermometer on your
grill, that dome thermometer,

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.200
when the guy who's in
charge of purchasing

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.020
for the grill company, he's
given a really small budget.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:04.060
And he buys the cheapest
thermometer he can buy.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.310
And it's a piece of junk.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.750
Just put duct tape over it.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:07.750
Ignore it.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.490
Among other things,
it's up in the dome.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.230
And the food is down here.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.685
Now, if you plan to eat
the dome, it's useful.

00:16:14.685 --> 00:16:16.060
But you're going
to eat the food.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.232
So you want a probe that
you can place near the meat.

00:16:19.232 --> 00:16:20.940
And by the way, don't
place it too close.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.120
Because there's a cold air
bubble right around the meat.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.244
You want to put it about
two inches away or an inch

00:16:25.244 --> 00:16:27.410
away next to the
meat on the surface.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.930
And now you know the temperature
of the air the meat is feeling.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.030
So you know what
you're cooking at.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.370
Now you have control.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.089
This is an example.

00:16:38.089 --> 00:16:40.630
I've written this for years,
and readers have been sending me

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.470
pictures of their digital
thermometer compared

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.350
to the dial thermometer
on their grill.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:50.190
And you can see to the
left, 297 versus 397,

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.460
an even 100 degrees off.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.180
254 versus 210.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.140
Can you imagine if
you cooked indoors

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.360
if your thermostat
was that far off?

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.000
I mean, it usually
is a little off.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.700
But that far?

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.480
100 degree difference?

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.430
You need to know with a
digital thermometer what

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:09.510
your temperature is.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:13.242
And also, get yourself a
good meat temperature guide.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.859
We published a small one
like this that you can buy it

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:21.396
on Amazon for $5.00.

00:17:21.396 --> 00:17:22.770
And there's a big
long one that's

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.540
got all kinds of
numbers on it for $10.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.920
And it's magnetic, stick
to the refrigerator door.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.830
Now you know the temperatures
that USDA recommends.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.860
And the chart also gives
you the temperatures

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.650
that chefs recommend, which
is often different than what

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.990
USDA recommends.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.530
OK, here's another myth.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:45.190
Cook the chicken until
the juices run clear.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.330
Cooks in the audience, I presume
most of you are cooks, right?

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.110
You know this.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.360
You cook the chicken.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.250
You slice into it.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.020
And by the thigh bone, right
down by the thigh bone,

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.540
you've seen that, haven't you?

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.160
That ugly purple bloody
looking down by the thigh bone.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.200
There's a reason that's purple.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.030
And it's not unsafe.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:08.640
If you cook it to 160-165
degrees, it's safe.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.790
If you use a
thermometer, it's safe.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.890
The reason it's
purple down there

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.650
is chickens go from
egg to grocery store

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:20.150
shelf in seven and a half
weeks, often just seven weeks.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.750
Three and a half pounds
of growth, from zero

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:26.940
to three and a half pounds
in just under two months.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.080
I mean, that's
phenomenal growth rate.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.380
And they're not allowed
to use hormones.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.530
They've just fine
tuned the breeding

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.500
and the feeding
of these animals.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:42.920
The problem is the bones haven't
had a chance to fully calcify.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.000
They're not hard all around.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.050
They're still soft.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:47.510
These are like babies.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:48.640
The bones aren't hard.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.060
And blood is manufactured
inside the bones.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.080
And you see this particularly
on the thigh bone.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.470
Ugly and scary as that
look, that chicken is safe.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.370
I measured the temp.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.570
It was 180 actually.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:06.540
160 to 165 is safe,
well over safe temp.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.630
Only a thermometer will
tell you if it's safe.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:16.131
So of course, my wife, the food
safety expert, knows all this.

00:19:16.131 --> 00:19:18.130
But if I bring in a chicken
like this and I say,

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.760
honey, I swear I used
my $100 Thermapen.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.130
It's 181.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:23.983
160's safe.

00:19:23.983 --> 00:19:25.274
She'll pop it in the microwave.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.950
Pink chicken is kind
of weird, isn't it?

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.800
Another myth-- follow
recipe cooking times.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.170
So they'll tell
you-- this graphic

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.560
is your Christmas roast.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.290
That's your prime
rib roast, right?

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.620
It's about 10 inches long,
about four inches thick.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.050
And that's a seven
bone roast on the top.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:53.396
And they'll tell you cook it
for eight minutes a pound.

00:19:53.396 --> 00:19:54.770
I don't know what
they say it is.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.210
But they'll give you
a number, depending

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:58.880
on the temperature of your
oven, how many minutes per pound

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.260
to cook it.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.510
But the funny thing is, is
the top one, the second one,

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.130
and the third one all take
the same time to cook.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.820
Yet they weigh vastly
different amounts.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.080
And the reason they take
the same time to cook

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.580
is they're all
four inches thick.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.530
So the heat moving from
the outside to the center

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.010
takes the same amount of time.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.370
So the weight is not the
determining factor in how long

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:26.510
it takes to cook.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:30.080
It's the thickness
that matters the most.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.530
Now, the bottom one will
cook faster because it's

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:34.830
only three inches wide.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.050
So that's the narrowest
diameter instead of four inches.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.140
It'll cook faster.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.126
Cool, huh?

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.500
Searing seals in the juices--
another long lasting myth.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.860
We can't get rid of it.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.610
Started by some guy back
in the 1800s in Germany.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.710
And it just won't go away.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.430
Meat fibers are not balloons.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.200
They don't fill up with water.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.070
And when you put them
overheat, they just clamp shut,

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.580
and the juices won't come out.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.600
These are two steaks
that you can see here.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.660
They're seared well.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.240
They're brown on the surface.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.200
And there's juices
on the surface.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.320
The searing does not
seal in the juices.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.550
And in fact, if you take two
steaks, identical, cut side

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:24.940
by side from the same piece of
me, weigh the same, sear one

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.340
first, don't sear the other.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.940
Put them in the oven
or in the grill.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.360
And cook them to the same
internal temperature.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.230
Bring them out and weigh them.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.670
The seared one will weigh less.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.020
It'll have more moisture loss.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.480
Why?

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.780
Because it's hotter.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:45.380
When you sear, heat
drives moisture out.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.020
But don't worry.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.470
An eight ounce steak
contains six ounces of water.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.380
It's 70% to 75% water.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.534
You can stick a
thermometer in it.

00:21:55.534 --> 00:21:56.450
It's not going to go--

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.050
[WHISTLE]

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.830
--and deflate.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.684
You can even turn
it with a fork.

00:22:01.684 --> 00:22:03.100
And all the books
say, no, no, no.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:03.720
Don't do that.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.970
Don't [INTENTIONALLY MUMBLES].

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.471
They'll arrest you if
you-- Tongs are better.

00:22:08.471 --> 00:22:10.470
But you're not going to
lose that much moisture.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:15.280
An eight ounce filet mignon
has six ounces of water in it.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.960
Not to worry.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.140
Searing does not
seal in the juices.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.190
But searing is important.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.100
Searing is wonderful.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.290
Brown is beautiful.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:28.910
When you're cooking, you
want brown on the surface.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:32.510
Brown is a result of
the Maillard reaction

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:35.735
and caramelization--
two chemical reactions.

00:22:35.735 --> 00:22:38.350
Maillard reaction is
proteins and amino acids

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.660
with some sugars.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.300
Caramelization is mostly sugars.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.340
But regardless of the
chemistry involved,

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:50.540
the surface of the meat or
the potato or the asparagus

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.930
or whatever you're cooking,
the surface changes chemistry.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.310
The heat alters the
chemistry of the surface.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:02.620
So what you end up with is a
lot of new chemical compounds

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.840
that are really flavorful.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.470
You really like the
taste of seared foods.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.160
So you do want to sear.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.560
Don't worry about the
little bit of moisture loss.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.860
There's plenty of
moisture left in there.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.820
You want as much
brown as you can get.

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.250
Now normally when I do
something like this,

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:24.450
I say if you have a question,
feel free to interrupt me.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.360
We're going to take time at
the end for Q&amp;A. I'm having

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.240
a rough time seeing out there.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.210
But if I skip something or if
I'm ambiguous, wave your hand.

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:34.985
Oh, they just turned
up the lights a bit.

00:23:34.985 --> 00:23:37.110
Wave your hands and just
go ahead and interrupt me.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.650
I mean, let's be friends here.

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:41.710
Because I'm moving fast.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:44.280
So if you've got a question,
throw something at me.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.700
Get my attention.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:46.950
OK, we're doing OK so far?

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.990
Anybody got a question so far?

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.720
Doing good?

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.435
OK.

00:23:52.435 --> 00:23:54.210
So we talked about searing.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.660
What about grill marks?

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.320
All the cookbooks
teach you put meat down

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.840
for a couple of minutes and
get grill marks going one way.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.037
Then pick it up and
rotate it 45 degrees

00:24:05.037 --> 00:24:06.870
and get the grill marks
going the other way.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:12.150
And you get this pattern
of crosshatch grill marks.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:15.120
And you see this on
restaurant menu pictures.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.240
You see it on
packaged goods when

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.640
you buy a frozen chicken breast,
a TV dinner or something.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.660
They all show you grill marks.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:29.580
Well, Maillard reaction is
this browning of new flavors.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.290
So when you get grill
marks, remember,

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:36.270
the surface of the grill
grates, 8,000 times more energy

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:40.690
than the air, it's going to
make those sear marks on there.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:42.280
And that's Maillard reaction.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.190
That's good.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.840
But look at all the
interstices, the spaces

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.400
between the grill marks.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.290
Now, we're supposed to
have Pavlovian response

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.480
when we see grill marks.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.560
I see not something that
makes my saliva run.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.820
I see unfulfilled potential.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.610
I see meat that hasn't
reached-- like a child that

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.460
never finishes school.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.630
Now the top steak, that's
what I want to see.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:13.690
That's Maillard reaction,
edge to edge, top to bottom.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.004
That's maximum flavor.

00:25:16.004 --> 00:25:18.420
That steak, by the way, is
from a place called prime house

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.070
in Chicago, which
won our top steak

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.120
award according to "Chicago
Magazine" last year.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.230
I love that place.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.540
And that's the way I want
to see my steaks look.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:30.140
No grill marks for me.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.646
Maximum.

00:25:31.646 --> 00:25:33.020
Now sometimes,
you can't help it.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.050
I mean, if you doing
shrimp, you don't have time

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.631
to leave it out there and
let it brown all over.

00:25:37.631 --> 00:25:39.130
If you do that,
you're going to have

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.600
rock hard, bone dry shrimp.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:47.180
OK, another myth-- get
your grill screaming hot.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.360
Oh, this is such a guy thing.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.570
Pedal to the metal.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.725
Get it as hot as you
can possibly get it.

00:25:53.725 --> 00:25:56.990
Give it all she's got, Scotty.

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.660
Don't do it.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.440
We cook too hot.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.400
Use what we call
the two zone system.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.980
You can see on one side,
we've got the charcoal

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.690
pushed all the way to one side.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.660
On a gas grill-- I think
that's the next slide.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.450
Let's see if I've
got a picture of it.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:14.110
Yeah.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.810
On a gas grill,
turn on one or two

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:17.649
burners, leave the
other one or two off.

00:26:17.649 --> 00:26:19.190
Hey, how do I make
this go backwards?

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:22.270
Red?

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.180
Oh.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.890
I see I've just been
hitting the green.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:29.090
You told me that
earlier and I forgot.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.660
I thought red was
stop, not go back.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.650
OK, so, two zones-- hot
zone and not hot zone.

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.780
On the hot zone, we have
direct, radiant heat.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.030
That's the other type of
heat we haven't talked about.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.340
We talked about
convection heat, and we

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.110
talked about conduction heat.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:49.280
The conduction is from
the hot metal surfaces

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.960
or from the outside of the meat
cooking the inside of the meat.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.140
That's conduction.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.439
This is radiant heat--
infrared radiation.

00:26:56.439 --> 00:26:58.730
Just like you get out there
on a beautiful, sunny day--

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.870
we sat out on the
patio out for lunch.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.110
Chris took us outside.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.680
How lovely.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.220
You feel that radiant heat
on the back of your neck.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.330
That's infrared radiant heat.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:08.850
And that's a different
kind of heat.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.660
It's not as hot as conduction
from the metal grates.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.810
But it's hotter than warm
air, convection air flow.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.930
On the left hand
side of the grill,

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:21.130
you can see the charcoal
is not under the meat.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:25.570
It's cooking by convection
flow-- gentle air flow.

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.500
And that's where you want
to do most of your cooking.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.890
You don't want to cook over
the charcoals most of the time.

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.750
You don't want to cook over
the burners most of the time.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.470
You can throw some wood
pellets or some wood chunks

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.490
or some chips on the charcoal.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:41.510
And you'll get smoke
traveling around in there.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.550
And you'll get the grill flavor.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:45.720
But now, on the
indirect side, you

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.490
can gently heat the
meat I like to shoot

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.090
for 225 on the indirect side.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:52.350
And that takes a while.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.860
It takes a while
to cook the meat.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:57.250
But how many of you
have immolated a chicken

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.360
so that it's black
on the outside

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.022
and barely cooked on the inside.

00:28:01.022 --> 00:28:02.480
You don't have to
raise your hands.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.030
I know, all of us.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:06.790
Do this with your chickens.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.080
Put that bird on
the indirect side.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.880
Gently warm it.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:15.040
Safe temperature for
chicken-- 160-165.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.570
And 165 degrees will
kill all microbes

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.060
in about seven seconds.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.450
You don't want to monkey
around with chicken.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.260
Consumer Reports did a
research project last year

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.140
that they tested
300 chicken breasts

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.580
from around the country.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.900
90% or more had
pathogenic bacteria.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:38.490
And of those, half of them had
antibiotic resistant pathogens.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.570
Don't want under cook chicken
unless you've got somebody

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.110
you don't like at the table.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:48.070
So you want to put that
chicken on the indirect side,

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:49.740
and gently warm
it, and bring it up

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.310
to about 140 or 145
internal temperature.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:54.700
Use your digital thermometer.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.820
Probe it.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:01.610
And when it gets there, then you
move it over to the hot side.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:05.320
Skin down, lift the lid.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.640
Because right now, it's
being surrounded by hot air

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.020
when it's on the indirect side.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:12.620
If you lift the lid, now
all the infrared energy

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.170
is pounding on the underside.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.830
And you're beating that infrared
energy right into the skin.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:19.360
And you're rendering the fat.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.680
And your crisping that skin.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.900
Stand there and watch it.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.140
Don't go for a beer.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.710
Don't go take a piss.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.326
Because that thing
will burn in a hurry.

00:29:27.326 --> 00:29:28.450
And just keep an eye on it.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.200
And when you've
got GBD-- golden,

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.560
brown, and delicious-- when
you've got GBD on that chicken

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.330
skin, flip it over and
get the other side.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:38.360
And then you're done.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.810
And if you test it,
you'll be around 160.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:43.260
And we call this
the reverse sear.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.000
You sear at the end of the
cook, not the beginning.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.140
If you sear at the
beginning, all that energy

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.660
pounds into the meat.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.310
And it slowly works
its way down in.

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:57.410
And so what you end up with
is an overcooked exterior,

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.320
and then just below
it, another layer

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.780
that's slightly overcooked.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.250
On a steak, you'll end up
with a dark brown layer,

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.160
then a brown layer, then a
tan layer, then a pink layer,

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.010
and then maybe in the middle
you'll have some medium rare.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:12.510
So you don't want to
sear in the beginning.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:13.435
You sear at the end.

00:30:13.435 --> 00:30:16.030
And the reverse sear
technique will give you

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:20.060
even color from the
indirect convection airflow.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:23.310
Even color, even
temperature, top to bottom,

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:25.520
left to right on
the indirect side.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.440
Then when you move
it over and sear it,

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.080
you'll get that beautiful crust.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:33.340
What you're doing now is you're
cooking the interior separately

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.770
from the exterior.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.120
Because you have
two separate goals.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.820
Interior-- safe target
temperature, maximum tenderness

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:41.980
and juiciness.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.280
Exterior-- brown is beautiful.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.260
Crunchy, beautiful,
flavorful exterior.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.100
OK, are we with me?

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.830
And the same thing
on a gas grill.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:55.050
You have one or two burners.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:57.360
The more burners, the better.

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.120
So if you're buying a gas grill,
go for three, four burners,

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.600
but at least two.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.340
Get at least two burners so
you can set up two zones.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.510
You want to zones.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:14.050
And these are just some
pictures of what I showed you.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.710
Look at the bottom two.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:20.850
The middle one, number two, was
cooked the normal way-- sear

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:22.910
first and keep cooking.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:25.130
And you can see there's a
layer of well-done right

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:26.540
below the surface.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.890
The bottom one was
cooked indirect sear.

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.860
Very, very thin
overcooked layer.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.720
Beautiful, medium
rare in between.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.892
Now, how many of you are
grossed out by that pink color?

00:31:36.892 --> 00:31:41.550
OK, too much, too juicy,
too bloody for you?

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.500
Too bloody for you?

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.570
It's not blood.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.460
It's not blood.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:51.990
The juice that you see
in a steak is not blood.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.580
That blood has all been
removed during the slaughter.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.940
Animal blood is
just like our blood.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.790
It's dark red.

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:00.750
It's thick.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.620
It's almost black.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.675
And if it spilled out, it would
be really thick and coagulated.

00:32:07.675 --> 00:32:08.870
It would harden.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:12.750
The juices that come
out of a steak are thin.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:14.160
It's water.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:14.900
It's water.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.730
And it's pink only because
of the color of the pigments

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.110
of a protein called myoglobin.

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:23.299
And myoglobin makes it pink.

00:32:23.299 --> 00:32:25.090
And we'll talk more
about that in a minute.

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.050
Roast your food
in a roasting pan.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.980
Now this goes-- look at
your Thanksgiving turkey.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.170
This is your
Thanksgiving turkey.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:38.014
On the left is your
Thanksgiving turkey.

00:32:38.014 --> 00:32:40.430
You've got a big old roasting
pan with that V shaped rack.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.010
You put the turkey in there.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:45.650
And you can see, the
bottom never gets hot.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:47.930
Because the water in
the bottom of the pan--

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.890
you almost always put water
so it doesn't drip and burn.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:53.410
The bottom is going to
be about 240 degrees.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:54.950
And how many of you know this?

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.450
You bring that turkey
out, and the top side

00:32:57.450 --> 00:33:00.460
is beautiful, gold GBD--
golden, brown, and delicious.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:04.130
And the bottom is
sort of pale and sad

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:08.745
looking, gooey, and wet.

00:33:08.745 --> 00:33:11.930
What you want to do
is raise the meat up

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.860
so the warm air can
circulate all around it.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:19.500
And on the right hand side,
you see a turkey on the grill.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.100
It's cooking on the grate.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.470
And the pan is well below it.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.010
Now, air can
circulate all around.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:27.410
It browns all around.

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:28.630
It cooks evenly.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:30.630
You don't have it
overcooked on one side,

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:32.590
under cooked on the other.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:36.340
And when I cook a turkey-- and
this recipe is in the book--

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:40.860
we're going to put
onions, celery, carrots,

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.600
a little white wine,
some herbs, and we're

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.194
going to put all
that in the drip pan.

00:33:46.194 --> 00:33:48.110
We're going to take the
neck from the chicken.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.752
We're going to trim
around the cavity.

00:33:49.752 --> 00:33:50.960
Get all the fat off of there.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.200
We're going to chop off
the ends of the wings.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.630
All that's going
in the drip pan.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:58.350
We're making a turkey soup.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:01.060
We're making a turkey soup in
that drip pan underneath there.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.810
And it's getting all
the flavorful juices.

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:03.860
Yes, ma'am?

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.155
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Are you recommending

00:34:07.155 --> 00:34:10.888
putting a roasting pan on the
grill, and then another grill

00:34:10.888 --> 00:34:11.540
above that?

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.340
MEATHEAD GOLDWYN: If you can,
depending on what kind of grill

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:13.839
you have.

00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:16.639
Like on a gas grill, you
can put the roasting pan--

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:19.739
and I use just an inexpensive
stainless steel or porcelain

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:27.350
pan, not your fancy heavy
duty $250 roasting pan.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:31.670
And I put it underneath right
on top of the gas burners.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.710
On a charcoal grill,
we're cooking indirect.

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:37.270
So the coals are
all off on one side.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:39.190
The pan is off on
the other side.

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:43.219
All the drippings are
falling down on that grate.

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:45.020
You can also-- and
I've done this too--

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.920
you can also put the
pan on the grill grates.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.750
Put another grate more
like the middle picture

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:52.150
right on top of it there.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:54.580
And that's a good second option.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.040
And you can still
collect all those juices

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.970
and make one heck
of a turkey stock.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:01.730
And that's your gravy base.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:02.730
You strain that off.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:04.940
And that is the most
wonderful gravy.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.110
You won't want to
add flour to it.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.110
You won't want to
add thickener to it.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.620
That stuff just makes it thick.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.310
It sits on top of the meat.

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:13.640
It won't penetrate the meat.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.910
It won't give it any flavor.

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:16.894
You'll just take this
wonderful turkey soup.

00:35:16.894 --> 00:35:17.810
And that's your gravy.

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:19.270
And it's fantastic.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:22.630
But in either case, whether
it's a turkey or a beef

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:26.320
roast or a pork roast,
get it up above the pan

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.161
so it can cook all around.

00:35:30.642 --> 00:35:32.100
Here, we talked
about this earlier.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.070
The red juice is blood.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:33.830
It's not.

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:35.210
It's myoglobin.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:37.590
It's a liquid.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.670
It's almost all water
with a little pigment.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:43.200
And you've seen it in
chicken and in pork.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.430
They all put that little
spongy material underneath it

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:49.960
when you buy the package in the
store that absorbs the juices.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.180
And it's pink.

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.240
It's myoglobin.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.830
OK, big hunks of meat.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:36:00.920
Anybody here ever do pork
shoulder to make pulled pork?

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:01.820
Hands?

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:02.700
Briskets?

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.700
Yeah, OK, good.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.970
Legs of lamb?

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:06.760
Get the fat cap off.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:10.680
You're told that the fat cap
will melt and baste the meat

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.340
and penetrate the meat.

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.410
Because fat is flavor.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.280
We all know that.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:14.910
That's true.

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:17.520
That's not a husband's tale.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.470
But the fat that's
flavor is the fat

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:21.940
that's woven within the meat.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.660
It's called marbling.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:28.260
The fat that sits on top of
the meat is no good to anybody.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:32.490
You're going to sprinkle
the spices and the herbs

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.772
on that fat cap.

00:36:33.772 --> 00:36:35.980
And then when you serve it,
the first thing everybody

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.630
does is cut off the fat cap.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:40.110
And there go all your
spices and herbs.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:42.270
This picture here, it's
not my best photography.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.969
Forgive me.

00:36:42.969 --> 00:36:44.760
But in the top picture,
same piece of meat.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.551
You can see it's pretty
much the same meat.

00:36:46.551 --> 00:36:48.630
The colors are shifted
a little with air.

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:52.280
But the top piece of meat, I
dug a hole in a piece of beef,

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.510
filled it with olive oil.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:58.770
And that's 33 seconds into--
it took me a while to focus.

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:03.560
And then the bottom one
is 10 minutes later.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.210
Pardon me, that's nine hours.

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:08.840
That's nine hours.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.420
Nine hours and 58 minutes.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.080
The fat goes nowhere.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.520
Why?

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.190
Meat is 70% water.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:18.250
Oil and water don't mix.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:21.370
The fat on your fat cap is
not penetrating the meat.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:22.610
It's not going anywhere.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.550
It's not doing you any good.

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:25.990
Get rid of it.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.746
If you want, what
I do when I'm doing

00:37:27.746 --> 00:37:29.370
a brisket or a pulled
pork or something

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:33.200
that has a fat cap like a leg of
lamb, I'll leave a thin layer.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.550
Because people will eat
a thin layer of fat.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:40.290
And it will get
really good flavor.

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:43.782
What was the movie?

00:37:43.782 --> 00:37:45.490
We were talking about
this the other day,

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:53.452
Carrie-- little kids
asking people at the table,

00:37:53.452 --> 00:37:54.724
you gonna eat your fat?

00:37:54.724 --> 00:37:56.140
Somebody in here
knows this movie.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:38:00.130
It's a Rodney Dangerfield movie.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.340
There's this little kid
like, you gonna eat your fat?

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:03.800
You gonna eat your fat?

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.780
Fat is flavorful.

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.200
Bone in steak is
better-- another myth.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.410
I know that we love
to gnaw on the bone.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:13.150
And that's fun.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:17.010
And that's a good reason to
leave the bone in a ribeye.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:20.230
But the bone doesn't
give you any flavor.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:23.390
Now, that may have came about
because if you take something

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:27.040
like beef ribs and put them
in a crockpot or a stew

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.490
pot or a Dutch oven, and
you put in your sauce,

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:33.860
you're making up a little
red wine, and some stock,

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.720
and some seasonings,
and you pop it

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:42.540
in the oven, or your turn on
the crockpot, that will extract

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.880
the flavor from the bone.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.940
But it doesn't
extract any flavor

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.530
from the bone in a
dry cooking method

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:53.900
like the oven or the grill.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.110
You can see in the
cross-section of the bone,

00:38:56.110 --> 00:39:00.250
that compact bone
portion is pure calcium.

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:03.790
Calcium has no flavor,
none that we can taste.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:05.250
The yellow marrow has flavor.

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:07.210
But it can't get out.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:11.780
What the bone does do is it
interferes with even heating.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.240
And it's kind of hard to see.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:17.420
But you can see that the dark
red areas around that t-bone

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:21.060
don't heat up as much
as the other areas.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.710
Because the bone
is like the heat

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.450
shield on the space shuttle.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:25.920
It interferes with the heat.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.400
Now, as the bone heats up,
it'll retain heat more.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.070
And it actually gets hot.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:35.380
But the bone doesn't
do anything for flavor.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.960
And it will alter the
healing properties.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:42.920
So when I'm doing a ribeye, I
will often remove the bones.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.680
Of course, the way
I do ribeye, you

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.080
would expect me to do it weird.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.070
I'll buy a whole beef rib
roast with seven bones in it.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:55.900
And I'll cut the whole
slab of beef ribs off.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.300
And that I will cook
as a separate meal.

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.440
Beef ribs-- wonderful.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.950
And I'll then take this
round, big old roast

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.150
and cut it in a rib eye steaks.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.600
Now I have my own ribeye
steaks cut perfectly

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.030
to my specifications.

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:12.210
I like them about
an inch and a half.

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:16.130
And so I have now
boneless ribeye steaks.

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:19.170
And when I cook them, the
heat enters all sides evenly.

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.580
And they cook perfectly even.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.860
And I have a slab of beef
bones that I can cook

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.660
for beef ribs for another meal.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:31.507
Here's another myth-- let
meat come to room temperature.

00:40:31.507 --> 00:40:32.590
Take it out of the fridge.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:36.280
Let it sit on the table
for a couple hours.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.280
Well, I tried that.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.690
I took a steak, stuck
a thermocouple in it,

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:43.885
and waited for it to
come to room temperature.

00:40:43.885 --> 00:40:45.260
About an inch and
a half steak, I

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.180
think it took maybe three
hours to come to room temp.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.120
If you went to a
restaurant, and they said,

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.010
yeah we've got your
steak sitting out.

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:54.660
They've been out
for a couple hours.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.510
We'll put it in
the oven right now.

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:58.630
You'd head for the door.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:01.380
It is not a very safe practice
to let meat sit around

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.930
at room temp for very long.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.020
And a roast, a four
inch thick roast,

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:08.340
takes 10 hours to
come to room temp.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.880
But there's another reason
why you don't want to do it.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.350
Cold surfaces attract smoke.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:17.630
Just like when you
get out of the shower,

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:22.140
the cold surface of the
bathroom mirrors attract steam.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.930
And your mirrors steam up.

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:27.700
Well, smoke will be
attracted to the meat that

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.630
is cold out of the fridge.

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:34.110
And this picture shows
you the experiment we did.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:38.840
The white can on the right is
the control sat of my desk.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:43.020
The can on the middle is empty,
and it went on the smoker.

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:47.280
The can on the left was
filled with ice water.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:50.120
And you can see, not only did
it attract a lot of smoke,

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.490
but moisture started
running down the surface.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:56.160
Wet surfaces also glom
smoke and hold on to it.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.720
So smoke is a lovely flavor.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.180
You can't get it
on your spice rack.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.420
So you can get it on the grill.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.779
So go cold meat on the grill.

00:42:04.779 --> 00:42:06.320
And you'll attract
more smoke flavor.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.220
And you'll get more
flavor that way.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.370
Liquid smoke is nice.

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:11.080
It is made from natural smoke.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.292
But it's not the same.

00:42:12.292 --> 00:42:13.750
It's gone through
a transformation.

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:14.910
And it's not the same.

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:18.610
Natural smoke fresh from the
cooker really tastes nice.

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:23.268
So cold food, maximum smoke.

00:42:23.268 --> 00:42:26.062
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
de-frost in the fridge?

00:42:26.062 --> 00:42:27.020
MEATHEAD GOLDWYN: Yeah.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.609
Well, of course, you do want
to de-frost in your fridge.

00:42:29.609 --> 00:42:31.400
You do not want to
de-frost on the counter.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.180
Now, there is some new research.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.650
USDA did some research
that shows you can actually

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:37.390
defrost in hot water.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:39.525
And you've got to
be careful about it.

00:42:39.525 --> 00:42:41.150
And I don't have time
to get into that.

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:43.760
But I do talk about
it on the website.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.570
I think it's
mentioned in the book.

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:47.510
But de-frosting
is another issue.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.135
And there are several
ways to de-frost.

00:42:49.135 --> 00:42:51.135
But the best way is just
leave it in the fridge.

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:53.620
If your fridge is 38, check
your refrigerator temperature.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.770
Thermometers.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:57.750
38 degrees or less.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.590
33 to 38, that's
your sweet spot.

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:02.090
Microbes don't like that temp.

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.300
They will not grow rapidly.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:07.010
You get up over 40,
and they start growing.

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:11.780
And at room temp, they double
in population every 20 minutes.

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.780
So you don't want to leave
things sitting around

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:15.990
at room temp.

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.820
Soak your wood.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.830
This is another one
that just won't go away.

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:26.190
All the books tell you soak
your wood chips, your chunks

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:29.480
before you put them on
the fire for flavor.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:34.550
If you soak wood--
well, first of all,

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:36.540
why would you soak wood?

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:41.020
Because you know, they build
boats out of wood for a reason.

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.240
Wood doesn't absorb water.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.490
And it's kind of hard to tell.

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:46.170
But I took some
water and stained

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:47.950
it blue with some food dye.

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:50.660
And you can see
in these pictures

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:54.740
that on the left hand side
is the exterior of the wood.

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.390
And you can see a
little bit of water

00:43:56.390 --> 00:44:00.050
stain on there that
stayed, but not much.

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.100
When I took wood and
soaked it-- not just

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.640
for an hour or two
like the barbecue

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.590
books tell you, but
overnight-- then patted it dry,

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:11.260
they gained about 3% weight.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.290
That's all.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:15.960
And all of that
was on the surface.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.400
You can see that in
number one, that's

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.880
the exterior on the left.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.490
I cut it open.

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:23.920
The wet spot-- you see
the one little wet spot?

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.430
It was a crack in the wood.

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:27.130
A little water got
in through the crack.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:27.630
That's it.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.720
Bone dry inside.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.950
Hardly anything visible
on the exterior.

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:33.760
The middle one is a
raw chunk of wood.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.070
You can see there's a little bit
of blue stain to the exterior.

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:39.730
But the interior, again,
the only white spots

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:42.749
were the cracks and crevices.

00:44:42.749 --> 00:44:45.290
And then a little chip-- it's
hard to see from this picture--

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:48.000
but there was no
penetration of water at all.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.880
Now, when you take wet wood and
throw it on a charcoal fire,

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.890
what happens?

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.210
You wet the fire.

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:55.600
You lower the temperature.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.910
You reduce the temp.

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:58.920
You've lost control
of your heat.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.410
You want to get your fire to an
even temperature, your target

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:05.970
temperature, 225 in the
indirect zone most of the time.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:09.960
And you don't want to
throw cold water on it.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:14.060
So there's no need to wet
your wood before you cook.

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:17.540
And in fact, there's
another good reason not to.

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:20.480
There's different
kinds of smoke.

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.360
You can have black smoke,
gray smoke, brown smoke,

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.870
yellow smoke, white
smoke, and blue smoke.

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:31.000
White smoke and blue
smoke taste good.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.260
The best tasting
smoke is blue smoke.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:37.065
And blue smoke is
almost invisible.

00:45:37.065 --> 00:45:38.440
Let's see if I've
got that slide.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:41.140
Yes.

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:42.660
White billowing smoke is good.

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:43.970
And a lot of us look for it.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:46.490
And we say when we throw
the wet wood on the fire,

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:48.510
we see lots of billowing smoke.

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:49.230
It's not smoke.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:51.650
It's steam.

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:56.890
Wood doesn't combust till 575
to 600 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:58.180
Water boils at 212.

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.840
You throw a wet wood on a fire,
the first thing that happens

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.200
is you have to boil off the
water before the wood can

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.200
combust.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.940
So what you're seeing is steam.

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.800
But once you get it going,
white smoke has a good flavor.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.590
But it's not as good
flavor as very pale, almost

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:15.220
invisible smoke.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.980
Blue smoke is almost invisible.

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:20.410
The particles in the
smoke are so small,

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:23.750
they barely refract light.

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:25.350
So it's called blue smoke.

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:27.640
And it's the goal
of pit masters.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.280
Now I hear people all the time
saying, I've got a gas grill.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.690
And I put the wood chips
in a little aluminum pan

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:35.440
or I wrap them up in foil,
throw it on the fire,

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.770
and they catch on
fire and burn up.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:40.500
How do I prevent that?

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.090
That's good.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.980
You want the wood to burn.

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.150
You don't want it to smolder.

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:48.730
When it smolders, it's
starving for oxygen. You're

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:50.520
getting billowing white smoke.

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.250
You want the wood
to burn vigorously.

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:56.450
Barbecue pits, the big
ones, they cook with wood.

00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:57.580
They don't let it smolder.

00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:58.860
They throw the logs on there.

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.416
And it catches on fire.

00:47:00.416 --> 00:47:02.540
It's hard to keep the
temperature down once they're

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.650
burning with flame.

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:06.890
But that gives you the
purest, best flavor of smoke.

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:11.420
So don't worry if your
wood chips catch on fire.

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:14.150
Another myth-- rubs and
marinades penetrate the meat,

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:16.060
tenderize it, and flavor it.

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:20.900
That's a piece of chicken
I think, maybe a pork chop.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.160
I forget which one that is.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.900
I made a basic marinade,
some oil and some vinegar

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:32.150
and some flavorings and mixed
in some green food coloring.

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:35.300
The green food
coloring went nowhere.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:39.530
Sucrose, sugar, garlic,
paprika, black pepper, these

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:41.610
are huge molecules.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:43.560
They cannot penetrate the meat.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.370
They can get into some pores
and cracks and crevices

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:47.470
on the surface.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:50.250
They cannot get
deep into the meat.

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:55.570
The only thing, the only
thing, that goes deep into meat

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:59.180
is salt. Salt is magic.

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.290
Salt is the magic rock.

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:03.800
It's sodium and chloride.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.615
And when they get wet, they
get electrically charged.

00:48:06.615 --> 00:48:08.020
They create ions.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.030
And they move.

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.950
And they go down.

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:12.690
And you can see
there's a pale line

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:16.150
just below the surface where
the salt has been penetrating.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:17.750
This was I think
five or six hours.

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:18.620
I forget how long.

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:19.990
But the salt goes on.

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:21.300
And it goes into the center.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.180
And salt works magic.

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.730
Salt attacks the
protein and denatures it

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:29.870
and changes its structure so
that it holds moisture longer.

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:33.240
So you want to salt your meat.

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:36.200
But when you put spices
and rubs or marinades

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.520
on the surface of the meat, they
don't go beyond the surface.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.070
They flavor the surface.

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:43.140
You get wonderful
flavors from them.

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.000
But they're not getting
into the center.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.560
And if we cook this up and
we took a core sample out

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.940
of the center,
you wouldn't taste

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.484
any of those spices and herbs.

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:57.422
Beer can chicken.

00:48:57.422 --> 00:49:01.920
Oh, I've gotten more
hate mail on this one.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.910
This is the one that gets
me the worst hate mail.

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:06.580
We don't have any
problem with trolls

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.930
and hate mail on the website.

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:11.000
We have no prescreening
of comments.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.010
People love barbecue.

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:14.040
They love to talk it,
except this-- well,

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.130
there's one other page,
the page that says

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:18.160
don't put ketchup on hot dogs.

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.560
It's a comedy piece.

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:20.520
It's a humor piece.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.620
It's got a whole bunch
of quotes from people.

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:26.730
I get more vile-- how
dare you tell me not

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:28.050
to put ketchup on hot dogs?

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:28.560
It's a joke.

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.560
It's a joke.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.320
It really is.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.420
You can tell it's a joke.

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.560
Anybody with a
sense of humor-- I

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.101
think if you put
ketchup on hot dogs,

00:49:34.101 --> 00:49:35.893
it takes away your
sense of humor.

00:49:35.893 --> 00:49:38.291
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:38.791 --> 00:49:42.180
I don't know.

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.960
Beer can chicken.

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.060
Everybody know what
a beer koozie is?

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:50.550
A little piece of foam rubber
that you put around a beer can,

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:53.810
and it's supposed to
keep your beer cold?

00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:56.930
What do you think a 38 degree
three and a half pound chicken

00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:57.950
is?

00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:00.430
It's a chicken koozie.

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:02.420
It keeps the beer cold.

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:04.280
You put it up the
butt of the chicken.

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.140
And now you have a
large thermal mass

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.810
that comes out of the
refrigerator at 38 degrees.

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:13.900
The beer never gets beyond
the temperature of the meat.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.940
It can't.

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:16.300
It doesn't boil.

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.790
It doesn't steam.

00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:20.220
Steaming temperature
is 212 degrees.

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:24.460
If you cook the meat
safely to 160-165 degrees,

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:29.590
the beer rarely goes above 150.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.540
If you overcook
the hell out of it,

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:34.040
blacken it, and take it
up to 190 or something,

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.100
the beer still won't
go over 190 degrees.

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:37.910
It can't boil.

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:40.330
You weigh the can
before, you weigh the can

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:42.210
after, it weighs the same.

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:45.000
In fact, in a few
cases, when we tried it,

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.400
we weighed the can after it.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.910
It actually weighed
more because the fat

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:51.849
from the chicken dripped into
the can, coated the surface,

00:50:51.849 --> 00:50:53.640
and of course, that
went further to prevent

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.840
the beer from evaporating.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.510
So beer can chicken is cool.

00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:58.330
It looks cool.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:50:59.788
I mean, doesn't
that little chicken

00:50:59.788 --> 00:51:02.800
sitting there looking like
a human being look cool?

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.860
But then the beer can
chicken devotees say,

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:07.030
but everybody loves
my beer can chicken.

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.740
It's so good.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.020
It's delicious.

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:10.210
Of course it's delicious.

00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:11.450
It's roast chicken.

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:13.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.740
Everybody loves roast chicken.

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:19.660
It's hard to mess up roast
chicken unless you overcook it.

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:22.690
Only it's not roasted
as well as it could be.

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:25.710
If you take the beer can out,
warm air will enter the center.

00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:28.200
And it will cook from the
inside as well as the outside.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.360
You won't over
cook the exterior.

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:33.910
In fact, for me, I'll
cut it into quarters.

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:35.540
Cut it up into pieces.

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.220
Cook the pieces separately.

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:41.340
That way, you can brown both
sides, not just the exterior.

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.820
You can get maximum brown.

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:45.380
And you can temp
each piece of meat

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:47.490
individually and get
each piece of meat

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:50.100
off at the optimum temperature.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.370
So beer can chicken
may be delicious.

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:55.250
But it's far from the best
way of cooking chicken.

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:58.040
It does look cool though.

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.150
Anybody hate me now?

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:01.000
Somebody out there?

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.150
Somebody left a minute ago.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.260
He was really upset.

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:05.760
He was really
upset I could tell.

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.280
No.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.770
Another one-- I'm
running out of time here.

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:11.620
I got to wrap this
up real quick.

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:13.440
Lump charcoal is better.

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.650
It looks natural.

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:18.100
It looks like God
gave us this charcoal.

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:20.380
Briquettes look like somebody
made them in a factory.

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:21.210
Well, they did.

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:23.830
But I tell you, the
briquettes are just

00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:25.050
as good, if not better.

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:27.420
And there's a whole
bunch of reasons.

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:32.150
And among them is the
process of making charcoal

00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:34.180
means carbonizing the wood.

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:36.070
And if you don't
carbonize it thoroughly,

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:39.380
which is a problem when you
make it from lump charcoal,

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.727
it can belch out a lot of smoke.

00:52:40.727 --> 00:52:42.810
And you don't know where
the smoke is coming from,

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:43.950
what the wood is.

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:47.360
I want to control the wood
flavor by choosing my own wood.

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:48.550
Charcoal is for heat.

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:50.130
Wood is for flavor.

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:53.630
So I much prefer
briquettes because they're

00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:56.110
known entities of heat.

00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:59.060
I really can't take much more
time to talk about this later.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:04.240
And my final myth is
barbecue is for guys.

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.780
There are more and
more women now.

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.590
Our Google Analytics
are telling us

00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:12.872
that we're running
around 75% to 80% male.

00:53:12.872 --> 00:53:14.330
So it's still a
backyard guy thing.

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:16.710
And I don't know why for sure.

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:18.170
I know this.

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:19.840
The anthropologists,
the scientists

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:25.530
tell us that homo erectus were
the first of our ancestors

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:26.230
to cook.

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:29.160
Homo erectus, the
guys were the hunters.

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:32.660
And the girls were
the pit masters.

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:35.420
The first women were the pit
masters, or pit mistresses,

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.160
if you will.

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:42.280
How they ceded the control over
fire to men, maybe the same way

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.790
they lost control over
the remote control.

00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:46.582
I don't know how this happened.

00:53:46.582 --> 00:53:48.540
I do know that we're
seeing more and more women

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.130
cooking outdoors.

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:53.130
I think part of it
is that women just

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:55.310
want guys to have their fun.

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:56.220
Have their space.

00:53:56.220 --> 00:54:00.350
Let them think they're
doing something useful,

00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:02.250
that they're actually cooking.

00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:04.320
They're contributing
to the family welfare.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.708
Sort of like faking
orgasm I think.

00:54:06.708 --> 00:54:09.048
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:11.720
But more and more
women are grilling.

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.710
And I say, let them have it.

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:15.470
That's less work for me.

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:18.300
All right, well that
covers my-- there

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.200
are more myths than
that in the book.

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.377
There's a lot more
than this in the book.

00:54:22.377 --> 00:54:24.460
I hope we had some fun and
answered some questions

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:25.990
and busted a few of your myths.

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:27.650
Do we have more questions?

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:30.140
I think we've got a
couple minutes left.

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.270
Well, we started
five minutes late.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.770
Yes, sir?

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:34.220
Oh, wait.

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:34.550
That's right.

00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:36.432
I was told to ask you to go to
the microphone with questions.

00:54:36.432 --> 00:54:37.598
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:54:37.598 --> 00:54:41.360
So I recently-- actually, it
wasn't that recently ago--

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:43.610
but I was asking this
Argentinian guy like,

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:46.540
how come in Argentina you
are such famous pit masters?

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.900
And yet your steaks
are always well done?

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.674
And his answer was like, well,
that's just because here they

00:54:51.674 --> 00:54:53.840
don't really understand how
to cook well-done steaks

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:55.629
in a way that is delicious.

00:54:55.629 --> 00:54:56.670
What's your take on this?

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:58.930
Can you cook well-done steaks
in a way that's delicious?

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:00.390
Do they really have
something over us there.

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:01.390
MEATHEAD GOLDWYN: No.

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:03.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:06.980
Yeah, it can be delicious.

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:09.130
The flavor can be
on the surface.

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:11.620
But we know that when
you well cook a steak,

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:14.730
the water evaporates.

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:15.370
It dries out.

00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:20.080
It also chemically binds to
the compounds on the interior,

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.990
and it gets really dry and hard.

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:24.680
So I mean, if you go
into a steak house

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.790
where they have a
really beautiful USDA

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:30.460
prime or wagyu steaks
and they're aged,

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.460
and you ask for a
well-done, you'd

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:34.470
probably get a
cheaper grade of steak

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:38.190
than everybody
else at the table.

00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:39.720
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.736
Forgive me, I didn't
see the gentleman.

00:55:41.736 --> 00:55:43.360
AUDIENCE: While you
were trying to bust

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.734
the myths about
grilling, you had

00:55:44.734 --> 00:55:46.720
to come across a few
that were actually true.

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.670
Was there any that you think are
really, really useful that we

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:50.046
should continue to adhere to?

00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:53.920
MEATHEAD GOLDWYN: Gosh.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:56:02.000
Well, I think that the
general overall view

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.730
that anything you cook indoors,
you can go outdoors only better

00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:05.900
is a good one.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:06.570
I like that.

00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:10.610
I mean, it is just
an outdoor oven.

00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:14.160
But you've got this extra
element of open flame and smoke

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.530
that really adds to
the flavor compounds.

00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:20.230
I mean, there's a lot of what
we've been taught that is true.

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:22.360
That does work.

00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:25.060
I think briquettes, you know,
they've been around forever.

00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:27.090
I think briquettes are
better than lump charcoal

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:28.131
for a variety of reasons.

00:56:28.131 --> 00:56:29.200
We ran out of time.

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:32.002
But yeah, I'm drawing
a blank for others.

00:56:32.002 --> 00:56:33.210
But the book is full of them.

00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:35.950
You have to buy the book.

00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:39.051
AUDIENCE: OK, so
just this year, we

00:56:39.051 --> 00:56:41.050
have a place where we can
actually have a grill.

00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:42.014
And we got one.

00:56:42.014 --> 00:56:43.680
And there was this
big debate between me

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.965
and my boyfriend over
like gas versus charcoal

00:56:45.965 --> 00:56:47.090
and all this kind of stuff.

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:50.460
Ultimately, for various
reasons, we went with gas.

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:54.300
But you were talking about how
some people with gas grills,

00:56:54.300 --> 00:57:00.030
they put the wood in like
foil or something like that.

00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:02.830
If there's not like a
specific slot on your grill

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:05.160
like there are for some,
where do you put it?

00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:07.594
Do you put it down below the
flames, on top of the grates?

00:57:07.594 --> 00:57:10.010
MEATHEAD GOLDWYN: On top of
the heating elements, as close

00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:12.571
as you can to the heating
elements so they'll combust.

00:57:12.571 --> 00:57:13.070
AUDIENCE: OK

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:17.740
MEATHEAD GOLDWYN: And you can
get a disposable aluminum pan.

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:22.180
I have an old cast iron pan
that I throw down in there.

00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:24.320
Find something that will
hold the wood that you can

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.229
put right down on the burners.

00:57:26.229 --> 00:57:27.270
Get it as hot as you can.

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:29.660
By the way, I'll sign books
if you're buying them.

00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:32.589
I'll hang out and sign books for
you if they'll let me hang out.

00:57:32.589 --> 00:57:33.130
I don't know.

00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:35.000
Can I hang out?

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.882
Tell me if I can no
longer take questions.

00:57:36.882 --> 00:57:37.382
Can I Chris?

00:57:37.382 --> 00:57:38.607
CHRIS: Last one.

00:57:38.607 --> 00:57:40.190
MEATHEAD GOLDWYN:
Well, we've got two.

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:41.150
CHRIS: [INAUDIBLE] waiting.

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:42.432
MEATHEAD GOLDWYN: OK, go ahead.

00:57:42.432 --> 00:57:42.973
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:57:42.973 --> 00:57:44.290
So I'm curious.

00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:48.540
What's a better grill--
Weber, Green Egg, Kenmore?

00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:52.282
Do you have like a
favorite preference?

00:57:52.282 --> 00:57:53.740
MEATHEAD GOLDWYN:
I have favorites.

00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:56.120
I have this guy, Max,
who tests grills.

00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.290
And he's the real expert on it.

00:57:58.290 --> 00:58:02.100
Weber is just as good as
gold, always reliable.

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.480
They have inventory parts--
parts inventory going back

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.510
decades.

00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:08.840
Something breaks, they're
there to help you.

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:10.060
I love their products.

00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:12.050
They're not always
the latest, keenest.

00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:13.740
Some of the coolest
new developments

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.194
are by other manufacturers.

00:58:15.194 --> 00:58:17.360
But I don't think you'll
ever go wrong with a Weber.

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:19.180
And they all work well.

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:20.360
Big Green Eggs are nice.

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:23.010
They're a very different
concept, very different

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:25.270
thermodynamic properties.

00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:29.450
I think of them as better
smokers than grills.

00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:31.820
They're great pizza ovens.

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:35.240
They cook really well
in cold climates.

00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.570
Not my all time favorite.

00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:40.355
I know Green Egg people
are rabid about them.

00:58:40.355 --> 00:58:41.730
And if there's
one in here, he'll

00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:44.820
probably jump up on the
stage and strangle me.

00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:47.890
But they're not my
all time favorite.

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:51.120
And Kenmore, I'm
not too familiar

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.930
with the various
models that they make.

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:54.925
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:58:54.925 --> 00:58:55.800
MEATHEAD GOLDWYN: OK.

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:56.950
Well, thank you very much.

00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:59.290
And if you did buy a book, I'd
be happy to sign it for you.

00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:00.206
CHRIS: That was great.

00:59:00.206 --> 00:59:01.000
Super educational.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:01.870
Thank you very much, Meathead.

00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:03.036
MEATHEAD GOLDWYN: Thank you.

00:59:03.036 --> 00:59:05.220
