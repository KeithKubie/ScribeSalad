technical debt that has been building up

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
technical debt that has been building up
 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.650
technical debt that has been building up
in the support library so we're on

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
in the support library so we're on
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.450
in the support library so we're on
Twitter we're on Stack Overflow

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
Twitter we're on Stack Overflow
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.670
Twitter we're on Stack Overflow
we're on reddit maybe we're on reddit a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680
we're on reddit maybe we're on reddit a
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.529
we're on reddit maybe we're on reddit a
little bit too much but we noticed some

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
little bit too much but we noticed some
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.180
little bit too much but we noticed some
basic aspects of the support library

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
basic aspects of the support library
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.549
basic aspects of the support library
there were a little bit let's say messy

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
there were a little bit let's say messy
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.250
there were a little bit let's say messy
so we've reached out and spoken with

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260
so we've reached out and spoken with
 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.080
so we've reached out and spoken with
developers and try to find out some ways

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
developers and try to find out some ways
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.000
developers and try to find out some ways
that we can improve the basics of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010
that we can improve the basics of
 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.439
that we can improve the basics of
support library and lay a strong

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
support library and lay a strong
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.130
support library and lay a strong
foundation for future work and we got a

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140
foundation for future work and we got a
 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.049
foundation for future work and we got a
lot of good feedback some very

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
lot of good feedback some very
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.170
lot of good feedback some very
high-level some very specific we know

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
high-level some very specific we know
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.490
high-level some very specific we know
about the issues with showing and hiding

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
about the issues with showing and hiding
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.890
about the issues with showing and hiding
the I mean but we drilled down to the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
the I mean but we drilled down to the
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.700
the I mean but we drilled down to the
basics we got feedback on our maven

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
basics we got feedback on our maven
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.530
basics we got feedback on our maven
packaging so our artifact and package

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540
packaging so our artifact and package
 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.920
packaging so our artifact and package
names our Java packages have become a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
names our Java packages have become a
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.749
names our Java packages have become a
little bit confusing as support library

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759
little bit confusing as support library
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.499
little bit confusing as support library
has aged and in general we built up a

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509
has aged and in general we built up a
 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.050
has aged and in general we built up a
lot of technical debt so like last year

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
lot of technical debt so like last year
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.390
lot of technical debt so like last year
we're going to talk about what's old in

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400
we're going to talk about what's old in
 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.890
we're going to talk about what's old in
the android support library first so we

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
the android support library first so we
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.120
the android support library first so we
started in 2011 with support v4 and as

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
started in 2011 with support v4 and as
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.260
started in 2011 with support v4 and as
I'm sure everyone here knows that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
I'm sure everyone here knows that
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.910
I'm sure everyone here knows that
provided backward compatibility for

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
provided backward compatibility for
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.429
provided backward compatibility for
devices running SDK for the first public

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
devices running SDK for the first public
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.940
devices running SDK for the first public
release of Android and we grew we gained

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
release of Android and we grew we gained
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.539
release of Android and we grew we gained
libraries for watched components car

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
libraries for watched components car
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.740
libraries for watched components car
components testing support for SDK 13

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
components testing support for SDK 13
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.639
components testing support for SDK 13
for 11 so we have a lot more than just

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
for 11 so we have a lot more than just
 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.690
for 11 so we have a lot more than just
backwards compatibility now but we still

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
backwards compatibility now but we still
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.810
backwards compatibility now but we still
got these artifact names so we've got

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
got these artifact names so we've got
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.760
got these artifact names so we've got
support v4 everyone's familiar with that

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770
support v4 everyone's familiar with that
 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.760
support v4 everyone's familiar with that
support V 13 who knows what's in support

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770

uh literally less than 10 people Armas

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090
uh literally less than 10 people Armas
 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.150
uh literally less than 10 people Armas
knows so support v13 at this moment

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160
knows so support v13 at this moment
 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.030
knows so support v13 at this moment
contains nothing because our minimum SDK

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040
contains nothing because our minimum SDK
 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.420
contains nothing because our minimum SDK
for everything is 14 V 13 just redirects

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430
for everything is 14 V 13 just redirects
 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.390
for everything is 14 V 13 just redirects
to V 4 V 4 actually redirects to a bunch

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400
to V 4 V 4 actually redirects to a bunch
 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.860
to V 4 V 4 actually redirects to a bunch
of other components these are both just

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870
of other components these are both just
 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.490
of other components these are both just
umbrella artifacts on maven so why do we

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500
umbrella artifacts on maven so why do we
 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.949
umbrella artifacts on maven so why do we
have all of these weird versioning names

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959
have all of these weird versioning names
 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.870
have all of these weird versioning names
in our maven artifacts and in our

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880
in our maven artifacts and in our
 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.390
in our maven artifacts and in our
package names well they're kind of hard

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400
package names well they're kind of hard
 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.430
package names well they're kind of hard
to change but these are confusing it's

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440
to change but these are confusing it's
 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.050
to change but these are confusing it's
not a great place to start if you're new

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060
not a great place to start if you're new
 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.380
not a great place to start if you're new
to Android development we also have a

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390
to Android development we also have a
 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.789
to Android development we also have a
lot of versions of all of these

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799
lot of versions of all of these
 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.039
lot of versions of all of these
libraries so recommendation is something

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049
libraries so recommendation is something
 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.979
libraries so recommendation is something
that was added back in 23 and hasn't

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989
that was added back in 23 and hasn't
 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.199
that was added back in 23 and hasn't
changed a lot since then so we have 30

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209
changed a lot since then so we have 30
 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.509
changed a lot since then so we have 30
versions of basically the exact same

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519
versions of basically the exact same
 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.880
versions of basically the exact same
library and what does the versioning

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890
library and what does the versioning
 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.949
library and what does the versioning
scheme mean here well 24 means it was

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959
scheme mean here well 24 means it was
 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.100
scheme mean here well 24 means it was
released when at Google i/o when SDK 24

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110
released when at Google i/o when SDK 24
 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.289
released when at Google i/o when SDK 24
came out we had an alpha one

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299
came out we had an alpha one
 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.970
came out we had an alpha one
corresponding with the pub first public

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980
corresponding with the pub first public
 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.960
corresponding with the pub first public
release DP 1 alpha 2 4 DP 2 beta 1 4 DP

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970
release DP 1 alpha 2 4 DP 2 beta 1 4 DP
 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.690
release DP 1 alpha 2 4 DP 2 beta 1 4 DP
3 but it doesn't make a lot of sense for

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700
3 but it doesn't make a lot of sense for
 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.390
3 but it doesn't make a lot of sense for
us to be corresponding to just the i/o

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400
us to be corresponding to just the i/o
 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.069
us to be corresponding to just the i/o
releases wouldn't it be great if we had

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079
releases wouldn't it be great if we had
 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.500
releases wouldn't it be great if we had
alpha and beta releases for every

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510
alpha and beta releases for every
 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.060
alpha and beta releases for every
version of the support library and

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070
version of the support library and
 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.440
version of the support library and
wouldn't it be great if we didn't have

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450
wouldn't it be great if we didn't have
 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.479
wouldn't it be great if we didn't have
to do that for every single library even

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489
to do that for every single library even
 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.539
to do that for every single library even
if it hadn't changed so you may have

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549
if it hadn't changed so you may have
 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.990
if it hadn't changed so you may have
seen like a 2400 that should have had a

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000
seen like a 2400 that should have had a
 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.430
seen like a 2400 that should have had a
little bit more testing maybe there

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440
little bit more testing maybe there
 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.620
little bit more testing maybe there
should have been a beta 2 there or maybe

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630
should have been a beta 2 there or maybe
 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.949
should have been a beta 2 there or maybe
you pulled in 25.4 and found some bugs

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959
you pulled in 25.4 and found some bugs
 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.930
you pulled in 25.4 and found some bugs
that really should have been an alpha so

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940
that really should have been an alpha so
 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.400
that really should have been an alpha so
we've been doing a lot better about

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410
we've been doing a lot better about
 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.560
we've been doing a lot better about

that we did last year where we split out

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540
that we did last year where we split out
 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.210

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200
artifacts we've done that again this
 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.740
artifacts we've done that again this
year so we have smaller artifacts if you

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750
year so we have smaller artifacts if you
 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.570

need view pager you just pull in view

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580
need view pager you just pull in view
 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.370
need view pager you just pull in view
pager you don't pull in a bunch of other

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380

so if you pull in support v4 you still

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510
so if you pull in support v4 you still
 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.360
so if you pull in support v4 you still
get all of that umbrella of libraries if

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370
get all of that umbrella of libraries if
 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.250
get all of that umbrella of libraries if
you pull in core UI you still get view

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260
you pull in core UI you still get view
 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.200
you pull in core UI you still get view
pager and everything else but you also

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210
pager and everything else but you also
 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.610
pager and everything else but you also
have the option of just pulling in

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620
have the option of just pulling in
 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.890
have the option of just pulling in
exactly what you need so here's the

exactly what you need so here's the
 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.960
exactly what you need so here's the
split of the libraries this is just a

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970
split of the libraries this is just a
 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.210
split of the libraries this is just a
sample so you'll see that support compat

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220
sample so you'll see that support compat
 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.120

all the way up until 2.0 we're also
 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.910
all the way up until 2.0 we're also
going to be doing per artifact

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:37.920
going to be doing per artifact
 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.560
going to be doing per artifact
versioning and release so instead of a

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:39.570
versioning and release so instead of a
 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.870
versioning and release so instead of a
monolithic release if we have a bug fix

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:41.880
monolithic release if we have a bug fix
 

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.540

for recycler view we release a dot one

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:44.550
for recycler view we release a dot one
 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.820
for recycler view we release a dot one
of just the recycler view library you

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:46.830
of just the recycler view library you
 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.410
of just the recycler view library you
only have to pull in one new artifact

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:48.420
only have to pull in one new artifact
 

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.360
only have to pull in one new artifact
and if you don't need it you don't have

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.370
and if you don't need it you don't have
 

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.040
and if you don't need it you don't have
to pull it in so it's going to be very

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.050
to pull it in so it's going to be very
 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.780
to pull it in so it's going to be very
low effort on the part of the developer

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:55.790
 
 

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.040

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:51.910
explicit compiled SDK requirements so
 

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.930
explicit compiled SDK requirements so
our min SDK requirement is built in to

the requires API annotation so you may

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:01.149
the requires API annotation so you may
 

00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:04.050
the requires API annotation so you may
run into methods that require may return

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:04.060
run into methods that require may return
 

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.120
run into methods that require may return
a new object so you may see something

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:06.130
a new object so you may see something
 

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.829
a new object so you may see something
that returns compat something that

00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839
that returns compat something that
 

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.870
that returns compat something that
returns the actual object and you can

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:09.880
returns the actual object and you can
 

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.240
returns the actual object and you can
call that if you're on a newer platform

all right so let's step into an example
 

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.410
all right so let's step into an example
of that here's an example of some

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:19.420
of that here's an example of some
 

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.240
of that here's an example of some

quickly let's tick down on support

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240
quickly let's tick down on support
 

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.630

compat and card uv7 specifically and

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640
compat and card uv7 specifically and
 

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.000
compat and card uv7 specifically and
take a look at some of the classes so

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.010
take a look at some of the classes so
 

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:54.150

about Android build build system at 6:30
in in this room so hopefully you can go

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:07.810
in in this room so hopefully you can go
 

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:11.550
in in this room so hopefully you can go
and take a look at that so it's not all

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.560
and take a look at that so it's not all
 

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.650
and take a look at that so it's not all
about refactoring we also added new

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:13.660
about refactoring we also added new
 

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.500
about refactoring we also added new
features and I'm gonna talk you walk you

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:16.510
features and I'm gonna talk you walk you
 

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.019
features and I'm gonna talk you walk you
through some of these so the first

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:19.029
through some of these so the first
 

00:16:19.029 --> 00:16:20.190
through some of these so the first
feature I want to talk about is the

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:20.200
feature I want to talk about is the
 

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.320
feature I want to talk about is the
recycler view selection and this is a

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:22.330
recycler view selection and this is a
 

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.970
recycler view selection and this is a
library that will allow you to handle

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:23.980
library that will allow you to handle
 

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.090
library that will allow you to handle
item selection a lot easier it will help

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:27.100
item selection a lot easier it will help
 

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.530
item selection a lot easier it will help
you handle motion events and touch

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:28.540
you handle motion events and touch
 

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.480
you handle motion events and touch
events and convert them into selection

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:30.490
events and convert them into selection
 

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.670
events and convert them into selection
in the recycler view this is a fairly

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680
in the recycler view this is a fairly
 

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.070
in the recycler view this is a fairly
flexible library where allows for custom

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:35.080
flexible library where allows for custom
 

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.960
flexible library where allows for custom
layout managers and a lot of custom

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:36.970
layout managers and a lot of custom
 

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:38.880
layout managers and a lot of custom
actions that you can do with so let's

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:38.890
actions that you can do with so let's
 

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.860
actions that you can do with so let's
jump through and see how you use it as

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:40.870
jump through and see how you use it as
 

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.630
jump through and see how you use it as
you can imagine you add a new dependency

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:42.640
you can imagine you add a new dependency
 

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.329
you can imagine you add a new dependency
to your build our Gradle file and the

00:16:45.329 --> 00:16:45.339
to your build our Gradle file and the
 

00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:47.280
to your build our Gradle file and the
important thing to note here is that we

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:47.290
important thing to note here is that we
 

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:48.860
important thing to note here is that we
are using the new Android X our

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:48.870
are using the new Android X our
 

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.980
are using the new Android X our
fact this is the same stuff that Alan

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:51.990
fact this is the same stuff that Alan
 

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.220
fact this is the same stuff that Alan
was talking about so for the set up what

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:55.230
was talking about so for the set up what
 

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.840
was talking about so for the set up what
you need to do is you want to create a

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:56.850
you need to do is you want to create a
 

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.560
you need to do is you want to create a
new layout a new adapter and the adapter

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:00.570
new layout a new adapter and the adapter
 

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:01.970
new layout a new adapter and the adapter
the important thing is that it uses

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980
the important thing is that it uses
 

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.670
the important thing is that it uses
stable IDs we're using a stock grid

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:04.680
stable IDs we're using a stock grid
 

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.559
stable IDs we're using a stock grid
layout manager and we set both of these

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:06.569
layout manager and we set both of these
 

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:08.120
layout manager and we set both of these
on the recycler view there is no

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:08.130
on the recycler view there is no
 

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.309
on the recycler view there is no
selection code just yet we're just doing

00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319
selection code just yet we're just doing
 

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.710
selection code just yet we're just doing
the basic recycling we set up the

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720
the basic recycling we set up the
 

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.110
the basic recycling we set up the
adapter as I said again nothing super

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120
adapter as I said again nothing super
 

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.970
adapter as I said again nothing super
exciting the only important thing here

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:16.980
exciting the only important thing here
 

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.429
exciting the only important thing here
is that we're doing stable IDs and this

00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439
is that we're doing stable IDs and this
 

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:21.230
is that we're doing stable IDs and this
allows for a consistent mapping from ID

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240
allows for a consistent mapping from ID
 

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.500
allows for a consistent mapping from ID
to the item and then next when we jump

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:24.510
to the item and then next when we jump
 

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.540
to the item and then next when we jump
back to the activity we stopped setup

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:26.550
back to the activity we stopped setup
 

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:28.549
back to the activity we stopped setup
selections library sees key provider and

00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559
selections library sees key provider and
 

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:31.549
selections library sees key provider and
this in conjunction the stable IDs will

00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559
this in conjunction the stable IDs will
 

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:33.200
this in conjunction the stable IDs will
allow for a quick mapping between the

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:33.210
allow for a quick mapping between the
 

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:36.260
allow for a quick mapping between the
IDs and the items that will handle the

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:36.270
IDs and the items that will handle the
 

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.020
IDs and the items that will handle the
selection by the selection library and

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:39.030
selection by the selection library and
 

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.480
selection by the selection library and
now what we need to setup is the

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:41.490
now what we need to setup is the
 

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.160
now what we need to setup is the
selection tracker which actually is the

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:43.170
selection tracker which actually is the
 

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.320
selection tracker which actually is the
actual machinery behind the scenes and

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:45.330
actual machinery behind the scenes and
 

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.540
actual machinery behind the scenes and
we pass in recyclerview the key provider

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:47.550
we pass in recyclerview the key provider
 

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.070
we pass in recyclerview the key provider
both of these that we just created and

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080
both of these that we just created and
 

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.650
both of these that we just created and
in my details look up and my detailed

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:51.660
in my details look up and my detailed
 

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.270
in my details look up and my detailed
lookup is actually a fairly simple class

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280
lookup is actually a fairly simple class
 

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.340
lookup is actually a fairly simple class
you need to overwrite only one method

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:55.350
you need to overwrite only one method
 

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.200
you need to overwrite only one method
and then the sight of that one you

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:57.210
and then the sight of that one you
 

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.310
and then the sight of that one you
retain it returned item details and that

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320
retain it returned item details and that
 

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.750
retain it returned item details and that
returns the position and the selection

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760
returns the position and the selection
 

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.440
returns the position and the selection
key for the item that is for the given

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:06.450
key for the item that is for the given
 

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.190
key for the item that is for the given
motion event and finally recyclerview

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200
motion event and finally recyclerview
 

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.440
motion event and finally recyclerview
has no default selection mechanism so

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:12.450
has no default selection mechanism so
 

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.549
has no default selection mechanism so
what you have to do is you have to

00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559
what you have to do is you have to
 

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:16.160
what you have to do is you have to
handle it or non bind so there you might

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:16.170
handle it or non bind so there you might
 

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.419
handle it or non bind so there you might
want to change the background of the

00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:17.429
want to change the background of the
 

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:19.820
want to change the background of the
view or you can use it by setting

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:19.830
view or you can use it by setting
 

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.340
view or you can use it by setting
activated state and to get activated

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:22.350
activated state and to get activated
 

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.040
activated state and to get activated
state working you use background for the

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:25.050
state working you use background for the
 

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.680
state working you use background for the
view and that background is a selectable

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:27.690
view and that background is a selectable
 

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.390
view and that background is a selectable
drawable that has an activated state

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400
drawable that has an activated state
 

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.210
drawable that has an activated state
which will allow to indicate to user

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:32.220
which will allow to indicate to user
 

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.840

library to import is slices core that

00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399
library to import is slices core that
 

00:26:20.399 --> 00:26:22.549

contains methods for permissions so to
 

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:24.169
contains methods for permissions so to
build a slice you have to define a slice

00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179
build a slice you have to define a slice
 

00:26:24.179 --> 00:26:26.509
build a slice you have to define a slice
implement the slice and handles by

00:26:26.509 --> 00:26:26.519
implement the slice and handles by
 

00:26:26.519 --> 00:26:27.889
implement the slice and handles by
section let's take a look at how we can

00:26:27.889 --> 00:26:27.899
section let's take a look at how we can
 

00:26:27.899 --> 00:26:31.820
section let's take a look at how we can
do it so the first thing we need to do

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:31.830
do it so the first thing we need to do
 

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:35.690
do it so the first thing we need to do
is to let the system or other apps know

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:35.700
is to let the system or other apps know
 

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.489
is to let the system or other apps know
that you have slices to provide so you

00:26:37.489 --> 00:26:37.499
that you have slices to provide so you
 

00:26:37.499 --> 00:26:39.560
that you have slices to provide so you
do that by implementing your slice

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:39.570
do that by implementing your slice
 

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.080
do that by implementing your slice
provider so you register your flights

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:42.090
provider so you register your flights
 

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:43.999
provider so you register your flights
provider in your Android not manifest

00:26:43.999 --> 00:26:44.009
provider in your Android not manifest
 

00:26:44.009 --> 00:26:48.769
provider in your Android not manifest
file next you have to extend from the

00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:48.779
file next you have to extend from the
 

00:26:48.779 --> 00:26:50.899
file next you have to extend from the
slice provider and implement your slice

00:26:50.899 --> 00:26:50.909
slice provider and implement your slice
 

00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:52.849
slice provider and implement your slice
provider you can have multiple slices

00:26:52.849 --> 00:26:52.859
provider you can have multiple slices
 

00:26:52.859 --> 00:26:55.159
provider you can have multiple slices
for your app so this is where the

00:26:55.159 --> 00:26:55.169
for your app so this is where the
 

00:26:55.169 --> 00:26:58.090
for your app so this is where the
business logic happens when when a

00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:58.100
business logic happens when when a
 

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.499
business logic happens when when a
platform or another app once you call

00:27:00.499 --> 00:27:00.509
platform or another app once you call
 

00:27:00.509 --> 00:27:03.049
platform or another app once you call
get your slices you get a call on unbind

00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.059
get your slices you get a call on unbind
 

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:06.470
get your slices you get a call on unbind
slice there you get a you get a call

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480
slice there you get a you get a call
 

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.849
slice there you get a you get a call
with the URI of the slice being

00:27:07.849 --> 00:27:07.859
with the URI of the slice being
 

00:27:07.859 --> 00:27:09.830
with the URI of the slice being
requested and you you have to return

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840
requested and you you have to return
 

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.169
requested and you you have to return
your slicing immediately so any Content

00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:12.179
your slicing immediately so any Content
 

00:27:12.179 --> 00:27:13.489
your slicing immediately so any Content
that needs to be loaded should be kicked

00:27:13.489 --> 00:27:13.499
that needs to be loaded should be kicked
 

00:27:13.499 --> 00:27:15.349
that needs to be loaded should be kicked
off and you would return it and don't

00:27:15.349 --> 00:27:15.359
off and you would return it and don't
 

00:27:15.359 --> 00:27:17.720
off and you would return it and don't
slice so let's take a deeper look and

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:17.730
slice so let's take a deeper look and
 

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.759
slice so let's take a deeper look and
we're gonna construct the slice here

00:27:19.759 --> 00:27:19.769
we're gonna construct the slice here
 

00:27:19.769 --> 00:27:22.609
we're gonna construct the slice here
and with we get able to construct it

00:27:22.609 --> 00:27:22.619
and with we get able to construct it
 

00:27:22.619 --> 00:27:24.529
and with we get able to construct it
with several builded classes including

00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:24.539
with several builded classes including
 

00:27:24.539 --> 00:27:26.509
with several builded classes including
broke builder brick road builder and

00:27:26.509 --> 00:27:26.519
broke builder brick road builder and
 

00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:29.779
broke builder brick road builder and
list builder so let's take a look so

00:27:29.779 --> 00:27:29.789
list builder so let's take a look so
 

00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:32.930
list builder so let's take a look so
here we go use the list builder to add a

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:32.940
here we go use the list builder to add a
 

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.599
here we go use the list builder to add a
very simple header the header contains a

00:27:35.599 --> 00:27:35.609
very simple header the header contains a
 

00:27:35.609 --> 00:27:36.140
very simple header the header contains a
title and

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:36.150
title and
 

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.700
title and
subtitle and you see the method add

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:37.710
subtitle and you see the method add
 

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:42.080
subtitle and you see the method add
header that adds the header then to

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:42.090
header that adds the header then to
 

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:44.270
header that adds the header then to
build on top of it we can use the grid

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:44.280
build on top of it we can use the grid
 

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.910
build on top of it we can use the grid
road builder first we get to the latest

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:46.920
road builder first we get to the latest
 

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.920
road builder first we get to the latest
weather information and then we can loop

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:48.930
weather information and then we can loop
 

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.810
weather information and then we can loop
through it adding a cell to the grid

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820
through it adding a cell to the grid
 

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.450
through it adding a cell to the grid
road builder and by just calling ed grid

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.460
road builder and by just calling ed grid
 

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.750
road builder and by just calling ed grid
row at the bottom we append the rest of

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760
row at the bottom we append the rest of
 

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.600
row at the bottom we append the rest of
the slice to the header so what will you

00:27:59.600 --> 00:27:59.610
the slice to the header so what will you
 

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.960
the slice to the header so what will you
get here is that based on screen real

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:02.970

uses these attributes it can also pick
 

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:44.880
uses these attributes it can also pick
up the theme so let's take a look at

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:44.890
up the theme so let's take a look at
 

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:45.990
up the theme so let's take a look at
some of the components that we've

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000
some of the components that we've
 

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.140
some of the components that we've
updated first off is text field we've

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:49.150
updated first off is text field we've
 

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.490
updated first off is text field we've
done a lot of research and we have

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:50.500
done a lot of research and we have
 

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.620
done a lot of research and we have
improved the touch target making it more

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:52.630

usable and accessible
we've also added new States to it which

00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440
we've also added new States to it which
 

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.770
we've also added new States to it which
includes focus State Aero State disabled

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:01.780
includes focus State Aero State disabled
 

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.480
includes focus State Aero State disabled
and text counter so we've kind of think

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:06.490
and text counter so we've kind of think
 

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:08.040
and text counter so we've kind of think
through all of it from the start to make

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:08.050
through all of it from the start to make
 

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:12.120
through all of it from the start to make

providing two updated bars for you the

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:36.100
providing two updated bars for you the
 

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.400
providing two updated bars for you the
first is the bottom app bar the bottom

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:38.410
first is the bottom app bar the bottom
 

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:41.820
first is the bottom app bar the bottom
app bar allows you to add app actions

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:41.830
app bar allows you to add app actions
 

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:45.390
app bar allows you to add app actions
into your app and what we have done here

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:45.400
into your app and what we have done here
 

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.640
into your app and what we have done here
is that we have allowed you to we've

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:47.650
is that we have allowed you to we've
 

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.170
is that we have allowed you to we've
done research and saw that the phones

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:49.180
done research and saw that the phones
 

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.670
done research and saw that the phones
are bigger so we want to allow you to

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:50.680
are bigger so we want to allow you to
 

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.190
are bigger so we want to allow you to
position the your actions anywhere you

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200
position the your actions anywhere you
 

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.020
position the your actions anywhere you
want along the bottom app bar so here we

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:55.030
want along the bottom app bar so here we
 

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.630
want along the bottom app bar so here we
have a fab that is centered and then can

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:57.640
have a fab that is centered and then can
 

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.090
