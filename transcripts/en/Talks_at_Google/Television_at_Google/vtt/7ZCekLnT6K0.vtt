[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.976 --> 00:00:08.964
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:12.948
BD WONG: Hey.

00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:14.442
Hello, everybody.

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:14.942
JULIE: Hi.

00:00:14.942 --> 00:00:17.234
BD WONG: Julie, did you just
say that I would volunteer

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:18.540
to take selfies with everybody?

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.340
JULIE: Well, yes, kind of.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.340
BD WONG: Do you see how
many people are in here?

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.180
JULIE: Well, yeah.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.380
I mean, we're Google, so
we can be very efficient.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.420
We can streamline this process.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.970
[LAUGHS]

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.220
BD WONG: How about if we
take a selfie with one person

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.928
and then green screen
in everyone's face?

00:00:34.928 --> 00:00:36.530
JULIE: OK, we can
do that, for sure.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.450
All of the people that want
to be in that selfie, right?

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.575
BD WONG: No, I'm happy to
take selfies, it's just--

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:42.325
I'm just razzing you.

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:43.255
JULIE: OK, thank you.

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:46.180
Raz some more if you want, so.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.948
How are you?

00:00:46.948 --> 00:00:47.740
BD WONG: I'm great.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.160
JULIE: Yeah?

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.702
BD WONG: Yes.

00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:50.950
You know, I'm-- you said
this already, right?

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.580
I'm a native San Franciscan.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.710
So it's great to come home.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.393
And it's great for my mom to
come home and do a play in--

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:01.060
JULIE: Oh, yeah.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.768
BD WONG: My hometown
and stuff like that.

00:01:02.768 --> 00:01:06.940
It's not really-- it's a big
deal for my family, kind of.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:07.940
So I love it.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.010
And I love this theater.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.380
I've always loved this
particular theater--

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.060
American Conservatory
Theater, ACT.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.190
And I-- so this is a really
great kind of collaboration

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.380
with them that allows me to
have this hometown experience

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.750
and to do a play like
this one that I really--

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.720
I really believe a lot
in this particular play.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.790
JULIE: Yeah, so let's talk a
little bit more about the play.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.290
BD WONG: OK.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.790
JULIE: I got to see
it on Wednesday.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.768
It was fantastic.

00:01:34.768 --> 00:01:35.560
BD WONG: Oh, great.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.640
JULIE: Yeah.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.445
But I'm hoping more people here
and folks on the live stream

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:41.320
would come to see it.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.020
So can you tell us a
little bit about the show?

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.830
BD WONG: Yes.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.150
Well, Lauren-- Lauren
Yee is the playwright.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.600
Lauren Yee is also a
native San Franciscan.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.100
JULIE: Yes.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.600
BD WONG: If you know anything--

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.308
I mean, there was a
big article about her

00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:56.320
in the pink section on Sunday.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.380
But very briefly, she
really writes a lot

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.930
from her own experience
and her own family,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.880
and has written
two plays, in fact,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.090
that are inspired in one way
or another by her father.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.699
This particular play
is inspired by the fact

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.130
that her father played
basketball in Chinatown

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.250
in the early '70s and was
on a basketball team of kids

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.320
from San Francisco
Chinatown that

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.190
went to China to play exhibition
games throughout China.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.880
And so she's written a
play about a young, very

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.750
enthusiastic Asian-American
boy in high school

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.540
who, like, wills his way onto
the team to go play in China

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.180
and kind of have
this kind of what's

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.410
it like for an Asian-American
kid to go to China experience.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.450
And there's a lot
more to the play

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.760
and a lot more is
revealed in the play.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.000
But the play also centers
around the relationship

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.430
between two basketball
coaches, a Chinese basketball

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.170
coach and an American
basketball coach.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.830
And I play the Chinese
basketball coach.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.252
So that's it, basically.

00:02:57.252 --> 00:02:58.240
JULIE: OK, basically.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.030
BD WONG: And also
in its identity,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.590
it's a comedy with a really
strong emotional undercurrent,

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.780
which is very rare
in plays to me.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.910
I find the most
successful plays,

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.340
plays that are
successfully funny

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.530
and move you at the same time.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.640
Did you find it that way?

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.450
JULIE: I did, yes.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.720
And I find that Lauren's
work in particular, she just

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.970
did "King of the Yees" at
SF Playhouse, which is also

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.770
another story about Larry--

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.830
BD WONG: Yes.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.800
JULIE: --but I
really like her work

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.270
because she does straddle humor
and touching some soft points

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.580
about family relationships,
which I think

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.217
is really heartwarming
about her work.

00:03:35.217 --> 00:03:35.800
BD WONG: Yeah.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.008
She's really skilled in that.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.560
And the extra added--

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.537
I mean, I really--

00:03:39.537 --> 00:03:41.370
I'm here to sell tickets,
right, of course--

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.070
JULIE: Please.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.570
Please do.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.080
BD WONG: --but I
really-- do really,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.260
sincerely recommend
this experience

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.410
of seeing this play
in San Francisco.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.750
And also, it's too late
to see "King of the Yees"

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.370
at the San Francisco Playhouse,
but I would definitely

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.530
have recommended that.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.890
And when I went to see
it, "King of the Yees,"

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.860
I sat there thinking, how
was this play ever done

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.170
anywhere but in San Francisco?

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.610
The resonance was so strong.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.420
The places that she mentions,
the locations, the things

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.430
that we all know,
or that many of us

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.360
know that we draw from our
own childhood experiences

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.110
are really strong.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.810
And they're much stronger-- you
know, this play has been done--

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.190
"King of the Yees"
and "The Great Leap"

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.840
have been done all
over the country,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.060
but there's something really
special about seeing San

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.352
Francisco productions about it.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:30.750
They're going to be rare.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.590
It's not-- it's a
rare opportunity.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.880
But the one thing that I
think you might have noticed

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.560
is that the audiences
kind of like--

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.750
they just get such a
kick out of hearing

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.700
about things that they know.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.470
And that's not an experience
you can have that often.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.430
And I think one of the things
that regional theater does when

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.010
it's being successful
is connecting

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.120
to the community in a way that
this play, a local playwright

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.940
and a local actor,
can help them do.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.330
JULIE: Yes, I would agree.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.940
And it's even more special when
the audience can really relate

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.110
and visually see the locations.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.550
I mean, in "The Great Leap,"
it's USF, it's Chinatown.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.070
Galileo High School
is also mentioned.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.602
And so they're already
along the ride for you.

00:05:14.602 --> 00:05:16.060
There's not-- I
mean, you obviously

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.060
have to work for the story,
but it's kind of nice

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.550
when they're already with you.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.842
BD WONG: When they're already--

00:05:21.842 --> 00:05:22.580
absolutely.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.820
And I had the really
good experience

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.210
of doing this same play
in New York last year.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.490
And one of the major joys
of doing it again here

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.970
is my seeing the difference
of how the audience reacts

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.290
to certain things.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.840
And I love the way
the San Francisco

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.578
audience responds to the San
Francisconess of the play.

00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:47.120
You can feel it,
and you can hear it,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.840
and it's really exciting.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.630
There's a line in the play
where the American basketball

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.990
coach is telling the kid,
you know, I played and--

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.040
I went to China and I coached
the Chinese basketball players.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.470
And they don't want
to rough each other up

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.620
and they don't want
to touch each other.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.370
I'm paraphrasing, but
that's what he says.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.280
And the kid says, have you
ever been to Chinatown?

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.550
And that line is a very
perfectly funny line

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.500
in New York City,
but in San Francisco,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.330
the audience just loves it.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.500
They just love knowing that the
playwright really knows what--

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.127
JULIE: Yes.

00:06:22.127 --> 00:06:24.210
BD WONG: --pushy Chinese
people in Chinatown are--

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.076
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:25.076 --> 00:06:26.950
--on the 30 Stockton are like.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.942
JULIE: So true.

00:06:29.942 --> 00:06:31.760
So, so true.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.287
And you mentioned you did
this play in New York.

00:06:35.287 --> 00:06:36.870
And so this is the
second time around.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.280
What is it like to play the
character for the second time?

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.980
BD WONG: It's great.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.785
Whenever you do a play
in a different theater,

00:06:45.785 --> 00:06:46.910
it's going to be different.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.970
But this is even more
so different than that,

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.980
because it's a completely
different theater

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.480
company that did the play.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.150
It was completely different
director and different actors.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:02.180
So I'm the real only kind
of consistent thing in it.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.780
And the other big difference
is that the theater

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.880
was very small in New York.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.870
It was a 99 seat theater.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.750
And this is an
1,100 seat theater.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.125
And just technique-wise
and physically,

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:17.750
it's a completely
different production.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.040
It's a big set.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.860
This version is much
more like a Broadway show

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.320
than the one we did in New
York, where Broadway is.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.350
So that experience is
really a learning experience

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.980
for somebody like me,
because you're always

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.840
surprised at the
new things that you

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.810
can discover when the play is
opened up in a much bigger way.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:40.850
JULIE: Right.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.530
BD WONG: Lots of
things, like there's--

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.600
I have more costumes
in this production

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.260
than I had in the
first production.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.520
And usually you'd
think the play,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.700
the storytelling of the play
requires certain characters

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.980
to wear certain costumes
at certain times.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.670
And that's true, but I was able
to, because the theater was

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.268
so small, wear the same thing
throughout the entire play.

00:08:02.268 --> 00:08:04.310
And it worked really well,
because that character

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:09.200
was consistent throughout,
from 1971 to 1989.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.990
This time, because it's
so opened up and big,

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.210
when I walk off the stage
and I come back on again

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:15.680
and it's a different
time period,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.990
you kind of want to see
me dressed differently.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.865
JULIE: Yeah, you want
to see the progression.

00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:22.647
BD WONG: And so I was really
kind of thrown off at first.

00:08:22.647 --> 00:08:24.230
Like oh, I'm going
to wear all these--

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.030
like the first day they show
you all the sketches and stuff.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.520
And I was really
surprised at that.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.330
And then my mind had to
click over to, oh, I see.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.137
I see this differently now.

00:08:34.137 --> 00:08:36.679
And that is an example of a lot
of different things that have

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.669
happened-- the way you use your
voice and all of that stuff--

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:45.350
that are adjustments and
learning experiences.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.270
JULIE: How has it
been just performing

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.980
for some of the early audiences?

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.515
I saw it during a
dress rehearsal,

00:08:50.515 --> 00:08:53.750
so I know that was the
first time you were up.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:59.630
BD WONG: Well, a play like this
with a lot of fast language

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.012
and a lot of--

00:09:02.012 --> 00:09:03.470
at least one of
the four characters

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.820
in the play that has a lot of
movement, and a lot of staging.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.190
And then there's physical
elements in the production,

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.540
like moving scenery
and stuff like that.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.830
These things take
such time to iron out.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.110
And so there's never
been such a thing

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.440
as a perfectly brilliant
dress rehearsal,

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.840
because you're still
working things out.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.360
You can never be that ahead
of schedule that by the time

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.000
the audience comes,
it's all down.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.970
Your mind is always
processing things.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:37.890
So we did a pretty clean
skate on that dress rehearsal,

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.158
but the show has definitely
deepened and deepened

00:09:40.158 --> 00:09:40.700
and deepened.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.280
And we've done it maybe
six or seven times now.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.830
And it's almost--
it's pretty much

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:50.010
hit its stride as far as the
command that we have over it.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:50.552
JULIE: Right.

00:09:50.552 --> 00:09:52.343
BD WONG: And it's like
practicing anything,

00:09:52.343 --> 00:09:53.660
right, over and over again.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.395
The more you do it,
the better it gets.

00:09:56.395 --> 00:09:57.770
And with this kind
of play, which

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:02.520
is kind of deep and kind of full
of lots of details and stuff,

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.650
it's a kind of a
bottomless well, you know.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.110
You don't ever get bored of
it, because there's always

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.180
something new to
discover about it.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.535
JULIE: That's the beauty of
theater and live production.

00:10:13.535 --> 00:10:15.260
BD WONG: Yeah, and
good plays, and plays

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.215
that are written with
a kind of substance.

00:10:17.215 --> 00:10:19.590
JULIE: Especially when you're
in love with the play, too.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:20.300
BD WONG: Yeah, I do--

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.550
JULIE: You do it all the time.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:22.140
BD WONG: I do.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.850
And this particular play
is one of my favorite plays

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.530
that I've ever been able to do.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.100
I love doing it.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.100
I could keep doing it forever.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.630
I understand why actors like
Carol Channing and Yul Brynner

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.670
played parts forever and ever.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.320
I used to think
they were losers.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.710
I used to think, oh, god.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.590
Put it away, Carol.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.050
You're 80 years old.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.750
And she's going on tour with
another tour of "Hello Dolly."

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.460
She maybe did seven--
and Yul Brynner--

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.230
seven or eight tours of the--

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:58.280
but when that part sings for
you, you want to keep doing it.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.570
And you know what you're
giving the audience.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.090
And they're loving it.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.890
There's no way that you're
going to give that up.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.930
So I don't see myself continuing
to do this play until I'm 80,

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.750
but I understand the joy that
one gets from that, yeah.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.250
JULIE: Yeah.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.540
I mean, you could
certainly do it,

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.040
because it has that
age progression--

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:16.957
BD WONG: Yes, it does.

00:11:16.957 --> 00:11:18.885
JULIE: --and you certainly
don't age at all.

00:11:18.885 --> 00:11:20.310
BD WONG: Yeah, OK.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.750
JULIE: [LAUGHS] What
I really walked away

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:30.480
with from the play was that
it's about manifesting destiny.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.880
And there's two
characters, and one

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.100
is able to just kind of
move through the world

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.460
and say, yes, everything is
on my plate and I can grab it.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.300
That's Manford.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.940
And for your character,
it's more or less

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.940
like waiting for the
opportunity to be told,

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.350
like, it's now your time.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.117
And there's a line
at the end where he--

00:11:51.117 --> 00:11:53.450
and I'm going to paraphrase
as well-- but like basically

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.870
saying that I didn't
know that it was my time,

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.340
but now it's my time.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.467
It's always been there.

00:11:59.467 --> 00:12:00.050
BD WONG: Yeah.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.600
JULIE: And I'm
wondering how that

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.420
parallels with your successful
career that you've had.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.820
BD WONG: Oh, wow.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.690
I never made a--

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:13.490
I never thought to parallel it
that particularly personally.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.850
I have always
considered him someone

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:20.210
that I needed to learn
about, because he,

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:29.480
being a citizen of
Communist China, what

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.430
was built into that life,
particularly in this time

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.640
period, was a life of giving
yourself-- giving over

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.010
your own wishes to the
wishes of the party

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.980
and not making
choices for yourself.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.010
And what's a nice
juxtaposition in the play

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:51.950
is that this balls to the
wall Asian-American kid who

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.010
doesn't know anything
about that, just

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.790
wants and is going
after his dream.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:59.350
JULIE: Yes.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:03.050
BD WONG: And in comparison,
this other character in China

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:07.790
is giving up all of his
dreams, because there's

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:12.260
no alternative for him because
of the political circumstances

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.240
that he is in.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.080
Personally, I guess
what I could say

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.030
is that when I was
in high school,

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:26.810
I was just so lucky to have had
a very mentorial relationship

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:31.490
with a high school drama teacher
who recognized potential in me

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:39.110
and who absolutely
demanded that I follow it,

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.350
or that I not squander it.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:46.610
To the point where she took me
by the hand to my own parents

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.890
and said, I really
think this person

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.760
needs to keep doing this.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.500
JULIE: Wow.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.520
BD WONG: And my parents were
rather typical Asian-American

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.470
second generation parents.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.720
They weren't super,
super, super--

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.490
they weren't tiger parents.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:10.730
They were more, though,
conditioned and assumed

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.680
that the best thing
for us would be

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.640
successful and stable careers.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.273
Doctor or lawyer, that was it.

00:14:18.273 --> 00:14:18.960
That was it.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.960
JULIE: Yes.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.300
BD WONG: And so that
was a huge paradigm

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.020
shift for this person who
was kind of an expert, right?

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:27.560
She knew.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.820
She was a drama teacher.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.360
Not really, but she did have
credibility for my parents.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.950
And so the idea-- when you say
the idea of taking your shot,

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:43.410
or looking, following your
bliss, or taking what you think

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:46.950
could be yours, that
came from outside forces

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.760
that I was lucky to
have been exposed to.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.370
And I guess I do
relate emotionally

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.400
at the end of the
play to someone

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.680
who isn't able to do that.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.720
And whatever the complicated
feelings that one

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.710
has not having to have that
restriction, the guilt you

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.660
might feel, survivor's
guilt kind of thing,

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.800
or it what if it
were me, really,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.920
we're all here just
because we're here.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.530
We don't get a choice to
be Communist Chinese or not

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.030
Communist Chinese.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.710
And in this particular
play, it really

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.136
shows that you
don't have a choice.

00:15:25.136 --> 00:15:26.390
JULIE: Yes.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.320
BD WONG: And so I
think we all kind

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.690
of take for granted our
freedom and our ability

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:35.090
to do whatever we want and
to say whatever we want.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:44.755
And the play very, very
beautifully reminds us of that.

00:15:44.755 --> 00:15:46.380
And I do like that
part about the play.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.550
So I do relate to the
character's inability

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:57.120
to access his dreams based upon
my ability to access my dreams,

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:57.720
I guess.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.950
JULIE: Yes.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:04.800
It's interesting
because a lot of times,

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.030
even like if we take the context
out of the play of just being

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.030
maybe an emerging
artist of color,

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:15.390
or part of the LGBTQ
community, which you have been

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:19.380
a huge advocate for both, I
think it's quite difficult when

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:24.430
we are going out to pursue
those kinds of artistic dreams,

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.910
whether it be in acting,
dance, or even here in tech,

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.890
if you don't see
a role model, it's

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.100
hard to really think
about, can I go out

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.120
and grab hold of those dreams?

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.560
And it was great that you
mentioned your high school

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.060
mentor.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.540
But as someone who may
not have that, what

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.970
is some advice that you would--

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.490
BD WONG: Well, I--

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.050
advice, I have tons of advice.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.830
But before I give advice,
I think it's-- and it is

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:58.122
important to acknowledge that
phenomenon of representation.

00:16:58.122 --> 00:16:59.580
We're in this point
now where we're

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.740
talking about
representation all the time.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.970
And it doesn't lose its meaning,
but what I love to talk about,

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.450
what is absolutely essential
about that representation

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.119
is the influence that
that representation has

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.190
over younger people, right?

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.750
And that what we're
really fighting

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.900
for in our grown-up
state is, well, we

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.900
want to see more Asians.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.329
But I want to see--

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:22.569
I want my stories to be told.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:25.290
I want to see sexy Asian
people on the screen and all

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:25.960
of that stuff.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.300
But what we really want is
for the needle to shift,

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:38.910
because our kids don't
have the same schism when

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.210
it comes to looking,
searching fruitlessly

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:44.220
for themselves in the media.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.730
And it is shifting in a way
where the exposure is greater

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:48.510
now.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.800
And we do love that.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.300
And so my advice would
be, I don't know,

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.530
I think it's partly--

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.320
for me, it's always been
kind of that hokey Gandhi

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.770
thing, that be the change
you want to see thing.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.530
That there's always someone
that you can mentor.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.660
There's always someone--
even if you're not famous,

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.760
there's always someone that
is looking to you for--

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.920
and as role models,
I think people

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.175
forget that that thing
is really happening.

00:18:17.175 --> 00:18:18.300
You don't see it happening.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.467
You don't feel it happening.

00:18:19.467 --> 00:18:21.690
But it's happening
Young people are

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:27.150
looking to you for an example
of what they are going to be.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.590
They have no other
frame of reference

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.760
but to see a person older and
more experienced than them

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.410
and to do as they do.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.220
JULIE: Yes

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.480
BD WONG: And so our
self-esteem is super important

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.330
and our sense of sorting
out all the baggage

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.420
that our parents gave us and
their grandparents gave them.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.260
Sorting all that so that it's
a little bit easier for them

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.160
is a fun challenge, I
think, because we're still

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.450
dealing with our own baggage.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:57.310
But I think we do have
less, a little bit,

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.870
than our grandparents had.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:59.920
JULIE: I hope so.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.295
BD WONG: We have
different kinds.

00:19:01.295 --> 00:19:03.480
Our grandparents didn't
care about representation.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.260
JULIE: True.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.360
BD WONG: They don't
care at all about it.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.840
But then I do remember my
parents' generation of people

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.400
running into the
living room saying,

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.460
oh my god, look there's
an Asian person on TV,

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.750
like that kind of thing.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.600
And us all running
into the living room.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.510
That wasn't that long ago.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.310
And there is still a
sense of that now, right?

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.090
Oh, look.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:28.040
Wow, it's a commercial
with an Asian person in it.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.287
That's kind of a new
trend, commercials

00:19:30.287 --> 00:19:31.370
with Asian people in them.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.650
Well, because for
whatever reason,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.010
we could talk about it
forever, about the misnomer

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.162
that Asian people, their
money doesn't matter

00:19:40.162 --> 00:19:41.120
or something like that.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.245
JULIE: Something like that.

00:19:42.245 --> 00:19:44.946
BD WONG: So now it's
clearly true that--

00:19:44.946 --> 00:19:47.920
it's been established that
the money does matter.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.642
And that's good for us in a way.

00:19:49.642 --> 00:19:51.600
And it's certainly good
for our representation.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.560
JULIE: Oh, totally.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.445
Yeah, and I mean the success
with "Crazy Rich Asians,"

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:57.570
I mean, proved that it can
be a commercial success.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.260
BD WONG: Right,
that it transcended

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.323
being an Asian movie by being
popular across the board, yeah.

00:20:02.323 --> 00:20:03.240
JULIE: Everybody, yes.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.420
And that's what's really nice.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.930
I did hear on a podcast that you
did maybe a couple weeks ago,

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:14.100
KQED, what really struck
me was you did talk

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.230
about the responsibility
that you have,

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.860
or producers, or people who
have that power of choosing

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.340
the story, that they
have this responsibility

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.450
to create these images and
characters so that the younger

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:31.330
generation can be inspired.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.670
So I'm wondering, what is
your personal responsibility

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.210
for that?

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:39.530
Are you having a hand in
developing [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.280
BD WONG: Oh, yeah.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.260
You mean what am I doing?

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:41.760
JULIE: Yeah.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.690
BD WONG: Yeah, I am.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:44.770
I think that's
one of the great--

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.170
one of the things that
comes out of frustration

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.560
is the creative limitations
that you're given.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:55.780
Create, if you're up
for it, opportunities

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.970
for yourself, or for
others, or for the people

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.850
that you believe in that are
experiencing the same kind

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.690
of marginalization as you.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.305
And so I have--

00:21:05.305 --> 00:21:08.920
I'm always working
on things on my own,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.100
like trying to maintain my
relationship with theaters

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.470
like ACT to kind of like--

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:16.760
I'm already thinking,
now, what's next?

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.190
What would I do here next?

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:23.000
And coming up with, you
can't just pick one thing.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.670
You can't just go
to Pam MacKinnon,

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.420
the artistic director,
and say, oh, here's

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.910
the one thing I
want to do, do it.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.730
You have to give her
a landscape of things

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:34.080
that might work and see whether
any of them appeal to her.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:40.210
And all of those things for
me involve Asian-Americans,

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:46.390
or not just me or me as
a character playing--

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:52.510
they're all explorations of
re-imaginations of classic work

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:58.780
or new work itself that will
do what this play that we're

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.050
doing now is doing.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.780
When I talk about
producers, I'm not

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.865
sure exactly what
I said that time,

00:22:06.865 --> 00:22:10.960
or don't remember
exactly, but I do

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.350
feel that there's this
phenomenon that we're all

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:18.018
well aware of that's
very frustrating that we

00:22:18.018 --> 00:22:19.310
don't know what to do about it.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:21.520
And that is that
unless it affects you,

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.920
you often don't want to do
anything about something.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.900
It's the kind of thing-- to
use a very brutal example,

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.590
it's like the people that
are most championing cancer

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.660
research and stuff
are people that cancer

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.550
has touched themselves, right?

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:41.290
And this is a kind of way,
in some ways, for people

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.520
to choose the things
that mean most to them,

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.010
which is a nice thing.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.480
However, when it
comes to Hollywood,

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.610
the issue of diversity doesn't
ring true for a lot of people.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:54.500
And it kind of defines
white privilege,

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.150
what we like to throw around,
this term of white privilege.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:03.100
Because a person has no
sense of what that damage

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.640
or what that pain or what
that exclusion feels like.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.860
So the ones who are
doing it are doing it

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.680
because they know they're
supposed to or whatever.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.670
So some way to get them to feel
that is the thing that I think

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:20.170
is an interesting challenge,
to get them to understand,

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.060
to take to heart.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:27.460
It's the equivalent of
going to a cancer benefit,

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.740
like a big cancer
gala or something,

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:33.040
and watching the
video that they show

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.690
of what it means to a survivor
or to their family or whatever.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.240
And you're going, oh,
those are human beings.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.830
I relate to being a human being.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.140
That thing, I don't
have to have cancer

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.390
to know that this is important.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.900
JULIE: Yeah.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.660
BD WONG: And that
kind of sharing

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.390
of that, because there are
still so many producers

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.642
and people that are borderline.

00:23:54.642 --> 00:23:57.100
They're either doing it because
they think they're supposed

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.530
to-- and that's good, but
they're still not really

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:00.190
feeling it--

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:01.630
or they don't get it at all.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.550
It doesn't occur to them.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.670
And I'm fascinated by
that, because I personally

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.400
am really--

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.640
I don't consume a lot of
things that are all white.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.190
Like when I see something that
seems kind of like it's all

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:18.730
white or doesn't have any
Asian people in it at all,

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:19.700
I'm not as interested.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.780
I don't connect to it.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.640
And so, like I
watched the other day,

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.440
I watched "Hidden
Figures," which everybody

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.440
loves that movie, right?

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.740
It's a great-- it's a
very satisfying movie.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.520
But I'm less moved by it.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.960
I feel left out of
it in some ways.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.480
Because as we grew--

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.670
as I've grown up, it was always
like, are you black or white?

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.820
There was like a
kind of question

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.190
that was a very strange one
to perceive people asking.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:49.657
Anyway, I don't know.

00:24:49.657 --> 00:24:51.490
That's just me going
on about that question.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:52.520
JULIE: I love it.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.782
BD WONG: OK, thanks.

00:24:53.782 --> 00:24:54.990
JULIE: It's very interesting.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:58.950
But I kind of want to tag back
on to what you just said about,

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.280
well, I'm not a part of it.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:04.650
And I think that's the narrative
that a lot of Asian-Americans

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:08.130
feel, that we're not part of
the main narrative in Hollywood.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:09.500
BD WONG: Right.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.600
JULIE: Kind of to tie
back to Lauren, and then--

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.433
I know we're talking
about "The Great Leap,"

00:25:13.433 --> 00:25:17.100
but the "King of the Yees" made
a comment about, in marketing,

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.020
there's the black
people marketing,

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:19.410
the Hispanic people--

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.040
BD WONG: That's right.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:20.855
She talks about it, yeah.

00:25:20.855 --> 00:25:22.688
JULIE: --marketing, and
then there's Asians.

00:25:22.688 --> 00:25:24.840
And we're all lumped into
the Caucasian marketing

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.060
plan, which I thought was
a very interesting point.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.090
And I'm wondering, how do we
get more visibility out there?

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:36.170
Like how do we raise our
voices and say, hey, we matter,

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:40.770
or make more stories about us
because we want to watch it?

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:43.560
BD WONG: Well, I would tie
that into my being here today,

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.350
really, because what
I'm trying to do--

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.560
I mean, the theater
wants me to come and talk

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.880
about the show, which is great.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.297
And I love talking
about the show.

00:25:52.297 --> 00:25:54.870
But what I really want
to do is to create

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:57.900
a situation in which
Asian people are really

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.020
supporting their own content.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.840
Because the only way to
perpetuate that content

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.780
is for it to be successful.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:12.390
And if Pam MacKinnon, the
Caucasian-American artistic

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.940
director of American
Conservatory Theater,

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.640
has a big dud with
this play, she's

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.250
less likely to do another one.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:24.180
And then we're all more
likely to complain about it.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.670
And we're like, oh, well,
ACT, they don't ever do--

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:27.780
well, did you go?

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.300
Did you go see it?

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.415
JULIE: Exactly.

00:26:30.415 --> 00:26:32.040
BD WONG: And for
Asian-American people,

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.957
well, with a lot of
people, like human beings,

00:26:33.957 --> 00:26:36.990
they don't always understand
the gesture of that.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.870
Like doing your part, voting.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.610
All of that stuff.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.440
Yes, it does matter
that you vote.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.090
And yes, it does
matter that you buy

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:49.950
a ticket to see a play if you
care about what the play can

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:53.720
do for you, the things that
you're complaining about,

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.030
that we all complain about.

00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:01.830
So that's an equation that I
think could be made more clear.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:02.640
And I love that.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:07.260
And I always try to
tell people, oh, just

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.780
try to support the content.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.730
And we really did that in a big
way with "Crazy Rich Asians."

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:13.230
JULIE: Yes.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.590
BD WONG: That was really
super gratifying to me,

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:19.740
and reassuring to me,
and encouraging to me

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.220
that this generation of
Asian-Americans put their money

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.890
where their mouth was,
and created a sense,

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:29.508
whether it's true or not,
that something has changed.

00:27:29.508 --> 00:27:31.800
Because there's a lot of
articles out there now saying,

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.110
has it really changed?

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.110
Or whatever is it.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.650
What will happen next?

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:39.240
There's a fair amount of
"Crazy Rich Asian" knockoff

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.087
action happening out there,
which is a really good sign--

00:27:42.087 --> 00:27:42.920
JULIE: That's great.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.460
BD WONG: --that--

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.490
I'm not into knockoffs but
I'm into the representation--

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:48.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.550
--so I'll take it.

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.470
But it's absolutely--
like there's

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.240
going to be a couple
of television shows

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.720
and all of that stuff.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.080
And that's really good.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.408
You do have to kind
of, in some ways,

00:28:00.408 --> 00:28:01.950
if you're really,
really responsible,

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:06.720
you take note of the people that
are sponsoring Asian content

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.760
and try to support them.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.600
That's what network
television is kind of--

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.340
one thing that it
allows you to do

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.970
is to see the corporations
and the companies that

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.710
support the things that
we're trying to do.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:23.280
So we don't think
about that, right?

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.670
I don't think
about it that much.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:28.710
I have to go, OK, oh look,
OK, so these people are

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:33.982
sponsors of the whatever show.

00:28:33.982 --> 00:28:35.190
I don't know, whatever it is.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.130
I'm doing this Comedy Central
show with Aquafina in summer.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:39.120
JULIE: That's right.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:46.710
BD WONG: And I can't wait to see
who buys ad time on that show.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.600
JULIE: OK, last question.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.823
I'd love to know what your
mom thinks about all of this--

00:28:51.823 --> 00:28:52.835
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:52.835 --> 00:28:54.150
--because moms are important.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.390
BD WONG: Yes, we are at the
Asian Affinity Google Group,

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:57.940
aren't we?

00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.740
JULIE: We are.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.610
And mommies are important.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:05.700
BD WONG: Really, I have to
say, I consider my mother way

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.010
more than I should in
various everyday decisions,

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.890
like buying underwear.

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:17.160
I'm just so-- it's so deeply
ingrained to me to please her

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.070
that I think about
her to a fault.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:24.100
And it's not necessarily
good for me sometimes,

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:24.920
but I do do it.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.490
And there are really positive
side effects of that.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:32.290
And I must say that choosing
this play, to do it here,

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:36.910
and to do it here now, and to
kind of drop everything as much

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:39.970
as I could to do it, because the
time commitment that it takes

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.520
to do a play is really intense.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.050
And that means being
away from home.

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.700
And I have a teenage son
and all of that stuff.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:50.290
So choosing to do
so, to do a play out

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:57.040
of town, was made infinitely
more seductive or satisfying

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:02.830
because my mom's here, and
because my mom is inviting

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.770
my whole family, my
whole, gigantic--

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.130
her whole family, who mostly
are still in the Bay Area,

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:12.020
to come to the
matinee this Sunday.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.550
And then to have this big
party upstairs in the theater,

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.500
and do that kind of thing.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.170
Because she is like a--

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:25.090
there isn't one
prototypical Chinese mom,

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.070
but there are
maybe four or five.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.370
JULIE: Yes.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:29.690
BD WONG: Right?

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:30.220
JULIE: Yes.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.790
BD WONG: And my
mom is the one who

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:39.230
will do anything not to brag
by using bragging words.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:42.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.030
If you look closely, there is
a lot of bragging going on,

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:48.350
but it's very classy
and it's very--

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.170
she never says anything.

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:54.290
She lets everyone else say nice
things, and then she says--

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:56.180
she just nods or
something like that.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.110
You must be very proud.

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:00.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:09.320
So she is in that kind of--

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:13.460
it's kind of passive aggressive,
like she doesn't want to--

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:18.530
but it's wonderful to be the
beneficiary or the recipient

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:22.310
or the inspiration for
her doing these things,

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.580
inviting all of her family
and friends to this thing.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.420
And not pushing them to come see
it, but telling them when it is

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.140
and hoping that they come
and then feeding them.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.060
JULIE: That's key.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:34.750
BD WONG: Yeah.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:35.500
JULIE: That's key.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:36.920
Food talks, yeah.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:42.290
BD WONG: And she's kind of
a mascot of the production,

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:46.040
because the last time
I worked at ACT, she

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.900
cozied up to the house staff.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.090
And so then she would
say to me, oh I'm

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:51.950
going to go shopping
in Chinatown.

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:54.815
I think I'm going to come and
see the second act of the play.

00:31:54.815 --> 00:31:57.710
And show up and they'd like
let her sit in the back

00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:58.670
or whatever like that.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.750
I said, well, you
can't just show up.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:04.380
I mean, you have to meet
the person or what--

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:08.802
but she is-- she's treated very
royally and it's very nice.

00:32:08.802 --> 00:32:10.010
JULIE: It's very [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.677
BD WONG: She's like
the Empress Dowager.

00:32:11.677 --> 00:32:14.555
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:14.555 --> 00:32:17.290
And she's very cute.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:21.703
And she has a very
lovable personality.

00:32:21.703 --> 00:32:22.370
She really does.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:26.510
She's just like-- she's
very infectious and very

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.430
kind of smiley.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:29.260
JULIE: I love that.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:29.600
BD WONG: Yeah.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.560
JULIE: That's great.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.580
Thank you, BD.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.240
We have our first
question over here.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.850
BD WONG: OK, you're on.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:35.600
AUDIENCE: Hey, BD.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.690
BD WONG: Hey.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:38.940
AUDIENCE: I'm also-- I notice
that you're a native San

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:39.290
Franciscan.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.970
I know we've talked a
lot of serious topics,

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:42.720
but we wanted to talk
about something fun.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.023
Julie mentioned food talks.

00:32:44.023 --> 00:32:44.690
BD WONG: Uh-huh.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:47.232
AUDIENCE: And I'm always curious
about when actors come home,

00:32:47.232 --> 00:32:50.900
at least back to San
Francisco-- or actresses--

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:51.810
what's your go-to?

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:52.910
What is the one
thing when you come

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.535
back here that you need to have,
that kind of connects you back

00:32:55.535 --> 00:32:59.520
with your childhood and some
of these good, joyous memories?

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.880
BD WONG: Capital Restaurant,
Clay Street, chicken wings.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.317
JULIE: Oh.

00:33:04.317 --> 00:33:05.900
BD WONG: They're
famous chicken wings.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.020
And they're-- I mean,
I'm almost kind of like--

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.450
you almost want to not
tell people about them

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.600
because you want
them for yourself.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.550
But that comes to
mind immediately.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:20.150
My family is obsessed
with the House

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:22.620
of Prime Rib on Van Ness--

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.825
obsessed with it.

00:33:23.825 --> 00:33:25.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.500
And we go there--
we like, I mean,

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:31.320
at the opening of an
envelope, we will go there.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.070
It's like we'll go
there for any occasion.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.378
We'll make up some special
occasion to go there.

00:33:37.378 --> 00:33:38.086
JULIE: Of course.

00:33:38.086 --> 00:33:38.586
[LAUGHS]

00:33:38.586 --> 00:33:43.993
BD WONG: And so we do the House
of Prime Rib whenever we can.

00:33:43.993 --> 00:33:45.410
We just did it a
couple weeks ago.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:49.940
Let's see, what else is there?

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:53.540
Sunset Bakery, [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:57.200
That's on like 9th
Avenue in Irving.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.610
Or [? Judah. ?]

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:02.450
And let's see, what else?

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.760
Let's see, I'm going through
all of my ethnic groups--

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.735
Mexican.

00:34:06.735 --> 00:34:09.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:15.739
You know, my Uncle Bobby, my
mom's brother, replicated the--

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.699
you guys are mostly
too young for this--

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:21.780
but my Uncle Bobby replicated
the recipe of the enchiladas

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.699
at this place
called The Hothouse,

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:27.330
which was at Playland
at the beach, which

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.840
was by the Cliff House,
this boardwalk that

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.190
used to be there.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:36.420
And there used to be like a
pass-through window rest--

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:39.510
kind of a precursor to a
food truck kind of restaurant

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:40.409
called The Hothouse.

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:47.610
And they had these very basic
but delicious enchiladas

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:49.860
that came in a little
cardboard tray.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:54.989
And so my uncle has
kept that recipe alive

00:34:54.989 --> 00:35:00.660
and makes a big batch of this
enchilada gravy that they made.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.988
And so that's a childhood
memory of going to The Hothouse

00:35:03.988 --> 00:35:04.530
at the beach.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:07.350
Because I grew up
on 40th and Ortega,

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.830
really close to the beach.

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.810
Those are the top five, I think.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.050
The ones that-- there'll
be more that come to mind

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:16.918
and I'll blurt them
out like Turret's.

00:35:16.918 --> 00:35:18.590
JULIE: Please do.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.830
AUDIENCE: Sweet, thank you.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:20.250
BD WONG: Sure.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:21.450
JULIE: We'll go right over here.

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:23.283
AUDIENCE: Thanks again
for coming today, BD.

00:35:23.283 --> 00:35:24.840
BD WONG: Sure.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:29.080
AUDIENCE: This is a little bit
more of a personal question.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:33.140
So I went to acting school
in New York many years ago.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.890
When I graduated, it
was the early aughts,

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.860
and I walked into
an industry that

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.697
was not particularly looking
for dudes who looked like me.

00:35:40.697 --> 00:35:41.280
BD WONG: Yeah.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.870
AUDIENCE: And I wanted to
talk-- you talked a lot

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:43.800
about representation today.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.490
BD WONG: Yeah.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:46.323
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
talk a little bit more

00:35:46.323 --> 00:35:48.240
about the pipeline issue.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.952
And for me, I got
out of the game.

00:35:50.952 --> 00:35:52.410
And I'm very ashamed
to admit that.

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:55.000
And it was really hard for me.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.570
But I had those
prototypical parents

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.910
who were like, chase your
dream, chase your dream.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:02.495
And then it became, I
can't do this anymore.

00:36:02.495 --> 00:36:03.120
BD WONG: Right.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.660
AUDIENCE: So I guess my
question is, what would you

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.440
say to all of the folks who now
are going into an industry that

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:15.060
is just slightly more
friendly to folks like us

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.612
to keep them in the
game, and to keep

00:36:16.612 --> 00:36:17.820
that side of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.180
BD WONG: Oh, great.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.100
That is a really good
positive-based question.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.000
Thank you.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.370
And you know, good
things come from pain.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:25.560
And if your pain
created this question

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.780
and changes somebody's life,
that's probably a good thing.

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.140
But I will say that--
just before I answer--

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:37.020
is that pain, that
rejection, and that shame

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.410
are universal, right?

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:40.320
They're not your own.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:45.060
And you have to blame,
really, the situation

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:49.500
much more than yourself
for the outcome of that.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:53.457
You seem perfectly happy
now, so I trust that that's--

00:36:53.457 --> 00:36:54.290
AUDIENCE: We'll see.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:55.123
BD WONG: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:55.123 --> 00:36:56.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.900
And what I would say--

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.828
well, I wouldn't
say anything that's

00:36:59.828 --> 00:37:02.370
that different from what people
told me when I first started,

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.090
when it was
considerably different,

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:07.632
which was if you absolutely
have to do it, then do it.

00:37:07.632 --> 00:37:09.840
And if you don't, you should
think of something else.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.610
It's super difficult. It
messes with your mind.

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:16.080
It messes with your self-esteem.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.770
It messes with your sense of
self-worth, your sense of what

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.510
success means.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:23.460
And you have to be--

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.860
you have to have an
extremely strong constitution

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:30.810
and an extremely
accessible support system.

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:34.770
And I feel like you're right
that the needle's moved

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:36.930
to the point where
young people--

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:39.630
you want to kind of
slap them for the things

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.970
that they complain about, right?

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.900
Because it was so much harder
before and it is so much--

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.090
there's so much more
opportunity now.

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:54.210
But with that opportunity
comes more competition.

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:57.550
And I certainly feel that from
the beginning of my career,

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.410
there was less competition.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.160
And the competition has
grown and the amount

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.340
of younger people in
the industry has grown.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:08.460
But so, also, has the amount
of Asian-American writers

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.620
and the amount of
producers and people

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.290
that are actually making
influential choices.

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.420
So I would just say
that they really

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.700
should not take for granted--

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.200
especially given
what you're saying.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.470
They should not take for granted
any progress that's been made.

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:27.370
But you know, young people
are so clueless sometimes,

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:30.900
and rightly so, because
we can't know anything

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.700
that happened before us.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.220
We can hear about it and
we can take it to heart.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:41.160
When we talk to my son, who
was born in 2000, about 9/11,

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.450
he understands
the gravity of it.

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:45.780
He doesn't feel
the emotion of it.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.810
He wasn't there to
watch on television

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:52.050
the absolute
devastation and the loss

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:54.070
and the emotional feelings.

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:57.240
So you guys know that this
show, "Come From Away,"

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.610
came into town a few weeks ago.

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:02.430
"Come From Away," is
centered around the day

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.360
of 9/11 and the days after.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.260
And it's one thing where
if you're of a certain age

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:09.300
and you're sitting in the
audience at that show,

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.220
everyone in the
audience is having

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:16.060
the same emotional experience,
which is a very rare thing.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.700
In Lauren's play,
she's having to explain

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:22.780
certain really heavy things that
have happened in its history.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.120
And you get it
from understanding

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.610
what she's taught you about it.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.170
"Come From Away" starts
and it says, today's 9/11,

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:31.290
and everyone starts
crying immediately.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:33.010
And it's kind of great.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:35.950
Anybody born after 9/11
doesn't really understand.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:38.650
This is a tangent
to try to describe

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:44.740
these rather adorable young
people that are becoming actors

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.040
don't really understand
the things that

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:51.250
were built on the backs
of other people, right?

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:57.070
This is an ongoing discussion
about everything-- about AIDS,

00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:01.150
about gay people and AIDS,
and about the Holocaust,

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:04.120
and everything major
that has ever happened,

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.700
where every pain that any
generation has experienced

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:11.030
is really hard for the
following generation to feel.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.420
So we cut them a
little bit of slack.

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.970
And we try to kind of--

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:18.340
for me, I think a
sense of discipline

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.040
and a sense of entitlement.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.810
Discipline needs
to be encouraged

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:26.290
and entitlement needs to
be kind of smacked out

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:29.200
of people sometimes.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.090
But the advice I would give is
that it requires an absolutely

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.000
steadfast constitution.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.360
And that there's great
joy to be had in it,

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.340
and that there's
something actually

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.750
kind of noble about it.

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:46.960
There is a sense, that I learned
from my first acting teacher,

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.170
that you are a messenger,
and that if the messages

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:53.530
that you're giving are
true and are positive

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:56.710
and they make people think
or they make people act

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:58.780
differently, then
you've done something,

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:02.570
or you've acted as an agent to
something actually happening.

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:07.660
So it's not just kind
of glamour and acting

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.130
and applause and
stuff like that.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:13.550
It could be rather
useful in society.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:14.450
So thank you.

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:15.380
I appreciate that.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.330
JULIE: Thank you.

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:17.640
We have a question over here.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.700
AUDIENCE: Hi, BD.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.110
Thanks again for coming out.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:21.730
Just wanted to
ask you a question

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:24.460
as an Asian-American
who's also grown up

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:28.270
with second generation parents.

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:32.620
If you ever traveled back to
China, if and when you did,

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.000
did you ever--

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.650
how was that experience for you?

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:38.590
And how were you
channel that when

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:41.380
you're acting during the play?

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:45.760
BD WONG: I went to
China two major times.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.820
The first time I went,
my dad was still alive.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.850
And I was booked to
be the guest speaker

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:54.380
on a cruise that went to China.

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.270
And it was a super-duper,
hilariously fancy cruise

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:01.420
with all super old white people.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:06.250
But I was supposed to talk about
being a Chinese person to them.

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.440
I was like-- it was a
little bit like a zoo.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:12.430
You know, it's like
feeding time is at 4:15.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:17.130
BD Wong will come out and you
can throw pretzels at him.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:19.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:23.710
But it was a really, really, in
many ways, moving experience.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:29.020
My dad had not been back to Hong
Kong since he left Hong Kong.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:33.160
Oddly enough, my grandfather
was born in California.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.550
My grandfather went back
home to marry my grandma

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.160
and to have my dad and
then brought them back.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.000
So my dad was technically
not born here,

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.560
but he was born a citizen.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.940
And so he had this
very, like, oh my gosh,

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.740
this is where I was born kind
of thing that really snuck up

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:52.240
on him.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.470
I don't think he ever even
thought about going back,

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:55.720
but here was this opportunity.

00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.290
We went back.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:58.460
So that was that.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:03.127
And I wish I could talk for
an hour about this cruise.

00:43:03.127 --> 00:43:04.210
It was so funny, because--

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:04.680
JULIE: Sounds amazing.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.513
BD WONG: Well, first
of all, I will tell you

00:43:06.513 --> 00:43:10.270
that the one thing is it was
so fancy that they give you

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.850
this little thing to fill
out when you come in,

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:14.170
when you check into your room.

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.570
And the thing asks you
what kind of liquor

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:22.270
they want you to stock the bar
with, the refrigerator with.

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:25.330
And you get four bottles of
each, or something like that.

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:27.880
And my mom is a
white wine drinker

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.230
and my dad was a Jack Daniels.

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.570
Drinker.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.153
So they got four
bottles of white wine

00:43:31.153 --> 00:43:32.770
and four bottles
of Jack Daniels.

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:38.850
And then that night they put all
eight bottles in their suitcase

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:40.730
and they filled
out the form again.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:41.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:42.460
JULIE: Of course.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.130
BD WONG: By the
end of the cruise,

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:49.870
they had like a
BevMo under the bed.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:52.666
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:56.350
I don't want to say--

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:57.970
it's racial profiling
to say that this

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:00.940
is because they're Chinese.

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.340
But no pun intended.

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.825
You do the math.

00:44:04.825 --> 00:44:07.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:10.270
I went on a second
trip to China in 2003

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:12.740
to make a terrible
television movie.

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.268
But that was a really
interesting cultural experience

00:44:15.268 --> 00:44:17.060
for me as well, working
with Chinese people

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:23.390
and working in the Chinese
film industry in rural China.

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:28.310
And I think, really, I hope
you'll come see the play.

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:30.410
Lauren talks about the
experience of being

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:34.160
an Asian-American and going
to China as a very unique kind

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.800
of odd fish-out-of-water
experience.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.450
And that is THE
experience I felt.

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:41.630
I didn't really feel like I
was home or anything like that.

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:46.310
I felt-- it's so obvious to them
that you're American before you

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:48.530
even open your mouth.

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:50.660
You just, you can't hide it.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:55.190
And so there's always either a
curiosity or a slight disdain

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:56.450
over you.

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:59.330
And so I felt that tension.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:01.010
And that was no
different than the way

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:07.280
that the young woman in the play
describes it in Lauren's play.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.810
So apparently,
Lauren understands

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:10.760
that kind of experience too.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.220
It's pretty common.

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.720
Did I answer the question?

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.330
Not really.

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:17.288
AUDIENCE: You did, or kind of.

00:45:17.288 --> 00:45:18.113
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:18.113 --> 00:45:20.030
BD WONG: You said good
things, but you did not

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.840
answer the question.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:23.370
JULIE: But we learned
about the BevMo.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:25.820
BD WONG: What was the
specific question?

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.648
I can answer it now.

00:45:28.648 --> 00:45:29.440
AUDIENCE: I guess--

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.480
BD WONG: Oh, how did I
draw on it in the play?

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.633
Well, I would say that--

00:45:33.633 --> 00:45:35.050
how did I draw on
it for the play.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:37.630
I did really relate
it to Lauren's words

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:40.280
about being an Asian-American
going to China.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:44.110
And I think what I had to do,
really, the research about how

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:50.140
shut down a Chinese
person who's not

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:54.790
a dream seeker, a person who is
of a certain constitution who

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:58.120
is a party member of the--
a member of the party

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:01.360
and very obedient
and very diligent.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.290
That is a very different
kind of person than me.

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:08.500
And so I did have
to kind of access

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.800
whatever else I
feel in my life that

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:16.690
shuts me down, or quiets me, or
keeps me from making decisions.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:22.510
And I do relate to feeling like
a younger man being closeted

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:26.770
and feeling kind of restricted
by my sense of being closeted,

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:29.140
and a sense of not being
able to be free and open

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:32.920
and speak my own truth.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.850
So that's the thing
I would relate to,

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:37.937
I think, more than going
to China, actually.

00:46:37.937 --> 00:46:38.770
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:39.353
BD WONG: Sure.

00:46:39.353 --> 00:46:40.062
JULIE: Thank you.

00:46:40.062 --> 00:46:42.794
BD WONG: I'm just going back and
forth, because it makes sense.

00:46:42.794 --> 00:46:44.150
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:45.730
So I think a lot about inequity.

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:46.748
It's a very heavy topic.

00:46:46.748 --> 00:46:47.290
BD WONG: Yes.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:49.220
AUDIENCE: I think a
lot about inequity.

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.053
And one thing I've been
thinking a lot about

00:46:51.053 --> 00:46:53.680
is the importance of
Asian-Americans needing

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.180
to leverage their
privilege in order

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.788
to stand in deep solidarity
with other communities of color.

00:46:57.788 --> 00:46:59.080
So black and brown communities.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.690
And I know, obviously, there's
a nuance in various industries.

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:04.920
I think the tech industry,
we're highly represented here.

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.760
And that looks different
in other places.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.500
But I wanted to hear
a little bit more

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:12.550
from you around how you think
about Asian-Americans building

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:15.010
that solidarity with
other communities of color

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:16.840
in the entertainment
industry, and what you

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.490
see happening on that front.

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:20.890
BD WONG: It's such
a wide reaching,

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:22.840
far reaching industry, right?

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.790
You have Hollywood.

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:27.880
And here we are, I'm working
at a regional theater.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.420
And the regional theater has
its own agenda and aspirations

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:35.620
for community building and for
community fundraising and all

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:36.680
of that stuff.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.390
And they're different, I think.

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:47.260
The wider Hollywood industry
is driven by a bottom line

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.910
kind of thing that makes it
really hard for this needle

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:53.113
to shift.

00:47:53.113 --> 00:47:55.030
And I don't know if
actually this-- this might

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:56.950
be a similar kind of tangent.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:59.470
But what your question
is reminding me of

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:03.880
is my own baggage
about fundraising,

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.640
like for example, when I'm
pushing up the mountain

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.380
several of my own projects.

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.960
I've co-written a
musical that I'm

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.420
trying to continue to develop.

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:18.650
And I have, say,
several other projects,

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:20.290
a lot of theater projects.

00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:21.640
And I find myself--

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:27.950
one of them is one that our
friend has been involved in,

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:33.280
a mutual friend, which is a
very diverse cast of actors.

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:37.150
And other projects are
Asian-American projects.

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:40.360
And I find myself
trying to edit myself

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.550
when it comes to whose
money I'm going after.

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.230
Like I [INAUDIBLE]
think, oh, you

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:45.730
can't ask an
Asian-American person

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:48.340
to help me fund the
diverse project.

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.590
You should really be getting
the Asian-American person

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:52.752
to fund the
Asian-American project.

00:48:52.752 --> 00:48:54.460
But I think, well,
wait a second, though,

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:57.310
but I'm the Asian-American
making this project.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:00.760
Will that be enough
for them to support me,

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.550
to help move the
needle in that way,

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:09.700
because my work as a writer
will be put on the map.

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:13.780
And then I will be able
to have the credibility

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:15.590
to create more and more content.

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:18.100
And as it turns out, this
particular diverse project

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:21.430
ends up having a lot
of Asian people in it.

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:23.620
But it's not an Asian project.

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:26.260
And so is there a kind of--

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:27.950
what I'm saying
is that I perceive

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:32.140
there to be some kind
of invisible limit

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.610
to the amount of
support I can get

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:36.020
from the Asian-American
community,

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.897
like from Asian people
that have money.

00:49:37.897 --> 00:49:40.480
I think, oh, I have to be really
careful about who I ask money

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.120
for and what it's for.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.520
They'll want me to just--

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.860
they'll want me to just do
all Asian content I think.

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.130
And so that's interesting,
because I guess what I--

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:52.460
as am repeating it--

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.840
I'm an Asian-American artist
and that's the content

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.673
that I'm generating.

00:49:56.673 --> 00:49:58.757
But I know that doesn't
really specifically answer

00:49:58.757 --> 00:49:59.350
your question.

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:03.160
I'm also just me and I don't
really understand or know

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.990
what's going on out
there, necessarily,

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:11.020
about the connections between
different groups and how--

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:16.154
You know, Ken Savage,
who was up here before--

00:50:16.154 --> 00:50:17.680
no, was he up here yet?

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.790
No, he wasn't up here yet.

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:23.280
Ken Savage, who works at ACT
and brought me here today,

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.810
was talking about how he
has been in this building

00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:30.560
before, because he also did
a Google talk with the Black

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.390
Google Live group.

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:33.190
JULIE: BGN, yeah.

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:34.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:38.240
And so that shows
you that that kind

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:44.600
of accessing the different
groups within the theater

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:48.980
is an active thing
that's happening.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.480
But I think you're
absolutely right.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.940
That kind of solidarity
is really helpful.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.130
I think everybody
has their own agenda

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:58.610
and their own unique
challenges, and that sometimes

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:01.290
makes things difficult,
as you can imagine.

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:02.060
JULIE: Yeah.

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:04.080
Thank you so much
for your questions.

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.672
We are out of time.

00:51:05.672 --> 00:51:06.380
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:07.250
JULIE: Yeah, I know.

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:08.510
It's been so much fun.

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.280
I'm sorry for those who
couldn't ask the questions.

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.528
But BD, I just want to thank you
so much for being here today.

00:51:14.528 --> 00:51:16.820
And for those who don't know,
please go watch the show.

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:19.760
It's running at ACT Geary
stage, "The Great Leap,"

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.810
until March 31.

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:22.370
So thank you again.

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:25.720
[APPLAUSE]
