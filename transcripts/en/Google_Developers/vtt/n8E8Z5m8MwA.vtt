00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.290
Hi, I'm Greg Rosenberg, user
experience lead for the AdWords

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.620
platform.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.010
I'm here to show you another
side of Google design,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.690
one perhaps you're unaware
of-- designing our advertising

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.240
products, many of which
are listed right here.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.240
Specifically, I'm going to tell
you about designing AdWords,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.780
our flagship product
used by customers

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.140
who create ads on Google search
results-- those results you see

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.320
marked with the yellow orange
Ad tag in front of them.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.470
These customers can be small
businesses like your corner

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.460
grocer, or a large
advertising agency that

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.530
manages online advertising
campaigns for big spend brands.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.540
Like all design work at Google,
this is fun and exciting work.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.300
However, it's truly unique
as it has the biggest

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.490
impact to businesses
and the biggest

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.340
impact imaginable on Google.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.420
Advertising revenue is our
primary revenue source.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.980
I'm here to show you how
critical fast, intuitive,

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.900
and beautiful are when
literally billions of dollars

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.130
are on the line and the
resulting challenge that

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.980
creates for the designers
that create these products.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.430
OK, so imagine you're a
designer working on AdWords.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.780
Every design decision
you make could

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.850
have a huge impact on
the customer's business

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.100
and that customer feedback works
back into the product's design.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.290
Big pressure?

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.190
Yeah, sure.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.330
But also a really big reward.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.420
Let me tell you about
our challenges and goals.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.100
We deal with tons of
data coming in from lots

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.340
of different backend systems and
factor them into our designs.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.090
Let me show you an example.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.600
This is our simple and elegant
alert system in AdWords.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.780
We have a red bar that
goes across the top

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.810
for critical alerts, like
an expired credit card,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.410
or in this case having to
review terms and conditions.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.940
And we also have this simple
menu for less critical alerts.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.660
Clean and simple.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.760
This all looks really
straightforward, right.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.420
But it's not.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.650
By digging deeper, you can
see by looking at this diagram

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.570
that this really
simple you UI actually

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.030
pulls in data from lots
of different sources.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.520
And a lot of logic has to
be applied to figure out

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.682
the right alert to serve at the
right time to our customers.

00:02:05.682 --> 00:02:07.390
Our designers not only
have to figure out

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.470
what the UI looks like, but
have to figure out in what order

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.270
to show things,
how much to show,

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.120
and what to show and
exactly at what time

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.140
depending on the user's context.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.540
Our job is also to make
the complex and powerful

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.370
into something really
simple and intuitive.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.860
This is the keyword
set-up screen in AdWords.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.480
This is one of the
screens customers

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.230
go through when setting up
AdWords for the first time.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.290
Keywords are either
single or a combination

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.340
of words that trigger the
customers ads to appear

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.580
on Google search based on
the query that was entered.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.230
OK, for example, if I own
a music equipment store

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.810
and I create an ad for it with
the keyword, buy a drum set,

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.020
my ad will appear
on Google search

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.650
when someone googles
"buy drum set."

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.830
Setting up keywords is one of
the critical aspects of AdWords

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.480
for customers to do effectively
so they get the most out of it.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.292
Our old keyword entry
screen, shown here,

00:03:04.292 --> 00:03:05.125
wasn't as intuitive.

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:07.220
It assumed a lot of
existing knowledge

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.500
on the customer's part.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.350
It was cluttered.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.040
And as I mentioned, it
was pretty unintuitive.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.030
Our new one here is much
cleaner and inviting.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.560
It gives the customer
an automatically added

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.870
set of suggested keywords that
would work best, including

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.760
search popularity for each
keyword, a cleaner way

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.925
to add their own
keywords, and a widget

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:27.800
that tells the customer
what their reach will

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.590
be for the keywords
they've entered.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.640
We let the data become
the UI, and get the UI,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.870
et cetera out of the way.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.360
We recently redesigned AdWords.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.290
This is the before.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.540
As you can see in this
design, a lot of the screen

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.080
is taken up by this big
green bar at the top.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.550
There's a white
header above that.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.480
There's additional
links on the top right.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.240
And generally, the user
interface is lacking polish.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.840
In the new design,
or after, we've

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.200
consolidated the top two
header bars into one,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.050
updated the visual design style
to match the general Google

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.050
style-- so the gray top
toolbar, red buttons.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.920
By bringing in these
changes, customers

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.390
can focus more on
their data and less

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.730
on the controls and widgets
that get them to their data.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.530
This is in Google's DNA.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.630
You see it every day on our
famous and simple homepage.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.399
And that design
philosophy is also

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.209
being reflected in our
advertising products.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.240
What have we learned as a team?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.990
We've learned that
beauty and design

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.520
quality of our
advertising products

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.060
not only improves them
aesthetically, but makes

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.430
advertisers more effective.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.510
Specifically, refined
design gives advertisers

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.790
confidence in the product with
a variety of design improvements

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.570
that have come to AdWords
both large, like the redesign

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.970
I showed you, and
feature focused changes,

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.000
like the alert system
and keyword entry system.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.550
We've seen our customers
more engaged with the product

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.860
and we receive positive
feedback that they feel better

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.770
about the experience of AdWords
meeting their advertising

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.890
needs.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.090
With our recent redesign, we've
also received a lot of feedback

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.970
that the product was faster.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.240
But no performance
changes were made.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.290
It was all design.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.220
This is the power clean
and simple design can have.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.970
Clean, well-designed
products feel faster.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.680
Don't overwhelm customers
with every possible option.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.170
The alert system I showed
is a great example of this.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.000
We used to show customers
all alerts all the time just

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.670
stacked on top of each
other, burying data

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.390
that they couldn't
see without scrolling.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.770
We did this because we were
concerned customers wouldn't

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.800
find alerts if we
didn't expose them.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.930
We've found with a cleaner
design and some alerts even

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.620
hidden behind a menu that
customers are not only

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.365
finding them better, but acting
on them more than ever before.

00:05:44.365 --> 00:05:45.990

more about being

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.000
