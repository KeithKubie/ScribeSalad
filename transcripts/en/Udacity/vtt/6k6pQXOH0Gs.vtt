00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.190
So the percentage of individuals that'll end up

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.460
being lactose intolerant, like the dad is zero, none.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.480
To be lactose intolerant, you have to be homozygous

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.260
recessive. None of the possible combinations from our Punnett

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.800
square showed us we could be homozygous recessive, so

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.860
none of our offspring are going to to be lactose

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.520
intolerant. They'll all be tolerant like their mom. However,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.070
they don't have the same genotype as their mother.
