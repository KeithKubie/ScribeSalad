00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.440
All right, so here's another state.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.950
I just transported you randomly
to another start state, and

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.650
you claim that you understand
how things work now.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.050
So can you explain?

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.950
&gt;&gt; I think I do.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.230
The goal is to go get
the little yellow circle or

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.020
the circle which was yellow
to begin with the last time.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.400
I don't know if that means anything.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.680
And I
&gt;&gt; I think it was green last time.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.180
&gt;&gt; Was it?

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.620
And you want to pick it up,
which was I think 5.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.570
And when you do that, what I don't yet
know is whether it will change color.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.901
But whatever color it
is when you pick it up,

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:35.930
you want to take it to the square
that matches that color.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.840
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Then put it down, which is Action 1.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.040
Now I should say, because I didn't say
it before, that what I thought the point

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.740
was the first time was just to get the
square and the circle in the same place.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.890
&gt;&gt; The square and the circle.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.030
Yeah, you did that.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.675
But you didn't get any reward for that.

00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:56.434
&gt;&gt; Right, so then I figured out
maybe I didn't do anything but

00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:59.870
at that time I was also just trying to
figure out what all the commands did.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.400
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; I was doing a lot of exploring.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.380
&gt;&gt; All right, so learned a bit
about the transition function,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.950
you learned a little about how
actions change the state and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.790
you also learned a little bit
about what states are rewarding.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.430
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.820
&gt;&gt; And so now you think even though
things are a bit different you think you

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.200
can actually get kind of on
a minimal path to a gold state now?

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.900
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.055
So from here I would go 3,3.

00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:30.900
Then I would go 4,4 then
5 which keeps it yellow.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.380
So then I need to go as
quickly to yellow as I can.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.561
There's a lot of ways of doing that but
let's just do 2,2.

00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:41.837
6,6,6,6.

00:01:41.837 --> 00:01:43.980
2,2.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.510
And then that doesn't work.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.650
&gt;&gt; Is it possible you forgot something?

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.949
&gt;&gt; Oh, 1, I forgot to put it down.

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:49.831
&gt;&gt; Boom!

00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:50.505
&gt;&gt; Done.

00:01:50.505 --> 00:01:53.233
&gt;&gt; All right, so good excellent job.

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:56.863
So that was an MDP and in fact,
you solved that a lot faster than any of

00:01:56.863 --> 00:02:00.500
the algorithms [LAUGH] that
we're going to be talking about.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.123
Because you made use of all kinds of
interesting background information about

00:02:05.123 --> 00:02:09.618
how you can- What navigation does and
how it's consistent across states.

00:02:09.618 --> 00:02:12.496
But generally in the MDP model and
the reinforcement learning model,

00:02:12.496 --> 00:02:14.150
we don't necessarily assume that.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.252
It could very well be that what you're-
In each state, the actions all do some

00:02:18.252 --> 00:02:22.360
other kind of crazy different thing,
and you have to learn that mapping.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.210
&gt;&gt; Right, so let me say two things.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.532
Actually three thing.

00:02:25.532 --> 00:02:29.690
One, is when I trying to figure out
what the actions were, I considered for

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.716
a moment, even though I had already
figured out that 3 moves you right,

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:37.808
I considered trying to go right a couple
of times just to see if there was any

00:02:37.808 --> 00:02:39.207
randomness [CROSSTALK].

00:02:39.207 --> 00:02:40.480
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.565
But then I decided you wouldn't do that
to me, you're too nice of a person.

00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:44.262
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And so

00:02:44.262 --> 00:02:46.370
I decided they were deterministic and
then do that.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.760
But you point out that yeah,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.120
I did it kind of fast because I
had a lot of background knowledge.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.040
I'd really say that it was
more about assumptions.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.200
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.500
&gt;&gt; And
in fact my first assumption was wrong.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.220
Oh.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.860
&gt;&gt; The goal was just to get in
the same place as the circle and

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.070
that was the whole point.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.320
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.810
&gt;&gt; And
then the last thing I'll say is that

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.810
as long I've been thinking
about reinforcement learning.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.085
As long as I've been thinking
about search algorithms and AI.

00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:16.360
As long as I've been machine learning I
don't think I ever really appreciated

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.730
how incredibly frustrating it is
[LAUGH] when you don't actually know

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.590
what the rules are and you're just
trying to figure out what's going on.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.760
And I now am going to be much kinder
to all of my search algorithms.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.390
&gt;&gt; That's what I was hoping
you'd get out of that.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.270
Thank you.
Yes.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.840
So sometimes it's really frustrating
watching these algorithms do what

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.740
they do.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.910
And in some cases just repeatedly
bashing their heads against the wall.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.190
Which for what it's worth is
something that you didn't do.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.042
When you were moving around in the grid,

00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:44.282
you were purposely avoiding
these black lines.

00:03:44.282 --> 00:03:46.255
Do you know why?

00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:47.990
[LAUGH] Maybe those
are actually reward lines.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.760
If you bump into them you win.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but every time I've ever
played any game, they're walls.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they look like walls.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.690
And, in fact, they are in this case.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.298
So that again, that was an assumption
that you brought to bear.

00:04:00.298 --> 00:04:04.240
But, right, so when you watch a learning
algorithm, reinforcement learning

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.620
algorithm actually interacting
with a grid like this.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.470
It doesn't have those
biases necessarily.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.240
And so it can actually bash its
head against this wall, and

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.510
then maybe this wall for a while,
and hey, this wall looks really fun.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.390
And so, yeah,

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.260
it's good that we have a little bit
of empathy for the poor reinforcement

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.360
learning agent that's trying to master
this environment given very complex and

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.470
hard to parse apart representations for
the actions and the states.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.590
&gt;&gt; Hmm, that's very good.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.730
Probably the only thing more
frustrating than my trying to play this

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.420
was all the people watching
me trying to play this.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.450
&gt;&gt; Oh, I think they loved it.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.710
For what it's worth,
we can make this available.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.405
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Who would play
it on their home computers?

00:04:44.405 --> 00:04:46.590
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but now they know the answer.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.600
Can you just like randomly
change what the actions are?

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.950
&gt;&gt; Let's say that I did that.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.970
&gt;&gt; Okay, that was actually quite good.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.749
I'm glad you didn't let me
know what it was before hand.

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:57.331
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Do you recognize it now?

00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.620
Do I recognize what now?

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.880
It's a taxi cab to me.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.195
I almost said that [LAUGH] and then
realized that would break the illusion.

00:05:06.195 --> 00:05:09.870
&gt;&gt; [LAUGHTER] So when I had Molly
do this a long a time ago, and

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:10.538
I asked her at the end.

00:05:10.538 --> 00:05:13.992
What is exactly the task that
this is supposed to be doing?

00:05:13.992 --> 00:05:16.240
She's like well you have
to rescue the dog, and

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.529
it just wants to go to its house.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.800
Wow, that is-
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.600
I thought that was kind of awesome.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.500
&gt;&gt; We should try that with
my daughter and see if,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.580
assuming she can sit still long enough,
and see what she would come up with.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.770
&gt;&gt; The other thing is when
you had in this position and

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.990
you really like the kind of
symmetries of it and stuff.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.114
We actually did this in a mall in New
Jersey where we had people come by and

00:05:36.114 --> 00:05:37.860
just see what they would do.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.880
You'd give them the game and they'd.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.780
And there was one woman who was a real
estate agent, who could just not

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.300
get over the idea that the actual
goal is to fix the Feng Shui.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.550
So if you look there's
a color in every corner,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.010
except the blue is not
quite in the corner.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.540
So she kept trying to move
the blue into the corner.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.850
&gt;&gt; And when I told her that she should
stop doing that, she just kept doing it

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.010
because [LAUGH] she was convinced
that the task was one of feng shui.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.810
&gt;&gt; I like that.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And that tells you everything you

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.350
need to know about why our real
estate market is the way it is.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.920
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And New Jersey.
