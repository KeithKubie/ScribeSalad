00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.440
I'm going to talk to you about
pressure, resistance and flow.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.940
We're going to try to make sure you feel

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.040
real comfortable with all three of these things

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.040
by the time we're done.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.860
So we start with the heart, and

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.060
off of the heart is the aorta.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.500
This is the largest artery in the body.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.300
And, this is one branch of the aorta.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.600
I didn't draw a lot of the other ones.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.820
This is the brachial artery.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.800
And the blood is flowing from the aorta

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.640
into the brachial artery.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.640
And let's say that the blood
is trying to make its way out to

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.640
our finger tips,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.640
for example.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.800
So on its way out there it makes its way

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.820
to an arterial

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.640
and the blood continues flowing

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.640
and it goes into a capillary bed

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.640
and the vessels are too small

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.100
to draw so I just kind of do that thing

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.640
and it then goes into

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.080
the other half of the capillary bed

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.640
where now the blood is deoxygenated.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.640
So I'm going to draw that as blue.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.940
That's the part where

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.880
now the blood is without oxygen

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.640
and then it continues to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.120
go and get collected

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.340
into a venule which

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.160
sounds a little bit like the arterial

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.180
on the other side, right?

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.640
We've got a vein over here

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.640
and then finally the blood gets

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.880
collected in a large vein

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.140
called the vena cava.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.640
And there are actually

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.640
two vena cavas, so this will be the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.260
superior vena cava.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.640
There is also an inferior vena cava.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.640
And the blood flow

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640
through this half

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.540
is, as you would guess, kind of

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.160
continues to go around.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.480
And if I was to try to figure out

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.220
the pressures, the blood pressures,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.180
at different points along this system

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.640
I'm going to choose some points

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.640
that I think would be interesting ones to check.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.640
So it would be good probably to check

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.640
what the pressure is right at the beginning

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.640
and then maybe at all the branch points

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.640
so what the pressure is

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.640
as the blood goes from the aorta to the

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.320
brachial artery.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.560
Maybe as it ends the brachial artery
and enters the arterial,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.680
maybe the beginning and the end
of the capillaries

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.640
also from the venule

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.640
to a vein and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.840
also, wrapping it up,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.680
what the pressure is at the end.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.680
Now these numbers

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.580
or these pressures can be

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.680
represented as numbers, right?
Like, what is the millimeters

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.680
of mercury

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.680
that the blood is exerting on the wall

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.680
at that particular point.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.640
in the system.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.000
And earlier we talked about

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.080
systolic versus diastolic pressure.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.520
And there we wanted to use two numbers

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.900
because that's kind of the range.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.420
The upper and the lower range of a pressure.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.180
But now I'm going to do it
with one number.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.520
And the reason I'm using
one number instead of two

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.740
is that this is the
average pressure over time.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.420
So the average pressure
over time, for me,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.720
keep in mind my blood pressure's
pretty normal

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.680
somewhere around
120 over 80 in my arm.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.940
So, the average pressure

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.700
in the aorta kind of coming out

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.400
would be somewhere around 95.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.980
And in the artery, in the arm,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.560
probably somewhere around 90.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.800
Again that's what you would expect,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.680
somewhere between 80 and 120.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.160
So 90 is the average because

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.820
it's going to be not exactly 100.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.200
Because, remember,
it's spending more time

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.280
in diastole and relaxation

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.880
than in systole.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.180
So it's going to be closer to 80
for that reason.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.660
And then if you check the pressure

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.060
over here by this X,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.500
probably be something
like, let's say, 80.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.820
And then as you
cross the arterial

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.480
the pressure falls dramatically.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.480
So it's somewhere closer to 30.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.480
And there here it's about 20.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.840
Here it's about 15.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.240
Let's say 10 over here.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.060
And then, at the very end,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.480
it's going to be close to a 5 or so.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.680
Here, let me try that
again.  10 and 5.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.160
And the units here
are millimeters of mercury.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.260
So I should just write that:
pressure in millimeters of mercury.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.820
That's the units that we're talking about.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.360
So, the pressure falls dramatically

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.940
from 95 all the way to 5.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.340
And the heart is
a pump, so it's going to

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.460
instill a lot of pressure
in that blood again

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.700
and pump it around and around

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.400
and that's what keeps
the blood flowing in one direction

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.320
So now let me ask you a question
and let's see if we can figure this out.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.980
Let's see if we can figure out
what the resistance is

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.400
in all of the vessels
in our body, combined.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.560
So we talked about resistance before

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.360
but now I wanted to pose this question.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.180
See if we can figure it out.
So what is

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.820
total body resistance.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.760
And that's really

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.520
the key question I wanted
to try to figure out with you.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.820
We know that there is some relationship
between radius and resistance

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.120
and we talked about vessels
and tubes and things like that,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.780
but let's really figure this out

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.300
and make this a little bit
more intuitive for us.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.760
So to do that

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.360
let's start with an equation.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.960
And this equation's really going to
walk us through this puzzle.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.400
So we've got pressure P
equals Q times R.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.060
Really easy to remember because

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.780
the letters follow each other
in the alphabet.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.780
And, here actually instead of P
let me put delta P

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.780
which is really "change in pressure".

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.600
So this is change in pressure.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.240
And a little doodle that
I always keep in my mind

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.900
to remember what
the heck that means is

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.520
if you have a little tube,
the pressure at the beginning --

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.640
Let me say "start".  The s is for start.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.720
-- and the pressure at the end

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.720
can be subtracted from one another.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:44.220
And that gives you Ps minus Pe
equals delta P.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.140
The change in pressure is really

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.200
the change from one part of the tube
to the end of the tube.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.300
And that's the first part
of the equation.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.300
So next we've got Q.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.440
So what is Q?  This is flow.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.540
And more specifically
it's blood flow.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.060
And this can be thought of
in terms of a volume.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.760
of blood over time.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.320
So let's say minutes.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.920
So how many liters of blood

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.580
are flowing in a minute.
Or two minutes,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.400
or whatever number
of minutes you decide.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.260
And that's kind of a hard thing
to figure out actually.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.360
But what we can figure out

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.180
is that Q, the flow, will equal
the stroke volume.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.520
And I'll tell you what this is
just after I write it.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.220
The stroke volume times the heart rate.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:43.480
So what that means is that
basically if you can know

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.280
how much blood is in each heartbeat--

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.220
so if you know the volume per heartbeat

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.420
and if you know how many
beats there are per minute,

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.060
then you can actually figure out
the volume per minute, right?

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.480
Because the beats would just
cancel each other out.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.440
And it just turns out,
it happens to be

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.720
that I'm about 70 kilos.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.940
That's me.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.520
I'm 70 kilos.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.900
And for a 70 kilogram person

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.180
the stroke volume is about
70 milliliters.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.500
So, for a 70 kilo person
you can expect

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.080
about 70 milliliters per beat

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.760
And, as I write this, let's say

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.500
my heart rate is about
70 beats per minute.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.520
I feel pretty calm

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.720
and so it's not too fast.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.900
So the beats cancel, as we said,

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.340
and I'm left with 70 milliliters

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.160
times 70 per minute.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:53.120
So that's about 4900
milliliters per minute.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.140
Or, if I was to simplify that's
a 5.  Let's say, about.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.300
So the flow is about 5 liters per minute.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.680
OK.  So I figured out the blood flow

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.940
and that was simply because
I happened to know my weight.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.260
And my weight tells me
the stroke volume.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.520
And I know that there's
a change in pressure.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.260
We've got to figure that out soon.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.180
And lastly, this last thing
over here is resistance.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.980
And I'm just going to--
I know I've said it before.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.000
I just want to point out
to you again

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.040
that resistance is going to be
proportional to 1/r to the fourth.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.080
And so just remember that
this is an important issue.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.440
r is radius, and that's the
radius of the vessel.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.660
So let's figure out this equation,
and how--

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.200
Let's figure out the
variables in this equation.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.020
and how it's going to help us solve

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.520
the question I asked you.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.140
What is the total body resistance?

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.520
OK.  So if I have to figure out
total body resistance--

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.080
Let me clear out the board.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.180
I've got, let's say,
the heart over here.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.200
I like to do the heart in red.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.040
And it's pumping blood
out my aorta.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.260
Right?  So blood is going out.
Out of the aorta.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.300
And then it's going and branching,

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.340
branching here,
branching here, let's say.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.980
And then it's going to
branch some more

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.640
and it's going to branch some more,

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.660
and you can see
where this is going.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.240
It's going to keep branching.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.940
And eventually every branch

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.700
kind of collects on the venous side.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.740
All the blood is
kind of filtering back in,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.620
solely into venules and veins.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.140
and finally into a vena cava.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.600
And I should really draw this going like that.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.160
The blood is going to go back
into the vena cava.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.760
So that's my system,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.300
and I've got to figure out

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.820
what the total body resistance is here.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.680
So, if I have a system
drawn out for myself

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.340
and I happen to know that--

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.540
here I said 95 and here I said
the pressure was 5--

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:03.380
then delta P equals 95 minus 5

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.380
which is 90.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.300
And I know that there are 5 liters

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.380
of blood flowing through per minute,

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.920
and that was my Q.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.680
So I could say 90

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.660
equals 5 liters per minute.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.080
Actually let me take
a step back from that.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.280
Instead of 90 let me write the units.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.620
90 millimeters of mercury

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.360
equals 5 liters per minute.
That was my flow.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.040
That's my Q.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.700
And I've got delta P here.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.300
and my resistance is the unknown

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.940
so I'll just leave that as R.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.700
So let's just solve for R.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.580
So I'll move my flow
to the other side.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.440
So R equals--
I'll put it here--

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:01.180
90 divided by 5 which is 18.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.520
And the units are a little funky

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.580
but I'll just write them out anyway.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:12.680
Millimeters of mercury times minutes
divided by liters.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.780
So this is the answer to my question.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.000
What is the total body resistance?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.660
Well we know what the pressures are

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.220
at the beginning and end of our system.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.560
And we know that the flow
has to be around 5 liters per minute

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.100
because that's based on
my weight and my heart rate.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.460
Therefore the resistance must be

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.180
18 millimeters of mercury
times minutes over liters.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.720
Whatever that set of units means to you.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.160
It's kind of an abstract thing.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.280
But basically I want to demonstrate to you

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.280
that this powerful equation
helps us solve

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.120
for what would otherwise be kind of
a tricky problem to figure out.
