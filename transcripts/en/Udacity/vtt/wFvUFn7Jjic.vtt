00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.280
At this point, the character of
our discussion of computability

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.320
is going to change significantly.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.900
We've established the key
properties of Turing machines.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.720
That they can do anything
we mean by computation,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.130
and that we can pass a description of
a Turing machine to a Turing machine

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.280
as input for it to simulate.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.930
With those points established, we won't
need to talk about the specifics of

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.860
Turing machines much anymore.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.460
There will be little about tapes, or
states, transitions, or head positions.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.000
Instead, we'll think about
computation at a very high level.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.119
Trusting that if we really had to,

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.810
we could write out
the Turing machine to do it.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.680
If we need to write out code,
we'll do so

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.590
mostly in pseudocode or with pictures.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.820
What is there left to talk about?

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.730
Well remember from the very first
lesson that we argued that not

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.890
all functions are computable or

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.440
as we later said not all languages
can be decided by Turing machines.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.330
We're now in a good position to talk
about some of these undecidable

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.540
languages.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.200
We had to wait until we established
the universality of Turing machines.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.200
Because these languages
are going to consist of strings

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.400
that encode Turing machines.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.190
The rest of the lesson we'll review
the definitions of recognizability and

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.200
decidability and then we'll talk
about the positive side of the story.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.660
The languages about Turing machines
that we can decide or recognize.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.790
As we'll see later,
there are plenty that we can't.
