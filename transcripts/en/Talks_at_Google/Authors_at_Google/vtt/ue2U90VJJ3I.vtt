00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.980
&gt;&gt; WU: I'm Olivia Wu. And, I'm one of the
seven Google executive chefs and one of some

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:21.019
400 cooks on this campus from dishwasher to
chef; all of us in someway or other have been

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:27.180
touched profoundly by our guest, Alice Waters.
If you've eaten at any café, your lives have

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:37.610
been enriched by her, it's an honor for me
to welcome her. In the '90s when I was a journalist

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.760
in Chicago, I had the chance to interview
Alice, I don't know if you remember this,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.930
Alice. The resulting story I wrote prompted
one reader to write back to me saying she

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.330
would never again look at a piece of food
in her local store the same way. She said

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:02.250
the story changed my life. There are only
a few seminal moments like this in the journalist

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.810
life and this was one of them for me. When
I knew for sure I was doing the right thing

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:15.810
and doing a good thing, and it was only because
I was a messenger for Alice. Alice's spear

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.329
of influence has truly inspired what has been
called and rightly so a revolution in this

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:28.409
country. And I don't call it a food revolution
because it is a revolution, it is about food

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.399
and how it touches all of us and the whole
culture. So what she started is a movement

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.909
that is far greater than the 60 seat iconic
store front restaurant she founded in Berkeley.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.359
She grew the restaurant not by profits and
not by volume, but by the idea to have cooking

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:54.649
and gardening in the nearby Berkeley's school
which became the Edible Schoolyard. Her ideas

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.819
grew to embrace a foundation housed next to
the restaurant then the entire 10,000 strong

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:06.380
students population of the Berkeley United
School District, gardens and prisons and other

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.209
communities. At the same time, she wrote cookbooks
and as well, grew generations of cooks who

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.340
then flew out of the Chez Panisse nest to
open their own restaurants. These restaurants

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.610
and kitchens were built on the same belief
that good food, food that nourishes, awakens,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.580
delights and builds individual's families
and communities begins at the source. The

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.920
source is the soil and the farmers who steward
the land and who grow food as artisans. It's

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.409
a simple idea but so easy to stray from. We
have, as a nation straight from both the philosophy

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:55.390
and the practice of caring for our farmlands
and therefore, our food, our children, our

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:03.970
families. As you know, obesity, diabetes,
heart disease, a whole string of chronic diseases

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.680
are at epidemic proportions in this country.
And I believe that as a planet, we're in similar

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.849
danger. I've been on assignment in China,
I grew up in Thailand, and I see so many parts

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.840
of the third world going in the same direction
of processed high volume of chemical food

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.920
production. Simplicity is at the core of Alice's
ideals and she's here today in part to talk

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.989
about her latest book: The Art of Simple Food.
And, and Alice is nothing if not about sensory.

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:47.989
As you can see, she's going to have us see,
touch and taste what food is about. So it's

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:54.329
one of the things I admire most about her
is this firm foundation of beliefs, she doesn't

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:00.970
budge from them. Two days ago, a couple of
us visited the Edible Schoolyard and then

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.959
we ended by having lunch at Café Fanny, and
one of us was talking about what we do, we

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:17.000
change our menus everyday and Alice simply
looked at him and said, "Why? Why do you change

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.970
your menus every day?" She said, "I could
eat some of the dishes we make here every

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:31.840
day, they are so good." And it is this simplicity
that I so admire in her. She's also here to

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.000
brainstorm with us later on the reform of
the National School Lunch Program, so she

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.180
doesn't think small, this woman. It is one
of the collaborations that I hardly hope Google

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.669
can engage in with her. And in so many ways,
I think, Alice's vision and Google's parallel

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:59.970
each other. Google's mission is to make the
world's information accessible and useful.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:10.580
And to Alice, real nourishing food from farm
to table should be a basic human right. Alice's

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:17.780
mission is to make that kind of food accessible
and useful. Please join me in welcoming her.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:37.310
&gt;&gt; WATERS: Well, I've always wanted to be
a vegetable vendor and I've always wanted

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:48.360
to come to Google. So, here I am, a vegetable
vendor at Google and you can tell exactly

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:57.790
what month this is so I know what this is,
it's because tomatoes are absolutely at their

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:04.490
peak. You know, we can begin eating them in
June in California, those little tiny ones,

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:11.760
they come in June. July, they're good, August,
they're getting there but September, they're

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:21.230
completely ripe and irresistible, and the
same with the peppers. These are, this is

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:27.970
what's happening right now. We went to the
farmer's market yesterday and brought all

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:34.040
these food right at the farmer's market, right
in front of Chez Panisse. You know when I

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:42.700
first fell in love with food and I was awakened.
I, undoubtedly, know that I was dipped and

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:50.460
indoctrinated when I first went to France
when I was 19. But every day on the way to

00:06:50.460 --> 00:07:00.161
school, I went by these open markets and I
just couldn't believe my eyes, I mean, and

00:07:00.161 --> 00:07:06.110
we go in these little restaurants and gather
with friends, and we get to eat this food.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:13.970
It's very simple. I didn't have any money
then to spend on food and I had grown up in

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:20.521
New Jersey on, you know what, New Jersey cuisine
was like in the '50s. It all just came in,

00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:29.300
in cans to Hoboken. You know, they did, they
did a lampoon, a Harvard lampoon piece on

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:37.199
the, on New Jersey cuisine--New Jersey cooking.
And, it was one of those that, that was exactly

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:45.640
like the Time Life Series and so there were
these little pictures every step was, was

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:55.050
in a little box there, and I'll never forget
they were teaching people how to boil water,

00:07:55.050 --> 00:08:02.251
really. Now, turn on the tap, you know, put
the pan under the, you know, just this way

00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:12.280
and I just thought how could that have happened,
you know, that we, that I grew up in a place

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:21.720
where people were so disconnected to their
food. I--my family had a victory garden during

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:27.840
the war and we always had, you know, food
from the garden. We had this beautiful corn--where

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:35.801
is my corn? This beautiful corn, and tomatoes
and I loved them my whole life because we

00:08:35.801 --> 00:08:41.269
picked them right before we cook them, threw
them in the water, sliced the tomatoes and

00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:50.600
that was dinner. But, a lot of people don't
eat like that anymore. I mean, I would say

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:58.950
and I've heard and I believe it's true that
as many as 85% of the population in this country

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:06.880
doesn't sit down for a meal with family and
friends. Now they may think they do because

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.480
they kind of set the table for the kids and
they give the kids, you know, something to

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.510
eat and maybe they come in at the end of the
meal and they eat something else. Or, or maybe

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:26.029
they, you know, are watching, let's see, what
would they be watching on television for the

00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:30.540
virtual experience like Martha Stewart and
they're sitting there and they're watching

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:36.420
that and feeling like they're cooking, and
participating. But most people haven't made

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:47.910
the time for that, and I think it's really
because we haven't tasted something that's

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:54.029
irresistible. You know I didn't start the
restaurant because I believed in sustainability.

00:09:54.029 --> 00:10:02.871
I mean, I did grow up in Berkeley and so I
had some of that in me, but I didn't do it

00:10:02.871 --> 00:10:09.200
for that reason. I was just trying to find
food that tasted like the food that I've eaten

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.800
in France and I couldn't find it. You know
I used to go through all of the green beans

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:21.779
in a box, all of the green beans, taking out
the little, tiny Kentucky wonder green beans

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:27.060
because I thought they were the variety of
aricover (ph) like French green beans. They

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:32.760
were just immature Kentucky wonder beans but
it took me a long time and I threw out the

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:38.320
whole rest of the box and just took my little
handful so we had to get ten boxes of it to

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:44.320
do that and it used to take us eight hours
to do the lettuce because I wanted every outer

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:51.850
leaf to be taken off because they were so
bruised. I just wanted that little inner one,

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:59.350
but, of course, it depends on how you pick
that lettuce and you don't have to wait until

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:06.790
it's all overgrown and slightly bolted in
the center. You pick that lettuce when it's

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:16.120
young. But, this is a whole process that we
went through at the restaurant and it began

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.829
by somebody growing us some radishes in their
backyard nearby and I decided I would trade

00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:25.070
lunch at Chez Panisse for the radishes. And
then, this person put in a few other things,

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:34.940
they said, this is a good deal. And, oh then,
somebody came in with a little handful of

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:44.250
fingerling potatoes from Germany and he said,
about how many, can I--my wife and I eat upstairs

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:53.089
for this little, this little handful of potatoes.
And, of course, I said yes but, 20 years later,

00:11:53.089 --> 00:12:01.750
I realized that he had brought me my first
fingerling potatoes. They were a variety that

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:07.980
was very special to him and his family because
they had brought the seeds from Germany and

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:13.060
planted them, but I didn't know that then,
thank, God, I gave them a couple of meals

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:29.519
but, it was, it's this whole, a kind of--it
takes time to do it. But, the great part is

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:38.920
this reward that you get at the end, and it's
not only beautiful but, you realize that at

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:45.930
the same time that you're eating, you're taking
care of the people who are taking care of

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:53.380
the land for the future. So every time I go
to the farmer's market, I feel like I am making

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:58.730
a donation to the future of this country and
the greenbelt around San Francisco. They will

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:04.709
say it's too expensive, you know, they overprice
everything at the Ferry Plaza Market, why

00:13:04.709 --> 00:13:12.310
are you going shopping there? And I say over
and over, I want to make that donation. I

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:19.130
want to give my money to those people; I want
to give them my feedback. And, you know, why

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:23.940
don't we order everything on the computer,
why don't you? It's much easier to do it that

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:34.660
way. Why are you calling people up and taking
so much time? And, I say, you know, I want

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:39.020
to talk to Bob Kennar, he's a farmer who's
one hour from Chez Panisse and he's been growing

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:49.250
vegetables for us for 20 years. And, I want
to know how he is kind of because if I can

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:55.759
have his vegetables, if I didn't have those,
Chez Panisse would not be what it is. This

00:13:55.759 --> 00:14:06.579
is our 38th birthday of the restaurant and
it's always new to me because of the varieties

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:12.769
of produce and the breeds of animals and the
way people discover things in the ocean that

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:24.690
we can eat and I'm just, I'm kind of thrilled
by it. But, I want to talk to Bob because

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:35.320
he amuses me, that's why I want to talk to
Bob. He's always making a joke on the phone

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.240
and he kind of lifts my spirit. He says, "I'll
send you down a big old branch with cherries

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.310
and why don't you just pass them around the
dining room and people can pick their own,"

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:52.290
and I thought about that, that's a great idea.
Why don't we do that? That we take the people

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:56.100
who work at Chez Panisse out to the farm.
You know, there was a story in the New York

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:05.910
Times a couple of weeks ago, and they were
talking about Kim Severson in the food section,

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:15.009
was talking about how people, very wealthy
people who are now going back to have a farm

00:15:15.009 --> 00:15:22.170
vacation with their family. Almost as if,
it's a quaint little thing like Marie Antoinette

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:30.320
going out to the, you know, they have her
little pastoral experience. But, in fact,

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:37.579
you know, I had little; I was upset with Kim
with the way she wrote it because that's exactly

00:15:37.579 --> 00:15:46.050
what we need to do, is sort of come back to
our senses. I don't think there's anybody

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:54.380
here that wouldn't be slightly curious to
milk a cow. How many people in this room have

00:15:54.380 --> 00:16:03.780
milked a cow? Oh, that's good, you're already
saved; you've milked a cow. This, how many

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:11.529
people have killed a chicken? Ah, this is
very unlikely. I don't think you could do

00:16:11.529 --> 00:16:18.519
this any other place. Seriously, this is very,
very good because it is knowing about that

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:24.070
experience so that you can identify with it.
I went one time down to the Chino Ranch in

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:29.709
Southern California and they--we were picking
beans, those little straight, little string

00:16:29.709 --> 00:16:38.560
beans and the tiny little things they were
bringing out to their farm stand. And, I just

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:44.509
couldn't believe it. It was the hardest work
I have ever done. I was out there and just

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:50.550
dripping with perspiration, my back hurt in
five minutes, and I just--how can they do

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:58.860
this and send Chez Panisse a box this big
of little aricover (ph). I mean, who's doing

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:06.170
this work? I mean, you couldn't pay me enough
to do the work. I just, it was too hard for

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:13.680
me to do this. And so, that's the other piece
that we have to really contemplate is--and

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:25.930
slow food calls this the fair part that we
have to pay people the real price of the work--for

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:35.080
the work that they do. And, if we don't empathize
with the people that are doing that work,

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:43.920
we can appreciate it. We have been indoctrinated
in the way of fast food, and we've learned

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:50.700
fast food values which tell us not to care
about where our food comes from, and not to

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:58.030
care about the people who produce it; it magically
happens. Resources are infinite. They should

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:02.190
be opened--food stores should be opened 24
hours a day. There's no season, it doesn't

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:12.540
matter. You can eat by yourself, you can eat
in five minutes, and it's those values that

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:22.360
are changing the world because that's how
they think about everything. They, meaning

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:33.300
people who are not eating consciously are--those
values just come in osmosis as you grab your

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:44.600
lunch. You just think about entertainment
that way. I just want the best bits, you know,

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.370
I just want to have those. I don't, I don't
have the time to really listen to the whole

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:59.810
lecture. I just like the clip notes, but it's--what
we're getting is kind of the clip notes on

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:10.640
our life. We're not living our lives and that's
the sad part is that--that it does take time

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:22.080
to go to the farmer's market, just take time
but it's such a rewarding experience, I can't

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:29.940
tell you and every time you find something
that you don't know about now. I've never

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:37.770
seen these before, perhaps, I have because--because
it looks like it's attached to the kohlrabi

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:43.750
but I'm not sure because we don't have use
kohlrabi at the restaurant, we haven't and

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:53.140
all of a sudden, it's without that and I'm
a little--I'm delighted by the color of it.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:20:01.720
I just, you know, it just goes so beautifully
with these eggplants. They're so fantastic

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:08.780
and the little vericated eggplant as well
and then you get maroon okra and if you had

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.720
okra everyday or kohlrabi greens, I'm not
sure, has anybody cooked kohlrabi greens?

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:23.030
Yes, tell me how do you cook them--you steamed
them--beautiful, no garlic but that's a--what?

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:34.460
I like this--this is beautiful, he just steams
them, do you put it in olive oil or [INDISTINCT]

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:40.660
yeah, at the end, but just steaming greens
when they're incredibly tasty--that's what

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:53.000
is best, just slicing a tomato. Now, but we
have lost all of our confidence in being able

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:02.920
to cook and we think that really cooking is
about complication in a way that we really

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.990
admire the people who do fancy French cooking,
the best selling cook book in the United States

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:16.570
is Thomas Keller, you know, and except for
Julia Child's had a big comeback but Thomas

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:28.730
Keller and I think and you know, who is cooking
that very complicated food? I can't cook that

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:39.940
way, you know, I'm just don't know how and
yet at the same time, we're not engaging in

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:48.720
the very simplest way of eating, we're not
just finding the ingredient and allowing it

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:56.190
to speak for itself. There was a whole time
at Chez Panisse when the French would come

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:03.350
over and they'd hear about Chez Panisse and
they'd come and they'd just see, you know,

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:09.280
what would maybe, you know, cucumber salad
and with some of these little beautiful cucumbers

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:16.140
and they say to me, "Ooh," you know that's
not cooking, that's shopping, that's not cooking,

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:23.780
that's shopping. And the great thing is now
they come back and they say, "Oh, it is about

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:31.370
shopping," and you know and Daniel Bullock
[ph] in New York is one of the greatest proponents

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:40.550
of local organic, finding the rare breeds
of the animals and they know so much about

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:52.660
this because they had a gastronomic or they
still do have a culture that understands Gastronomy

00:22:52.660 --> 00:23:04.970
but very sadly, we allowed the sort of melting
pot of America to just stir it all up there

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:16.320
and now, we don't know anything as a culture
about where our food comes from, how it is

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:22.970
grown? What it's supposed to taste like? What
it could taste like? And it's the reason that

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:30.940
I believe that we need to go back to school.
We need to educate ourselves as a nation and

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:41.650
the best way in my mind is to bring little
children into it, you know, start in kindergarten,

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:49.070
start in preschool. I used to teach Montessori,
it was all about, you know, smelling. This

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:59.990
has a good smell. And this is a lemon cucumber
but I've never sort of put my nose to a cucumber

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:08.080
before in that way. But this is something
that we used to do with the kids, we used

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:16.680
to put a bag of vegetables out and they'd
have to reach in this bag and guess what the

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.580
vegetables were and so they just have to touch
them. We had little exercises that--where

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:30.190
they have to match the smells in little cylinders--what
is that? Is that cumin or is that, you know,

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:37.010
coffee or is that, no we can't use coffee
in it. That we put in, you know, things pepper

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:45.690
and things that, herbs that were highly scented
and they had to match them up and this was

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:54.380
what I could--what Montessori called as sensual
education. To look at the colors or the little

00:24:54.380 --> 00:25:02.830
gradations of greens. It's a way and these
little beautiful ones are, maybe you've seen

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:08.290
this, the two colored ones and you kind of
wonder what's inside? Is it--is it really

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:16.500
going to be green all the way through? And
then you open that up but these are the surprises

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:23.980
that the kids, you know, when they have a
class out in the garden and it's not a gardening

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:32.421
class, it's a Math class or it's a Science
class but when they're out there in the garden

00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:42.560
measuring the beds or figuring out about a
worm box or the drainage for the garden. They're

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:51.120
eating the raspberries. They're, you know,
picking some of the greens for a salad in

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.990
the kitchen or they're biting into an Asian
pear and they're planting seeds. So, it's

00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:05.680
just coming in, just like the osmosis experience
of being in a fast-food joint, it affects

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:17.350
you or it deadens you, let's put it that way,
that's what's happening, I think when you

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:25.710
eat like that and this experience in the garden
is awakening the kids. They're just feeling

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:31.180
that. They come into the room in the kitchen
and I went in there yesterday, just to show

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:37.060
my daughter around, we're walking through
the garden in the morning, we walked into

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:42.290
the kitchen and they were making pesto and
the whole kitchen smells like garlic and basil

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:49.710
and all these kids were pounding in their
mortars and pestles and I just thought this

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:59.100
is fantastic, I mean you don't even--you just
feel good in that kitchen, you don't know

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.180
what's happening, you just feel good and I
should have roasted some garlic for you this

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:10.470
afternoon because I wanted that, that kind
of--you just responding with your nose as

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:18.090
well as your eyes and it is touching this,
that is so delightful for me. I'm just--when

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:25.060
I go to the farmer's market again, I just
grab my basket, I take my--this is my basket

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:31.800
and I just--I can't get enough, I mean I fill
this, I never believe in taking more than

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:41.640
I can carry in my basket or if I have a couple
of [INDISTINCT] with me, I'd laid them down

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:50.070
but I'm trying to take home what I carry,
what I can carry and I just, you know, but

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:59.700
it's--it is that kind of experience of falling
in love and that's what we're trying to create

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:08.820
because for children, is a caring experience,
so we put a table cloth on the table and we

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:13.910
get them to go out and pick something for
his centerpiece and they just--they'd find

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:19.220
all kinds of things, they may just find a
whole bunch of these peppers and put them

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:24.780
down on the center of the table. Some of the
kids pick some flowers in the garden or maybe

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:30.160
it's a little bouquet of kohlrabi but it's
whatever they want and they're responding

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:37.641
not just to the food but it's the care that's
comes with food, that's what's happening and

00:28:37.641 --> 00:28:48.970
it's very seductive, that because they don't
have that at home, that kind of attention,

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:57.190
everybody is--one in two families is working,
I mean, not one in every two families but

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:05.130
what I really want to say was one in every
two people in this country is divorced, okay?

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:14.960
So, just think about that. Both families are
working and so what happens to the kids, where

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:24.820
do they go? Who's taking care of them? And
it's the reason that we need to have a program

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:31.160
in the school that feeds all children for
free, they don't have to pay for it, it's

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:43.290
all part of a core curriculum in Ecology and
Gastronomy so that's the big vision. I call

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:48.930
it "The Delicious Revolution," by the way.
It isn't just any old revolution because this

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:59.380
isn't about having to study really hard, you
know, have that little red book. This is about

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:06.870
something else, this is opening yourself up,
and it all comes in because we have--our DNA

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:16.610
is programmed. It's already in our computer.
So, all you have to do is touch it. And it

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:23.440
comes right back. This isn't anything new;
people have been eating like this since the

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:33.380
beginning of time. Picking what's local, saving
the food that is, you know, in abundance at

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:39.201
a certain time for the winter months, selling
them in the market place, eating with family

00:30:39.201 --> 00:30:46.041
and friends, saving seeds because they're
precious, thinking of food as something that

00:30:46.041 --> 00:31:03.620
is absolutely, what would I say, absolutely,
the center of one's life. It is not to say

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:13.210
that it has to take for a long time, it just
has to be--it's what we're all made off and

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:20.100
we need to pay attention in that way and it's
been that way, as I said since the beginning

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:29.480
of time, it's only this huge interruption
that happened after the war 50 years ago.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:45.340
That is the kind of a western way of eating,
this way that is so connected to consumerism.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:53.310
And the idea that people would really make
a lot of money of selling somebody something

00:31:53.310 --> 00:32:04.000
that wasn't good for him. And so we're in
a pretty impossible place and I'm hoping you

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:15.050
can help us get out of it, that's my hope
and I'd loved to answer some questions, anybody

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:16.760
have any questions about this beautiful watermelon.
I hated watermelon.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.240
&gt;&gt; Please go up to the microphones to ask
Alice about your questions so that people

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:35.330
at YouTube can hear.
&gt;&gt; Hi, thanks for coming. What kind of fertilizer

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:41.520
do you use in the gardens that you have?
&gt;&gt;WATERS: Let me just tell you that, I don't

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:52.990
do the gardening for Chez Panisse but I can
tell you that the kind of compost that Bob

00:32:52.990 --> 00:33:04.040
Kennar uses is on his produce, comes from
an incredibly rich mix of Chez Panisse compost.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:14.400
So we put it everyday into these bins and
we take it up to Bob Kennar and bring the

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:19.760
vegetables back. Now I know he uses everything
from oyster shells, he makes his own little,

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:31.180
I don't know what you would call it, you have
to go up there and see him, he's got his own

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:36.040
special blend. But in my backyard, I have
a little compost bucket that I keep on the

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:48.740
counter at all times, I only put in vegetable
waste and I have the most amazing little small

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:52.590
vegetable garden. Yes?
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you for coming. So, my question

00:33:52.590 --> 00:34:02.640
is regarding making healthy local food accessible
to the population, so this is related to poverty.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:11.909
And so, how do we make it so for people in
lower income levels are able to afford, I

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:16.730
mean, right access is just one part of it
but then, how do we lower the costs so it's

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:21.330
accessible? And I guess there was one story
that I heard about the other day on MPR and

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:25.820
maybe you'd care to comment, so, one idea
was being thrown around that, you know, we

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:30.830
could take food stamps change the food stamp
program somehow, so people could bring their

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.880
food stamps to local Farmers Markets.
&gt;&gt;WATERS: That's happening.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:38.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, I was just wondering if you have
any thoughts on that topic.

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:45.750
&gt;&gt;WATERS: Well, I have lots of thoughts on
this topic, but, just to say that in New York,

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:52.220
they're doing another little variation on
that that's wonderful, because when there

00:34:52.220 --> 00:35:01.300
the food stamps exchange, it still is more
expensive, of course, to buy in the Farmers

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:06.840
Market. So, they decided that when people
exchange them in the framers market, a $5

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:12.620
food stamp would be worth $8 in the market,
and I think it's a brilliant little variation.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:23.080
But, we're never going to pay less for food,
unless, I mean, unless the government decides

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:34.900
to subsidize all organic food. But that could
happen, but I see that there's even the ultimate

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:46.600
way to do this. It's my own stimulus program.
Now we can talk about billions. So, I would

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:55.370
put the money into schools to feed every child
at school, a breakfast, a lunch and an afternoon

00:35:55.370 --> 00:36:01.260
snack. And then I would give, which would
give money right back to the parents and the

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:06.670
families because they would know that the
children were eating well, and that would

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:13.060
help, that would be money in their pockets.
And then I would make a criteria for the buying

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:21.070
of the food in the schools. So that people
purchase the majority of food from local sustainable

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:31.230
people which would stimulate the economy locally
and if they, if the stipulation was to buy

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:40.330
all of their products from local and sustainable
people, just imagine what could happen, paper

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:50.100
plates, we're talking about everything. But
Chez Panisse has served 500 people a day.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:57.540
We support maybe 85 farms, two farms in a
major way totally, but you know all of these

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.380
other people during the course of the year.
Berkley has 10,000 children in school. So,

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:12.430
just imagine what would happen if you made
that commitment to fund the schools in that

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:24.500
way? We would institute a program that came
with a school lunch that educated all the

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:30.830
children about stewardship of the land, how
to feed themselves, how to have a conversation

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:38.850
at the table, you know, we don't know about
this. This is the sort of the building of

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:46.530
a world community. And I see that the most
extraordinary information is being passed

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:58.070
around right now, from the whole slow food
movement globally in a 151 countries. I see

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:08.290
that the bio diversity of this planet is helping
people everywhere to figure out how, what

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:15.740
they can grow and how they can eat it in a
delicious and nourishing way. And so, that

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:27.920
is this internet that I'm just and I am nearly
illiterate in this--on this front, I do have

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:36.630
accent and I love taking pictures of all this
beautiful. I do do that. But I love the way

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:42.660
we're able to communicate about this, and
it's a beautiful thing. I didn't answer your

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:48.480
question, but I don't want to--I don't want
to pay less, I don't want to pay less for

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:57.990
my food, I want to pay more because I know
what it means to do that work. Yes?

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:05.460
&gt;&gt; As a relatively recent Farmers Market addict,
I'd like to add my voice in thanks, I'm also

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:13.620
wondering how you weigh in on this debate
over whether the mainstreaming of organic

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:20.180
as per the California state definition--the
mainstreaming of organic food in grocery stores,

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:31.010
whether that is actually helping or hurting
the sustainable local market, not market just

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:38.440
the nature of sustainable local food.
&gt;&gt;WATERS: When we're uneducated about it,

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:45.010
we end up in that place, I can get that over
at Whole Foods and it'd cost less than at

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:51.990
the Union Square Farmers Market, you know.
That's what you're weighing against and you

00:39:51.990 --> 00:40:01.631
have to really make that kind of commitment.
I think to the farmers that you get to know,

00:40:01.631 --> 00:40:09.440
that's what I love about being in that Farmers
Market. It's not to say that there isn't sort

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:22.400
of a general education going on through supermarkets
that sell organic food. But they aren't reaching

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:35.620
us--they're teaching, for me, it's selling
slow food in fast food packages. I want slow

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:41.480
food, and I don't mean slow in preparation
because I can make a meal in 10 minutes, I'm

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:53.670
not talking about that, I'm talking about
the beauty and connection pieces that are

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:59.670
missing at that big market place.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:05.070
&gt;&gt; Hi. I recently heard--I think it was Michael
Pollins (ph) say that he thought one of the

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:10.800
most profound things that the Obama Administration
has done so far was having Michelle Obama

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:16.420
plant a garden and I was wondering if this
is a time when you might actually have the

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.930
ear of the White House for some of these ideas
that you have?

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:27.440
&gt;&gt;WATERS: Well, I'll try my very best. And
anybody who knows those right people would

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:34.540
just need to spread this word around. But
tomorrow, a Farmers Market is opening up one

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:42.050
block away from the White House. And the young
chef who's in the White House, who's feeding

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:52.330
the Obamas is somebody very dedicated to edible
education and I know he's doing everything

00:41:52.330 --> 00:42:03.150
he can do right now to bring these ideas right
there to the table. I think it was remarkable

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:10.480
that Michelle Obama just put that shovel in
the ground. I mean, it was really a great,

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:17.590
great moment in my life. To see children,
right there, and we got to learn where food

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:22.230
really comes from. It's beautiful. And he's
got beehive. If you can imagine, he's got

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:27.970
a bee, I've seen he's got a compost system
that runs at 160 degrees. Can you imagine

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:36.000
right there in the White House lawn. And nobody
said a thing. Nobody said a thing, well, why

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.089
wasn't somebody protesting that? Yes?
&gt;&gt; So, a lot of fairly serious questions.

00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:43.630
&gt;&gt; WATERS: Oh, yes.
&gt;&gt; And a slightly lighter one. You mentioned

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:49.470
when you're talking about sort of problem
with the existing food system, you know, we

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:51.940
are on those fast food ultra-convenient on-the-go
food, not really thinking about it, cheap,

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:57.740
and then you throw in 24 hours and I really
love Farmers Markets, I especially love the

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:05.060
Alemany Farmers Market in San Francisco, but
my natural sleep schedule, if I really had

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:12.079
a choice, is about waking up at 11 and going
to sleep at about three.

00:43:12.079 --> 00:43:14.313
&gt;&gt; WATERS: Ooh.
&gt;&gt; What are all the serious food movement

00:43:14.313 --> 00:43:19.850
people have against me?
&gt;&gt; WATERS: You know, you have to move to move

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:26.030
to Bolinas. They have a 24 hour Farmers Market
stand. And it's the best. It's just the best--you

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:33.320
can't believe it. You just get to weigh your
vegetables and put your money in the box.

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:43.760
I just love a 24-hour farm stand. And all
this trust and that's--I think we—you know,

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:49.100
I'm not somebody who stays up until three
in the morning anymore, I used to be, when

00:43:49.100 --> 00:44:02.380
I was working at the restaurant, but I think
we do need to, you know, make food more, real

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:09.730
food available to people. And there's nothing
wrong with having a lovely little pizza. I

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:15.410
just want to know where the flour for the
dough came, I want to know where did the cheese

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:21.950
came from. Who made the cheese? I want to
know who grew the oregano, I want to know

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:28.930
how it was processed, I want to know the details
of the providence. And that's what I care

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:36.411
about. I care about how it tastes, too. But
I really care about where it comes from. And

00:44:36.411 --> 00:44:44.430
it could be a hotdog. You know, but it's about
the bun and the mustard and the catsup. And

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:50.200
where is that meat from? Where is that meat
from? Yes?

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:54.380
&gt;&gt; I love going to the Farmers Market too
and just buying whatever looks interesting

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:58.360
or smells interesting or whatever farmers
seem particularly inspired about whatever

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:03.390
it is they're selling on that day, they tell
you, "This is the thing to get today." I'll

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:07.250
get it so, you must've done something like
that with that stuff that it's front of you

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:11.711
right now. If you had 10 minutes to make a
meal, right now out of that, what would you

00:45:11.711 --> 00:45:12.711
be making?
&gt;&gt; WATERS: What would I make? Ooh, that's

00:45:12.711 --> 00:45:15.030
a very…
&gt;&gt; But assuming you had a kitchen.

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:21.100
&gt;&gt; WATERS: Well, I know I would use these.
I would use these. I'd put a pot of water,

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:30.520
bang, on the stove, I have a steamer. These
are Tokyo turnips, I take the little tops

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:38.120
off, I'd probably take this off, take this
off, leave the top, I'd cut it in four or

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:46.100
six if I wanted, maybe cook it a little bit
longer. And I cut them in half, just when

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:57.010
they're nearly cooked, I'd throw in the greens
and I may rip them up a little bit and throw

00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:05.340
in the greens, I think that's about five minutes,
I think I'd probably make myself a little

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:09.900
salad with some greens, slice some tomatoes,
slice it a few cucumbers, very quickly while

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:19.020
my turnips were cooking. You know, if I—-now,
I see these guys, I could cook these, I can

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:28.180
steam these or I can do a really fast sauté
with garlic, some olive oil, these little

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:33.800
tiny cauliflower and broccoli that's there.
And these are—-I've never seen any this

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:38.870
small, these little baby cabbages. Now, I
think they're probably from the last crop,

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:43.840
and they just cut the ones that weren't going
to have time to get bigger and they're on

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:50.380
the next crop of cabbages. Oh, and I have
a little corn. And I take it off the cob,

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:59.083
or just throw the corn into the pot. Take
it out and eat it, and some watermelon for

00:46:59.083 --> 00:47:05.030
dessert. And I don't have a lemon here but
that's probably what I do, I might just throw

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:11.890
these in the steamer as well. Or boiling water
and cut them in half, length-wise. If I had

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:19.280
my little knife here, which I don't have,
we'd see whether it was green on the top,

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:27.650
and I'm somehow missing herbs. They must be
in the big box in the back. But I always use

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:33.030
herbs. Whether it's, you know, I have lots
of things that are growing up every color,

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:36.530
every kind, every shape. Because one meal,
I make an orange salad with purple things.

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:44.840
And the next day, I may want a red salad up
with these early growth, with little tiny

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:51.130
green basil. And you could eat tomato salad
every single day of this beautiful month of

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:57.780
tomatoes and never get tired of them. Ever,
because it's just and then the third day,

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.410
I'm eating every color all mixed together.
Just goes on like that. Yes?

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:02.141
&gt;&gt; Thanks for coming. So, you talked a little
bit about the uniting experience of food and

00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:11.710
what a family shares, I wanted to know if
you could share one of your poignant food

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:18.300
memories.
&gt;&gt; WATERS: Well, one comes to mind. I have

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:28.760
lots in France. Lots and lots and maybe the
one that is recurring the most is one with

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:43.200
a winery in the south of France, it's called
Domaine Tempier. And the woman who's the proprietress

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:51.402
just had her 90th birthday. And she's very
short; she was kind of my size. And she cooks

00:48:51.402 --> 00:48:57.820
some bouillabaisse. And her whole family helps
to prepare, the fire, she gets the big branches

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:03.119
from the, you know, the vines that are pruned
every spring and the old vines—-oh, you

00:49:03.119 --> 00:49:08.930
have to pass out some food for them to eat.
Oh, God, yes, for them, please. I forgot to

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:17.590
feed you. How could I have forgotten that?
Oh, my goodness. Well, these are some figs

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:28.640
and some peaches. That I thought were ripe
and nice, so, just grab a piece as you go.

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:34.350
But anyway, she has a huge copper cauldron.
And they—-we'd go down to the market place

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:41.300
and she has her fishermen and they bring in
all these little tiny fish, and she makes

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:48.210
it right there over the big roaring fire.
And we sit at the table that's probably twice

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:59.860
as long as this table and we eat the fish
first with [INDISTINCT]. And then we have

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:08.500
this bouillon that is just served down the
table and lots of Rosé wine. And then she

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:17.960
always has some beautiful goat cheeses for
dessert. But that's kind of a recurring beautiful

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:28.780
moment in my life. In my dream life. Anybody
else have anything burning? How many cooks

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:35.740
work at shifts-—oh, I have something really
burning. Okay, I do, thank you, all right.

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:41.441
I printed this manifesto of slow food out.
Everybody was saying, we'll just send it.

00:50:41.441 --> 00:50:51.440
Send it in an email to everybody here. But
I just decided that I wanted to you to put

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:59.900
it on your wall and look at it—-or use it
as a place mat. I didn't want you to have

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:06.840
it on a screen, in a little screen. Or even
a bigger screen, I wanted you to hold it.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:18.200
And read what Carlo Bettrini (ph) said when
he started the slow food movement in Italy

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:25.350
about 20-25 years ago in the Piaza de Spana.
He protested a McDonald's coming into the

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:37.080
square. And he sat down on a big old table
with all of his friends and they ate pasta

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:44.590
and drank wine. And they dreamed this up.
And I think it says everything eloquently,

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:48.330
I really believe them. So, I hope you will
take it all to heart and the last sentence

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:56.760
here says, "Slow food is an idea, it needs
plenty of qualified supporters who can help

00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:00.620
turn this slow motion into an international
movement," with a little snail as its symbol.

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:11.200
And that's what I'm hoping you all can do.
So, thank you so much for coming.
