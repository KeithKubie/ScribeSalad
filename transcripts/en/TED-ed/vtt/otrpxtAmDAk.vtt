00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:30.262
You might have heard that we're running out of fresh water.

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:31.758
This might sound strange to you because,

00:00:31.758 --> 00:00:33.691
if you live in a place where water flows freely

00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:35.879
from the tap or shower at any time,

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.861
it sure doesn't seem like a big deal.

00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:39.694
It's just there, right?

00:00:39.694 --> 00:00:40.781
Wrong!

00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:42.531
The only obvious thing about fresh water

00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:44.785
is how much we need it.

00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:46.244
Because it's essential to life,

00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:48.173
we need to think about it carefully.

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:51.067
Right now, at this very moment, some people,

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:53.102
women and girls in particular,

00:00:53.102 --> 00:00:56.127
walk hours and miles per day to get fresh water,

00:00:56.127 --> 00:00:58.632
and even then, it may not be clean.

00:00:58.632 --> 00:01:02.809
Every 15 seconds, a child dies due to water-born diseases.

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.436
This is tragic!

00:01:04.436 --> 00:01:06.640
The most compelling reasons to think about fresh water,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.405
therefore, have to do with what we might call

00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:09.994
the global common good.

00:01:09.994 --> 00:01:11.687
This is not something we normally think about,

00:01:11.687 --> 00:01:14.499
but it means recognizing how much fresh water matters

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:17.162
for the flourishing of human and non-human life on Earth

00:01:17.162 --> 00:01:19.909
now and in the future.

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.322
How do we think about something

00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:22.660
as local as our faucets

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.578
and as global as fresh water?

00:01:24.578 --> 00:01:27.330
Is there a connection between them?

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.580
Many people assume that fresh water shortages

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.712
are due to individual wastefulness:

00:01:31.712 --> 00:01:34.001
running the water while you brush your teeth, for example,

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.458
or taking really long showers.

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:37.828
Most of us assume, therefore,

00:01:37.828 --> 00:01:39.423
that water shortages can be fixed

00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:41.300
by improving our personal habits:

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.891
taking shorter showers

00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:45.468
or turning off the water while we brush our teeth.

00:01:45.468 --> 00:01:46.977
But, global fresh water scarcity

00:01:46.977 --> 00:01:49.504
neither starts nor ends in your shower.

00:01:49.504 --> 00:01:51.581
Globally, domestic use of fresh water

00:01:51.581 --> 00:01:54.251
accounts for only 8% of consumption,

00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:55.680
8%!!

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.025
Compare that to the 70% that goes to agriculture

00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:01.242
and the 22% that goes to industrial uses.

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:04.156
Now, hold up - you're not off the hook!

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:06.734
Individual habits are still part of the puzzle.

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:09.826
You should still cultivate water virtue in your daily life,

00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:12.039
turn off the tap when you brush your teeth.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.707
But still, it's true.

00:02:13.707 --> 00:02:16.519
Taking shorter showers won't solve global problems,

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.093
which is too bad.

00:02:18.093 --> 00:02:20.589
It would be much more straightforward and easier

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:23.926
if virtuous, individual actions could do the trick.

00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:26.143
You'd just stand there for 30 seconds less,

00:02:26.143 --> 00:02:27.769
and you'd be done with that irksome,

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.141
planet-saving task for the day.

00:02:30.141 --> 00:02:32.559
Well, that's not so much the case.

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.978
Agricultural and industrial patterns of water use

00:02:34.978 --> 00:02:36.814
need serious attention.

00:02:36.814 --> 00:02:38.855
How do our societies value water?

00:02:38.855 --> 00:02:39.739
Distribute it?

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.577
Subsidize its use in agriculture?

00:02:41.577 --> 00:02:45.186
Incentivize its consumption or pollution?

00:02:45.186 --> 00:02:47.238
These are all questions that stem from

00:02:47.238 --> 00:02:49.868
how we think about fresh water's value.

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:51.676
Is it an economic commodity?

00:02:51.676 --> 00:02:52.877
A human right?

00:02:52.877 --> 00:02:54.289
A public good?

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:55.690
Nobel prize winners,

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.543
global water justice activists,

00:02:57.543 --> 00:03:00.129
transnational institutions like the United Nations,

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.491
and even the Catholic Church

00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:03.043
are at work on the issue.

00:03:03.043 --> 00:03:04.397
But, it's tricky, too,

00:03:04.397 --> 00:03:05.769
because the business of water

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.666
became very profitable in the 20th century.

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:12.680
And profit is not the same thing as the common good.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.546
We need to figure out

00:03:13.546 --> 00:03:16.238
how to value fresh water as a public good,

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:18.683
something that's vital for human and non-human life,

00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:21.046
now and in the future.

00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:23.606
Now that's a virtuous, collective task

00:03:23.606 --> 00:03:26.519
that goes far beyond your shower.
