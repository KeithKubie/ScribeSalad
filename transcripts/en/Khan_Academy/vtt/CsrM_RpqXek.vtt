00:00:00.675 --> 00:00:01.784
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.784 --> 00:00:02.642
Hello, Rosie.

00:00:02.642 --> 00:00:03.750
- [Voiceover] Hi, Paige.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.408
So in this video we're gonna
talk about complex sentences.

00:00:07.408 --> 00:00:09.362
We've talked in another video

00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:11.943
about simple and compound sentences,

00:00:11.943 --> 00:00:14.794
so, that is like one independent clause

00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:17.618
or two independent clauses.

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:18.899
And with a complex sentence,

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:22.237
we're gonna introduce something
called a dependent clause.

00:00:22.237 --> 00:00:25.211
So a sentence needs at
least one independent clause

00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:27.806
to function as a sentence.

00:00:27.806 --> 00:00:32.270
But with complex, we're gonna
add this dependent clause.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.928
So, Rosie, what's an example
of a complex sentence?

00:00:35.928 --> 00:00:38.456
- [Voiceover] When we
buy his birthday cake,

00:00:38.456 --> 00:00:42.076
we have to make sure
it's lemon. (chuckles)

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:42.909
- [Voiceover] So this sentence,

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.190
when we buy his birthday cake,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.915
we have to make sure it's lemon,

00:00:45.915 --> 00:00:47.994
is made up of two clauses,

00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:50.458
and I've written them in
different colors here.

00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:51.291
So,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.324
the second one, the pink one,

00:00:54.324 --> 00:00:56.169
can stand on its own as a sentence.

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:59.104
We could just say, we have
to make sure it's lemon.

00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:01.963
- [Voiceover] It functions
as an independent clause,

00:01:01.963 --> 00:01:03.555
as its own sentence.

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:05.428
We have some information
that might be missing

00:01:05.428 --> 00:01:07.429
from this sentence, because
we don't necessarily know

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:12.027
what it's is, but we do
have all the components

00:01:12.027 --> 00:01:13.631
of an independent clause here.

00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:17.798
We've got a subject, we,
and a verb, have, have to,

00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:22.864
and well we have multiple verbs. (laughs)

00:01:22.864 --> 00:01:24.481
- [Voiceover] (laughs) Yeah, got a lot of

00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:26.420
have to make sure.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.620
- [Voiceover] So the sentence is relying

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.643
on some information that's not provided,

00:01:30.643 --> 00:01:34.310
but it does still stand
as its own sentence.

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:36.693
- [Voiceover] Right, like we
can have a sentence before it

00:01:36.693 --> 00:01:39.397
that's like, we're gonna
go buy a birthday cake,

00:01:39.397 --> 00:01:41.573
we have to make sure it's lemon, right,

00:01:41.573 --> 00:01:43.651
those can be two separate sentences.

00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:46.964
In this case we have this other clause,

00:01:46.964 --> 00:01:49.073
this what's called a dependent clause.

00:01:49.073 --> 00:01:51.867
We can't just say when
we buy his birthday cake

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:56.034
as a sentence, that doesn't
really stand on its own,

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:59.477
it doesn't convey the information

00:01:59.477 --> 00:02:02.144
that a sentence needs to convey.

00:02:03.194 --> 00:02:06.736
So we could have an independent
clause or a sentence

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:09.544
that's just we buy his birthday cake.

00:02:09.544 --> 00:02:12.344
It's kind of a weird construction,

00:02:12.344 --> 00:02:14.104
I don't know that I would say that,

00:02:14.104 --> 00:02:17.374
you could maybe say, we are
buying his birthday cake.

00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:20.947
But we buy his birthday cake
still works as a sentence.

00:02:20.947 --> 00:02:24.667
It has a subject we and a verb buy,

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:28.090
and it expresses a complete idea,

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.467
it's an action that's happening

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:32.371
and it tells you who's doing it.

00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:36.170
But we add this thing called
a subordinating conjunction,

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.113
that's this word when, here,

00:02:38.113 --> 00:02:41.581
and that makes this
into a dependent clause,

00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:44.311
it can't be a sentence by itself,

00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:47.066
so it depends on the latter clause,

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:51.469
we have to make sure it's
lemon, to be part of a sentence.

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.545
Okay, so, Rosie, what's another example

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:55.378
of a complex sentence.

00:02:56.237 --> 00:02:58.635
- [Voiceover] Although
our tent was zipped up,

00:02:58.635 --> 00:03:02.802
the sound of hyenas in the
distance still frightened us.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.540
- [Voiceover] So again,
this sentence starts

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.057
with a dependent clause,
although our tent was zipped up.

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:13.640
This would be independent if
it said our tent was zipped up,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.697
but again, we have this
subordinating conjunction, although,

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:18.821
at the beginning.

00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:20.116
And there's kind of a whole bunch

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.047
of different subordinating conjunctions.

00:03:22.047 --> 00:03:25.112
They're sort of just something
that you need to remember,

00:03:25.112 --> 00:03:28.198
but essentially their job is

00:03:28.198 --> 00:03:31.348
to connect clauses and sentences,

00:03:31.348 --> 00:03:34.766
but also make things
into dependent clauses.

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:36.354
- [Voiceover] One other
thing, we were showing you

00:03:36.354 --> 00:03:39.304
two sentences where the
dependent clause is coming

00:03:39.304 --> 00:03:43.372
before the independent clause,
but that's not necessarily

00:03:43.372 --> 00:03:44.474
always gonna be the case.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:47.833
Like for example, we could've said,

00:03:47.833 --> 00:03:50.893
the sound of hyenas in
the distance frightened us

00:03:50.893 --> 00:03:53.782
even though our tent was zipped up.

00:03:53.782 --> 00:03:57.446
- [Voiceover] Right, that would
still be a complex sentence,

00:03:57.446 --> 00:04:00.222
it would be an independent
clause and a dependent clause,

00:04:00.222 --> 00:04:01.535
but just in a different order,

00:04:01.535 --> 00:04:06.497
they don't have to be in this
order that we've done twice.

00:04:06.497 --> 00:04:08.583
Okay, so Rosie, what if
I do something like this?

00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:10.754
Like, when we buy his birthday cake,

00:04:10.754 --> 00:04:14.114
we have to make sure it's lemon,
because it's his favorite.

00:04:14.114 --> 00:04:15.555
I think because it's his favorite

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.590
is a dependent clause, right?

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.423
- [Voiceover] That's right.

00:04:18.423 --> 00:04:21.130
And this sentence still completely works

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.667
as a complex sentence,
because you still just have

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:26.139
this one independent clause,

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.603
we have to make sure it's lemon,

00:04:27.603 --> 00:04:29.829
but the thing about a complex sentence is

00:04:29.829 --> 00:04:34.303
is you can add more than one
dependent clause if you want

00:04:34.303 --> 00:04:37.022
and it's still considered
a complex sentence.

00:04:37.022 --> 00:04:38.102
- [Voiceover] Okay, so it has to have

00:04:38.102 --> 00:04:40.223
just one independent clause.

00:04:40.223 --> 00:04:41.056
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:04:41.056 --> 00:04:41.897
- [Voiceover] But I guess,

00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:44.026
as many dependent clauses as you want?

00:04:44.026 --> 00:04:45.194
- [Voiceover] Yeah, you can go crazy.

00:04:45.194 --> 00:04:46.802
- [Voiceover] Okay, cool.

00:04:46.802 --> 00:04:49.060
So I think that's complex sentences.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.921
It's an independent clause that
can be a sentence by itself

00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:55.318
and one or more dependent clauses

00:04:55.318 --> 00:04:57.429
which can't be sentences by themself

00:04:57.429 --> 00:04:59.495
all put together in one big sentence.

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:00.853
Does that sound right, Rosie?

00:05:00.853 --> 00:05:02.194
- [Voiceover] Sounds good to me, Paige.

00:05:02.194 --> 00:05:03.163
- [Voiceover] Cool.

00:05:03.163 --> 00:05:04.858
You can learn anything, Paige out.

00:05:04.858 --> 00:05:05.965
- [Voiceover] Rosie out.
