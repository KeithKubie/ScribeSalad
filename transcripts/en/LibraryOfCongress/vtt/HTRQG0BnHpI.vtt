00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:01.791
??

00:07:05.094 --> 00:07:08.087
&gt;&gt; These extremely rare but 
damaged motion pictures of Mark 

00:07:08.088 --> 00:07:10.088
Twain were taken at his home in 
Connecticut 

00:07:12.857 --> 00:07:13.403
in 1909, a year before his death
. A copy of the film along with 

00:07:13.404 --> 00:07:15.404
first 

00:07:16.682 --> 00:07:19.346
editions and thousands of the 
celebrated writers letters and 

00:07:19.347 --> 00:07:21.347
manuscripts were part of the 
Mark Twain project.

00:07:23.627 --> 00:07:25.627
Its aim is to painstakingly edit
and 

00:07:28.267 --> 00:07:29.941
publish the book of Twain's huge
output Twain's daughter 

00:07:29.942 --> 00:07:32.177
bequeathed her father's papers 
to the University of California 

00:07:32.178 --> 00:07:34.178
at Berkeley in 1962.

00:07:38.498 --> 00:07:38.904
The extensive collection is 
hidden away in small offices on 

00:07:38.905 --> 00:07:40.905
the top floor of Bancroft 
Library.

00:07:44.183 --> 00:07:46.183
For three decades editors have 
been pouring over more 

00:07:48.925 --> 00:07:49.494
than 10,000 letters, plus 
notebooks, story and book 

00:07:49.495 --> 00:07:51.735
manuscripts and newspaper 
clippings seeking to find 

00:07:55.043 --> 00:07:56.059
the real Mark Twain and to make 
all of his work accurate and 

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.060
accessible.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.090
&gt;&gt; This is your literary 
heritage here in our files. It 

00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:06.549
has to be edited. It has to be 
performed in some form if it's 

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.550
going to be transmitted into the
future.

00:08:10.543 --> 00:08:12.543
&gt;&gt; Robert hurst, the general 
editor has 

00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:16.507
devoted his entire professional 
life since 1967 to Twain, who he

00:08:16.508 --> 00:08:18.508
sees as a towering talent in 
language and humor.

00:08:21.553 --> 00:08:23.659
&gt;&gt; I still hear my editors 
laughing out loud during the 

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.660
hall because they are 

00:08:26.682 --> 00:08:27.537
reading something which they 
probably read a dozen times 

00:08:27.538 --> 00:08:29.151
before but it still alive, it's 
still funny no matter how many 

00:08:29.152 --> 00:08:31.152
times you read it.

00:08:34.807 --> 00:08:35.463
&gt;&gt; Many academics would argue 
that Twain is still America's 

00:08:35.464 --> 00:08:37.464
best-loved, perhaps its best 
writer.

00:08:38.922 --> 00:08:40.769
Prof. Frederick crews recently 
retired from Berkeley's English 

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.770
department.

00:08:44.435 --> 00:08:47.101
&gt;&gt; Mark Twain appeals to 
academics and non-academics to a

00:08:47.102 --> 00:08:49.102
degree that you can't find 
matched in any other writer.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.010
He grew up with the country.

00:08:55.259 --> 00:08:55.457
He represents the Midwest, the 
Far West, even the New England 

00:08:55.458 --> 00:08:57.458
establishment.

00:08:58.931 --> 00:09:00.931
He went from being a rough 
frontier 

00:09:01.966 --> 00:09:04.445
humorist to being the darling of
gentle culture. Which of course 

00:09:04.446 --> 00:09:06.446
he made fun of.

00:09:08.055 --> 00:09:10.055
&gt;&gt; Robert paca Browning, another
of the 

00:09:12.174 --> 00:09:14.038
project editors is convinced 
Twain is worth special treatment

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:16.039
as an American writer and 
personality.

00:09:18.319 --> 00:09:20.319
Using materials from Berkeley's 

00:09:21.583 --> 00:09:21.795
collection he has put together 
an exciting display of Twain's 

00:09:21.796 --> 00:09:23.417
life and work at the 
university's Blackhawk Museum.

00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:30.302
&gt;&gt; The language that you and I 
speak, 

00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:33.390
with its peculiar American 
qualities was put down on paper 

00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:36.262
by this man.
&gt;&gt; Notice his handwriting...

00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:41.441
&gt;&gt; At the museum visitors 
immerse themselves in issues 

00:09:41.442 --> 00:09:45.729
Twain wrote about from racial 
equality to love. A passionate 

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.730
love letter to his future wife 
is here for everybody to read.

00:09:47.772 --> 00:09:53.458
&gt;&gt; I love love love love love 
you... And multiplied by 150...

00:09:56.722 --> 00:09:58.722
And so loving you I note your 
faults 

00:09:59.764 --> 00:10:01.764
and knight them with my love

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:03.443
&gt;&gt; What do you think Mark Twain 
feels about this wonderful 

00:10:03.444 --> 00:10:05.480
woman?
&gt;&gt; He was really in love with 

00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:07.481
her.

00:10:08.946 --> 00:10:09.787
&gt;&gt; Twain spent a lot of time in 
the lecture circuit to gain fame

00:10:09.788 --> 00:10:11.788
and money.

00:10:14.693 --> 00:10:16.693
His lecture notes from 1896 help

00:10:17.694 --> 00:10:19.694
explain the crucial passage in 
Huck Finn publish 12 years 

00:10:21.884 --> 00:10:22.278
earlier where Huck is debating 
whether to turn in Jim as a 

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:24.279
runaway slave

00:10:27.397 --> 00:10:28.234
&gt;&gt; Huck is preparing to turn Jim
in, yet he finally concludes 

00:10:28.235 --> 00:10:32.165
that he cannot do that. His 
heart wins out. And his 

00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:34.166
conscience suffers a defeat.

00:10:37.834 --> 00:10:40.379
This was the most popular 
component of his lecture on this

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.380
grand tour of the world.

00:10:50.806 --> 00:10:52.839
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; so, good morning.

00:10:57.136 --> 00:10:59.136
I am so happy to see all of you.

00:11:00.588 --> 00:11:02.224
So glad to be able to welcome 
you to the Library of Congress 

00:11:02.225 --> 00:11:04.225
this morning and 

00:11:08.344 --> 00:11:10.344
to the ninth annual Jonah school
cuff 

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.360
Eskin Memorial lecture. Today is
going to be more of a 

00:11:16.189 --> 00:11:16.798
presentation and a conversation 
and we are delighted to have all

00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:18.799

00:11:21.861 --> 00:11:24.331
We are also delighted to have

00:11:24.332 --> 00:11:25.345
and before we get started with 
the rest of the program I've got

00:11:25.346 --> 00:11:27.346
a couple remarks for you.

00:11:29.216 --> 00:11:29.812
I'm Leanne Potter I direct 
educational outreach here at the

00:11:29.813 --> 00:11:32.656
Library of Congress and along 
with my colleagues in 

00:11:33.074 --> 00:11:34.923
educational outreach and our 
young reader center we want to 

00:11:34.924 --> 00:11:37.787
welcome you and we also want to 
shout out to you because we know

00:11:37.788 --> 00:11:39.788
who all of you are.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.003
Before I do the rollcall of the 
various schools in the room 

00:11:47.004 --> 00:11:49.004
though I want to 

00:11:50.661 --> 00:11:52.070
mention that this week is 
children's book week. It is the 

00:11:52.071 --> 00:11:54.071
longest running national 

00:11:58.604 --> 00:11:59.638
literacy program or initiative 
in the United States. It is 

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:02.516
sponsored by the children's book
Council as well as every child a

00:12:02.517 --> 00:12:04.548
reader, and along with schools 
and libraries 

00:12:07.549 --> 00:12:08.507
around the country, this week is
dedicated to celebrating the joy

00:12:08.508 --> 00:12:13.037
of reading. So we are happy that
you are with us today to help us

00:12:13.038 --> 00:12:15.038
celebrate the joy of reading.

00:12:17.763 --> 00:12:19.803
All of you, before you leave 
will be receiving a copy of this

00:12:19.804 --> 00:12:23.914
year's book week poster, so make
sure you get those on your way 

00:12:23.915 --> 00:12:25.915
out.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:33.518
They were illustrated by Jillian
to amaki and given to us by the 

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:34.162
children's book Council so a 
nice thank you to the children's

00:12:34.163 --> 00:12:36.163
book Council.

00:12:38.432 --> 00:12:40.432
Also I want to make another 
shout out, 

00:12:41.849 --> 00:12:43.849
thank you to my colleagues to 
Karen Jaffe, to Sasha dowdy, to 

00:12:46.574 --> 00:12:47.087
Monica Valentine, the rest of 
educational outreach as well as 

00:12:47.088 --> 00:12:49.314
the multimedia team for making 
this morning possible. Thanks, 

00:12:49.315 --> 00:12:51.315
you guys.

00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:56.856
So we have six, seventh and 
eighth graders here with us from

00:12:56.857 --> 00:12:58.857
school without walls at Francis 
Stevens..

00:13:01.134 --> 00:13:02.603
. We have sixth-graders from 
Washington global public charter

00:13:02.604 --> 00:13:04.604
school...

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:12.416
We also have sixth and seventh 
graders from Stuart Hobson 

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.550
middle school.

00:13:16.478 --> 00:13:18.478
We have sixth-graders from St. 
Patrick's Episcopal school.

00:13:26.471 --> 00:13:28.471
We also have students from 
Northern 

00:13:29.488 --> 00:13:31.418
Virginia including students in 
grades three through six from 

00:13:31.419 --> 00:13:33.419
the river from cooperative 
school in Alexandria..

00:13:36.062 --> 00:13:39.187
. And, and I guess I should say 
this a little louder, we also 

00:13:39.188 --> 00:13:41.630
have seventh and eighth graders 
from the Mark Twain middle 

00:13:41.631 --> 00:13:43.666
school... In Alexandria.

00:13:47.987 --> 00:13:49.987
We are also live streaming this 
program.

00:13:53.697 --> 00:13:56.139
And we know that we've got 
schools and individuals in 

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.140
various parts of the US watching
so if you guys want to turn 

00:13:59.613 --> 00:13:59.817
around and waved to them so they
know we are glad they are tuning

00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:03.899
in.
[Background chatter]

00:14:06.542 --> 00:14:08.542
&gt;&gt; and I really need to do..

00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:13.142
. We have some interns in our 
young readers center who did 

00:14:13.143 --> 00:14:17.206
some homework last week to find 
as many middle schools in the US

00:14:17.207 --> 00:14:19.207
that are named for Mark Twain as
they could and they 

00:14:21.643 --> 00:14:23.733
sent out special notes to those 
schools telling them about this 

00:14:23.734 --> 00:14:25.968
event. So hopefully we've got 
some other Mark Twain schools 

00:14:25.969 --> 00:14:27.969
tuning in.

00:14:29.626 --> 00:14:31.626
I'm excited about that. So thank
you all for coming.

00:14:35.596 --> 00:14:35.810
And by the way, because we are 
live streaming the program there

00:14:35.811 --> 00:14:37.811
will be a 

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.898
recording available, so if you 
really get into the program 

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:41.120
today you can watch it again 
later and show your friends and 

00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:43.371
family okay? You will all do 
that, right?

00:14:46.459 --> 00:14:48.459
Because the Library of Congress 
has a 

00:14:49.468 --> 00:14:49.933
YouTube channel and I know you 
all follow it. And we are on 

00:14:49.934 --> 00:14:51.934
Facebook.

00:14:58.522 --> 00:14:58.902
So, today's program is about 
Mark Twain but it is just sort 

00:14:58.903 --> 00:15:00.903
of about Mark Twain.

00:15:03.826 --> 00:15:04.018
How many of you, raise your 
hands if you think you know a 

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:08.522
thing or two about Mark Twain. 
Okay. All right. Some good hands

00:15:08.523 --> 00:15:10.523
going up.

00:15:13.659 --> 00:15:15.911
So as you learn from the video 
that we showed you, Mark Twain 

00:15:15.912 --> 00:15:17.912
was a writer. He was a lecturer.

00:15:20.588 --> 00:15:22.226
He was a humorist. He was also a
publisher. And we are going to 

00:15:22.227 --> 00:15:24.227
learn a little bit 

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.527
more about him today but we are 
also going to focus not just on 

00:15:27.528 --> 00:15:29.528
Mark Twain, 

00:15:30.546 --> 00:15:32.636
but really we are going to focus
on the work of this guy and his 

00:15:32.637 --> 00:15:34.637
wife, so Philip 

00:15:36.246 --> 00:15:39.403
Stead is with us today and he's 
got an incredible story to tell 

00:15:39.404 --> 00:15:42.654
you about Mark Twain that's very
closely connected to the papers 

00:15:42.655 --> 00:15:44.655
of Mark Twain that you got a 
glimpse of in the video.

00:15:47.776 --> 00:15:48.203
And with all of our programs 
here at the Library of Congress 

00:15:48.204 --> 00:15:52.271
we like to make sure that we 
understand what the connection 

00:15:52.507 --> 00:15:55.122
to the library and its 
collections might be, with 

00:15:55.123 --> 00:15:57.123
whatever topic we are focused 
on.

00:15:59.762 --> 00:16:02.723
So we did a little digging and 
not only are there Mark Twain 

00:16:02.918 --> 00:16:04.918
papers in the Bancroft Library 
out in 

00:16:06.194 --> 00:16:06.404
California but there's some 
terrific Mark Twain materials 

00:16:06.405 --> 00:16:08.405
here in the Library of Congress.

00:16:10.294 --> 00:16:12.294
One of them is up on the screen.

00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:16.666
In 1874 Mark Twain who of course
his real name was Samuel 

00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:19.722
Clemens, he wrote a letter to 
the librarian of Congress and he

00:16:19.723 --> 00:16:21.723
did so because he had written a 

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.825
series of sketches and he wanted
to ensure that his work was 

00:16:24.826 --> 00:16:26.923
being copyrighted. You can go 
ahead and hit the next slide.

00:16:33.173 --> 00:16:36.516
So he is writing to, this is in 
May, this is in May 1874. And he

00:16:36.517 --> 00:16:38.517
is writing to the then librarian

00:16:40.013 --> 00:16:42.013
of Congress, Ainsworth Spofford.

00:16:44.872 --> 00:16:46.872
He says dear Sir I  include a 
cover of a pamphlet which I 

00:16:49.363 --> 00:16:50.628
designed also the title page of 
the pamphlet upon the contents 

00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:52.629
of which I likewise desire 
copyright.

00:16:55.568 --> 00:16:57.568
Fees, one dollar enclosed, very 
truly yours, Samuel Clemens.

00:16:59.692 --> 00:17:04.161
So I have to say we love it when
we come across things like this 

00:17:04.162 --> 00:17:04.361
in the library's collection. So 
a handwritten letter from Mark 

00:17:04.362 --> 00:17:06.362
Twain related to copywriting 
some of his work.

00:17:09.125 --> 00:17:10.769
But not only does the Library of
Congress hold original letters 

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:16.378
but the library also has an 
enormous collection of 

00:17:16.379 --> 00:17:19.335
newspapers and magazines and 
many many many literally 

00:17:19.336 --> 00:17:21.336
millions of them are available 

00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:24.791
through the library's 
chronicling America website.

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:29.940
And the next slide shows you one
of those political cartoons in 

00:17:29.941 --> 00:17:31.941
one of those 

00:17:33.858 --> 00:17:36.506
magazines, Harper's weekly, that
shows Mark Twain as well and I 

00:17:36.507 --> 00:17:38.507
know that in your textbooks and 
other materials 

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.635
sometimes you often see things 
like the political cartoon, but 

00:17:43.636 --> 00:17:47.088
you miss the context. You miss 
that it originally appeared in 

00:17:50.108 --> 00:17:52.610
the newspaper and that's the fun
part of looking at original 

00:17:52.611 --> 00:17:55.049
sources is you see where they 
originally came from. I want to 

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.050
say one more thing about the 
video that we watched.

00:17:58.543 --> 00:17:58.746
We were so excited about this. A
couple years ago the library 

00:17:58.747 --> 00:18:02.669
entered into a partnership with 
WGBH TV Boston, it's 

00:18:08.395 --> 00:18:09.506
a public TV station, and because
of the partnership the American 

00:18:09.507 --> 00:18:14.221
archive of public broadcasting 
was established and through the 

00:18:14.434 --> 00:18:16.465
American archive of public 
broadcasting website you can 

00:18:16.466 --> 00:18:18.466
access literally 

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.988
thousands of public television 
programs like the one we 

00:18:22.989 --> 00:18:25.826
watched. So when we started 
digging around the website it 

00:18:25.827 --> 00:18:27.827
came across that entire film.

00:18:31.933 --> 00:18:32.132
It's a lot longer than what we 
saw, related to Mark Twain. So 

00:18:32.133 --> 00:18:34.133
we were pretty excited.

00:18:35.331 --> 00:18:38.292
So another shout out to the fact
that the library's collections 

00:18:38.293 --> 00:18:39.520
come in a huge variety of media 
from motion picture films to 

00:18:39.521 --> 00:18:42.047
newspapers and periodicals to 
manuscripts, library collections

00:18:42.048 --> 00:18:44.282
are so much fun. They are not 
just books.

00:18:47.283 --> 00:18:48.764
But if they were books and you 
happen to go on the library 

00:18:48.765 --> 00:18:52.254
website and you happen to do a 
search on Mark Twain in the main

00:18:52.255 --> 00:18:53.507
card catalog guess how many 
times you would find Mark 

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:55.508
Twain's name?

00:18:57.212 --> 00:18:59.212
Millions, but about 3000...

00:19:01.709 --> 00:19:03.709
There are about 3000 books in 
the library collection that are 

00:19:06.197 --> 00:19:08.324
either written by Mark Twain or 
about Mark Twain. That's a lot. 

00:19:08.325 --> 00:19:08.524
3000. That's incredible. And 
they are not just in English 

00:19:08.525 --> 00:19:10.525
either. Lots of those materials 
are in 

00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:16.261
languages other than a gli
English okay so enough about the

00:19:16.262 --> 00:19:18.262
Library of Congress and its 
collection.

00:19:19.523 --> 00:19:22.154
But what I love most about all 
of those materials and the 

00:19:22.155 --> 00:19:24.155
reason we wanted to highlight 
them is to really emphasize to 

00:19:26.026 --> 00:19:28.667
you that the materials that are 
in the library often speak to 

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.718
us, they inspire us, they are 
the ideas and thoughts and 

00:19:34.751 --> 00:19:36.265
often the voices of people not 
only living today but people who

00:19:36.266 --> 00:19:38.266
lived in the past.

00:19:40.136 --> 00:19:41.961
And our speaker today certainly 
has a story in that vein to tell

00:19:41.962 --> 00:19:43.962
us.

00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:48.051
So I'm going to do my 
introduction of Philip now.

00:19:50.345 --> 00:19:52.345
So here we go. It is my great 
pleasure to introduce 

00:19:55.262 --> 00:19:57.262
our very patient and 
award-winning 

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:00.764
author, Philip Stead who with 
his 

00:20:02.584 --> 00:20:04.046
illustrator wife Erin Stead 
wrote the exceptional and unique

00:20:04.047 --> 00:20:06.686
book, the per lining of prints 
Olemargarine

00:20:11.956 --> 00:20:13.956
[applause]

00:21:17.622 --> 00:21:19.622
&gt;&gt;...

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:25.970
so I'm on record not telling you
that now.

00:21:27.868 --> 00:21:29.084
I absolutely never skipped 
middle or high school. So I'm an

00:21:29.085 --> 00:21:31.523
author and also in illustrator. 
I've either written or 

00:21:31.524 --> 00:21:33.524
illustrated 

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:37.045
about 15 different books with 
about five or six more to come 

00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:40.342
in the near future. These two 
books are the books that I made 

00:21:40.343 --> 00:21:42.343
with my wife Erin.

00:21:45.415 --> 00:21:48.909
Erin I coucould not be here 
today but she was the artist in 

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.910
all three books and also the 
artist for the Mark Twain 

00:21:50.995 --> 00:21:52.995
collaboration that I'm going to 
be talking about today.

00:21:54.065 --> 00:21:56.703
A little bit about myself before
I begin. I'm from the state of 

00:21:56.704 --> 00:22:00.397
Michigan. Has anybody here ever 
been to the state of Michigan? 

00:22:00.398 --> 00:22:02.398
That's not too bad.

00:22:05.082 --> 00:22:05.489
I love Michigan. One of the 
reasons I love Michigan is 

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.490
because there's so much water.

00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:13.029
I grew up down here near 
Detroit, so 

00:22:14.237 --> 00:22:15.138
people from Michigan like to 
show their hands when they are 

00:22:15.139 --> 00:22:17.139
talking about where they are 
from because 

00:22:18.351 --> 00:22:20.649
Michigan is shaped like a 
mitten, but Detroit is down here

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.650
and now I live way up there, do 
you see the red dot up there?

00:22:25.766 --> 00:22:26.779
I live way up there and then do 
you see an island of sort of 

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.780
right above that a big Island?

00:22:31.282 --> 00:22:31.688
So remember the island. We are 
going to come back to that in a 

00:22:31.689 --> 00:22:33.689
minute.

00:22:36.593 --> 00:22:36.999
I think it is important to know 
where a person or where an 

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
author is front because I think 
something about where 

00:22:41.426 --> 00:22:42.707
you are from will inevitably 
sort of creep into the types of 

00:22:42.708 --> 00:22:44.708
things you make.

00:22:45.775 --> 00:22:47.606
I think that is absolutely true 
of Mark Twain, who as you heard 

00:22:47.607 --> 00:22:51.305
in the video was from all over, 
but really I believe he is from 

00:22:51.306 --> 00:22:53.306
Hannibal Missouri.

00:22:54.826 --> 00:22:55.030
That is where he was born. He 
was born along the Mississippi 

00:22:55.031 --> 00:22:57.031
River.

00:22:59.688 --> 00:23:00.367
And I think there is something 
about being from the place that 

00:23:00.368 --> 00:23:02.368
has infected everything he's 
written.

00:23:04.659 --> 00:23:04.863
When you live along the river I 
imagine you are always seeing 

00:23:04.864 --> 00:23:06.864
people coming and 

00:23:07.877 --> 00:23:08.352
going and there's constant 
motion and things coming into 

00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:10.353
town and out of town.

00:23:13.096 --> 00:23:14.712
When I read Mark Twain's work 
that's what sticks out to me. 

00:23:14.713 --> 00:23:17.373
There's always a coming and a 
going in his books and his 

00:23:17.374 --> 00:23:19.374
stories. They are always 
traveling stories.

00:23:23.708 --> 00:23:23.915
I think the water is important 
to me too. Michigan is 

00:23:23.916 --> 00:23:25.916
surrounded by water.

00:23:27.782 --> 00:23:30.623
And this is right, this may be 
five minutes from where I live 

00:23:30.624 --> 00:23:33.883
PA people think of Michigan and 
they imagine something more like

00:23:33.884 --> 00:23:35.884
Ohio, flat farmland but when I 
think of Michigan I think of 

00:23:39.795 --> 00:23:40.616
beaches and I think of big open 
expanses of water and when I 

00:23:40.617 --> 00:23:42.617
want to be...

00:23:45.673 --> 00:23:46.363
When I want to be quiet and I 
want to think about my thoughts 

00:23:46.364 --> 00:23:48.813
and think about my writing I go 
to the water and I sit in quiet 

00:23:48.814 --> 00:23:50.814
places near the water.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:55.179
I live in an old farmhouse and 
beside the old farmhouse is a 

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.180
big red barn.

00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:03.852
My wife Erin and I have turned 
to the red barn into an art 

00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:02.560
studio. So this is the inside of
the studio.

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:11.716
And the upstairs when you walk 
upstairs is just a library of 

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:09.650
all books.

00:24:10.923 --> 00:24:12.923
So when we don't have ideas we 
just go 

00:24:13.927 --> 00:24:16.870
upstairs and sit and hear other 
people's ideas. And once we've 

00:24:16.871 --> 00:24:18.093
got an idea we go back stairs 
and sit at our desk and we begin

00:24:18.094 --> 00:24:20.094
to drop.

00:24:21.979 --> 00:24:24.823
Anybody here consider themselves
an artist? Yeah.

00:24:28.682 --> 00:24:30.682
So I think I was 10 years old..

00:24:31.754 --> 00:24:34.625
. I think I was 10 years old 
when I was given my first 

00:24:34.626 --> 00:24:37.498
drafting table. A drafting table
is one of the tables that sort 

00:24:37.499 --> 00:24:39.499
of lifts up like this so you can
draw closer to your face.

00:24:41.156 --> 00:24:43.394
And I think it's really 
important as an artist or 

00:24:43.395 --> 00:24:45.395
author, either one to have a 
space that you work.

00:24:48.025 --> 00:24:50.542
And it does not have to be as 
big and open as this barn. It 

00:24:50.543 --> 00:24:53.393
can be a corner in a room or a 
closet. I remember when I was 

00:24:53.394 --> 00:24:55.836
very little I used to go in my 
closet and lock the door and 

00:24:55.837 --> 00:24:58.328
that's where I'd work on my 
projects. It's important to be 

00:24:58.329 --> 00:25:00.360
alone with yourself sometimes. 
That brings us to Mark Twain.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.070
And the story of how the story 
came to be.

00:25:11.381 --> 00:25:13.381
So in the year 1879 Mark Twain 
was in a 

00:25:14.588 --> 00:25:15.296
hotel room in Paris and he was 
telling a story to his own 

00:25:15.297 --> 00:25:18.385
children. This is something that
he would do almost every night.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.902
We know that because he would 
write about these moments in his

00:25:23.903 --> 00:25:25.903
diaries and journals.

00:25:27.933 --> 00:25:29.619
And way it would work is one of 
the daughters would bring a 

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.243
magazine or newspaper. They 
would open up to a page and 

00:25:31.244 --> 00:25:33.244
point to an image.

00:25:35.411 --> 00:25:37.666
And from the image, Mark Twain, 
it was Mark Twain's job to come 

00:25:37.667 --> 00:25:40.555
up with a story for his 
daughters and sometimes it was 

00:25:40.556 --> 00:25:42.556
successful. Sometimes it was not
so successful.

00:25:47.477 --> 00:25:49.477
But we never really had any 
actual 

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:51.350
written evidence of any of these
stories that survived to the 

00:25:51.351 --> 00:25:53.351
present day.

00:25:54.413 --> 00:25:56.413
So fast-forward all the way to 
the year 2011.

00:25:58.638 --> 00:26:00.638
There is a man named Dr. John 
Byrd, who was a professor from 

00:26:02.189 --> 00:26:04.676
North Carolina and he was out at
that archive that we just saw in

00:26:04.677 --> 00:26:06.677
the video in 

00:26:07.984 --> 00:26:08.184
Berkeley California and he was 
doing research for a Mark Twain 

00:26:08.185 --> 00:26:10.185
cookbook.

00:26:14.257 --> 00:26:14.955
He wanted to write a cookbook 
based on food and recipes that 

00:26:14.956 --> 00:26:16.956
could be found in Mark Twain's 
writings.

00:26:18.432 --> 00:26:20.664
So he had the researchers 
pulling out any file folder that

00:26:20.665 --> 00:26:22.665
had anything at all to do with 
food.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.560
So there was one folder just 
labeled 

00:26:29.572 --> 00:26:31.704
Oleomargarine which today we 
would just call margarine and we

00:26:31.705 --> 00:26:34.596
find it at the grocery store 
kind of like butter. We always 

00:26:34.597 --> 00:26:36.597
had margarine in our 
refrigerator when I was a kid.

00:26:39.311 --> 00:26:39.517
When they open up the folder 
instead of finding anything 

00:26:39.518 --> 00:26:41.518
about food what they found were 
16 pages of handwritten notes 

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:45.436
for this children's story that 
Mark Twain had told his 

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:47.437
daughters in Paris that night.

00:26:49.701 --> 00:26:51.701
This was an enormous news in the
Mark Twain universe.

00:26:53.809 --> 00:26:55.809
Because it's not every day that 
you 

00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:59.740
find something brand-new from 
the most famous and important 

00:26:59.741 --> 00:27:01.741
American writer who has ever 
lived.

00:27:04.381 --> 00:27:06.381
Interestingly enough though, in 
some point in the hundred plus 

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:08.519
years between the original 
telling and when it was 

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.520
discovered somebody had actually
pulled it out of the archives, 

00:27:13.151 --> 00:27:15.151
thought that maybe it was a 
little bit illegible that people

00:27:15.232 --> 00:27:17.232
would not be able to read it and
decided 

00:27:18.739 --> 00:27:18.939
to type the whole thing on a 
typewriter and stick it back in 

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.940
the folder and forget about it.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.058
So this thing had been 
discovered before but the first 

00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:23.869
and who discovered it the first 
time did not realize the 

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.870
importance.

00:27:28.369 --> 00:27:28.574
So this was what was given to 
me. It was not a completed 

00:27:28.575 --> 00:27:30.575
story. It was notes for a story.

00:27:34.084 --> 00:27:35.908
And I was asked to please find a
way to complete Mark Twain's 

00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:37.909
original idea.

00:27:39.196 --> 00:27:41.196
So this is a daunting task.

00:27:43.474 --> 00:27:45.520
But right away I began making 
written notes on this original 

00:27:45.521 --> 00:27:47.521
document.

00:27:52.384 --> 00:27:52.871
Sometimes I agreed with what 
Mark Twain, the ways in which 

00:27:52.872 --> 00:27:54.872
Mark Twain was telling the 
story.

00:27:56.135 --> 00:27:58.135
Sometimes almost immediately in 
fact I 

00:28:00.374 --> 00:28:03.065
found ways to take issue with 
what Mark Twain was doing, for 

00:28:03.066 --> 00:28:05.066
example Mark 

00:28:06.113 --> 00:28:06.525
Twain had right on the very 
first page a main character in 

00:28:06.526 --> 00:28:08.526
the story named Susie 

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:09.978
which is also the name of the 
daughter and the character was a

00:28:09.979 --> 00:28:12.638
kangaroo. I felt that this was a
mistake that he had made.

00:28:17.187 --> 00:28:17.586
Mark Twain love kangaroos, which
you can actually learn a lot 

00:28:17.587 --> 00:28:19.587
about Mark 

00:28:20.606 --> 00:28:21.872
Twain and that is one thing that
comes up again and again, Mark 

00:28:21.873 --> 00:28:23.873
Twain love kangaroos.

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:28.104
But as a storyteller that works 
specifically in children's 

00:28:31.274 --> 00:28:32.993
literature like I do, I know 
something about kangaroos that 

00:28:32.994 --> 00:28:35.634
he doesn't, which is that if you
put a kangaroo in your story, 

00:28:35.635 --> 00:28:37.635
you just made 

00:28:38.908 --> 00:28:39.108
your story in a very specific 
place, in a very specific 

00:28:39.109 --> 00:28:41.109
country. What country is that?

00:28:45.441 --> 00:28:47.441
Exactly so every kid everywhere 
knows 

00:28:48.487 --> 00:28:48.692
that kangaroos are from 
Australia and I really didn't 

00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:50.693
think that Mark Twain wanted to 
set the book in Australia.

00:28:54.834 --> 00:28:56.834
So I crossed off kangaroo and I 
made the character into a skunk.

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:01.137
Which has made some Mark Twain 
professors very angry with me.

00:29:03.653 --> 00:29:05.653
So what I got was 4 1/2 pages of
notes.

00:29:08.733 --> 00:29:11.641
And at the end of the last page 
the story just ends. There is no

00:29:11.642 --> 00:29:14.325
official ending to the story, 
there's just the point at which 

00:29:14.536 --> 00:29:16.536
he stops taking notes.

00:29:18.609 --> 00:29:20.261
And there was never a clear 
answer as to whether the final 

00:29:20.262 --> 00:29:25.239
pages of the manuscript were 
missing or if Mark Twain never 

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.240
got around to writing them, or 
maybe there never was an ending.

00:29:29.919 --> 00:29:30.329
I am of the opinion that there 
actually never was an ending to 

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:35.436
this story because this is a 
story that Mark Twain was 

00:29:35.437 --> 00:29:37.437
telling out loud, probably over 
the course of several nights.

00:29:39.922 --> 00:29:41.966
So there didn't need to be an 
ending. It was the kind of story

00:29:41.967 --> 00:29:43.967
that just 

00:29:45.172 --> 00:29:45.868
continued to have new material 
every night when he would sit 

00:29:45.869 --> 00:29:47.869
down with his children.

00:29:49.168 --> 00:29:51.168
But that doesn't really work if 
you're trying to make a book.

00:29:52.434 --> 00:29:55.105
A book needs to have an ending. 
So you can see my own 

00:29:55.106 --> 00:29:57.106
handwriting at the end. That was
a very first thing I wrote for 

00:29:59.796 --> 00:30:01.796
this project where I get to the 
ending and I write then what?

00:30:04.097 --> 00:30:06.097
And that was my task, figuring 
out then what.

00:30:09.234 --> 00:30:11.234
So for me, that meant going very
far away.

00:30:14.755 --> 00:30:14.960
And very far away for me meant 
an island in the middle of Lake 

00:30:14.961 --> 00:30:16.961
Michigan.

00:30:19.607 --> 00:30:20.300
So you remember the island that 
was just north of where I live. 

00:30:20.301 --> 00:30:22.301
That is called Beaver Island.

00:30:24.571 --> 00:30:24.771
And I had never been to Beaver 
Island, which is not unusual 

00:30:24.772 --> 00:30:26.772
because very few 

00:30:28.048 --> 00:30:28.843
people have ever been to Beaver 
Island. This is what it looks 

00:30:28.844 --> 00:30:30.844
like from the 

00:30:32.967 --> 00:30:34.967
airplane that I had to take as I
was leaving the island.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:37.658
There are very few buildings. It
doesn't look anything like 

00:30:37.659 --> 00:30:40.295
Washington DC. There is a tiny 
tiny town at the very far end.

00:30:44.724 --> 00:30:45.783
And that's it, there's about 
three buildings and a 

00:30:45.784 --> 00:30:47.784
lighthouse.

00:30:48.794 --> 00:30:49.275
There's one road that cuts 
through the middle of the 

00:30:49.276 --> 00:30:51.276
island.

00:30:52.333 --> 00:30:54.520
So I originally arrived in that 
kind of boat, I had my bicycle. 

00:30:54.521 --> 00:30:56.521
I wrote all the way to a cabin 
that was 

00:30:57.569 --> 00:30:59.860
owned by a friend of mine, the 
cabin had no phone. It had no 

00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:01.861
Internet. It had no television. 
It had no radio.

00:31:03.112 --> 00:31:05.167
And I decided I was going to 
stay at this cabin until I had 

00:31:05.168 --> 00:31:08.050
written something. It's always 
the hardest part of any 

00:31:11.553 --> 00:31:14.398
project I think is the beginning
and I can put off working on 

00:31:14.399 --> 00:31:16.399
something forever if I don't get
to it right away.

00:31:18.871 --> 00:31:21.722
So that's why I ended up on this
island. As I'm riding my bike 

00:31:21.723 --> 00:31:23.723
around this 

00:31:25.196 --> 00:31:26.008
island though, I kept 
encountering these signs along 

00:31:26.009 --> 00:31:28.009
the side of the road.

00:31:30.244 --> 00:31:31.135
And the signs were all talking 
about this man named James Jesse

00:31:31.136 --> 00:31:33.136
strange.

00:31:34.993 --> 00:31:35.188
Who I had never heard about and 
I knew nothing about the history

00:31:35.189 --> 00:31:37.232
of Beaver Island before I 
arrived there with my bicycle.

00:31:41.703 --> 00:31:43.703
This is where the story...

00:31:46.579 --> 00:31:47.177
The story of Beaver Island is 
strange but it's also where the 

00:31:47.178 --> 00:31:49.178
story of the making of this book
becomes very strange.

00:31:53.243 --> 00:31:55.534
In the 1860s, the Mormon church 
was led by a man named Joseph 

00:31:55.535 --> 00:31:57.535
Smith.

00:32:00.837 --> 00:32:03.272
Joseph Smith died and then there
were several people who were 

00:32:03.273 --> 00:32:05.304
sort of vying for control of who
would be in charge of the Mormon

00:32:05.305 --> 00:32:07.305
church.

00:32:11.234 --> 00:32:11.441
So there was a man named Brigham
Young who took a bunch of his 

00:32:11.442 --> 00:32:13.442
followers out to 

00:32:14.654 --> 00:32:15.546
the state of Utah and that's why
so many followers of the Mormon 

00:32:15.547 --> 00:32:17.547
church still live in Utah today.

00:32:20.586 --> 00:32:21.284
But then there was also this man
named James Jesse strange who 

00:32:21.285 --> 00:32:23.285
took his followers to Beaver 
Island.

00:32:25.381 --> 00:32:27.225
When he arrived at Beaver Island
he decided that he had had a 

00:32:27.226 --> 00:32:29.226
revelation 

00:32:30.483 --> 00:32:32.534
from God and that revelation was
that he should be named King, 

00:32:32.535 --> 00:32:34.535
king of Beaver Island.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:39.448
This was very funny to me that 
there was a king of Beaver 

00:32:39.449 --> 00:32:41.449
Island that I had never heard 
of.

00:32:44.928 --> 00:32:45.545
I learned shortly thereafter, 
writing my bike down the road I 

00:32:45.546 --> 00:32:48.837
end up at a different sign that 
says this is the spot where 

00:32:48.838 --> 00:32:51.481
James Jesse strange issued a 
particularly unpopular 

00:32:51.482 --> 00:32:53.482
proclamation and then he got 
himself killed.

00:32:55.162 --> 00:32:57.162
So this again was very funny to 
me.

00:32:58.805 --> 00:33:00.649
And it seemed like exactly the 
kind of story that Mark Twain 

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.650
himself would have 

00:33:04.073 --> 00:33:05.759
been very interested in hearing 
tbecause Mark Twain was always 

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:10.843
interested in how American 
history, American politics, 

00:33:10.844 --> 00:33:13.502
American religion are mixed 
together to make one sort of 

00:33:15.939 --> 00:33:18.812
uncomfortable story. So I didn't
know what to do with all this 

00:33:18.813 --> 00:33:20.813
information.

00:33:22.022 --> 00:33:24.022
It seemed important to me. It 
seemed important because it was 

00:33:25.725 --> 00:33:26.417
something that I thought Mark 
Twain would be interested in. It

00:33:26.418 --> 00:33:29.268
also seemed important because it
was a story about a king and a 

00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:32.164
kingdom and here I was working 
on a fairytale that was about a 

00:33:32.165 --> 00:33:34.165
king and a kingdom.

00:33:36.034 --> 00:33:38.877
And so I could not figure out 
exactly how but I nknew I wanted

00:33:38.878 --> 00:33:44.395
these things to go together and 
I was worried that I was already

00:33:44.396 --> 00:33:46.396
sort of going off on a wrong 
direction and 

00:33:47.822 --> 00:33:50.103
Mark Twain maybe would not be so
happy with me. But then my very 

00:33:50.104 --> 00:33:52.104
last day on the island 

00:33:53.513 --> 00:33:56.225
I pull a book off the shelf, so 
again I'm at a library. A much 

00:33:56.226 --> 00:33:58.226
smaller library, but a library 

00:33:59.497 --> 00:33:59.701
just inside this little cabin, I
pull the book off the shelf and 

00:33:59.702 --> 00:34:01.702
a page falls out.

00:34:04.793 --> 00:34:05.191
The book was a little paperback 
of stories and essays by Mark 

00:34:05.192 --> 00:34:08.054
Twain. And this quote was on the
page that fell out.

00:34:11.713 --> 00:34:14.372
It says, narrative should flow 
as flows the brook down through 

00:34:14.373 --> 00:34:16.373
the hills and the leafy 
Woodlands.

00:34:18.645 --> 00:34:20.645
, it's course changed by every 
boulder 

00:34:22.471 --> 00:34:24.471
it comes across and by every 
grasp clad

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:27.020
gladly spurred the projections 
to its path, it's service 

00:34:27.021 --> 00:34:29.021
unbroken but the 

00:34:30.216 --> 00:34:32.116
course not stayed by rock and 
gravel in the bottom of the 

00:34:32.117 --> 00:34:32.740
shoal places. A brook that never
goes straight for a minute but 

00:34:32.741 --> 00:34:38.850
goes and goes briskly. Sometimes
on grammatically and sometimes 

00:34:38.851 --> 00:34:39.247
fetching a horseshoe at three 
quarters of a mile around and at

00:34:39.248 --> 00:34:41.248
the end of the 

00:34:42.271 --> 00:34:43.954
circuit flowing within a yard of
the path it traversed an hour 

00:34:43.955 --> 00:34:45.955
before. But always going and 
always following 

00:34:49.071 --> 00:34:50.137
at least one law, always loyal 
to that law, the law of 

00:34:50.138 --> 00:34:52.138
narrative which has no law.

00:34:55.036 --> 00:34:55.437
And I love the last sentence, 
the law of narrative which has 

00:34:55.438 --> 00:34:57.438
no law.

00:34:58.549 --> 00:34:59.970
And I really felt like I was 
Mark Twain giving me permission 

00:34:59.971 --> 00:35:01.971
to tell this story 

00:35:02.977 --> 00:35:06.374
in any way that was necessary. 
In a really felt that that was 

00:35:06.375 --> 00:35:08.375
the way that Mark Twain would 
want me to tell this story.

00:35:13.711 --> 00:35:13.922
But then began, after I came 
back from the island I get 

00:35:13.923 --> 00:35:15.923
something down on paper, it's 
really not a finished story 

00:35:18.347 --> 00:35:19.006
yet but at least I got something
and I really feel like I needed 

00:35:19.007 --> 00:35:20.415
to do some more research to 
really understand who Mark Twain

00:35:20.416 --> 00:35:22.416
was.

00:35:26.618 --> 00:35:27.037
So there were sort of two ways 
to approach how to write the 

00:35:27.038 --> 00:35:29.038
story.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.156
One would be to try to predict 
every single word that Mark 

00:35:31.157 --> 00:35:33.157
Twain would have said. And right
away I felt like that was a 

00:35:33.229 --> 00:35:38.146
recipe for failure. There was no
way to really know over 100 

00:35:38.147 --> 00:35:40.227
years later what Mark Twain 
would have said but what I could

00:35:40.228 --> 00:35:42.271
do is get to know who Mark Twain
was as best I could 

00:35:45.323 --> 00:35:46.135
and if I could no who Mark Twain
was that I might be able to tell

00:35:46.136 --> 00:35:48.136
a story 

00:35:49.139 --> 00:35:51.139
that he would be happy with, 
that he would 

00:35:53.098 --> 00:35:55.368
be proud of, that would honor 
the spirit of Mark Twain instead

00:35:55.369 --> 00:35:58.024
of trying to be literal aabout 
the way he would have told the 

00:35:58.025 --> 00:36:03.140
story. One of the first stops 
that my wife and I took was to 

00:36:03.141 --> 00:36:06.785
this house. So this was Mark 
Twain's house in Connecticut. 

00:36:06.786 --> 00:36:09.083
This was where he lived when he 
wrote many of the, his most 

00:36:09.084 --> 00:36:11.084
famous works.

00:36:12.542 --> 00:36:14.542
It is the house that his 
children grew up in.

00:36:16.573 --> 00:36:18.669
It's a big beautiful elaborate 
house, so big that I really 

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.128
could not fit it all into a 
picture so I'm just showing you 

00:36:21.129 --> 00:36:23.129
one little piece of it.

00:36:24.424 --> 00:36:26.424
This is Mark Twain's personal 
writing room.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:28.290
This is my favorite place in the
house. It's got a billiard 

00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:30.291
table.

00:36:32.409 --> 00:36:34.409
The desk in the back is where he
would sit and do his writing.

00:36:36.106 --> 00:36:38.139
What I really loved about this 
house is that even though it is,

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.140
today it is a 

00:36:41.156 --> 00:36:43.156
museum and even though it is a 
big beautiful 

00:36:45.532 --> 00:36:45.946
elaborate house, it really still
felt like a home. So when you 

00:36:45.947 --> 00:36:48.419
walk in you really like this is 
a place where a family that 

00:36:50.456 --> 00:36:51.068
loved each other lived. You 
could imagine the stories being 

00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:53.757
told. It did not at all feel 
like a museum.

00:36:58.034 --> 00:37:00.034
Another piece of research that 
was 

00:37:01.233 --> 00:37:03.322
really important, there are 
actually two more pieces I want 

00:37:03.323 --> 00:37:05.323
to talk about.

00:37:06.529 --> 00:37:06.869
One is the autobiography of Mark
Twain, which was published in 

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:08.304
three volumes and we stack them 
up together it is about this 

00:37:08.305 --> 00:37:10.305
tall.

00:37:12.559 --> 00:37:14.559
What is so important about the 

00:37:15.616 --> 00:37:16.020
autobiography of Mark Twain is 
that he had stipulated he did 

00:37:16.021 --> 00:37:18.021
not want it published until 100 
years after his death.

00:37:21.512 --> 00:37:25.592
The reason being is that he had 
put all of his grievances into 

00:37:25.593 --> 00:37:27.593
that autobiography, all the 
things 

00:37:29.016 --> 00:37:31.318
he was feeling irritable about, 
all of the things that were 

00:37:31.319 --> 00:37:32.130
bothering him maybe, there was a
whole section about copyright at

00:37:32.131 --> 00:37:34.131
the Library of Congress that he 
was upset about...

00:37:38.638 --> 00:37:40.638
And he was able to put 
information down 

00:37:41.905 --> 00:37:43.905
in a very honest way that he may
have 

00:37:46.567 --> 00:37:47.052
felt inhibited, more inhibited 
if it was something for 

00:37:47.053 --> 00:37:49.053
publication while he was still 
alive.

00:37:52.401 --> 00:37:54.633
In addition to that he didn't 
actually write the biography. 

00:37:54.634 --> 00:37:56.634
What he did is, he spoke it.

00:37:57.717 --> 00:37:59.717
He tried and failed several 
times in 

00:38:02.588 --> 00:38:04.493
his life to work on his 
autobiography and toward the end

00:38:04.494 --> 00:38:06.945
of his life he realized the best
way for him to go about it was 

00:38:06.946 --> 00:38:08.946
not to start with the day 

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:13.485
of his birth and write down 
every single instance along the 

00:38:13.486 --> 00:38:14.095
way until his eventual death. 
What he wanted to do is wake up 

00:38:14.096 --> 00:38:17.192
in the morning and before he 
even got out of bed, just start 

00:38:17.193 --> 00:38:20.050
speaking about whatever it was 
that was on his mind. And 

00:38:20.051 --> 00:38:22.717
somebody else in the room would 
be writing it down. This was 

00:38:22.718 --> 00:38:24.718
hugely important for me.

00:38:28.877 --> 00:38:29.294
Because the story I was writing 
began as what we would call a 

00:38:29.295 --> 00:38:31.946
piece of oral history. So it was
a story that was spoken out 

00:38:36.993 --> 00:38:38.667
loud in real time between Mark 
Twain and his daughters. And 

00:38:38.668 --> 00:38:40.908
here I had pages and pages and 
pages of Mark Twain oral 

00:38:40.909 --> 00:38:43.146
history. And I think we all know
that the way 

00:38:46.147 --> 00:38:46.835
that you speak out loud is 
different from the way that you 

00:38:46.836 --> 00:38:48.836
write on paper.

00:38:50.287 --> 00:38:52.287
And there might be some overlap 
between 

00:38:54.093 --> 00:38:56.238
the two, but I really needed to 
get to know the Mark Twain that 

00:38:56.239 --> 00:38:58.239
spoke aloud and that's a much 
harder Mark Twain to find.

00:38:59.703 --> 00:39:03.566
The other piece of research that
was really important for me was 

00:39:03.567 --> 00:39:03.768
a biography written by Mark 
Twain by his 12-year-old 

00:39:03.769 --> 00:39:05.769
daughter Susie.

00:39:07.865 --> 00:39:09.865
This was probably the most 
important 

00:39:10.865 --> 00:39:13.804
piece of, the most important 
original document that I came 

00:39:13.805 --> 00:39:15.805
across.

00:39:18.295 --> 00:39:21.436
Here we have a quote from that 
biography. So she is 12-year-old

00:39:21.437 --> 00:39:24.503
and she writes about her father.
He could not bear to hear anyone

00:39:24.504 --> 00:39:28.161
talk about himself. But he could
listen to himself talk for hours

00:39:28.162 --> 00:39:30.162
without getting tired.

00:39:34.384 --> 00:39:35.406
So I could find no other 
instance of anybody writing 

00:39:35.407 --> 00:39:37.407
critically about Mark Twain.

00:39:40.517 --> 00:39:40.918
Anybody that was willing to 
acknowledge what kind of flaws 

00:39:40.919 --> 00:39:42.919
did this person have.

00:39:44.179 --> 00:39:46.179
Although Susie thought her 
father was 

00:39:47.191 --> 00:39:50.740
very funny, she thought he was 
very brave, she thought he was 

00:39:50.741 --> 00:39:52.399
very intelligent, she also had 
critiques of her father and I 

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.400
wanted to know those critiques.

00:39:57.882 --> 00:39:59.712
Mark Twain would also be writing
down notes in his own journals 

00:39:59.713 --> 00:40:01.713
and diaries about Susie.

00:40:04.555 --> 00:40:05.476
So here is one that says 
apparently Susie was born with 

00:40:05.477 --> 00:40:07.302
humane feelings for the animals 
and compassion for their 

00:40:07.303 --> 00:40:09.303
troubles.

00:40:10.344 --> 00:40:12.344
That was one of my favorite 
quotes that 

00:40:13.559 --> 00:40:16.125
I came across because that's 
when I recognized that if this 

00:40:16.534 --> 00:40:18.534
was a story that Mark Twain was 
telling 

00:40:19.605 --> 00:40:19.799
to his own children and to Susie
in particular who I think was 

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.800
his favorite 

00:40:23.424 --> 00:40:25.424
daughter, and Susie was a child 
who had a lot of love and 

00:40:27.138 --> 00:40:29.138
compassion for animals, then 
loving 

00:40:30.345 --> 00:40:31.471
compassion for animals should be
a part of this story even if 

00:40:31.472 --> 00:40:33.472
it's not a part of the original 
note.

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:36.971
Here's another quote from Susie.
And this quote is actually at 

00:40:36.972 --> 00:40:41.041
the very beginning of the book 
when you open up the book, it 

00:40:41.042 --> 00:40:42.868
says I have wanted Poppa to 
write a book that would reveal 

00:40:42.869 --> 00:40:45.109
something that was kind of 
sympathetic nature.

00:40:48.795 --> 00:40:51.230
This as I'm talking right now I 
think that this was actually 

00:40:51.231 --> 00:40:53.300
probably the most important 
single piece of information that

00:40:53.301 --> 00:40:55.301
Erin and I stumbled across.

00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:03.335
Because Mark Twain, you have to 
imagine he's not just a famous 

00:41:03.336 --> 00:41:06.271
author, he's the most famous and
important person on the entire 

00:41:06.272 --> 00:41:09.100
person on the entire planet when
he was alive. Is less like a 

00:41:09.101 --> 00:41:11.101
famous author and more 

00:41:17.036 --> 00:41:19.130
like say, kanyw West he was the 
Kanye West of his day. And so 

00:41:19.131 --> 00:41:21.131
because of that I think it was 

00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:24.346
very difficult for Mark Twain to
be

00:41:25.939 --> 00:41:27.939
honest when in public. He felt a
real burden to always be funny.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:30.623
I think he felt a burden to 
always be really smart. He 

00:41:30.624 --> 00:41:30.859
wanted to be the smartest and 
funniest man in the room but he 

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.511
had a hard time revealing the 
part of himself that was kind 

00:41:34.512 --> 00:41:36.512
and the part of himself that was
vulnerable.

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:40.071
And I felt that those parts of 
himself would be the kinds, 

00:41:40.072 --> 00:41:42.072
would be the parts 

00:41:43.085 --> 00:41:44.370
of himself that he revealed if 
he was telling a story just to 

00:41:44.371 --> 00:41:46.371
his own family.

00:41:49.288 --> 00:41:51.752
So this is what my writing looks
like. And I kind of cringe at 

00:41:51.753 --> 00:41:53.753
the idea that 

00:41:54.956 --> 00:41:55.634
my own notes will end up someday
at the Berkeley archive or the 

00:41:55.635 --> 00:41:57.635
Library 

00:41:59.089 --> 00:41:59.501
of Congress because my notes 
look a lot like my own middle 

00:41:59.502 --> 00:42:01.502
school homework.

00:42:05.412 --> 00:42:07.412
This is the very first passage 
from the book.

00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:12.109
This is a note written by me 
that sort 

00:42:13.155 --> 00:42:14.579
of explains how I'm going to 
tell the story and the way I 

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.580
imagined myself telling the 
story was that I imagined 

00:42:19.492 --> 00:42:21.492
Mark Twain was there with me and
he was 

00:42:22.664 --> 00:42:24.523
telling me the story and now 
Mark Twain is gone and it is my 

00:42:24.524 --> 00:42:26.524
job now to tell it 

00:42:27.733 --> 00:42:28.217
back to you and I'm going to 
tell it in my own way but I'm 

00:42:28.218 --> 00:42:29.858
going to be as faithful as 
possible to the man who told it 

00:42:29.859 --> 00:42:31.859
to me in the first place.

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:36.189
So now I'd like to talk to you a
little bit about how the artwork

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:38.190
was made.

00:42:40.054 --> 00:42:42.696
So, Aaron would normally do this
part of the presentation. She's 

00:42:42.697 --> 00:42:44.723
at home with our 10 month old 
baby right now so I'm going to 

00:42:44.724 --> 00:42:46.724
do my best at telling her half 
of the story.

00:42:48.228 --> 00:42:50.228
For Aaron, the most important 
part of 

00:42:51.495 --> 00:42:53.495
the process was coming up with 
the main character.

00:42:55.512 --> 00:42:59.033
She really felt that there was 
no way she could proceed with 

00:42:59.034 --> 00:42:59.635
this project until she knew 
exactly what this character 

00:42:59.636 --> 00:43:01.709
looked like, exactly how the 
character moved.

00:43:05.436 --> 00:43:07.436
In this case, she really wanted 
the 

00:43:10.692 --> 00:43:11.182
character to have two things 
that are very difficult to put 

00:43:11.183 --> 00:43:16.491
into the same person. She wanted
the character to look vulnerable

00:43:16.492 --> 00:43:18.492
and compassionate.

00:43:20.161 --> 00:43:22.161
She also wanted that character 
to look brave.

00:43:26.728 --> 00:43:30.728
And these two things are not 
necessarily opposites but they 

00:43:26.728 --> 00:43:28.728
are difficult things to put into
the same face.

00:43:32.199 --> 00:43:35.298
So Erin spent nearly 3 months 
working on this single drawing. 

00:43:35.299 --> 00:43:37.299
She would draw it and draw it 
again and 

00:43:39.112 --> 00:43:39.605
eventually she came to this 
image of our main character, 

00:43:39.606 --> 00:43:41.606
Johnny, that she was happy with.

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:47.570
One thing that Erin does to find
a 

00:43:48.625 --> 00:43:52.558
character is that she will 
actually sculpt to the character

00:43:48.625 --> 00:43:50.625
with clay.

00:43:54.155 --> 00:43:56.155
For Erin that's easier sometimes
then 

00:43:57.168 --> 00:43:59.168
just trying to draw on the empty
white page.

00:44:01.751 --> 00:44:02.155
She gets her thumbs in there and
start moving around, what does 

00:44:02.156 --> 00:44:04.156
the nose look like, what does 
the eye look like.

00:44:06.892 --> 00:44:07.096
What does the character look 
like when you turn it. Does it 

00:44:07.097 --> 00:44:09.097
look good from all angles.

00:44:13.174 --> 00:44:14.900
And once she has got a clay 
heaf=dad, this is about 3 inches

00:44:14.901 --> 00:44:16.901
tall in real life and once she 
has got that finished...

00:44:20.439 --> 00:44:22.675
She can move it around and draw 
from it. That way you are not 

00:44:22.676 --> 00:44:24.676
always having to use your 
imagination.

00:44:27.509 --> 00:44:30.279
Erin uses all old-fashioned and 
traditional materials, which is 

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:33.142
one of the reasons I think we 
were asked to work on the 

00:44:33.143 --> 00:44:35.143
project.

00:44:36.842 --> 00:44:39.287
Mark Twain, when Mark Twain was 
alive and writing the most 

00:44:39.288 --> 00:44:41.288
common form of book illustration
was probably woodblock printing.

00:44:45.385 --> 00:44:50.469
In its day, it would have been 
in almost every book that you 

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:52.470
see had those images. These days
it's much less common but 

00:44:54.499 --> 00:44:56.499
it's the way that Erin continues
to work so on the right side 

00:44:56.978 --> 00:44:59.510
here we have her carving knives 
that she uses for carving wood 

00:44:59.511 --> 00:45:01.351
block and on the left are just 
her pencils that she uses to 

00:45:01.352 --> 00:45:03.352
finish the images.

00:45:07.424 --> 00:45:11.019
So these are Erin's paints and 
her brayer's and what is called 

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:13.020
a Baron, a little circular 
object is called the Baron.

00:45:17.526 --> 00:45:19.526
The way that Erin works as she 
will carve a wood block.

00:45:20.945 --> 00:45:21.615
She will add ink or paint to the
wood block. Using one of those 

00:45:21.616 --> 00:45:23.616
prayers. It's kind of like a 
paint roller.

00:45:25.503 --> 00:45:27.503
And

00:45:29.656 --> 00:45:29.840
she will press a piece of paper 
onto the wood block and take the

00:45:29.841 --> 00:45:31.691
circular Baron and with the 
pressure of her own hand will 

00:45:31.692 --> 00:45:33.692
press the ink from the wood 
block onto the paper.

00:45:36.178 --> 00:45:38.178
In the center there is Erin's 
color chart.

00:45:39.661 --> 00:45:41.661
So there are one, two, three, 15
colors there.

00:45:43.755 --> 00:45:45.755
That's every color that Erin is 
going to use in the book.

00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:49.667
Before Erin makes a single image
what she does is decide the 

00:45:49.668 --> 00:45:51.668
entire color palette for the 
entire book.

00:45:55.921 --> 00:45:56.797
So this is one of Erin's wood 
blocks this is one of the wood 

00:45:56.798 --> 00:45:58.798
block that was used to make the 
cover image.

00:46:03.051 --> 00:46:05.349
So, she carved that big shape, 
that sort of all smeared in red 

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:07.350
right now, that is the Dragon.

00:46:09.022 --> 00:46:11.022
Underneath the dragons had is 
the 

00:46:12.693 --> 00:46:15.554
lineead is the lion after she 
presses think she pulls up the 

00:46:15.555 --> 00:46:17.555
paper and it looks something 
like this and the final 

00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:23.483
step is several hours just with 
a pencil box where she starts 

00:46:23.484 --> 00:46:28.598
filling in all the details. So 
this is the image. This is the 

00:46:28.599 --> 00:46:30.599
cover image for the poor 

00:46:31.605 --> 00:46:33.605
leapurloining.

00:46:38.784 --> 00:46:39.881
Typically you would always be 
carving away things but one 

00:46:39.882 --> 00:46:44.059
thing Erin likes to do is add 
ink directly onto the block and 

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:46.118
sort of wipe it softly away just
with a paper towel and by doing 

00:46:48.375 --> 00:46:51.031
that she can get an image that 
looks kind of like this with 

00:46:51.032 --> 00:46:53.032
these soft edges 

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:58.248
for the Brown and the soft edges
for the cloud and then becomes 

00:46:58.249 --> 00:47:00.249
an image that looks like this.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:02.745
So one of the challenge that 
Erin was facing was what was the

00:47:02.746 --> 00:47:08.027
setting for this book? it was 
told originally in 1879. We are 

00:47:08.028 --> 00:47:12.913
illustrating it at this time in 
2014, 2015, 2016. But it's a 

00:47:12.914 --> 00:47:14.914
fairytale at the same time.

00:47:18.002 --> 00:47:20.565
And fairytales are not usually 
set, well in Australia for one. 

00:47:20.566 --> 00:47:23.216
They are also not set in the 
United States typically. We kind

00:47:23.217 --> 00:47:25.217
of felt that Mark Twain would 

00:47:26.487 --> 00:47:30.553
want to buck the trend and he 
would want the book set in the 

00:47:26.487 --> 00:47:28.725
US. So what we decided to do is 
bridge the 

00:47:34.207 --> 00:47:35.844
gap between Mark Twain era and 
our own era and to set the book 

00:47:35.845 --> 00:47:38.912
in what is known as the 
dustbowl. So, the middle of the 

00:47:38.913 --> 00:47:40.913
country in the 1930s basically.

00:47:43.388 --> 00:47:45.238
A really desolate, dusty place 
and we thought it was perfect 

00:47:45.239 --> 00:47:47.239
for the kind of story that Mark 
Twain would tell.

00:47:49.551 --> 00:47:51.551
So if you guys see the house up 
there 

00:47:52.845 --> 00:47:54.845
in the upper right corner, 
throughout 

00:47:55.879 --> 00:47:59.794
the book, Erin dropped in little
things that were... She would 

00:47:59.795 --> 00:48:02.241
call them Easter eggs. Things 
for people that really love Mark

00:48:05.105 --> 00:48:05.308
Twain to find so they could 
engage with the book in a 

00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:10.190
special way. So the house is 
actually based on the house that

00:48:10.191 --> 00:48:12.191
Mark Twain was born in, which is
seen here.

00:48:20.584 --> 00:48:21.283
The Queen in this story, does 
not show up until later on in 

00:48:21.284 --> 00:48:22.900
the story was actually based on 
Mark Twain's wife, which some 

00:48:22.901 --> 00:48:24.901
people have noted.

00:48:27.001 --> 00:48:29.483
There was one final piece of the
creation of the artwork that 

00:48:29.484 --> 00:48:31.484
really was giving us trouble for
a long time.

00:48:33.964 --> 00:48:35.964
There were certain elements that
we 

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:38.035
really wanted to be carved in 
wood and printed, but they were 

00:48:38.036 --> 00:48:40.036
just either 

00:48:41.082 --> 00:48:41.290
too intricate to carved by hand,
or it would just take us too 

00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:43.291
long.

00:48:44.995 --> 00:48:46.995
So, what we ended up doing was 
using a laser to carve the wood.

00:48:51.729 --> 00:48:55.329
Which involves a lot of me 
standing and watching this 

00:48:51.729 --> 00:48:54.166
machine work. This is what I'm 
looking at there.

00:48:58.050 --> 00:48:59.270
All of the chapter titles in the
book, so chapter 2 regarding 

00:48:59.271 --> 00:49:01.271
parades, chapter 

00:49:03.383 --> 00:49:05.383
1, in which we are introduced to
our 

00:49:07.268 --> 00:49:08.324
luckless hero, all of the 
chapter titles were carved into 

00:49:08.325 --> 00:49:10.325
wood using this laser machine.

00:49:15.446 --> 00:49:15.652
There were also these long 
proclamations, the proclamation,

00:49:15.653 --> 00:49:17.653
the 

00:49:19.136 --> 00:49:19.340
unpopular proclamations of the 
King, that would have taken us 

00:49:19.341 --> 00:49:23.841
literally months to carved by 
hand that we were able to carve 

00:49:23.842 --> 00:49:25.842
in maybe 45 minutes using this 
machine.

00:49:27.753 --> 00:49:29.753
These are some of my favorite 
pieces of artwork in the book.

00:49:31.224 --> 00:49:31.428
This is what the king's 
proclamation looks like in the 

00:49:31.429 --> 00:49:33.429
final book.

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:39.590
This is what one of the chapter 
titles looks like.

00:49:44.563 --> 00:49:46.607
Maybe my favorite individual 
carving in this book is actually

00:49:46.608 --> 00:49:48.608
on the endpaper.

00:49:51.054 --> 00:49:55.009
So an endpaper is the part of 
the book, the very first thing 

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:56.639
when you open the book and the 
very last thing you see when you

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.640
close the book.

00:50:00.752 --> 00:50:03.612
And in most books this will just
be a solid color. Or maybe it 

00:50:03.613 --> 00:50:05.613
will be plain white.

00:50:08.134 --> 00:50:11.088
But Erin and I love to do 
something special for the 

00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:13.089
endpapers whenever we can so we 

00:50:14.091 --> 00:50:16.424
wanted to bring the whole 
project back to where it began. 

00:50:16.425 --> 00:50:16.610
We wanted to be able to see a 
little bit of what Mark Twain's 

00:50:16.611 --> 00:50:18.611
actual writing looked like.

00:50:20.698 --> 00:50:21.107
So we took some original pages 
of Mark Twain's work. We had 

00:50:21.108 --> 00:50:23.108
them digitized.

00:50:24.257 --> 00:50:26.257
Then we were able to feed those 
into 

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.260
the laser Carver and Mark 
Twain's actual writing started 

00:50:30.759 --> 00:50:32.759
to get spit out by this laser 
Carver directly into the wood.

00:50:36.955 --> 00:50:37.162
And this is an image of Erin 
pulling a print from Mark 

00:50:37.163 --> 00:50:39.820
Twain's handwriting. So these 
are some of my favorite pieces 

00:50:39.821 --> 00:50:41.821
of artwork.

00:50:42.869 --> 00:50:44.869
So that brings us to the 
conclusion.

00:50:48.317 --> 00:50:48.593
One of the questions that I get 
more than any when I'm talking 

00:50:48.594 --> 00:50:50.594
about 

00:50:52.697 --> 00:50:52.896
this book is which part of the 
book was Mark Twain and which 

00:50:52.897 --> 00:50:54.897
part of the book is yours?

00:50:57.199 --> 00:50:57.604
And the obvious answer is, the 
most obvious answer is that the 

00:50:57.605 --> 00:51:00.247
ending is my. The last few pages
of the book are completely mine.

00:51:03.946 --> 00:51:06.388
But in truth, that doesn't 
really tell you the story 

00:51:06.389 --> 00:51:08.389
because all throughout the 

00:51:09.609 --> 00:51:11.609
text, he and I are

00:51:13.319 --> 00:51:13.723
sort of interweaving and 
sometimes it is hidden speaking 

00:51:13.724 --> 00:51:15.724
and sometimes it is 

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:17.607
me speaking and I worked very 
hard and it was very difficult 

00:51:17.608 --> 00:51:19.608
for me to find a way to balance 
the two voices.

00:51:21.271 --> 00:51:23.100
My favorite example of something
that neither Mark Twain nor 

00:51:23.101 --> 00:51:25.101
myself but is also both is this 
chicken.

00:51:28.458 --> 00:51:30.458
So, the chicken is my favorite 
character in the entire book.

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.160
And the chickens name is 
pestilence and famine.

00:51:36.686 --> 00:51:39.129
And so as I was doing my 
research on Mark Twain, one of 

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:41.177
the things I discovered was that
Mark Twain always had cats in 

00:51:41.178 --> 00:51:43.178
his house.

00:51:46.301 --> 00:51:46.508
Cats and cats everywhere. When 
he lived on the farm in L Myra 

00:51:46.509 --> 00:51:48.509
New 

00:51:51.149 --> 00:51:52.210
York there were cats in and out 
of the house and the writing 

00:51:52.211 --> 00:51:54.211
studio and the cats always had 
strange names.

00:51:57.129 --> 00:51:59.129
One of those cats was named 
pestilence and famine.

00:52:03.494 --> 00:52:03.701
Or, and we could never really 
figure this out, there were two 

00:52:03.702 --> 00:52:05.702
cats, one that 

00:52:06.923 --> 00:52:08.814
was named pestilence and one 
that was named famine. The 

00:52:08.815 --> 00:52:10.237
reason we couldn't figured it 
out is because nobody had 

00:52:10.238 --> 00:52:12.238
bothered to put a 

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.930
comma where you would need one 
and we couldn't find a 

00:52:15.931 --> 00:52:16.139
satisfactory answer as to 
whether there were two cats or 

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.140
one cat.

00:52:19.777 --> 00:52:20.681
But Erin and I thought it was 
funnier if there was only one 

00:52:20.682 --> 00:52:23.128
cat and the cat had two names. 
And so that's why the chicken 

00:52:23.129 --> 00:52:25.129
was introduced into the story as
pestilence and famine.

00:52:29.646 --> 00:52:30.881
One chicken with two names. That
is my favorite example of 

00:52:30.882 --> 00:52:33.333
something that is both a little 
bit of Twain and a little bit of

00:52:33.334 --> 00:52:35.334
me and a 

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:39.620
little bit of Erin, too, and an 
example 

00:52:40.827 --> 00:52:41.513
of the kind of thinking that we 
were using as we were making 

00:52:41.514 --> 00:52:44.802
this project.
&gt;&gt; I love this story. Isn't it a

00:52:44.803 --> 00:52:46.803
great story?

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:51.450
[Applause]

00:53:00.879 --> 00:53:02.910
&gt;&gt; I am really glad that you 
made a point of mentioning how 

00:53:02.911 --> 00:53:04.933
you start the book. I want to 
read you guys something real 

00:53:04.934 --> 00:53:06.934
quick.

00:53:08.646 --> 00:53:09.861
He says at the very beginning 
it's the note from one of the 

00:53:09.862 --> 00:53:11.862
authors..

00:53:15.197 --> 00:53:15.397
. And he showed you his 
handwriting version of this, but

00:53:15.398 --> 00:53:17.398
the part that I 

00:53:19.571 --> 00:53:19.790
really get a kick out of is most
likely you don't know me and 

00:53:19.791 --> 00:53:21.791
you've never heard 

00:53:23.604 --> 00:53:25.106
my name, said too fast or 
otherwise chances are you have 

00:53:25.107 --> 00:53:28.000
heard of my friend, Mark Twain. 
He is the one who told me the 

00:53:28.001 --> 00:53:30.001
story. I love that.

00:53:32.286 --> 00:53:34.286
I have a feeling you guys have 
some questions for him.

00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:39.481
I love this notion that 
something that he has just 

00:53:39.482 --> 00:53:41.482
shared with 

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:43.146
you either about his work or the
story itself probably spoke to 

00:53:43.147 --> 00:53:45.147
you and you have some questions.

00:53:46.195 --> 00:53:48.195
So we have got four microphones 
all around our room.

00:53:51.287 --> 00:53:53.287
And when you raise your hand and
one of my colleagues..

00:53:57.222 --> 00:53:59.222
. Identifies you, if you would 
take the 

00:54:01.916 --> 00:54:02.110
microphone and say your name and
then ask your question, that 

00:54:02.111 --> 00:54:04.111
would be great. Why don't we 
start right here.

00:54:08.226 --> 00:54:10.226
&gt;&gt; Hi I am Jaden and I wanted to
ask...

00:54:13.337 --> 00:54:15.993
What do you, what do you inspire
to be most like Mark Twain?

00:54:17.654 --> 00:54:19.654
&gt;&gt; Um..

00:54:21.739 --> 00:54:23.206
Well if I could grow a mustache 
like Mark Twain I think that 

00:54:23.207 --> 00:54:25.207
would be pretty great.

00:54:28.087 --> 00:54:30.087
I think I learned a lot about 
Mark 

00:54:33.182 --> 00:54:33.868
Twain and as I was working on 
this and one thing that I really

00:54:33.869 --> 00:54:35.869
admire is that Mark Twain was 
really well known for 

00:54:38.094 --> 00:54:40.094
being able to stand up in front 
of people and he would sort of 

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:42.170
stand and wait for everybody to 
get 

00:54:43.222 --> 00:54:44.033
really quiet, then he would just
start talking and he could tell 

00:54:44.034 --> 00:54:46.034
a story like that.

00:54:48.895 --> 00:54:52.444
And that really is impressive to
me because it took me three 

00:54:52.445 --> 00:54:52.647
years to write this story and I 
think Mark Twain could have done

00:54:52.648 --> 00:54:54.648
it in about 15 minutes.

00:54:56.943 --> 00:54:58.943
So that's what I aspire to be.

00:55:00.028 --> 00:55:00.433
I aspire to be somebody who can 
just get up, tell a story and 

00:55:00.434 --> 00:55:02.121
have it be perfect on the first 
try.

00:55:02.122 --> 00:55:04.122
&gt;&gt; Good answer.

00:55:05.793 --> 00:55:08.043
I want to mention as well for 
those of you who are watching 

00:55:08.044 --> 00:55:10.283
the live stream if you want to 
ask a question you can 

00:55:16.628 --> 00:55:18.628
through Twitter if you use the 
hashtag 

00:55:21.714 --> 00:55:24.563
TwainLOC if you are on twitter 
and you want to ask a question 

00:55:24.564 --> 00:55:26.564
if you use the 

00:55:27.571 --> 00:55:29.650
hashtag TwainLOC my colleague 
Sasha has her phone ready and 

00:55:29.651 --> 00:55:31.651
she can be on the lookout for 
any of those questions.

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:37.185
Okay how about we go, do we have
a question back there or not? 

00:55:37.186 --> 00:55:41.107
Great.
&gt;.

00:55:45.986 --> 00:55:48.828
&gt; Hi my name is Eleanor and I 
was wondering what the 

00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:51.475
connection between all the 
characters was and how they were

00:55:52.302 --> 00:55:54.302
all connected.

00:55:55.959 --> 00:55:58.396
&gt;&gt; The question is how were all 
the characters connected. So 

00:55:58.397 --> 00:56:00.397
this is a difficult one to 
answer 

00:56:01.445 --> 00:56:03.445
because Mark Twain sort of had 
his own 

00:56:04.931 --> 00:56:06.931
way in his notes of connecting 
the 

00:56:09.825 --> 00:56:10.049
characters but then I had my own
ideas for how the characters 

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:13.162
ought to be connected but there 
were certain characters that 

00:56:13.163 --> 00:56:15.163
were the same throughout. So the
character of Johnny, we were 

00:56:17.662 --> 00:56:21.528
very faithful to the way that 
Mark Twain wrote about that 

00:56:17.662 --> 00:56:20.554
character. Also the character of
the Queen, who I 

00:56:24.006 --> 00:56:26.006
think was, we based it on Mark 
Twain's 

00:56:27.008 --> 00:56:29.008
wife who he loved very much. But
I think that even if he was not 

00:56:30.354 --> 00:56:33.202
quite thinking that, that was a 
character that he was 

00:56:33.203 --> 00:56:35.203
particularly in love with.

00:56:38.497 --> 00:56:38.918
But there were so many different
options. One of the things I 

00:56:38.919 --> 00:56:40.958
love about this story is there 
were so many pieces of 

00:56:41.152 --> 00:56:43.152
information that were missing.

00:56:45.455 --> 00:56:49.055
And that is what was really 
exciting as a storyteller 

00:56:45.455 --> 00:56:48.309
because there were so many 
pieces missing it allowed us to 

00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:50.769
make the connection and put 
things together in a way that 

00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:53.842
felt appropriate to us.
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:56:57.937 --> 00:56:59.576
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Cooper and 
what made you like Mark Twain so

00:56:59.577 --> 00:57:02.432
much?
&gt;&gt; So that's an interesting 

00:57:02.433 --> 00:57:04.433
question 

00:57:05.447 --> 00:57:06.933
because there were times when I 
would say that I didn't like 

00:57:06.934 --> 00:57:08.934
Mark Twain very much.

00:57:12.464 --> 00:57:15.394
We spent so much time working 
with him as if he were a real 

00:57:15.395 --> 00:57:17.395
live person that we started 

00:57:18.463 --> 00:57:20.463
to feel that Mark Twain was 
almost like a family member.

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:23.346
So you love your family, but 
sometimes you just really can't 

00:57:23.347 --> 00:57:25.347
stand your family either.

00:57:28.646 --> 00:57:29.043
And the more that we read about 
Mark Twain and the more we had 

00:57:29.044 --> 00:57:33.555
to spend time with him there 
were times when we just felt 

00:57:33.556 --> 00:57:36.420
like maybe it would be better, 
Mark if you would leave and we 

00:57:36.421 --> 00:57:38.421
could work on this thing by 
ourselves for a little while.

00:57:39.887 --> 00:57:41.512
But he never left and now I feel
like Mark Twain is permanently 

00:57:41.513 --> 00:57:43.544
living in my spare bedroom.
[Laughter]

00:57:45.981 --> 00:57:47.981
&gt;&gt; My name is Zoe.

00:57:49.045 --> 00:57:51.045
I was wondering what is your 10 
month old baby's name?

00:57:52.906 --> 00:57:54.906
&gt;&gt; My 10 month old baby's name 
is 

00:57:56.572 --> 00:57:58.572
Adelaide, which is actually a 
city in Australia.

00:57:59.615 --> 00:58:01.615
So Australia has come back into 
the conversation.

00:58:01.652 --> 00:58:03.652
&gt;&gt; All right

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.320
&gt;&gt; My name is Ty and I had a 
question 

00:58:10.251 --> 00:58:11.468
about when you went into the 
house did you feel like a 

00:58:11.469 --> 00:58:13.469
flashback or anything 

00:58:15.562 --> 00:58:15.764
that he felt inside that could, 
you could have put in your 

00:58:15.765 --> 00:58:18.186
books?
&gt;&gt; You mean like in Mark Twain's

00:58:18.187 --> 00:58:20.187
house?
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:58:21.872 --> 00:58:23.872
&gt;&gt; so a little bit.

00:58:25.755 --> 00:58:26.152
The funny thing is that when you
walk in the house it really does

00:58:26.153 --> 00:58:30.868
feel like there are ghosts in 
the house and it's not a house 

00:58:30.869 --> 00:58:31.881
that I would want to be hanging 
around and after dark. I will 

00:58:31.882 --> 00:58:36.391
say that.
&gt;&gt; Hello my name is Avery.

00:58:41.321 --> 00:58:42.942
And was the title of your book 
Mark Twain's title or did you 

00:58:42.943 --> 00:58:44.943
make that title?

00:58:46.646 --> 00:58:48.065
&gt;&gt; That's a very good question. 
So Mark Twain didn't leave a 

00:58:48.066 --> 00:58:50.066
title.

00:58:53.133 --> 00:58:55.019
All he wrote was the word 
oleomargarine on the top and so 

00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:57.020
it was our job also to come up 
with the title.

00:59:02.409 --> 00:59:05.927
Purloining is my editor's 
favorite word, she has two 

00:59:05.928 --> 00:59:06.129
favorite words, should one is 
that one which if you don't know

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:08.130
what it 

00:59:09.606 --> 00:59:11.606
means it is something like 
stealing, 

00:59:13.928 --> 00:59:15.928
kind of like kidnapping in this 
case, her other favorite word is

00:59:16.923 --> 00:59:18.923
defenestration

00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:20.854
which means to throw yourself 
out a window, but I worked 

00:59:20.855 --> 00:59:22.081
tirelessly to try to get the 
second word into the book and 

00:59:22.082 --> 00:59:24.082
was never able to do it.

00:59:31.408 --> 00:59:33.408
&gt;&gt; 

00:59:34.535 --> 00:59:37.033
My name is destiny and my 
question was, is it like a 

00:59:37.034 --> 00:59:39.876
spiritual connection with Mark 
Twain or is he still alive?

00:59:45.195 --> 00:59:47.195
&gt;&gt; So, Mark Twain died in I 
think it was 

00:59:48.246 --> 00:59:51.085
the year 1910, but for me he is 
very much still alive. And so I 

00:59:51.086 --> 00:59:53.086
guess, yeah you would call it 
kind of a spiritual connection.

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:03.223
&gt;&gt; My name is Suleman and my 
question is if those aren't the 

01:00:03.554 --> 01:00:04.159
characters then how did you pick
which characters to put on the 

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.160
cover?

01:00:08.894 --> 01:00:10.894
&gt;&gt; So that was up to my wife 
Erin to decide.

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:17.476
And all of the important 
characters in the book are 

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:18.087
there. So, the characters that 
have either speaking roles or 

01:00:18.088 --> 01:00:20.088
play some other sort 

01:00:21.357 --> 01:00:24.267
of important role, and there are
a lot of animals in the book 

01:00:24.268 --> 01:00:26.744
that are sort of I guess you 
could call them background in 

01:00:26.745 --> 01:00:28.745
the story.

01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:35.390
And so it was, Erin was trying 
hard to put all the most 

01:00:35.551 --> 01:00:38.219
important characters which would
include the chicken, the skunk, 

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:41.507
the lion, on top of the tiger 
there was the weasel, the weasel

01:00:41.508 --> 01:00:41.716
was very important to the 
telling of the story and of 

01:00:41.717 --> 01:00:43.717
course the Dragon 

01:00:44.718 --> 01:00:45.814
which was so big she could not 
fit him onto the front cover so 

01:00:45.815 --> 01:00:47.815
he goes all the way to the back 
cover too.

01:00:49.708 --> 01:00:51.708
&gt;&gt; My name is Austin and I was 
wondering 

01:00:55.009 --> 01:00:57.009
how many graphs did you have 
todrafts did you do?

01:00:58.261 --> 01:01:00.261
&gt;&gt; Another good question my very
first 

01:01:01.265 --> 01:01:03.265
draft was the version of the 
book I wrote when I was 

01:01:05.618 --> 01:01:05.848
on the cabin at Beaver Island 
but I did not stop writing the 

01:01:05.849 --> 01:01:07.849
entire time we were working on 
the book.

01:01:09.322 --> 01:01:12.195
And so I began writing it's a 
time of 2014 and we finish the 

01:01:12.196 --> 01:01:14.196
book and January 2017.

01:01:18.548 --> 01:01:19.753
So around 2 1/2 years of writing
and rewriting and rewriting and 

01:01:19.754 --> 01:01:22.654
the way that I work I do not 
start at the beginning 

01:01:25.655 --> 01:01:27.954
of a draft and work all the way 
to the end. I have the entire 

01:01:27.955 --> 01:01:29.955
thing in front of me 

01:01:30.958 --> 01:01:32.958
and I change a little bit

01:01:35.146 --> 01:01:35.336
here and there and go back to 
the middle and change a little 

01:01:35.337 --> 01:01:35.958
bit there. So I can't tell you 
exactly how many drafts but I 

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:37.181
can tell you I was constantly 
working, constantly changing.

01:01:40.886 --> 01:01:42.735
&gt;&gt; Hello my name is Wesley and I
was wondering if Mark Twain had 

01:01:42.736 --> 01:01:44.736
an influence on any of your 
other books.

01:01:46.206 --> 01:01:48.206
&gt;&gt; I love that question.

01:01:50.578 --> 01:01:52.001
So did Mark Twain have an 
influence on any of my other 

01:01:52.002 --> 01:01:54.002
books?

01:01:56.107 --> 01:01:56.321
I think he did not necessarily 
have a direct influence on my 

01:01:56.322 --> 01:01:58.978
books but I think he had an 
influence on the type of rider 

01:01:58.979 --> 01:02:00.979
that I became.

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:07.140
People have a lot of ways to 
describe 

01:02:08.155 --> 01:02:12.189
Mark Twain but to describe him 
as a satirist, so a satirist is 

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:14.190
somebody who finds a way to 

01:02:17.698 --> 01:02:18.525
use comedy to better inform 
people about some serious issue 

01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:23.018
that's going on. And that's 
always been a really interesting

01:02:23.019 --> 01:02:25.019
way for me to communicate.

01:02:30.963 --> 01:02:31.909
Something that has influenced 
me, even though there's maybe 

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:33.352
not a specific book of Mark 
Twain's that I would look to for

01:02:33.353 --> 01:02:35.353
inspiration.

01:02:40.495 --> 01:02:42.495
&gt;&gt; Hi my name is Shakela and I 
was 

01:02:43.788 --> 01:02:44.391
wondering where did you find the
notes for the book, to write the

01:02:44.392 --> 01:02:46.392
book?

01:02:47.476 --> 01:02:49.476
&gt;&gt; Remember the video we watched
at the beginning?

01:02:51.557 --> 01:02:53.557
That was the Mark Twain paper 
that is 

01:02:54.561 --> 01:02:57.268
its own little archive and 
library in Berkeley California. 

01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:59.534
So at the time they made that 
video, which I'm guessing was 

01:02:59.535 --> 01:03:01.535
about 20 years 

01:03:02.803 --> 01:03:05.038
ago they said that there were I 
think about 10,000 letters to 

01:03:05.039 --> 01:03:07.039
and from Mark Twain.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.840
Today it's all the way up to 
over 30,000.

01:03:12.699 --> 01:03:14.699
And they are still finding, 
every 

01:03:18.178 --> 01:03:20.119
single week, as many as three 
new letters written to either 

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.120
Mark Twain or 

01:03:23.338 --> 01:03:26.015
from Mark Twain or from a family
member of Mark Twain. So the 

01:03:26.016 --> 01:03:28.057
archive is really a living thing
where things are constantly 

01:03:28.058 --> 01:03:33.359
coming in and new things are 
being discovered and there have 

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:35.360
got to be any number of little 
pieces of gold stuck in this 

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:37.412
archive waiting to be discovered
by people.

01:03:41.602 --> 01:03:43.602
&gt;&gt; My name is Amani and I was 
wondering 

01:03:44.696 --> 01:03:46.696
why do you think that you were 
chosen to rewrite this book?

01:03:49.602 --> 01:03:53.703
&gt;&gt; I have asked myself that too,
and I don't have an answer that 

01:03:53.704 --> 01:03:55.704
I can say is definitely the true
answer.

01:03:57.642 --> 01:03:59.050
But what I think is the reason 
we were chosen is actually the 

01:03:59.051 --> 01:04:01.051
ability of my wife Erin.

01:04:05.607 --> 01:04:05.808
So I really think it is her 
ability as an artist and the 

01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:07.809
methods I was showing 

01:04:08.816 --> 01:04:10.588
you, how she works in woodblock,
she works with these traditional

01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:12.589
materials, I 

01:04:13.884 --> 01:04:15.524
think that Erin was a bridge 
between Mark Twain's era and my 

01:04:15.525 --> 01:04:17.961
own and I just kind of came 
along because I was attached to 

01:04:17.962 --> 01:04:20.235
her. That's what I tell people, 
anyway.

01:04:22.674 --> 01:04:24.674
&gt;&gt; We've got time for one more 
question. And we will...

01:04:30.847 --> 01:04:32.847
&gt;&gt; Hello, so my name is Odon and
so 

01:04:35.556 --> 01:04:35.966
before you wrote the book did 
you know what was in Mark 

01:04:35.967 --> 01:04:37.967
Twain's mind like you 

01:04:39.231 --> 01:04:41.231
don't know the way it was like, 
the book 

01:04:42.517 --> 01:04:46.785
was ended, like what was in his 
mind? Did you figure out this? 

01:04:46.786 --> 01:04:48.786
Or did you take your time?

01:04:51.345 --> 01:04:53.583
&gt;&gt; So the most difficult part of
this job was figuring out what 

01:04:53.584 --> 01:04:57.656
was actually inside the mind of 
this writer and instead of 

01:04:57.657 --> 01:04:59.657
trying to figure out what was 

01:05:01.342 --> 01:05:03.342
in his mind on that very 
specific day, 

01:05:04.548 --> 01:05:07.332
what I tried to figure out was 
what was on his mind throughout 

01:05:07.333 --> 01:05:09.333
his lifetime. And if I could 
figure out what was on 

01:05:10.803 --> 01:05:15.069
his mind throughout his lifetime
I would have a better chance of 

01:05:10.803 --> 01:05:15.110
figuring out the way that he 
would have told the story. Also 

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:17.354
before I leave I want to make 
sure that somebody gets me one 

01:05:17.355 --> 01:05:19.355
of these T-shirts that just says
Twain on it.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.463
Because I don't have anything 
quite like that so if... That 

01:05:24.464 --> 01:05:26.464
would be great.
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

01:05:30.422 --> 01:05:32.422
Thank you all so much. Your 
questions were terrific.

01:05:33.709 --> 01:05:35.709
And thank you.

01:05:38.974 --> 01:05:40.974
[Cheers and applause]

01:05:46.104 --> 01:05:48.104
&gt;&gt; I also want

01:05:50.629 --> 01:05:52.629
to, I also want to give a very 
very special...

01:05:55.335 --> 01:05:56.771
I want to give a very very 
special thank you to Dr. and 

01:05:56.772 --> 01:05:58.772
Mrs.

01:06:02.073 --> 01:06:06.006
Eskin who are here with us who 
made this program possible. 

01:06:02.073 --> 01:06:06.608
Thank you.
[Cheers and applause]

01:06:09.275 --> 01:06:11.509
&gt;&gt; As I mentioned at the 
beginning of this program, Dr. 

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:13.510
and Mrs.

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:19.744
Eskin are responsible for the 
Jonah Skolkoff Memorial program 

01:06:19.745 --> 01:06:21.745
here at the 

01:06:22.757 --> 01:06:24.902
library and they have been 
supporting this for nine years 

01:06:24.903 --> 01:06:26.903
and every one of these programs 
I just think are marvelous.

01:06:28.981 --> 01:06:30.608
I think your connection to the 
story your way of telling it and

01:06:30.609 --> 01:06:33.486
having it be about inspiration 
and discovery is very 

01:06:36.853 --> 01:06:38.853
much a part of why you are here.
So thank you and thank you.

01:06:40.941 --> 01:06:43.425
And thank you to those of you 
watching on the live stream. We 

01:06:43.426 --> 01:06:45.426
love it when our audience gets 
extended.

01:06:46.478 --> 01:06:48.478
So thanks to all of you.

01:06:49.488 --> 01:06:49.968
And I've got a couple of things 
that I need to say to those of 

01:06:49.969 --> 01:06:52.245
you in the room before you head 
out. So..

01:06:55.465 --> 01:06:57.465
.
