ELLIE POWERS: OK, so
as Chris mentioned,

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.466
I'm going to talk
to you about how

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.620
to build your app for success.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.680
And one of the
things that we find

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.810
is most associated with a high
level of success on Google Play

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.520
is high quality.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.044
Users definitely appreciate
high quality apps.

00:00:16.044 --> 00:00:18.460
And we want to make sure that
you have all the information

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.960
that you need to make
sure that your apps meet

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.249
this high-quality bar.

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.540
So one of the reasons that
I'm most excited about being

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.360
a product manager on
Google Play is that today,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.330
if you have an
idea or a business

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.910
that you want to get out
into the world, the best way

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.960
to do that is
through mobile apps,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.470
and also through Google Play,
because we have the largest

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.180
global reach.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.930
So let's talk a little
bit more about what

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.210
quality means for mobile apps.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.460
We're going to walk through
each stage of the software

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.880
development cycle, from
designing your app,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.296
to developing your app,
to distributing your app.

00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:51.670
And we're going
to talk about how

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.135
you can bring out the
high level of quality

00:00:54.135 --> 00:00:56.280
at each of these stages.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.220
So first off, we're going
to start with design.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.370
And one thing to know
about Google Play

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.660
is that users have
really been trained

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.470
and evolved to appreciate high
quality, beautiful design.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.810
Earlier this year, with
the launch of Lollipop,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.530
we announced this new concept,
which Chris talked about,

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.900
which we call material design.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.100
Now the idea here
is it represents

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.910
a new design paradigm
that helps you

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.960
understand how to build
excellent experiences

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.770
from device to device.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.580
So if you have a
certain experience

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.180
that you want to have work
great across your website

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.950
and your different mobile apps
across different platforms,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.790
you can use material
design to help

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.070
give them a consistent
look, feel, and experience.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.480
Also if a user has
an Android L device,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.440
this is essential to
fitting in and making

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.610
your app feel that it really
belongs on this device.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.510
So first, before we
get into the details,

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.468
we're going to talk about
the different reasons

00:01:53.468 --> 00:01:56.110
why material design is
helpful and why you want

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.830
to consider it for your app.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.680
So first of all,
material design is

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.650
all about bright
and bold colors,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.110
which can be very useful in
expressing your company's

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.020
brand.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.850
Second, it's a great
way to delight users.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.070
Users want to feel
that the app really

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.780
fits in with the other apps
in their Android device,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.910
and material design
helps you do that.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.610
It also helps you create strong
cross platform or strong device

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.520
experiences where the user
will have a similar experience

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.000
whether they're on a phone,
a tablet, TV, and so on.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.830
And finally, this represents
an opportunity for your apps

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.090
to get discovered.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.481
Many developers have already
adopted material design.

00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:32.980
And we're featuring
some of the best

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.970
examples in our beautiful
design collection.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.670
Eventually, if you want your app
to get featured on Google Play,

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.191
you'll need to make sure that
it includes material design as

00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:41.690
well.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.530
So right now, it's a good
chance to get started early.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.540
Here's an example of how the
Gmail team has redesigned

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.040
the Gmail app to adopt the
principles of material design.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.240
Let's take a look at
what they've done here.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.490
So on the left is the old
version and on the right

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.810
is the new version.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.650
You can see that the new
version looks much cleaner.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.140
They've given a lot
more white space,

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.860
so it doesn't feel as
heavy or cluttered.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.420
They've added a bright color.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.040
You can see the red
bar across the top.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.150
And also the red button on
the lower right-hand corner

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.670
means that the message
composition button is very easy

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.940
to find and jumps out.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.410
It just looks great too and
feel a lot nicer to use.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.060
Second, this is an example
of how the Google Play Music

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.780
app has been redesigned.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.590
Again here, you'll notice
the bright use of color,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.810
drawing from each of
the different album art,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.660
emphasizing one of the most
prominent colors there.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.640
It looks really clean and nice.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.500
And also when you
interact with the app,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.060
you can see the use
of motion really

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.290
helps make the user understand
the different transitions

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.980
as they browse the
different music

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.860
collections on their tablet.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.160
And here we have the
Play Store as well.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.730
We recently updated the
Play Store earlier this year

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.000
to take advantage
of material design.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.630
So if you compare
again the old version

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.642
on the left with the new
version on the right,

00:03:58.642 --> 00:04:00.600
you can see that we've
added a beautiful banner

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.560
graphic across the
top, which really

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.070
gives the users a great
view and a beautiful imprint

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.260
of your brand.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.980
Secondly, we've added a
short text description

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.750
across the bottom to help users
get a quick summary of what

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.780
your app does.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.740
And in the middle, we're using
bright colors and bold icons

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.300
to show the user several
reasons why to install your app.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.790
So now we're going to talk
about the four different design

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.010
principles behind
material design--

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.590
tangible surfaces, meaningful
and delightful motion,

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.690
bold and beautiful aesthetics,
and adaptive design.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.890
So first, tangible surfaces.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.140
So again here the
idea is about creating

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.730
this idea of how physical
objects would react

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.220
in the physical world
and trying to express it

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.940
in a computer interface.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.780
So you can have areas
of light and shadow.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.400
You can also use the layout
to separate the content

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.170
from the navigation.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.410
And interactions
should be given cues.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.320
So if you have a
user interface, you

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.100
can use visual cues
to let the user know

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.010
how the app will respond
in response to their touch.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.900
Second, we have the bold
and beautiful aesthetics.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.950
So this can be use of beautiful
typography, whatever typography

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.916
fits your brand,
bold use of color,

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.290
and we also put
a lot of emphasis

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.280
on content and material design.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.650
Here you can see an example
of the Play Music app.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.440
We're using the album
art cross the top.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.280
And we're taking that bright
pink color that comes right

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.250
from the content and using that
to bring a bright highlight

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.490
to the different
buttons on the screen.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.984
We also like to
use geometric icons

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:37.650
that help give a consistent look
and feel between different apps

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.310
in the user's device.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.910
Next up is my favorite, which
is meaningful and delightful

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:43.932
motion.

00:05:43.932 --> 00:05:46.140
Here the idea is that you
want the app to really feel

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.060
like it's responding
to the user's touch.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.080
So you don't want
to distract the user

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.840
by having too much motion, but
you do use this as a great way

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.770
to make your apps feel much more
fun and much more interactive.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.715
Finally, we have
adaptive design.

00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:05.340
The main principle
that we want to have

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.930
here is if a user accesses your
app on their Android device,

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.760
on another mobile
platform, or on the web,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.360
even if they've never used that
platform before, they should

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.630
have an intuitive sense of
how it will work if they've

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.750
used your app somewhere else.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.480
So when they move
from screen to screen,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.690
they'll be able to see
some consistent elements.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.930
And you'll want to think
about exactly which elements

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:26.899
to show on each screen.

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:28.440
But again, the idea
is that they have

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.540
a consistent, underlying
principle that the user can

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.561
learn to understand.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:37.060
So now what we're going to do
is talk about different device

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.330
types and how you
can specifically

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.960
tune your apps to work great
across these different devices.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.460
And the first one we're going
to talk about is tablets.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.330
We've seen that most
apps, especially

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.200
in the global market, are
already designed for tablets.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.830
And this is great to see.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.110
They make sure that users
have a great experience

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.910
and really take advantage
of the larger screen size

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.530
that they have on tablets.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.230
When you upload your app to the
Google Play Developer Console,

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.900
we actually scan
it automatically

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.000
to make sure that it meets some
basic requirements to ensure

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.210
that users will have a
good experience on tablets.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.460
You can upload screenshots
of how your app will look

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.820
on 7-inch and 10-inch devices.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.830
And if you want to make
sure that your app has

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.004
maximum visibility and
discoverability on the Play

00:07:20.004 --> 00:07:21.670
Store and tablets,
you need to make sure

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.400
that you do meet the design
for tablets guidelines.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.675
And if you go to
developer.android.com--

00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:29.050
that's a website you're going
to hear about a lot today--

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.190
we have specific guidelines
to help you understand

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.540
what makes a great tablet app.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.720
Next up we have Android Wear.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.810
This is getting
a lot of interest

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.130
in terms of smart watch usage.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.110
And you actually have
three different ways

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.800
of how you can implement
an Android Wear app.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.300
We're going to talk about each
of your different options one

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.180
by one.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.850
So the most basic
version is if your app

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.970
is using our standard
notifications platform,

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.951
notifications are
just going to work.

00:07:56.951 --> 00:07:58.700
But you will want to
make sure you try it,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.020
so you may want to try
getting an Android Wear device

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.270
and make sure that the
notifications are showing up

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.990
the way you want them to.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.520
Secondly, if you're just getting
started with Android Wear

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.978
and you want to do
something that's

00:08:08.978 --> 00:08:11.650
going to be easy and quick,
with as little as about

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.430
10 lines of code, you can
create enhanced notifications.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.730
And this can help you reformat
your notifications using things

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.830
like pages or stacking.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.230
And you can even
integrate voice replies.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.550
We've seen a lot of
interest in Android Wear.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.050
And users are really excited
about things, especially

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.210
like messaging
apps, for example,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.400
where it can be pretty easy
to show the new message

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.669
notification on the
watch, and then the user

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:38.870
can respond directly from their
watch using the voice reply.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.059
Now if you want to build a
full-blown Android Wear app,

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:43.549
that's fantastic.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.380
So I wanted to share
a couple of tips

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.480
with you that we've seen
from some of our partners

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.520
who have gotten started
early with Android Wear.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.350
So those of you who have
built software before

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.710
may notice that the
graph on the left

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.740
seems like what you hope at
the beginning of the project.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.280
You think, I'll just need
a small amount of time

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.314
from design, I'll spend most
of my time building the app,

00:09:04.314 --> 00:09:05.980
and maybe I'll need
a little bit of time

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.130
at the end for debugging.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.700
But what actually
ends up happening

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.210
is you need more design
time than you expected,

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.750
you still have to build the
app, but then at the end,

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.067
you need a lot more debugging
than you had expected.

00:09:18.067 --> 00:09:19.650
Now, one thing that's
really important

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.390
when you think about
an Android Wear app

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.260
is that this type of
interaction is just

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.740
so different from
mobile apps or web pages

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.242
that you've done in the past.

00:09:27.242 --> 00:09:28.700
So to make the best
experience, you

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.960
need to make sure that you
have some UX iteration time.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.900
So the idea here is that
you build an early prototype

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.350
of your app, you get
an Android Wear device,

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.630
and you try it out at
home or at the office.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.930
And then you say, well, that
doesn't quite work right.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.595
And so you tweak
the interaction.

00:09:43.595 --> 00:09:45.720
If you do this, you're
going to have a great result

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.094
and be very happy
with it, but it

00:09:47.094 --> 00:09:50.530
does take a little bit of
extra work at the beginning.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.440
Next up we have Android TV.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.140
This is a great way to get
in users' living rooms.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.580
We have the Nexus Player
device that's already launched.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.470
And there's going to be a
lot more interest and devices

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.374
coming up in the future.

00:10:03.374 --> 00:10:04.790
So there are three
principles here

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.120
that you want to keep in mind
when you're building for a TV.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.190
So again the idea here is that
the TV in your living room

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.340
is not like a phone
or a desktop computer.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.890
The user just wants
to get in very quickly

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.570
and get into their content.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.630
So you don't want to put a lot
of interface between the user

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.400
and the television program or
the game that they want to use.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.900
Also, you need to have a
much simpler interaction.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.020
The user is going to be using
a remote control or a game

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.700
controller rather
than a touch screen,

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.949
so you'll need to do some
special testing to make sure

00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:39.190
that the user can access all
of the different elements

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.650
in the UI.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.210
Also you want the experience
to be very cinematic.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.130
So the idea is the user wants
to sit back on their sofa

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.490
and watch the TV,
and they don't want

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.000
to be doing a lot
of interaction.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.760
So we provide the Leanback
theme to give a consistent style

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.920
to your Android TV apps.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.530
And we definitely recommend
that you use them.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.540
Once you've created a
great Android TV app,

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.002
you can submit it to the
Google Play Developer Console,

00:11:03.002 --> 00:11:04.460
and we'll check it
out to make sure

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.570
that it will provide
that great experience.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.430
OK, so we talked
about how to design

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.849
your apps with quality in mind.

00:11:10.849 --> 00:11:13.140
And next we're going to talk
about how to bring quality

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.420
to the development process.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.174
So Lollipop came out
earlier this year.

00:11:18.174 --> 00:11:19.590
And we're really
excited about it,

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.510
because it has the largest
number of new APIs compared

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.300
to any other Android release
we've had in the past.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.170
This is really exciting.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.130
So I'll tell you about a couple
of the main things that come up

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.660
in Android L. First of all,
we have material design,

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.270
which we've already discussed.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.860
Second, we've made
a lot of changes

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.130
to the notifications platform.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.410
We've also made a lot of
performance optimizations,

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.650
especially around
battery, Bluetooth,

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.450
and network efficiency, so
that if a user's connection is

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.880
flaky or keeps getting
dropped, the device

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.780
will be more responsive.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.404
So let's talk a little bit
more about notifications in L.

00:11:53.404 --> 00:11:54.820
These are some
things that we want

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.194
to make sure that
you're aware of

00:11:56.194 --> 00:11:58.006
and you check your
applications for.

00:11:58.006 --> 00:11:59.630
First of all, you'll
notice immediately

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.840
that the background of
notifications has changed.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.430
It used to be that the
background color was black,

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.480
now the background
color is white.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.390
You also get to have a
customized accent color.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.970
So here, in this example,
this alarm clock notification

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:13.920
has a blue circle.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.630
And you can customize the
color there to suit your brand

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.220
and whatever works for you.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.570
Second, you want to add
a notifications flag

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.070
to the manifest,
because in Android L,

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.370
users can go in to
the Settings panel

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.384
and be able to
manage notifications

00:12:28.384 --> 00:12:29.300
for each of your apps.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.920
And you'll want your
app to be there.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.190
Finally, we have a new
feature in Android L

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.690
where notifications can be
shown on the Lock screen.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:39.360
This is a great way
to engage users.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.990
But one thing to
be aware of is you

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.220
want to make sure
that you're presenting

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.686
the right information to a user.

00:12:43.686 --> 00:12:46.060
You wouldn't necessarily want
to show private information

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.310
on the Lock screen.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.770
So we have special
visibility settings

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.800
so that you can set the
private, the public,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.241
and the secret views
for your notifications.

00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:56.740
This will make sure the user
gets the right information when

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.170
they expect it.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.730
Next up, one of
the things that's

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.400
so exciting about
working on Android

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.990
is we really have the
potential to connect everybody

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.070
in the world online using
mobile phone technology.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.164
And this is super
exciting for us.

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:11.830
But here's a couple
tips that developers

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.204
need to keep in
mind if they want

00:13:13.204 --> 00:13:15.770
to have a high-quality app
that gives a quality experience

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.710
in these emerging markets.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.380
The first thing is that data
plans are typically very

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.060
expensive and hard for people
to afford in emerging markets.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.564
So in order to help
people out, you

00:13:25.564 --> 00:13:27.730
want to make sure that you
keep the size of your APK

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.760
as small as possible.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.920
And secondly, don't think
about 3G access or LTE access.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.050
Think about your user having
only 2G access and probably not

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.189
Wi-Fi access at all.

00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:41.730
You'll want to make sure that
you do a good amount of testing

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.070
to make sure that your app
will be very responsive

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.060
and give the user
a clear experience,

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.680
even if the network
disconnects frequently or has

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.200
very slow access.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.830
Finally, another area
that's important to test

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:55.930
is memory usage.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.890
Typically these devices
in emerging markets

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.955
have a lower memory
than we are used to.

00:14:00.955 --> 00:14:03.330
So you'll want to make sure
that you use different memory

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.329
testing tools to make
sure that the app is still

00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:07.450
going to work great.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.550
Android Studio Beta
is something that

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.150
is providing a lot of
these tools to do testing.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.387
For example, it provides
this memory monitor tool

00:14:15.387 --> 00:14:17.470
that can be really helpful
for that memory testing

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.880
that we just talked about.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.330
It's also really
helpful in terms

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.280
of creating new device
type apps, so apps

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.590
for Android Wear or Android TV.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.240
It also helps add a lot
of the Google services

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.050
that users in the
global market expect.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:35.170
And it provides a lot of tools
to look at performance issues,

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.820
usability issues,
version compatibility,

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.749
and typical problems that
developers could run into.

00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:43.290
So you want to make sure that
you do all this testing earlier

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.482
before you've launched your app.

00:14:46.482 --> 00:14:48.440
For many of us, when
we're launching a new game

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.800
or application, we have
a really great idea,

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.960
but we don't have a big
budget to be able to build

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.970
a serious backend.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.110
And that's where the Google
Cloud Platform comes in.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.700
So it helps you launch quickly.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.440
And then if your
app or game starts

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.300
to take off and gain
a lot of traction,

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.840
it's easier to get more quota
and be able to keep scaling

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.740
your game without
doing a lot of work.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.860
It offers this great,
fast performance that

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.880
is typical of Google networks.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.250
And it also offers
global access.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.670
So this is a great
thing if you're

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.990
having an application
available on the global market

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:24.790
to make sure that users can
access this backend service

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.050
near where they are.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.810
And to help you
get started, we're

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.150
offering something called
the Mobile Starter Kit.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.380
So this is a special
offering from Google

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.320
to make the Google Cloud
Platform easier to afford

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.430
and easier to set up.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:40.970
So Google Play
services is something

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.810
that's really exciting.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.400
This is a way to give
access to all the Google

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.670
services on the user's device.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.380
So this is automatically
kept up to date.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.210
But with Google, you
don't have to put

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.910
any SDK into your app itself.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.840
And we've launched several
new features in it this year.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.820
For example,
activity recognition

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.890
is a special API that
allows you to see

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:05.300
if users are running, walking,
or doing other activities.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.675
And then there's
also Cloud Save,

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:08.591
which is a great feature,
especially if you're

00:16:08.591 --> 00:16:10.660
building a game and you
want to sync the user

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.590
state to the cloud.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.700
It even works and
synchronizes well,

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.640
even if the user goes
offline or online.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.666
OK, so we talked about
design and development.

00:16:21.666 --> 00:16:24.040
And now we're going to talk
about all the different tools

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.030
that Google Play can use to help
you improve your app's quality

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:30.077
as you distribute it globally.

00:16:30.077 --> 00:16:32.160
So we mentioned earlier
that the Google Play Store

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.950
has been updated to take
advantage of the new material

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:36.957
design look.

00:16:36.957 --> 00:16:39.290
So if you're a developer,
there's a couple of key things

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.956
that you need to know
about to make sure

00:16:40.956 --> 00:16:43.280
that this page is going to
look really great for you.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.750
One of them is that
you need to make sure

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.166
that you've uploaded a large
banner graphic, which will be

00:16:47.166 --> 00:16:48.711
shown at the top of the screen.

00:16:48.711 --> 00:16:51.210
You can see here it's the one
with the dark blue background.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.300
And this is a new
graphic that not everyone

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.830
will have uploaded before.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.880
Secondly, we also have
a short text summary

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.645
at the bottom of each page.

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:03.020
So you'll need to make sure
that you've entered that text

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:03.926
description as well.

00:17:03.926 --> 00:17:05.550
And this gives the
user a quick summary

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.210
to understand what the app does.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.160
OK.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.359
Hello.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.359
Are we stuck?

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:17.150
There we go.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.260
Great.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.680
So user ratings are
something that's

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.940
really important on Google Play.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.599
Users frequently
use ratings when

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.500
they're comparing
multiple apps and trying

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.530
to decide which one to install.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.750
And so one thing our most
successful developers

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.870
tell us is that they
want to understand how

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:35.670
they can improve their reviews.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.370
And they put a lot of time
into reading those reviews,

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.930
understanding the
complaints that users have,

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.380
reading user requests
for new features,

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.830
and then a special feature
that we have on Google Play

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.720
is that you can actually post
replies to your user reviews.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.720
So if a user says,
hey, I have this bug,

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.280
the app crashes for me, maybe
it would be nice if you say,

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.780
thanks, we'll look
into the problem.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.405
And then after you've fixed it,
you can reply again to the user

00:17:59.405 --> 00:18:01.810
and say, hey, we've
actually fixed that bug.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:05.200
Please check it and let us
know if it's working for you.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.690
And developers have seen
great response from users.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.530
Users are usually very happy
to have this excellent customer

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:11.390
service.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.350
And because your replies
are posted publicly,

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.835
if you respond to a review,
other users going to the store

00:18:16.835 --> 00:18:18.210
and looking at
your app will say,

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.835
wow, this company
is very responsive.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.840
OK, so one of the
most powerful tools

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.080
that we have in Google Play
is this idea of beta testing

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.800
and staged rollouts.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.600
So we've seen over 80,000
apps use beta testing

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.622
and staged rollouts
to increase quality.

00:18:36.622 --> 00:18:38.330
And we're seeing more
and more every day.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.890
In fact, the majority of
our top apps on the store

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.310
use beta testing and staged
rollouts to increase quality.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.390
And we see that
the average rating

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.500
for apps who have
done beta testing

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.910
is much higher than the average.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.010
So let's talk about what each of
these different concepts mean.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.920
So the whole idea
behind beta testing

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.910
is that you can do a
private test of your app.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.860
So the idea is here, you
can create a Google group

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.810
or a Google+ community, and
users can opt in to view

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.500
the beta software.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.090
You also get two
different versions

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.560
that you can test
simultaneously.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.450
We call one alpha, and
one of them is beta.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:22.950
And to prevent any leaking of
features or people sharing bugs

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.350
or things like that, we actually
make it so that those users

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.000
in the alpha and the beta
cannot actually leave reviews.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.680
So this means if you're
testing some early software

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.730
with a small group
of beta testers,

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.930
this won't have any negative
impact on your reviews.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.590
And later, you're actually
able to compare the statistics.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:45.750
So for example, you can see how
different metrics like crashes

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.130
vary between your alpha
and beta versions.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.540
Now, once you've tested
it with a small group

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.490
and you're ready to roll
out to a larger population,

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.050
you can use staged rollouts.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.050
So the idea here is that
when you release an update

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.790
to your app, you
should be pretty sure

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.039
that it's going to work great.

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:04.720
But occasionally, we
all have that worry

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.500
that what if there's a bug?

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.110
So staged rollouts lets
you put the new version out

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.950
to a small group of users.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.840
And so if you do find that
there is an issue early on,

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.750
like let's say users start
leaving bad reviews saying

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.250
that they don't
like the new version

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.220
or you notice a high
rate of crashing,

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.110
you can just stop the rollout
right there, fix the bug,

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.250
and then move on.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:28.380
So it keeps bugs from
impacting your whole user base.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.550
One common thing that
developers ask me a lot

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.600
is, tell me what I
should do on my app next.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.420
And so to try to make this
advice as scalable as possible,

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.580
we have a new area that we call
optimization tips and alerts.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.850
So what you decide to work on
next can be influenced by this.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.700
So if we notice any
opportunities for your app

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.390
to improve, we'll give
you an optimization tip.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:53.140
So an example of
this might be maybe

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.470
you have an app with a lot of
installs in, let's say, Russia,

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:58.910
but your app is not
translated into Russian.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:00.150
We'll actually let you know.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.130
And then it's easy to
purchase a translation

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.130
into that new language.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.710
And this can be a great way
to make sure that you haven't

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.410
missed any opportunities.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:10.280
Similarly, if we notice a
problem with your application,

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.690
we'll also let you know.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:14.090
So let's say that you publish
a new version of your app,

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.200
and we notice that your
user reviews are much

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.247
lower than your older versions.

00:21:19.247 --> 00:21:21.080
So we'll actually give
you an alert and say,

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:21.996
you should check this.

00:21:21.996 --> 00:21:23.430
Maybe there's a problem.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.640
You can also sign up to receive
emails so that you find out

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.880
about these alerts faster.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.620
So once you understand how
your app is doing overall,

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.030
you want to
understand what users

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.690
are doing inside your app.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.740
And the easiest way to do
that is Google Analytics.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.520
Google Analytics is
also very helpful,

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.460
because it works cross platform.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.090
You may have an Android
app, but maybe also

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.840
apps on other platforms,
and maybe a website as well.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.130
And Google Analytics
lets you measure users

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.090
across all of these platforms.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:58.340
So with just three
easy lines of code,

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.570
you can add Google
Analytics to your app.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:04.480
And from there, you can get a
lot of detailed information.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.070
So one example of
what you can do

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.850
once you've integrated
Google Analytics

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.080
is Google Tag Manager.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.120
So once you understand what
users do inside your app,

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.330
you probably want to
make little tweaks to it.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.290
And so Google Tag
Manager actually

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.120
lets you run experiments.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.740
So for example, I could
have two versions of my app.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.730
Maybe in one case, the
character in the game is a dog

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.610
and in another case, maybe the
character in the game is a cat.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.810
And I could do a test
to see whether users

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.680
like cats or dogs better.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.360
And then if I say I want to
maximize a certain metric,

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.700
like let's say revenue or
time spent in the game,

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.090
then the metric I
choose will be used

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.350
to determine whether the
cat or the dog character

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.260
is the winner.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.450
And over time, it will
switch more and more people

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:50.970
over to the version that gives
the result that I prefer.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.840
A common question
that users ask a lot

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.562
is, I would like to know how
people find my application.

00:22:56.562 --> 00:22:58.020
And one of the best
ways to do this

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.219
is the Google Play
Referral Flow Report.

00:23:00.219 --> 00:23:01.760
And this is a unique
feature that you

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.690
can get if you're using
Google Analytics in your app.

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.970
This allows you to track the
effectiveness of each campaign

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.700
that you run on Google Play.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.150
So for every single
campaign that you have,

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.740
you can see how many users view
your app in the Play Store,

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.720
how many install your app,
and how many launch your app.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.350
And this allows you to
track that conversion funnel

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:24.280
and understand which campaigns
perform best so that you can

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.570
optimize your marketing
budget and invest more

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.960
in the campaigns that work well.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.280
OK, so another
sophisticated thing

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.890
that Google Analytics
can do for you

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.350
is allow you to define
the segments of your users

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:40.420
that are most valuable, and
then track them over time

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.580
and compare them to
the average user.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.260
So for example, I
can say that I'm

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:48.310
very interested in users who
have gotten to level seven

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.720
in my game, have
spent more than $5,

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.750
and installed my
application in December.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.410
And I can track that
group of users over time

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.380
and see how they respond to
different changes in the app

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.530
or to see how many of them
stay engaged in the long term.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.580
We've seen a lot of
developers on Google Play

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.880
be able to grow their revenue
into significant businesses,

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.220
and so we've given much
more advanced reporting

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.677
around revenue.

00:24:13.677 --> 00:24:15.510
So in addition to showing
you total revenue,

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.750
we also show the average
revenue per paying

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:21.320
user, the number of
buyers, and also allow

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:25.245
you to see breakdowns by country
of how much different revenue

00:24:25.245 --> 00:24:26.470
you're making in each market.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.136
And this can be really
helpful as you're

00:24:28.136 --> 00:24:30.130
distributing your apps
and games globally

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.400
and you want to understand
the financial performance

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.080
of each market.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.380
One common request that
we had from developers,

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.050
especially those who have
a large number of apps

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:43.840
or a large number of languages,
is that updating your apps

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.990
was getting pretty
time consuming.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.380
So if you're spending a
lot of time doing updates,

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.410
especially if you have a lot of
apps or a lot of translations

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.520
into different languages,
the developer publishing API

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.300
may be helpful for you.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.200
So it's able to
upload your APKs,

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.640
you can manage alpha
and beta testing,

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.720
you can upload your
localized graphics and text,

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.714
and it can be very
helpful to make sure

00:25:06.714 --> 00:25:09.130
that you don't make any mistakes
in the publishing process

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.730
and that you can spend more time
building great apps and games

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.240
rather than uploading them.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.170
OK, so today we talked about
how to incorporate quality

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:22.250
at every stage of making
a great app or game,

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.250
so in the design process,
the development process,

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:27.340
and the distribution process.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.340
As you all learn much
more about Google Play,

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.990
I definitely encourage you to
check out the different tools

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:34.430
that we have available,
think about including

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.000
material design in your app,
and listening to your user

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.990
feedback.

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.620
Thank you.
