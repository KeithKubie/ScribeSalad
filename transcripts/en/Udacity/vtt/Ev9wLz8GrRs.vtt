00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We've seen errors appearing on different time scales.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The LTE, the local truncation error, that happens at each time step.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There is one more time scale that when they look into mainly what happens in the long run,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
what happens if this system runs for 1,000 years, 10,000 years for the age of the universe,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is this solution going to explode or to implode in the long run or will it stick close to the exact solution.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The GTE for one final time does not tell us much about that form.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
One way of looking at the long-term error is for instance to look at energy.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
If the systems is such that energy should be conserved, we can look at the long-term evolution

00:00:43.000 --> 09:59:59.000
of energy to learn whether there is an issue.
