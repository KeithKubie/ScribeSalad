00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.210
The function f of x is graphed.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.030
What is its domain?

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.810
So the way it's graphed
right over here,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.920
we could assume that this
is the entire function

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.040
definition for f of x.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.670
So for example, if
we say, well, what

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.770
does f of x equal when x
is equal to negative 9?

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:15.689
Well, we go up here.

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:16.980
We don't see it's graphed here.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.140
It's not defined for x
equals negative 9 or x equals

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.410
negative 8 and 1/2 or
x equals negative 8.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.990
It's not defined for
any of these values.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.410
It only starts getting defined
at x equals negative 6.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.950
At x equals negative 6,
f of x is equal to 5.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.880
And then it keeps
getting defined. f of x

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.470
is defined for x all
the way from x equals

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.550
negative 6 all the
way to x equals 7.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.190
When x equals 7, f
of x is equal to 5.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.650
You can take any x value
between negative 6,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.280
including negative
6, and positive 7,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.300
including positive
7, and you just

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.200
have to see-- you
just have to move up

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.060
above that number,
wherever you are,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.590
to find out what the value of
the function is at that point.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.440
So the domain of this
function definition?

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.445
Well, f of x is
defined for any x that

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:08.650
is greater than or
equal to negative 6.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.830
Or we could say negative 6
is less than or equal to x,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.760
which is less than
or equal to 7.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.810
If x satisfies this
condition right over here,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.400
the function is defined.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.460
So that's its domain.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.680
So let's check our answer.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.550
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.180
The function f of x is graphed.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.440
What is its domain?

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.340
Well, exact similar argument.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.240
This function is not defined
for x is negative 9, negative 8,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.470
all the way down or all the way
up I should say to negative 1.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.030
At negative 1, it
starts getting defined.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.300
f of negative 1 is negative 5.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.410
So it's defined for negative
1 is less than or equal to x.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.390
And it's defined all the
way up to x equals 7,

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.190
including x equals 7.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.850
So this right over
here, negative 1

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.230
is less than or equal to x
is less than or equal to 7,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.240
the function is
defined for any x that

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.350
satisfies this double
inequality right over here.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.750
Let's do a few more.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.370
The function f of x is graphed.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.350
What is its range?

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.330
So now, we're not
thinking about the x's

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.490
for which this
function is defined.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.400
We're thinking about
the set of y values.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.894
Where do all of the
y values fall into?

00:02:17.894 --> 00:02:18.560
Well, let's see.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.540
The lowest possible y value
or the lowest possible value

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.770
of f of x that we get
here looks like it's 0.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.230
The function never goes below 0.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.300
So f of x-- so 0 is less
than or equal to f of x.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.070
It does equal 0 right over
here. f of negative 4 is 0.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.770
And then the highest y
value or the highest value

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.780
that f of x obtains in this
function definition is 8.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.430
f of 7 is 8.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.150
It never gets above 8, but it
does equal 8 right over here

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.820
when x is equal to 7.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.010
So 0 is less than f of x, which
is less than or equal to 8.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.227
So that's its range.

00:02:57.227 --> 00:02:58.060
Let's do a few more.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.740
This is kind of fun.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.310
The function f of x is graphed.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.400
What is its domain?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.020
So once again, this function
is defined for negative 2.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.660
Negative 2 is less than or
equal to x, which is less than

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.190
or equal to 5.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.340
If you give me an x anywhere
in between negative 2 and 5,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.090
I can look at this graph to see
where the function is defined.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.130
f of negative 2 is negative 4.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.074
f of negative 1 is negative 3.

00:03:22.074 --> 00:03:23.490
So on and so forth,
and I can even

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.010
pick the values in
between these integers.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.380
So negative 2 is less than or
equal to x, which is less than

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.120
or equal to 5.
