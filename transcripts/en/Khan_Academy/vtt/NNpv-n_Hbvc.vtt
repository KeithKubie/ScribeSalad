00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.760
- [Instructor] Fay read
an article that said

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.030
26% of Americans can speak
more than one language.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.160
She was curious if this
figure was higher in her city,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.510
so she tested her null hypothesis

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.610
that the proportion in her city

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.090
is the same as all Americans, 26%.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.970
Her alternative hypothesis
is it's actually

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.360
greater than 26%,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.110
where P represents the
proportion of people in her city

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.080
that can speak more than one language.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.150
She found that 40 of 120 people sampled

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.090
could speak more than one language.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.290
So what's going on is here's
the population of her city,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.560
she took a sample,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.400
her sample size is 120.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.840
And then she calculates
her sample proportion

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.840
which is 40 out of 120 and this is going

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.770
to be equal to one-third,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.610
which is approximately equal to 0.33.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.300
And then she calculates the test statistic

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.221
for these results was Z is
approximately equal to 1.83.

00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:57.631
We do this in other videos,

00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:00.470
but just as a reminder
of how she gets this,

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.970
she's really trying to say well how many

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.270
standard deviations above
the assumed proportion,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.070
remember when we're doing
these significance tests

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.250
we're assuming that the
null hypothesis is true

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.500
and then we figure out
well what's the probability

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.430
of getting something at least this extreme

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.710
or this extreme or more?

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.180
And then if it's below a threshold,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.890
then we would reject the null hypothesis

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.854
which would suggest the alternative.

00:01:21.854 --> 00:01:23.960
But that's what this Z statistic is,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.440
is how many standard deviations above

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.190
the assumed proportion is that?

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.178
So the Z statistic,

00:01:29.178 --> 00:01:31.340
and we did this in previous videos,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.330
you would find the
difference between this,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.620
what we got for our sample,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.600
our sample proportion,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.480
and the assumed true proportion.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.301
So 0.33 minus 0.26,

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:45.480
all of that over the standard deviation

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.420
of the sampling distribution
of the sample proportions.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.520
And we've seen that in previous videos.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.700
That is just going to be
the assumed proportion,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.990
so it would be just this.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.610
It would be the assumed
population proportion times one,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.290
minus the assumed population
proportion over N.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.400
In this particular situation,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.460
that would be 0.26 times one,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.324
minus 0.26,

00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:12.440
all of that over our N,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.020
that's our sample size, 120.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.580
And if you calculate this,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.430
this should give us approximately 1.83.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.410
So they did all of that for us.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.840
And they say assuming that

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.810
the necessary conditions are met,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.970
they're talking about
the necessary conditions

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.730
to assume that the sampling distribution

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.800
of the sample proportions
is roughly normal

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.260
and that's the random condition,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.093
the normal condition,

00:02:35.093 --> 00:02:35.960
the independence condition

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.180
that we have talk about in the past.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.122
What is the approximate P value?

00:02:40.122 --> 00:02:42.020
Well this P value,

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.538
this is the P value would be equal to

00:02:45.538 --> 00:02:49.450
the probability of in
a normal distribution,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.440
we're assuming that the
sampling distribution is normal

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.380
'cause we met the necessary conditions,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.300
so in a normal distribution,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.140
what is the probability of getting a Z

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.520
greater than or equal to 1.83?

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.300
So to help us visualize this,

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.220
let's visualize what the sampling

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.360
distribution would look like.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.490
We're assuming it is roughly normal.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.590
The mean of the sampling
distribution right over here

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.200
would be the assumed
population proportion,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.520
so that would be P not.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.590
When we put that little zero there

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.730
that means the assumed population

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.832
proportion from the null hypothesis,

00:03:23.832 --> 00:03:26.590
and that's 0.26,

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.450
and this result that
we got from our sample

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.080
is 1.83 standard deviations above

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.420
the mean of the sampling distribution.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.350
So 1.83.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.600
So that would be 1.83 standard deviations.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.860
And so what we wanna do,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.210
this probability is this area under

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.773
our normal curve right here.

00:03:45.773 --> 00:03:49.170
So now let's get our Z table.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.570
So notice this Z table gives us

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.010
the area to the left of a certain Z value.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.660
We wanted it to the right
of a certain Z value.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.430
But a normal distribution is symmetric.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.360
So instead of saying anything
greater than or equal to

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.750
1.83 standard deviations above the mean,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.940
we could say anything
less than or equal to

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.470
1.83 standard deviations below the means.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.080
So this is negative 1.83.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.700
And so we could look at that

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.710
on this Z table right over here,

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.460
negative 1.8,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.640
negative 1.83 is this right over here.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.350
So 0.0336.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.990
So there we have it.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.040
So this is approximately 0.0336

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.310
or a little over 3% or
a little less than 4%.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.910
And so what Fay would
then do is compare that

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.770
to the significance level that she should

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.760
have set before conducting
this significance test.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.560
And so if her significance
level was say 5%,

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.849
well then that situation
since this is lower

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.534
that that significance level,

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:05.480
she would be able to
reject the null hypothesis.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.190
She would say hey the probability

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.050
of getting this result assuming

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.130
that the null hypothesis is true,

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.880
is below my threshold.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.940
It's quite low.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.670
And so I will reject it

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.450
and it would suggest the alternative.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.550
However, if her
significance level was lower

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.610
than this for whatever reason,

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.830
if she has say a 1% significance level,

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.820
then she would fail to
reject the null hypothesis.
