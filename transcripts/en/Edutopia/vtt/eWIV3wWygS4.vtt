00:00:00.246 --> 00:00:03.896
&gt;&gt;Girl: What does it mean to
make the world a better place?

00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:09.756
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Nice! So those are those
big questions we're focusing on.

00:00:10.046 --> 00:00:14.696
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: For me, being Trauma-Informed
has so much to do with mindset.

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:18.456
Accepting that different people
come into a school setting

00:00:18.716 --> 00:00:21.806
with incredibly varied life experiences.

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:25.566
Some of those life experiences may
be traumatic and the way in which

00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:30.116
that plays out in my particular
classroom could look a number of ways

00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:34.256
and by me having that
lens, it makes it less

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:37.256
about are they doing the right
thing or the wrong thing,

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:40.666
and more about where is
that behavior coming from?

00:00:40.876 --> 00:00:42.056
Why is that happening?

00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:53.046
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: Adverse childhood
experiences like poverty, neglect,

00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:57.206
exposure to violence can bring
about overwhelming stress,

00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:03.166
which can cause negative effects on
the learning brain and on behavior.

00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:08.696
If children have the
experience of adversity.

00:01:09.106 --> 00:01:13.336
They will have uneven development
of these foundational skills,

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:17.846
like self-regulation, and executive
function, or relationship skills.

00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:22.256
These are the children who are at risk
to fall further and further behind.

00:01:22.506 --> 00:01:28.006
But the good news is that there
is a powerful antidote to stress

00:01:28.486 --> 00:01:33.166
and that is the effect of the human
relationship and the presence of trust.

00:01:33.486 --> 00:01:40.386
Schools are an ideal place to produce
many different kinds of relationships

00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:42.676
that are capable of buffering stress.

00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:45.906
Schools, themselves,
can be healing places.

00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:49.656
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: If you're fearful,
if you're anxious, if you're distracted

00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:52.876
about something that's happened
to you, you literally can't learn.

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.506
Your brain shuts down.

00:01:55.266 --> 00:02:01.356
So it's essential to give kids social
and emotional tools that allow students

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:06.166
to recover from the challenges
that they have experienced.

00:02:06.996 --> 00:02:12.776
Take actual classroom time to
work on the building blocks of how

00:02:12.926 --> 00:02:17.646
to perceive your emotions, how to
talk about them, how to get along

00:02:17.646 --> 00:02:21.786
with other people, how to take a moment
and become calm when you need to.

00:02:22.056 --> 00:02:24.666
How to express your needs so
that others can meet them.

00:02:28.316 --> 00:02:32.086
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: When we start to understand
what it takes to be responsive

00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:35.856
to the effects of trauma, we need
to think about the environment,

00:02:36.316 --> 00:02:41.226
about individual services, and we need
to think about the skills and mindsets

00:02:41.226 --> 00:02:45.566
of kids that won't develop as they
should when they're impacted by trauma.

00:02:46.106 --> 00:02:51.196
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: I do a lot of work
around self-awareness and being able

00:02:51.196 --> 00:02:54.126
to name emotions and then
make a choice around those.

00:02:54.546 --> 00:02:59.376
&gt;&gt;Boy: When I get mad, I take deep
breaths and that helps me get more calm.

00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:01.500
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Hm.

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:04.636
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: Many of the
things we think about doing for who kids

00:03:04.636 --> 00:03:08.006
who may have experienced
trauma are good for everybody.

00:03:08.176 --> 00:03:12.416
And everyone will encounter some
kind of adverse circumstance

00:03:12.416 --> 00:03:13.626
at some point in their life.

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:16.436
And for some children,
we're helping them deal

00:03:16.436 --> 00:03:18.106
with what's already happened
in their lives.

00:03:18.106 --> 00:03:20.196
For others, we're preparing them to deal

00:03:20.196 --> 00:03:21.976
with the challenges later
in their lives.

00:03:21.976 --> 00:03:26.176
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: If you can hear my
voice, say, "We are awesome!"

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:27.316
&gt;&gt;Class: [clapping] We are awesome!
