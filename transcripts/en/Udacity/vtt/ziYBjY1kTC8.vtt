00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.780
Here, I made four changes to the code.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.010
I replaced cut with color in the aesthetic wrapper.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.920
I also changed the legend title and the

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.390
plot title, to use the word color. And finally,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.980
I removed the reverse parameter in the legend,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.820
so that the best color would be at the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.940
top of the list in the legend. Now that we've run our code, this is the output.
