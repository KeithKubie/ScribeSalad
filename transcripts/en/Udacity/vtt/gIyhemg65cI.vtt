00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.840
Let's take a bird's eye view of the process we just went through in transforming

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.658
this equation. Since we were aiming for having a perfect square at the end, on

00:00:07.658 --> 00:00:11.552
the right-hand side of the equation involving x and a constant, we knew that the

00:00:11.552 --> 00:00:15.269
initial constant we started out with couldn't be right, since right now, we

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.997
can't factor x squared minus 8 x plus 15 to be in this form. That means, we need

00:00:18.997 --> 00:00:22.701
a different constant attached to the two terms with x in them. So, the first

00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:26.413
step was to get rid of the initial constant we had so that we could have a

00:00:26.413 --> 00:00:30.679
different constant, on the end of the x squared minus 8x. You've figured out the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.640
constant that belonged at the end of those two terms was 16. When we add 16 to

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.758
this, we get the perfect square of a binomial. This process is called completing

00:00:38.758 --> 00:00:42.058
the square, since the constant that we add on over here ends up giving us a

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:45.700
squared expression as our answer. Now, we don't' technically have to move the 15

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.210
away from the right-hand side to do this. But I think that it makes dealing with

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.666
these two terms on their own a little bit easier, since we don't have anything

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:56.125
else to look at on the right side. So, completing a square is a crucial part of

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:59.676
transforming equations of parabolas from standard form, into the form where we

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:03.620
can see the vertex. Now that we understand how to complete this square and the

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.484
importance of that technique in transforming equations from one form to another,

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.900
I'd like you to rewrite the equation y equals x squared plus 5x plus 6 in the

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.677
form that we've been talking about. Now, if your numbers get a little bit messy

00:01:14.677 --> 00:01:18.239
in here, don't worry. That doesn't mean you're doing the problem wrong, that

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:21.672
often happens in math. So, just go with it and then at the end, you can always

00:01:21.672 --> 00:01:25.247
check your answer by plugging in points to the equation that you start with and

00:01:25.247 --> 00:01:28.345
the equation that you end with to make sure that they're the same.
