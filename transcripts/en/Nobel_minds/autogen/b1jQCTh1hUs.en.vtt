oh hello may I speak to George P Smith
 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.619
oh hello may I speak to George P Smith
yes yes he hello my name is Adam Smith

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629
yes yes he hello my name is Adam Smith
 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.360

you know elderly people have a difficult

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640
you know elderly people have a difficult
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.150
you know elderly people have a difficult
time sleeping sometimes so I got up

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160
time sleeping sometimes so I got up
 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.360
time sleeping sometimes so I got up
really early at about 4:00 what was your

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370
really early at about 4:00 what was your
 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.910
really early at about 4:00 what was your
first reaction on hearing the news great

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920
first reaction on hearing the news great
 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.680
first reaction on hearing the news great
surprise actually I thought it was one

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690
surprise actually I thought it was one
 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.560
surprise actually I thought it was one
of these sort of numerous jokes Jim call

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
of these sort of numerous jokes Jim call
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.360
of these sort of numerous jokes Jim call
coming in from Stockholm which is kind

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
coming in from Stockholm which is kind
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.290
coming in from Stockholm which is kind
of like a I mean that's really what I

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300
of like a I mean that's really what I
 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.139
of like a I mean that's really what I
kind of thought it was but there was so

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149
kind of thought it was but there was so
 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.630
kind of thought it was but there was so
much static online I knew it had to be

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640
much static online I knew it had to be
 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.119
much static online I knew it had to be
real it's going we going back to 1985

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129
real it's going we going back to 1985
 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.420
real it's going we going back to 1985
when you had this idea to get viruses

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
when you had this idea to get viruses
 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.179
when you had this idea to get viruses
that infect bacteria to display peptides

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189
that infect bacteria to display peptides
 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.950
that infect bacteria to display peptides
for you did the idea come to you

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
for you did the idea come to you
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.420
for you did the idea come to you
suddenly or was it a long process

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430
suddenly or was it a long process
 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.859
suddenly or was it a long process
certainly not certainly no it was an

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869
certainly not certainly no it was an
 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.539
certainly not certainly no it was an
idea from with many sources because I

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
idea from with many sources because I
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.929
idea from with many sources because I
had all these streams that was very much

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
had all these streams that was very much
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.539
had all these streams that was very much
in my background at the time so so he

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
in my background at the time so so he
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.520
in my background at the time so so he
was definitely not something that just

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
was definitely not something that just
 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.670
was definitely not something that just
popped into my head but so much a case

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680
popped into my head but so much a case
 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.590
popped into my head but so much a case
of being the right person in the right

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
of being the right person in the right
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.719
of being the right person in the right
place at the right time it is very much

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729
place at the right time it is very much
 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.210
place at the right time it is very much
the right person the right time I mean I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220
the right person the right time I mean I
 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.179
the right person the right time I mean I
was trained in immunology but I also

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189
was trained in immunology but I also
 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.359
was trained in immunology but I also
knew a lot about this stage of the stage

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
knew a lot about this stage of the stage
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.679
knew a lot about this stage of the stage
and and and in in classical you know

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689
and and and in in classical you know
 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.050

really don't know which mutation is
 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.690
really don't know which mutation is
going to be though the one that you know

were you surprised by the rapidity with

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340
were you surprised by the rapidity with
 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.229
were you surprised by the rapidity with
which it was all taken up and you know

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239
which it was all taken up and you know
 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.780
which it was all taken up and you know
it was as I say all those precedents

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790
it was as I say all those precedents
 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.569
it was as I say all those precedents
that were in the air so no I wasn't that

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579
that were in the air so no I wasn't that
 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.089
that were in the air so no I wasn't that
surprised actually and I certainly

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099
surprised actually and I certainly
 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.569
surprised actually and I certainly
wasn't surprised I mean another I'm

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579
wasn't surprised I mean another I'm

Greg winter so he came out of this
Cambridge group that had been as they

were calling a cloning cloning the
immune system at the time so that was

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530
immune system at the time so that was
 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.390
immune system at the time so that was
that was very similar very allied line

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400
that was very similar very allied line
 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.720
that was very similar very allied line
of reasoning line line of research and I

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730
of reasoning line line of research and I
 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.849
of reasoning line line of research and I
was very aware of that too

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859
was very aware of that too
 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.440
was very aware of that too
so I actually wasn't surprised that it

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450
so I actually wasn't surprised that it
 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.259
so I actually wasn't surprised that it
that people would catch on to it because

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269
that people would catch on to it because
 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.420
that people would catch on to it because
it was something that was it was a way

it was something that was it was a way

of thinking is very much in the air at

well that's a good question I don't I

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239
well that's a good question I don't I
 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.069
well that's a good question I don't I
don't think that I thought certainly in

those terms although I was very much

those terms although I was very much
interested in anybody's and very much

and our single polypeptide chains at
 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.729
and our single polypeptide chains at
that point it became quite obvious that

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739
that point it became quite obvious that
 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.990
that point it became quite obvious that
well I won't say quite obviously but

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000
well I won't say quite obviously but
 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.869
well I won't say quite obviously but
it's it seemed very plausible but not

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879
it's it seemed very plausible but not
 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.039
it's it seemed very plausible but not
just small peptides but my larger folded
