00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:02.277
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.277 --> 00:00:04.496
is think about under which conditions

00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:08.856
does the sampling distribution
of the sample portions,

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:11.617
in which situations does
it look roughly normal,

00:00:11.617 --> 00:00:16.576
and under which situations
does it look skewed right

00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:18.568
so does it look something like this,

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:22.335
and under which situations
does it look skewed left

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:24.688
maybe something like that.

00:00:24.688 --> 00:00:26.846
And the conditions that
we're going to talk about,

00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:28.811
and this is a rough rule of thumb,

00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:31.071
that if we take our sample size

00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:34.553
and we multiply it by
the population proportion

00:00:34.553 --> 00:00:38.720
that we care about and that
is greater than or equal to 10

00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:42.038
and if we take the sample size

00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:45.617
and we multiply it times one
minus the population proportion

00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:48.475
and that also is greater
than or equal to 10,

00:00:48.475 --> 00:00:49.877
if both of these are true,

00:00:49.877 --> 00:00:50.917
the rule of thumb tells us

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:55.036
that this is going to be
approximately normal in shape,

00:00:55.036 --> 00:00:58.249
the sampling distribution
of the sample proportions.

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.416
So with that in our minds,
let's do some examples here.

00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:06.349
So this first example says,

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:08.211
Emiliana runs a restaurant

00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:12.588
that receives a shipment
of 50 tangerines every day.

00:01:12.588 --> 00:01:14.303
According to the supplier,

00:01:14.303 --> 00:01:17.459
approximately 12% of the population

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:20.488
of these tangerines is overripe.

00:01:20.488 --> 00:01:23.177
Suppose that Emiliana calculates

00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:26.282
the daily proportion
of overripe tangerines

00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:28.692
in her sample of 50.

00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:31.748
We can assume the supplier's claim is true

00:01:31.748 --> 00:01:35.915
and that the tangerines each
day represent a random sample.

00:01:36.878 --> 00:01:40.884
What will be the shape of
the sampling distribution,

00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:43.796
what will be the shape of
the sampling distribution

00:01:43.796 --> 00:01:47.734
of the daily proportions
of overripe tangerines?

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:50.345
Pause this video, think about
what we just talked about

00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:52.945
and see if you can answer this.

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:54.850
All right, so right over here,

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.810
we're getting daily
samples of 50 tangerines.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.364
So for this particular example,

00:02:00.364 --> 00:02:02.031
our n is equal to 50

00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:06.541
and our population proportion,

00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:10.708
the proportion that is
overripe is 12% so p is 0.12.

00:02:12.838 --> 00:02:15.758
So if we take n times p, what do we get?

00:02:15.758 --> 00:02:18.175
NP is equal to 50 times 0.12,

00:02:20.415 --> 00:02:21.985
well 100 times this would be 12

00:02:21.985 --> 00:02:24.829
so 50 times this is
going to be equal to six

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.710
and this is less than or equal to 10.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.625
So this immediately violates
this first condition

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:33.632
and so we know that we're
not going to be dealing

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:36.062
with a normal distribution.

00:02:36.062 --> 00:02:39.089
And so the question is, how
is it going to be skewed?

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:41.102
And the key realization is remember,

00:02:41.102 --> 00:02:43.378
the mean of the sample proportions

00:02:43.378 --> 00:02:46.481
or the sampling distribution
of the sample proportions

00:02:46.481 --> 00:02:48.008
or the mean of the sampling distribution

00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:49.720
of the daily proportions

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.520
that that's going to be the same thing

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.059
as our population proportion
so the mean is going to be 12%.

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:57.331
So if I were to draw it,

00:02:57.331 --> 00:02:59.542
let me see if I were to
draw it right over here

00:02:59.542 --> 00:03:03.411
where this is 50% and this is 100%,

00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:06.102
our mean is gonna be
right over here at 12%

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:09.099
and so you're gonna have
it really high over there

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.791
and then it's gonna be
skewed to the right.

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.672
You're gonna have a big long tail.

00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:16.210
So this is going to be
skewed to the right.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.293
Let's do another example.

00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:22.390
So here we're told, according
to a Nielsen survey,

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.789
radio reaches 88% of children each week.

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.668
Suppose we took weekly random samples

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:34.189
of n equals 125 children
from this population

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.110
and computed the proportion of children

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.733
in each sample whom radio reaches.

00:03:38.733 --> 00:03:41.039
What will be the shape of
the sampling distribution

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:43.904
of the proportions of
children the radio reaches?

00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:45.063
Once again, pause this video

00:03:45.063 --> 00:03:47.823
and see if you can figure it out.

00:03:47.823 --> 00:03:51.120
All right, well let's just
figure out what n and p are.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.766
Our sample size here n is equal to 125

00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:56.910
and our population proportion

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.959
of the proportion of children

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.126
that are reached each week
by radio is 88% so p is 0.88.

00:04:05.177 --> 00:04:09.344
So now let's calculate np
so n is 125 times p is 0.88

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.179
and is this going to be
greater than or equal to 10.

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:17.395
Well, we don't even have
to calculate this exactly.

00:04:17.395 --> 00:04:19.978
This is almost 90% of 125.

00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:22.700
This is actually going to be over 100

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.482
so it for sure is going
to be greater than 10

00:04:25.482 --> 00:04:27.415
so we meet this first condition.

00:04:27.415 --> 00:04:29.151
But what about the second condition?

00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:32.234
We could take n 125 times one minus p

00:04:33.466 --> 00:04:35.216
so this is times 0.12

00:04:36.897 --> 00:04:39.147
so this is 12% of 125.

00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:44.528
Well, even 10% of 125 would be 12.5

00:04:44.528 --> 00:04:48.288
so 12% is for sure going
to be greater than that

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.530
so this too is going
to be greater than 10.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.521
I didn't even have to calculate it.

00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:52.873
I could just estimate it

00:04:52.873 --> 00:04:55.136
and so we meet that second condition.

00:04:55.136 --> 00:04:58.408
So even though our population
proportion is quite high,

00:04:58.408 --> 00:05:00.098
it's quite close to one here,

00:05:00.098 --> 00:05:03.098
because our sample size is so large,

00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:06.509
it still will be roughly normal

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.892
and one way to get the
intuition for that is

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:12.144
so this is a proportion of zero,

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:15.381
let's say this is 50% and this is 100%,

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:18.470
so our mean right over
here is gonna be 0.88

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.902
for our sampling distribution
of the sample proportions.

00:05:21.902 --> 00:05:24.235
If we had a low sample size,

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:27.839
then our standard deviation
would be quite large

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:29.162
and so then you would end up

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.361
with a left skewed distribution.

00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:34.533
But we saw before the
higher your sample size,

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:36.221
the smaller your standard deviation

00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:38.308
for the sampling distribution

00:05:38.308 --> 00:05:40.783
and so what that does is it tightens up,

00:05:40.783 --> 00:05:43.913
it tightens up the standard deviation

00:05:43.913 --> 00:05:46.775
and so it's going to look more normal.

00:05:46.775 --> 00:05:50.025
It's gonna look closer to being normal.

00:05:51.735 --> 00:05:54.353
So we'll say approximately normal

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:57.318
because it met our conditions
for this rule of thumb.

00:05:57.318 --> 00:05:58.581
Is it gonna be perfectly normal?

00:05:58.581 --> 00:05:59.414
No.

00:05:59.414 --> 00:06:01.263
In fact, if we didn't
have this rule of thumb

00:06:01.263 --> 00:06:03.582
to draw the line, some might even argue

00:06:03.582 --> 00:06:05.582
that we still have a
longer tail to the left

00:06:05.582 --> 00:06:07.750
than we do to the right,
maybe it's skewed to the left,

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.622
but using this threshold,
using this rule of thumb

00:06:10.622 --> 00:06:12.542
which is the standard in statistics,

00:06:12.542 --> 00:06:16.375
this would be viewed as
approximately normal.
