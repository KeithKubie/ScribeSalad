00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.130
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.580
- Welcome, everyone.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.340
My name is Immaculata De Vivo.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.950
I am one of the co-directors
for science programming

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.050
here at Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.060
And I have to make a
comment about the weather

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.050
and why wouldn't I?

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.070
It's a spectacular day.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.680
And we have a speaker
from San Diego,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.430
so I'd have to give a
little bit of credit

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.290
to our speaker for bringing
us some San Diego weather.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.930
So today's event,
Twins in Space,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.230
is part of the
undiscovered science series

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.700
here at Radcliffe.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.430
And "undiscovered,"
we mean, to paraphrase

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.430
my other co-director of
Science, Alyssa Goodman,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.160
is when you are on
a path in science

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.511
and you are addressing
a particular question

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:44.510
and you think you know
what you're going to find

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.790
but you find out something else.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.930
And Dr. Rana today, in
keeping with that theme,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:58.310
will tell us the amazing
resilience of the human body--

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.850
our ability to adapt in
very harsh environments,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.390
which is space.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.710
So with that, I'd like
to introduce Dr. Rana.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.440
Dr. Rana is an associate
professor from UCSD.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.020
Her area of expertise
is in twins genetics.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.480
Prior to NASA study,
she was invited

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.630
to serve as the PI of
several twin studies,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.660
investigating relative
contribution of the environment

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.810
and genetic influences on
cardiovascular-related traits

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.200
and diseases as well
as cognitive aging.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.090
Previous studies
involved investigating

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.980
the role of gene
and environment,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.720
especially on the genome.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.360
The NASA twin study was
a natural progression

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.220
of her prior work.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.640
And more importantly, Brinda,
as I like to call her,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.580
is a wonderful personal
friend and she actually

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.070
took me on this
journey with her to be

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.470
part of this NASA project.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.500
My lab generated some of
the data for this project

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.050
and for the paper that's
coming up in Science,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.404
and with that, I'd like
to introduce Brinda

00:01:57.404 --> 00:01:59.789
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.760
- Thank you, Immaculata,
and I just want

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.919
to say it's a great
honor to be here

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.930
and to speak at the
Radcliffe Institute.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.920
And I heard I'm competing
with Joe Kennedy, so thank you

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.830
for coming here to listen to me.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.340
And thank you for Dr.
De Vivo and Goodman

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.170
for inviting me here.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.740
So I had the
incredible opportunity

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.310
to work with NASA for
the last five years.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.660
I've learned a lot.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.480
And I'm going to talk a
little bit about the study

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.370
and everything--

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.070
all of my experiences
with NASA--

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.520
as much as I can get in
in 55, 50 minutes or so.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:51.290
So let me start with a little
event that occurred last March.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.240
So some of you may have
seen the article in CNN

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.750
in which the article
implied that Scott

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.110
Kelly, our astronaut, went
up to space for a year

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.040
and came back mutated.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.150
Now the great thing about
being on the west coast

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.700
is, while you sleep,
the entire world

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.320
hears the news before you do.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.450
And by the time I woke up,
every journal in the world

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.825
had said something about
Scott Kelly being mutated.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.070
So NASA, in its style--

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.460
you know, I mean, this
is what I thought of.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.450
Like, oh my gosh.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.800
7% of the genome is mutated.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.600
We're creating rhesus
monkeys up there.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.510
Well NASA was like,
what just happened?

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.480
So the staff at
Houston Space Center

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.860
called us up immediately.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.000
We had an emergency
phone call with Houston.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.890
Get to the bottom of it.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.520
Well what had happened was,
in January of that year,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.160
last year, the
twin investigators

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.620
gave a talk at a
NASA conference--

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.170
just a regular grant
investigators' conference--

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.560
and of course reporters were
there listening to our talks.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.350
Well the Daily Mail
reporter was there

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.120
and they kind of misinterpreted
are all our joint talks.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.770
And not only were we
mutating astronauts

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.800
but we were reversing
aging processes.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.150
And it went relatively under
the radar because, you know,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.720
it's the Daily Mail, but for
some reason, a month and a half

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.440
later, CNN decides
to read this article

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.360
and pick up where they left
off, and that was what happened.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.120
So anyway, with a little help
of other scientific journals,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.500
National Geographic helped us
clear up what had happened.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.370
So now I'm going to
tell you the real story.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.930
OK.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.920
So in March of 2015,
astronaut Scott Kelly

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.950
embarked on a one-year mission
onboard the International Space

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.880
Shuttle.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.460
And this became the longest
journey, or longest mission,

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.270
a US astronaut had
ever taken on in space.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.400
Previous missions
for US astronauts

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.756
were a max of six months.

00:05:29.756 --> 00:05:31.130
There had been
several astronauts

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.350
who'd take three
months and six months.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:40.850
And together with the
Russian cosmonaut Kornienko,

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.640
this mission was known
as the one-year mission.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.360
So the one-year mission
alone gave NASA opportunities

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.010
to study how the human body
adapts to long-duration space

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.650
travel-- long-duration
meaning a year--

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.530
and also to test out some
of the countermeasures

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.800
against the physiological
effects of space travels.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.230
Countermeasures is
a term they used.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.060
You know, therapeutic treatments
to counter the issues--

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.850
physiological issues.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:20.200
So NASA's goal is to send
astronauts to Mars in the 2030s

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.450
and they want their
astronauts to come back safe.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.140
They like their astronauts.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.600
So they need to figure out--

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.530
they know some of the effects
from the last several decades

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.690
of space travel.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.550
They know some of the
effects on the body

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.090
but what they're afraid of is
stuff that they don't know.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.010
Not everything is known.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:48.850
So they're starting to conduct
studies on human physiology.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.950
So some of the stressors
of space travel

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:58.660
include microgravity, elevated
CO2 in the International Space

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:06.069
Center, confined spaces,
circadian disruption,

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:07.610
radiation patterns
that are different

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.640
there than on Earth,
isolation from family,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.230
dietary limitation.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.240
These are all issues
that together contribute

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.850
to physiological issues.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.090
One of the biggest issues
that astronauts face--

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.770
well let's remind
you of the two movies

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.880
that you probably saw and
you can kind of remember

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.770
all the things that
astronauts go through.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.710
So one of the biggest
issues that astronauts face

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.980
is this phenomenon
of fluid shifts.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.750
We have, as humans, evolved on
Earth where there is gravity.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:49.410
So on Earth, our fluids are
being pulled towards the feet.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.950
Our physiology pumps
the fluids-- the blood--

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.260
towards the head.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.420
And on Earth, we're fine.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.020
We get blood flowing,
circulating, in our body.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.440
When you go into a microgravity
or a zero-gravity environment,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.660
there is no gravity
pulling the fluids back

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.740
to the feet, so
fluid shifts upward

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.230
towards the chest and the head.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.450
So what does this feel like?

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.605
Well imagine when you're a
kid, if you remember back then,

00:08:20.605 --> 00:08:23.610
and you hung upside
down on monkey bars.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.200
And that feeling of
pressure in your head,

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.380
that's the feeling that
these astronauts have.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.500
Now imagine that
for a whole year.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.890
So, needless to say, this
causes a lot of issues.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:42.190
Some of the issues are increased
intracranial pressure--

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.080
they get headaches up there--

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.650
edema.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.550
So if you look at pictures
of astronauts in space,

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.850
you will see that
they look puffy.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:58.060
Now this is not a photographic
thing that happens in space.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.960
Their faces are actually puffy.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.890
Some people say this
is a good thing.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.410
A lot of women--
older women I've

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.177
given this talk to say, oh,
well that's not so bad, is it?

00:09:06.177 --> 00:09:08.080
I'm like, well.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.770
OK.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:14.409
And you'll see our astronaut,
Scott Kelly, on the top

00:09:14.409 --> 00:09:15.200
when he's on Earth.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.230
And on the bottom, you can
see he's kind of puffy.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.690
And then do you notice
anything different about Scott

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:21.530
on the bottom panel?

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.500
He's wearing glasses.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.030
OK?

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.140
So glasses.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.870
They have a lot
of ocular issues.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.300
Now, back in the day, astronauts
for like fighter pilots,

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.160
they have perfect eagle
eyes, but now, they're

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.670
representative in the normal,
intelligent population.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.000
A lot of them wear glasses.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.890
But even then, when they go
up, they have further issues

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:50.820
with their eyes.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.550
Some of these issues
are caused by--

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.670
they get edema in their eye.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.550
They get distension
in the optic nerve

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:08.460
and then they get this pattern
of choroid folds, which

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.940
this is a normal
picture of the retina

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.530
and these are the folds here.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.260
Now we've talked
to opthamologists.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.150
This is not something
you see on Earth.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:26.260
This is something that happens
only because of space travel.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.540
So this is a big issue--

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.880
big enough that it
too hit the media,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.540
and this was accurately
reported a few years ago.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.720
Vision changes as an
astronaut's big issue with NASA.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.670
So collectively, this fluid
shifts, intracranial pressure,

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:49.480
eye issues, these symptoms are
known as Spaceflight Associated

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.830
Neuro-Ocular Syndrome,
or SANS, formerly known

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:58.430
as Visual Impairment
Intracranial Pressure, VIIP.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:02.140
So they like their
acronyms there.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:07.890
Another issue is this issue
with orthostatic intolerance.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:12.580
So, on Earth, we have a
pressure gradient in our body.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:20.040
When you go up in space, this
pressure gradient changes.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.290
We have little muscles
that are pumping

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.860
blood upwards towards
the head, but in space,

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.420
they kind of get--

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.480
they don't need to do that
because it's already being--

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.110
the fluids are
shifting upwards--

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.510
and so they get weak.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.680
So when the
astronauts come down,

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.900
the body isn't quite ready to
pump blood back up to the head

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.190
and the astronauts can pass out.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.610
And that's why you see,
when astronauts land,

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.722
whether or not they are
going to have an event,

00:11:58.722 --> 00:12:00.430
they are carried out
of the space shuttle

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.390
rather than walking out
of the space shuttle.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:08.310
Now not all astronauts
have this event.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.130
There's a lot of issues.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.690
There's variation in
how astronauts respond

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.030
and there's a lot of
issues, environmental

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:21.650
and maybe genetic,
that contribute

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:26.660
to this orthostatic intolerance.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.420
Other issues are
cardiovascular changes.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:35.800
So, on Earth, if you're
a middle-aged adult,

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.550
you may have gone to
screen for atherosclerosis.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.530
You look at this--

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:48.940
you look at this carotid intima
thickening of your artery.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.260
Normal individuals, they
don't have thickening,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.682
and if you are starting to
develop atherosclerosis,

00:12:55.682 --> 00:12:56.640
you get the thickening.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.170
Well these
astronauts, as healthy

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.780
as they are, when they're
in space, some of them

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.720
develop this thickening.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.740
So that's another issue as well.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.450
They also had
musculoskeletal issues--

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.520
muscle atrophy,
bone deconditioning.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.870
And this is kind of easy to
predict because, you know,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.690
they're up there
without any gravity.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.690
And I've been told
by physiologists

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.560
that, even though they
do exercise up in space,

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.480
an hour, a couple
of hours a day,

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.450
that still doesn't
make up for what

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.280
we do on Earth with
gravity and just

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.370
the daily walking
around that helps

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.800
keep our muscle and
bone tone going.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:44.860
And then there are
potential neurocognitive

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:49.700
and behavioral changes that
need to be studied as well.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.950
So let's put this together.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.860
We've got
musculoskeletal issues,

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:58.570
we've got cardiovascular issues,
cognitive issues, eye issues--

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.610
sound familiar?

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.710
So all the issues that
we face when we age.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.550
So then when people
kind of talked

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.902
to me about this
twin paradox, well,

00:14:10.902 --> 00:14:12.360
did Scott really
come back younger?

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.930
Well one of our twin
investigators, Chris Mason,

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.760
he actually did
the calculations.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.530
And yeah, by a few--

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:21.660
what did he say--

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.450
8.6 milliseconds younger.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:31.320
But really, maybe by
timeline, but physiologically,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.270
I don't think so.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.960
So there are standard
changes due to spaceflight.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.380
We know fluid shifts happen.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.630
It doesn't matter who you are.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.213
You go up there, you
get fluid shifts.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:50.430
This also corresponds
to decrease

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:57.600
in blood volume, blood
cell mass, and changes

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.250
in urinary output.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.250
These are all very
standard in all astronauts.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.410
But there are some
issues that astronauts

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.300
face that aren't standard.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.310
For example,
orthostatic intolerance.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:14.430
Like I said, not all astronauts
will pass out when they land.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.050
Ocular issues.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:20.160
In studies with the three
months and six-month flight

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:25.840
astronauts, some of them develop
the issues but some astronauts

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.590
don't.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:31.480
I think about 60% developed
it in the shorter duration

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.320
flights.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.570
And then something you
probably don't hear about a lot

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.960
is astronauts also
get space sickness.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.850
Maybe it's akin to getting
carsick or seasick.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:49.520
I don't think it's talked about
that much but they do get it.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.050
And so what's causing these
differences in response

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.640
to spaceflights?

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.660
Is it the environment?

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.805
Some of the countermeasures
they're doing?

00:15:58.805 --> 00:16:00.220
The environment's not the same.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.500
They're going into space
but the pattern of radiation

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.570
may be different.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.730
There may be events up there
in the six months or the year

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.730
that we don't know about
that are different.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.110
And then their genetics and
then the way the genetics--

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.510
the genome, the DNA--

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:23.700
interacts with the environment
to cause this response.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:29.160
So two of the twin
investigators, Dr. Smith

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.270
and Zwart--

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.240
they are the directors of the
Nutrition and Biochemistry Lab

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.800
at Johnson Space Center--

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.480
they came up with this
multi-hit hypothesis

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.800
which is kind of the
akin to the multi-hit

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.470
hypothesis for cancer.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:52.280
They talk about that
the optic issues

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.540
that the astronauts
face, represented here,

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.750
is a combination
of multiple issues.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:06.130
Their genetic makeup in
the one-carbon pathway

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:12.819
can cause different response
to the oxidative stress.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:15.339
That combined with
endothelial dysfunction

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:20.380
caused by just the environment
of space travel interacting

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:29.010
to cause variation in
their optical health.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.320
So NASA, they've
been really good

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.080
with physiological studies.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.280
And in fact, if anyone
is doing physiology

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.790
and wants to do an internship
at Johnson Space Center,

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.710
they're a fantastic lab.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:51.120
It's a great place to learn
physiology and environmental

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.320
response to it.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:00.450
But NASA five years
ago needed to integrate

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:04.080
new fields, such as
omics system, biology,

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.070
the metagenome, which
includes their microbiome,

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:12.570
and then also start
studying cognitive issues

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:17.630
and behavioral issues that the
astronauts are going to face.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:23.810
So to do so, they decided
to incorporate these studies

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:27.230
into the one-year mission
with Scott Kelly going up

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:28.040
for a year.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.400
Perfect chance.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.320
Now Scott Kelly,
he reminded NASA,

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.340
he said, hey, you know,
I have a twin brother

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:41.880
and he's an astronaut for
NASA, in case you didn't know,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.470
and maybe this would
be a perfect study

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.020
because my brother
Mark, he's retired.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.540
So Mark Kelly was an astronaut.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.830
He had 50 some days up in space.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.720
He retired a little bit earlier
because his wife, Senator

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:06.470
Gifford, had just survived
an assassination attempt.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:09.810
So he retired to
take care of her.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.800
So Scott and Mark
thought, well, hey, we

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.610
can do a study while
he's up in space.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:18.680
He'll be the space
twin and his brother

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.840
will be the ground control twin.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:27.110
So Scott and Mark joined the
other genetically identical

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.750
organisms up in the
International Space Station.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:35.420
There was rodent studies, fly
studies, weeds, arabidopsis,

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.890
that's being
conducted, and now we

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:41.660
had a human genetically
identical organism,

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.460
which was great.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:49.970
So NASA put out a
proposal called an RFA

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:53.370
and they selected 10 proposals.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:59.490
And I was fortunate to be one
of the PIs that got selected.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.300
And my buddies and I actually
put in a couple of proposals

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:08.190
and both of them got
accepted, so I was involved

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:12.300
in two of those studies.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.810
And I and my team--

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.050
couldn't have done it
without the whole team--

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.140
groups at UCSD and
University of Texas

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.140
and your own,
Immaculata De Vivo,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:30.770
we all worked together for the
last five years on this study.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.820
And what is this study?

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:37.230
Well this study included PIs
from all over the United States

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.370
and one in Germany.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.250
And we didn't really know
what we were going to do.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.350
And by the way, I just
wanted to tell you

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.225
that this is a huge study.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.620
Pick a number in your head about
how much this grant was for?

00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:01.565
Just-- it was $100,000,
including indirect cost.

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.010
And fortunately, I
was on a K award,

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.530
so I didn't have
to pay my salary.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:13.550
So yeah.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:14.560
So we got this.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.540
It was really exciting
and got a phone call.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.340
I just happened
to be in my office

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.100
when the phone call came
from Johnson Space Center.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.430
Really exciting.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.420
But then the letter comes
with this embargo notice.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:32.830
This embargo notice, you can't
tell anybody, and if you do,

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.682
it will be extremely serious.

00:21:36.682 --> 00:21:40.600
And I'm like, whoa, what
am I getting myself into?

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:45.580
So NASA called us all to
Johnson Space Center in April.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:50.080
They said, OK, pick
your co-investigator

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.990
and fly over to
Johnson Space Center.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:54.640
Put us all in a
room, NASA style.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.190
I think they did this
a lot in the '60s.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.170
You all are going to be a team.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.240
You're going to work
together and you're

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.080
going to conduct the
first integrated omics

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.580
study of a human body in space.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:12.120
Put your brains together
and collaborate.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.710
So the idea or the hypothesis
is that Scott and Mark,

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:23.070
being almost genetically
identical individuals,

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:31.950
the stressors of space would
manifest itself on the genome.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:38.180
So the genome being the actual
DNA sequence or the structure,

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:44.830
but really it could change
the regulation of genes.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.730
So changing the
regulation mechanisms,

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.370
epigenetic changes,
which then leads

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:56.100
to changes in transcriptomics,
so DNA to RNA.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.550
Which then, the
products of genes,

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:03.170
which are proteins which
we were working on,

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:08.210
antibodies, metabolites,
changes in the metagenome,

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.920
the microbiome, and
then ultimately,

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.520
changes in physiology
and cognition.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.470
N equals 2.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:19.410
All right.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:22.100
A lot of people like to tease
me about this N equals 2 study,

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.900
but I always say, really,
it's actually an N

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.090
equals one twin pair.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:31.160
I do different twin
studies, and one

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.070
of the twin studies I
work with is actually

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.140
with Boston University.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.760
They have 1,200
twins that they've

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.150
been longitudinally following.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:44.460
So this is kind of funny
to do an N equals 2 study.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:52.040
But anyway, what we're trying
to do-- well, I put this up.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.990
My postdoc mentor
published a paper

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:59.210
about how important n-of-1
trials are in this day and age

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.175
of personalized medicine.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.540
So anyway, what
we're trying to do

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.800
is we're trying to
just capture events.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:12.240
We're trying to capture
molecular events that

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.860
correspond to physiological
changes in relationship

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.220
with space travel,
both good and bad--

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.510
negative and positive effects.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:26.360
And these will provide
clues for further studies.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.010
And at the same time, we have
the Earth control brother,

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:37.260
and just to see how do these
normal middle-aged man,

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.062
how do these molecules change
on Earth and the physiology

00:24:40.062 --> 00:24:40.770
that we're doing?

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.020
We're doing some pretty
amazing physiology on him.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:50.510
So we got together
and created a scheme

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.740
to sample everything
we possibly could--

00:24:53.740 --> 00:25:02.110
urine, blood, fecal samples,
cheek swabs on the astronauts,

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:06.770
both on the ground before
they go up in flight

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.320
and on the ground and
then with the ground

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.850
twin wherever he happens to be.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.850
Now we were all
molecular biologists.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.490
None of us had worked for
NASA-- well most of us

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.320
hadn't worked for NASA.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.420
And we'd been designing
our studies based on Earth.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.860
So, oh yeah, we can
do lots for you,

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.160
we told NASA, on that
$100,000 with indirect cost.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.080
We can do this, this, and this.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.200
Just give us a
couple vials of blood

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.460
at 10 time points in space.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.080
We'll do stuff for you.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.700
Well NASA said, uh, yeah, no.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.982
Number one, remember I talked to
you about reduced blood volume.

00:25:47.982 --> 00:25:51.280
There's a lot of issues up
in space collecting blood.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.690
Not only that, we weren't the
only study on Scott Kelly.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.370
There were like 50 other studies
and they wanted their blood.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.030
So they had a limit of how
much blood they can give.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:02.552
I mean, these poor guys.

00:26:02.552 --> 00:26:03.052
- Wow!

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:08.110
- And they're the best
subject ever because they

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.150
collect samples for you.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:11.790
So they had to do
their own samples.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.990
This is Scott collecting
samples for us

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.970
up in space in the
International Space Center.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:16.880
It's not easy.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.475
He makes it look easy.

00:26:19.475 --> 00:26:21.100
And then we thought,
well urine's fine.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.360
But no urine.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.420
They don't like the urine
process because, you have

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:30.640
to imagine, you cannot
let liquid go airborne.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.090
I mean, it starts
floating around

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.300
and then you get a splash
of pee in your face.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.680
So they have to
pee into a vacuum.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.790
And so for our 24-hour
pooled urine sample,

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.520
they've got to do it in the
vacuum, get a little syringe

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.170
and collect the samples for us.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:47.830
It's not easy.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:54.270
And then we thought
Scott was hard.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:54.930
Mark.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:59.670
Mark was on the trail
around the United States

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.710
giving talks on gun control.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:03.390
We never knew where he was.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.790
But at least we knew
where Scott was.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.310
He was up in the
International Space Station.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.040
So we're like, OK, well
we need this flight

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.845
plus 10 days samples.

00:27:13.845 --> 00:27:15.660
OK, where's Mark now?

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.410
So we'd have to like, oh
gosh, he's over in New York.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.120
OK, send the phlebotomist into
New York to get blood from him

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.880
because we need it to correspond
to the same time as Scott.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.180
So that was pretty tough, too.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.110
And then we had to all share--

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.840
imagine doing a genomic
study, just genomics.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.630
Easily you get, you know,
one vial, 10 CCs of blood,

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.420
and you do transcriptomics
or epigenetics.

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.510
No, you get, for us,
one CC, one vial,

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:48.890
and you're going to do
transcriptomics, epigenetics,

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:53.990
proteomics,
metabolomics, everything

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.100
on that one CC of vial.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:28:01.700
So we had to really work
together and develop protocols.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.530
Not only that.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:07.990
The protocols were--
you've got to get

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.640
everything flight certified.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.620
You know, the stuff
you use here on Earth,

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.620
you can't just send it up
there because it may not

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.410
withstand space travel.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:19.090
And if you use glass,
it could shatter,

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:21.970
and then you've get shrapnel
all over-- you know,

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.190
floating around,
cutting the astronauts.

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:26.770
So everything has to be flight
certified and some of my stuff

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:28.290
didn't get flight certified.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.820
I wanted a filter to filter
out the epithelial cells

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.440
from the urine.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.140
Didn't get that done in
time, so we just let that go.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.610
And then I was a
little perturbed

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:39.370
when the Italians sent their
espresso machine up there.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:42.580
I'm like, they got an
espresso machine up there

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.440
but they couldn't put
my filter up there?

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.050
But that's the way it goes.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:49.920
So the other thing
we had to do--

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.950
the most important
thing that day--

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.270
they put us in a room for
three days to work together.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:29:00.590
The most important thing
was the name of the mission.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.870
We needed a mission
name and a patch.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.427
Now this is important to NASA.

00:29:05.427 --> 00:29:06.260
I mean, imagine NIH.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.320
You've got to get a
patch for your study.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.780
When an astronaut goes
up on any mission,

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.940
they wear a patch on
their flight suit.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.891
That patch represents
whatever they're doing.

00:29:18.891 --> 00:29:20.640
And they [INAUDIBLE]
have tons of patches.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.720
Like I said, there's 50 studies
that they're involved in.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:29.420
So we had to come up
with a name and a patch.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.490
And what happens
with this patch is--

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.430
this is Mission Control
at Johnson Space Center--

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:37.530
at the end of the
study, the patch--

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:39.620
they make a plaque
of the patch--

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.270
and you'll see, all over
here, there's these little--

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:45.450
these are all mission
patches on the walls.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.960
And they're ceremoniously
hung up on the wall

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.930
at the end of a mission.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:55.530
And they've been doing this
since the Apollo missions.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.390
So we had to come up with
an idea, unfortunately,

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:00.480
and so-- even the latrine--

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.840
the mission that introduced the
latrine, the pee system, they

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.340
even had a patch.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.210
I mean, everything has a patch.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:12.030
So we were trying to
come up with names.

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:16.830
Unfortunately, the Gemini
Project had been taken.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.630
So we came up with a few ideas.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.400
And I thought
Skywalker Project would

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:25.660
be fun but copyright issues.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.770
So we finally just
settled on The Twin Study,

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.530
which was great.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:35.100
And we put every molecule
on-- every single one of us

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.770
wanted our molecule on, and if
you look really closely, you've

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.530
got the DNA methylation, you've
got every little molecule

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:42.630
on here.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:45.630
And then of course the names
of all the institutions

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:49.322
of the PIs, and I'm very proud
that UCSD, alphabetically,

00:30:49.322 --> 00:30:50.280
ended up in the middle.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.706
OK, so we got the patch done.

00:30:55.706 --> 00:30:57.330
Then we had to, in
year one, figure out

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.270
how to get the
samples to and from.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:05.540
So to get the samples
up, we decided to use,

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.610
you know, Space X. That's
really what they use.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.260
We had different
types of experiments.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.360
We were doing--
some samples needed

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.670
to be sent back to Earth fresh.

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:19.540
Some of them, for my
studies, could wait 300 days.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:24.490
So the Russian Soyuz is
actually incredibly timely,

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:29.320
so we, for some of the
transcriptomics and telomerase

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.200
studies, we timed
the blood draws

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:39.759
with the schedule of the Soyuz
and it came back in two days

00:31:39.759 --> 00:31:41.050
from the International Station.

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.450
It gets to Kazakhstan,
the helicopter

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.820
is there, NASA's
helicopter, where it lands.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.830
They go pick up the
sample, they rush it over

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:54.070
to the Johnson Space Center,
and then one of our team

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:57.280
would be there at Johnson Space
Center to process the samples

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.460
when it got there.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.630
And that's usually Fran, who is
the first author of the paper.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:10.570
And for less
stringent protocols,

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:17.740
we just waited until our shuttle
came, landed in the Pacific,

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.354
picked up by NASA
in the Pacific,

00:32:19.354 --> 00:32:21.520
taken to Johnson Space
Center, and then disseminated

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.300
to all the investigators.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.360
So we came up with
this amazing protocol.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.780
And you know, you're
working with space.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.430
Like I said, things go wrong.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:31.930
And things did go wrong.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:34.540
We did have a supply
ship that blew up.

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:38.510
But when it did blow up, we
got this really nice letter

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:39.010
from NASA.

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:45.450
I mean, if you
read the letter, it

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.450
says, "Speaking as a
fellow researcher--"

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.280
I haven't memorized this--

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.010
"I can only imagine
how devastated

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:59.600
you must be feeling right now
on the loss of Space X's CRS 7."

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.910
And it goes on to tell
how saddened we all are.

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:08.340
And then it says, "I'm writing
to encourage you-- in fact,

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:12.300
urge you-- to continue
your inquiry."

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.210
Can you imagine the NIH
sending you a letter like that

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:16.710
if your experiment blows up?

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.140
So we persevered.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.610
I mean, we just lost samples.

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:26.510
They lost food.

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.900
That really sucked for them.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.950
And we got samples.

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:33.390
We got lots of samples.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:37.230
And this is just a
diagram of the samples

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.400
that we collected at the
different time points.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.620
I love the way
they write things.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:50.890
L minus 173, so Launch minus 173
days, or flight day and return.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:57.240
So we collected from the
Earth twin mark and space twin

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.570
at these different time points.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.480
And we did physiological
measures along

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.030
with the collections.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:06.280
Physiology also is complicated.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:11.460
Well, one thing is, one of the
PIs, Rubin Gore and Basner,

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.350
were doing cognitive studies.

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:16.020
Now they're standard
cognitive studies.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:21.000
You know, they are done
for neurocognitive testing

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.017
all the time.

00:34:22.017 --> 00:34:23.850
But you've got to
remember, these are highly

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:28.500
functioning adults, so they
had to develop a cognitive test

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.989
for the astronaut
special for them and one

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:35.070
that they could administer
through Mission Control.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:35.730
So yeah.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:40.560
So remember that the
true cognitive test is

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.090
what they experience every day.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:44.324
You know, this is what it
looks like on the Soyuz.

00:34:44.324 --> 00:34:46.449
All these buttons they have
to press to get around.

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:50.699
And they're in
Russian, so these tests

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:52.770
have to represent
their abilities.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:55.110
So that was one
of the phenotyping

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:58.560
measures that was being done.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:03.270
Our studies were looking
at omics in conjunction

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:07.330
with these physiological
changes, cardiovascular,

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:11.910
and fluid shifts,
the optic issues.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:13.410
So we had to do all
the phenotyping.

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:16.130
And this is just
a slide describing

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:19.080
a day in the life of
a fluid shift subject.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.060
And it's a lot of
words, but really

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.300
what I'm trying to get at
is, these are all the testing

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.950
that we did on the astronauts,
from ultrasounds to MRIs

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:32.850
to dilution measures,
pre-flight, in-flight,

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.310
and post-flight
on both brothers.

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:40.230
Really, really good physiology.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.880
And then in-flight, that's the
great thing about in-flight

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:48.380
is your subjects are doing
the studies on themselves.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.520
Best subjects ever.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:54.770
So, like I said, we looked at
the carotid intima thickening.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:58.350
So the way we do it,
the cardiovascular lab

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:02.150
at Johnson Space Center has
devised a really nice system.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:03.980
They've got a computer.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:08.340
They've coded it for the
astronauts, color and letters,

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.810
and the astronauts can
do their own ultrasound.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:13.050
And this is Scott doing
his ultrasound for us

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:15.000
on the International
Space Center.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.400
And at Johnson Space
Center Mission Control,

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.340
there's a little booth somewhere
and then they just call out

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.250
and they say, OK, a
little bit to the left,

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:27.990
a little bit to the right.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:30.200
OK, you got it.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.880
OK, click it.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.690
Click pink A. You know,
capture the image.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:37.760
And then I noticed on
the wall in the cubicle,

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.590
they had all these
little squishy balls.

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:44.210
I was like, what's with all
these little stress balls?

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:46.100
They said, well, there's
a five-second delay

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.220
between Mission Control
and the Space Station,

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.320
and every time they get the
best image and they said,

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:57.730
OK, the astronaut moves the
probe and they lose the image.

00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:59.870
And that causes a
lot of frustration

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.010
and so they throw
balls against the wall.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:06.520
But they're really good.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.220
This is my image.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.750
I got to do this on myself,
with them talking me through it,

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.620
except without the
five-second delay.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.475
So I was really proud that
I did my own ultrasound.

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.200
IRBs.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.450
They had never-- NASA
had not been involved

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:27.920
in genomic studies before.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:31.370
And the biggest concern
is here with privacy

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.350
and confidentiality.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:37.480
The entire world knows
Scott and Mark Kelly.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:41.890
Everything we publish, we're
going to know it's them.

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:44.950
Now they're federal
employees, retired.

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:47.800
They got the best
retirement plan.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.870
My dad was a federal
employee and I

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:53.157
know what a great
retirement plan they have,

00:37:53.157 --> 00:37:55.240
so they don't have to worry
about health insurance

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.150
and stuff.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:00.607
But we're talking
about genetics and we

00:38:00.607 --> 00:38:02.440
don't know what's going
to happen downstream

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.110
with their children,
their grandchildren,

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:10.560
so we have to be very careful
what we say about their data.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.310
Everything has to be
approved through them

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:17.560
and that's how we wrote this
Institutional Board Review.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:28.510
So some of the issues,
some of the risks--

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:31.300
I mean, the main risk is, you
know, shooting someone off

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:31.960
into space.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:37.180
But at a conference, the
International Space Station RMD

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.390
event, they got Scott
and Kelly together

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:43.440
to talk about our study
and I recorded it.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.120
It's a little bit hard to
listen to in a big room,

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:50.000
so I'm just going to
give you the highlights.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.635
So this is Scott and Mark Kelly.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.080
The way I remember
Scott and Mark is Mark

00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:00.530
has a mustache, so M for
Mark, Scott for space.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:05.030
But sometimes Mark shaves
his mustache and changes

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:06.950
everything, but
this is Mark here.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:11.780
So Mark jokingly said
that, "There was really

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:12.770
no risk for me.

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:15.380
I'm just shipping blood,
urine, and other stuff

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:21.050
to my former employer,"
he says sarcastically.

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:28.160
And then his brother starts
talking about cognitive tests,

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.100
and he said he
was more concerned

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:35.450
about the embarrassment
of doing worse

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:38.362
on the cognitive
study of his brother.

00:39:38.362 --> 00:39:40.070
They're very competitive
with each other,

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:41.990
like many brothers are.

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:44.155
And yeah, and he agreed.

00:39:44.155 --> 00:39:44.780
So Mark agreed.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.760
He said, "That was
a lot of pressure,

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.980
but I didn't practice."

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.360
He said he didn't cheat.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.450
He said he did it straight
up and he thought he did OK.

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:57.410
And then he proudly says
that, "In the debrief,

00:39:57.410 --> 00:40:01.290
they said I did
better than he did.

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:04.990
So I'm happy about that."

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:06.620
So there's some
data right there.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:11.790
And then of course
in TIME Magazine,

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:13.770
you know, Mark was
kind of complaining

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:17.040
about sending urine,
pee, and poop over

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.780
to us and the
embarrassment factor,

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:26.730
but they're ready to do it
for the benefit of humanity.

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:31.830
So these are some of
the issues with the IRB.

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:32.829
And then the IRB.

00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:34.620
Of course we've got to
approve through NASA

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.700
and we had to get approved
from my university as well.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.880
My university was like-- they
were like, you know what?

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:45.090
In this project, you're
shooting someone into space.

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:51.072
This presents more than
minimal risk to human subjects.

00:40:51.072 --> 00:40:53.280
But they just washed their
hands to it and they said,

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.170
this committee defers to NASA.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:01.800
So now I'm going to talk
to you about our study.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:05.050
So we are publishing our study.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.140
I was supposed to come--
the reason I decided

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.920
to come in February was it was
supposed to be published a week

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.340
or two ago.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.822
I'm not going to point
any fingers, but--

00:41:15.822 --> 00:41:16.686
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.340
I was at the NASA
meeting last week

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.280
and it was very sparse because
the federal employees couldn't

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.520
be there, including--
and so I cut out

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:31.080
the name, the director of
the human research project.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:35.086
They were allowed to come but as
citizens of the United States.

00:41:35.086 --> 00:41:36.710
And they had to put
this in their badge

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:38.860
they couldn't talk
about any NASA stuff.

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:42.060
So anyway, it didn't
get published,

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:46.050
but today, we signed
off on everything,

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.030
so it should be coming out soon.

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:54.860
This is just to show you
the integrative studies--

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:58.010
all the different
protocols we did,

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:01.580
physiology and molecular, all
the different time points.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:05.120
And in subsequent slides, you're
going to see green for Earth,

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.500
blue for the space twin.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.880
I'm going to show
you some of the data.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.250
And this is really data
that the astronauts

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.990
had approved for us to say.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:18.350
I can't say
everything, but you'll

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.420
get an idea of what we've done.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:23.480
So again, we were looking
at-- in my particular studies,

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:28.340
we were looking
at the correlation

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:32.870
between molecular
events, omics events,

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:37.330
and physiological issues.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.630
And in particular, we were
looking at metabolites

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:42.840
and peptides and proteins.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:47.520
So we did an integrative
study looking

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:51.180
at, if this means
anything to some of you,

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:55.190
mass spec based metabolomics,
targeted and untargeted,

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:57.060
and proteomics.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.040
And then we also
had some hypotheses

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.890
that we were studying about
mitochondrial dysfunction

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:08.000
in space, along with our
collaborator, Immaculata De

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.080
Vivo, which was done here.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:13.380
We looked at mitochondrial
DNA copy number as well.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.690
And then I'll show
you some data.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:23.510
So basically what
we found was we

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:26.900
found that there were
changes with spaceflight

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.050
in some of these molecules.

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:36.500
Some patterns we saw were,
in plasma, blood, or urine,

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.270
some of these proteins
or metabolites

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:41.300
were elevated
during spaceflight.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.380
In some cases, they were
decreased when you compare it

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.410
to pre-flight baseline levels.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:50.960
In most cases, they came
back to normal levels.

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:57.410
And then we looked
at the brother.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:01.650
Now what was interesting
is, in most cases,

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:05.430
the brother didn't fluctuate
too much but they did fluctuate.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.640
And in some cases, it could
fluctuate a little bit more

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:12.570
than the flight astronaut.

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:15.780
And you can imagine
that an astronaut,

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:17.610
when they're actually
on a mission,

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:21.210
they're in a very
controlled environment

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:26.570
versus a middle-aged man on
Earth over a two-year period.

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:28.490
You know, their diet.

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:32.780
Maybe they ate a hamburger
one day, exercised one day,

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.560
had a Margarita the next.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.790
So they fluctuate quite a bit.

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:45.400
But overall, the outcome was
a comprehensive and integrated

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.670
view of how the
human body responds

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:53.780
to spaceflight and of a
middle-aged man on Earth, which

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:57.040
is very important,
over a two-year period.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:02.720
So we found changes
in urine metabolites

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.580
that related to the adaptations
in multiple physiological

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:11.780
symptoms, including fluid
regulation, vascular

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.810
remodeling, and
musculoskeletal deconditioning.

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:18.050
And I'm going to go through
some of the more fun ones

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:21.440
that Scott and Mark approved
for us to talk about

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.820
before the paper comes out.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.680
Let's talk about hydration.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.870
So hydration.

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:31.250
Very important up in space.

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:37.010
We observed a particular
protein called aquaporin 2 that

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:40.250
was elevated in spaceflight.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:41.930
So what is aquaporin 2?

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:46.510
Well aquaporin 2
is a protein that's

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:51.000
found in the kidney
collecting duct cell.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.130
It's usually inside
the cell, but when

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:59.420
the body is
dehydrated, the hormone

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:03.350
signals a receptor on
the cell and says, OK,

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:06.920
aquaporin 2, go out to the
membrane and bring in water.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:11.719
Instead of eliminating
water in the urine,

00:46:11.719 --> 00:46:13.010
bring that water into the cell.

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:14.610
We're dehydrated.

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:17.660
So that's what aquaporin 2 does.

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.510
Now in some clinical
studies where

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:25.960
they've elevated
serum sodium levels,

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.225
they have found a
jump in aquaporin 2.

00:46:28.225 --> 00:46:31.880
And these are clinical
studies that have been done.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.670
This is not a normal situation.

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:40.970
But we found a high level of
aquaporin 2 in the astronauts.

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:44.000
And then we looked at the serum
sodium levels of the astronaut.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.340
It does jump in spaceflight,
as does osmolality,

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:53.405
so they are very
dehydrated up there.

00:46:53.405 --> 00:46:56.690
And it's not surprising
because, as you've heard,

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:58.850
they have to
recycle their water.

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:04.340
They're basically recycling
their urine and their sweat

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.900
and that's what they drink.

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:10.020
And then they have to use
this crazy system to pee

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.067
and they don't like
going in there,

00:47:12.067 --> 00:47:13.650
so then they don't
drink enough water,

00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:21.990
so the whole thing, I'm told,
is a setup for dehydration.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.670
Energy intake.

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:28.370
Well Scott Smith, one
of the 10 investigators,

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:31.000
he's the director
of the Nutrition Lab

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.960
and they've advanced
space food quite a bit.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.060
They have lots of choices.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:43.010
They're continuing to do studies
to make sure the astronauts are

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:44.870
getting the right nutrients.

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:46.520
They can design their own food.

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:52.250
So it's not as bad
as one may think,

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:59.000
but I'm sure it's not as
good as eating down on Earth.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.040
So the energy intake
does decrease.

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.660
And this is a graph.

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.150
If you see the blue
line, the blue line

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:17.190
represents a decrease in
Scott Kelly's body mass

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:20.420
compared to pre-flight.

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.250
And you can see he
drops a little bit more

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:27.730
than 8% of his body mass
throughout the flight period.

00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:30.540
This is the other
one-year mission astronaut

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:35.114
and the purple is historical
data of a group of astronauts

00:48:35.114 --> 00:48:36.030
over a period of time.

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:41.850
Green, as you can see, is
brother Mark Kelly, the Earth

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:45.600
twin, and as a typical
middle-aged male on Earth,

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:49.910
over the two-year
period, he gained weight.

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:53.610
So basically, astronauts
are losing weight in space--

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:55.080
body mass--

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.750
and it's not surprising because
instead of eating their food,

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:00.510
they're playing with their food.

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:07.260
So we saw some indications of
this in the proteomics study.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:11.070
For example, we found
a particular protein

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:16.860
called angiotensinogen which
decreased during spaceflight.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.700
Now this decrease
has been, on Earth

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:24.390
in [INAUDIBLE] studies,
has been correlated

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:26.790
with reduction in body weight.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:31.480
Now this whole system is also
involved in fluid regulation.

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.660
So what it's going to do--

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.420
the impact, cause, effect.

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.520
All this stuff has
to be worked out.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.480
We are seeing this.

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:48.770
And subsequent studies will
work out what it all means.

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:50.770
OK, so when we're
talking about body mass,

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:53.210
I'm going to talk a little
bit about telomeres.

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:59.270
Now telomeres on a DNA
molecule are the very end.

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:01.400
Basically, they're caps.

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:07.320
And they serve as caps to
protect our chromosomes.

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.540
They're kind of like
shoelaces, the analogy

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.760
is-- the little plastic
tip on your shoelace

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.970
that keeps it from being frayed.

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:20.540
Without it, your DNA
starts to degrade.

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:26.680
And telomere length has
been associated with age.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:31.550
Shorter telomeres
with older age.

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:36.430
So what we saw in this study,
no matter how we looked at it--

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:39.400
Susan Bailey was the lead
for the telomere studies

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:43.420
of this project but Dr. De
Vivo was part of our team

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:48.130
where she helped us validate
some of the studies.

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:53.380
No matter how you looked at
it, Scott Kelly in-flight had

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:55.150
larger telomere length--

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:58.420
whether we looked at the
entire leukocyte population,

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:01.930
whether we isolated
particular cells,

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:06.160
like in this case,
CD4, CD8 cells.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.390
In flight, there
was an elevation

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:09.860
of his telomere length.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:16.840
And this is a graph of
a population of cells

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:21.550
and the relative telomere
length of the cells.

00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:25.300
And you can see that, in flight,
the population of the cells

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:29.830
have higher telomere
length than pre and post.

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:33.580
So basically, telomere length
was increased in flight.

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:40.150
Now studies here on Earth
have found an association

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:42.280
of telomere lengthening
and weight loss

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.780
so this may be the reason.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:45.280
There might be other reasons.

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.035
Now the other thing
is telomerase,

00:51:47.035 --> 00:51:50.560
and telomerase is
the enzyme that

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:54.790
helps puts these caps on DNA.

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:57.640
In support of the data we
saw with telomere lengthening

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:02.880
in flight, we saw the
regulatory machinery

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:09.390
that kind of regulates genes
responsible-- so epigenetic

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:13.710
machinery regulates genes
and then transfertomics

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:16.890
measures the activity
of the genes.

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:22.350
We saw that that supported an
increase in telomerase activity

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:27.610
in flight and also some of the
genes involved in this process.

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:31.230
So this is how we integrated
a lot of our studies

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:34.930
to show that, OK, we
saw it at one level,

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:36.810
looking at relative
telomere length,

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:39.300
but then we also saw
it at other levels

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:43.420
in the transcriptomics
and epigenetic studies.

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.250
So then we can kind
of get to, what

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:49.360
is the mechanism
behind what's going on?

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.060
The other thing which I
find very interesting being

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:57.130
in the Department of Psychiatry
is, in November of 2016,

00:52:57.130 --> 00:53:02.050
six months after Scott
Kelly returned home,

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.360
there was a spike in
the telomerase activity

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.430
of both brothers.

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:10.230
And this corresponded to
a very stressful event.

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:12.670
Their father had passed away.

00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:18.130
So our study captured this event
at the level of telomerase.

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:28.000
So for what it's
worth, this study

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.490
was able to capture events
on Earth as well as on space.

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:33.990
And then let's look at exercise.

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:39.630
Astronauts need to exercise to
maintain their body in space.

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:48.130
One of the pathways
that we looked at

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:50.590
was this lactic acid pathway.

00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:55.960
So, going back to
basic biochemistry,

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.910
if you start with
pyruvate, you can

00:53:57.910 --> 00:54:02.760
go through anaerobic
or aerobic metabolism.

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:06.175
If you go to anaerobic
metabolism to produce energy,

00:54:06.175 --> 00:54:07.870
you go to lactic acid.

00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:10.270
If you go the other
way, you go through

00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:14.600
a mitochondrial pathway.

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:21.860
What we saw was in-flight
increase in lactic acid.

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:23.860
So the question, though,
is what's going on?

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:28.272
Is it simply due to more
exercise up in space?

00:54:28.272 --> 00:54:29.980
Is there something
going on where they're

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:33.850
having lactic acid buildup?

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:35.600
Or is it a mitochondrial
dysfunction?

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.900
So we did some studies
in mitochondrial function

00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.120
and that's going
to be in the paper,

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.190
but let's look at the
simple stuff first.

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:51.170
Well we were interested
to see, well, what

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:52.640
was going on in this pattern?

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.390
This is just the
trajectory of lactic acid

00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:58.680
throughout the
course of the study.

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.500
So this is in-flight.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.156
It's pretty elevated up here.

00:55:03.156 --> 00:55:04.530
Does it have to
do with training?

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:07.430
Well we have to
get data from NASA.

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:09.100
And we just call
this [INAUDIBLE] data

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.720
and tells us everything
about the astronauts.

00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:14.240
But sometimes the
data is not complete,

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:17.300
and so we kind of experienced
this with the data

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:20.520
for exercise and physiology.

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:23.810
So we did what every
good researcher does.

00:55:23.810 --> 00:55:30.560
We went to Costco, we bought the
autobiography of our subject,

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:35.930
we read the book, and he did
say that he was exercising

00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:38.420
quite a bit-- six days a
week for at least a couple

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:44.230
of hours a day to prevent
all this bone loss and muscle

00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:45.340
atrophy.

00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:48.750
So he was exercising a lot.

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:50.230
But there was an
interesting event.

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:51.830
There was a dip here.

00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:54.430
We also read the
book and we found out

00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:59.270
that he sustained an injury
in his leg during this period

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:02.390
where he cut down
all this exercise.

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:05.810
And that manifested--
and we could detect that

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:08.825
and that decreased lactic acid.

00:56:08.825 --> 00:56:11.090
But then, before
landing, he needed

00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:13.880
to boost his
exercise so he could

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:18.620
deal with all the issues
with post-flight physiology,

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:22.760
so he started exercising
again and we detected that.

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:26.420
So we did capture
some of the events

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:32.491
of their regular
exercise physiology.

00:56:32.491 --> 00:56:33.115
Cardiovascular.

00:56:33.115 --> 00:56:34.760
The vascular.

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:39.100
We talked about this CIMT,
Carotid Intima Thickening.

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:41.030
In flight, he did--

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:44.240
so this is pre, post.

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:48.200
This is the CIMT measurements.

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.240
Baseline.

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:52.800
And the green is Mark Kelly.

00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.750
Elevated in flight.

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:58.660
Post-flight, brother's
about the same.

00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:01.330
He is still elevated on return.

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:08.510
And this also corresponds to
this carotid artery diameter.

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:11.980
You can see that it's
increased up here in flight.

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:18.350
So we found an increase
in collagen protein

00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:27.800
in the urine of
the flight samples.

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.710
Now collagen-- and
we hypothesized

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:33.890
that this increase in collagen
has to do with the fact

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:38.070
that collagen is an important
protein in the vasculature.

00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:41.000
It's also in the eye--
in the sclera of the eye.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.480
And all this remodeling that
occurs due to space flight,

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:48.350
this could be causing the
shift in collagen synthesis

00:57:48.350 --> 00:57:50.072
and elimination.

00:57:50.072 --> 00:57:51.530
And that's what we
might be seeing.

00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:54.420
It hadn't quite been
reported in other studies,

00:57:54.420 --> 00:58:02.250
so this was one of the first
novel findings of this study.

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:05.130
So this is an interesting
marker to look

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:09.790
at for some of these
physiological vascular events.

00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:10.610
Microbiome.

00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:14.800
This is Fred Turek's study.

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:17.950
The two dominant
bacterial groups,

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:20.920
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:26.680
People often study
the ratio F to Bs.

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:31.350
And what they found is that the
ratio increased during flight

00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:34.010
and returned back to
normal in the space twin.

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:39.370
In Earth, it was
relatively unchanged.

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:41.060
OK, so and then
the other findings.

00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:42.310
There's a lot of findings.

00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:48.130
We've got transcriptomic,
methylation data, cytokines,

00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:51.250
physiology, all sorts
of blood markers.

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:55.900
They're all integrated in
our Science article, which

00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.317
should be coming out very soon.

00:58:58.317 --> 00:58:59.650
We're supposed to get the cover.

00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:01.024
I don't know if
this is the cover

00:59:01.024 --> 00:59:04.640
but this is a kind of a
pilot cover that we have.

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:09.070
OK, so in summary, what
does our study show?

00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:15.640
We saw both transient
and persistent changes

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:22.000
associated with long-duration
spaceflight at the cell level,

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.440
in different cell types,
tissues, and in phenotypes.

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.680
And our study-- our
N equals 2 study--

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:33.730
will serve as a roadmap
for future studies aimed

00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:37.990
at understanding
potential health risks

00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:39.850
of long-duration spaceflight.

00:59:42.790 --> 00:59:46.180
NASA is planning on
sending more astronauts up

00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:49.390
in these long-duration six
months and one-year missions

00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:56.330
and they have had
an RFA and everybody

00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:58.310
applied to do these studies.

00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:02.270
We don't know whose
proposals they accepted.

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:04.980
That, we'll know in
February, as well.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:09.800
So hopefully we'll increase
our N and do similar studies.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.030
But there's ongoing studies.

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:15.320
We also do these simulated
spaceflight studies.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:19.460
And these simulated spaceflight
studies are bedrest studies.

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:27.530
So bedrest studies, you're
eliminating gravity.

01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:32.950
And then to kind of
simulate this fluid shift,

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:36.550
the individuals are
tilted headward downward

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:42.790
and they remain in this position
for 30 days, 60 days, 70 days.

01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:45.160
They eat like that,
they shower like that,

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.420
they do everything like that.

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:53.330
So I'm involved in
several of these studies.

01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:56.060
And then they have
studies in which they

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.940
have countermeasures, and the
last study I was involved in,

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:01.996
where they elevated CO2 for
30 days in these subjects.

01:01:01.996 --> 01:01:02.870
So they were having--

01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:06.650
they were at a higher
CO2 level as well.

01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:09.830
And then some of the
studies, they do exercise

01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:12.410
and you can see the difference
with these countermeasures

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:17.190
or testosterone on their bone
health and muscle health.

01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:20.060
So these are the samples
that I'm working on.

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:23.410
And these studies are
a little bit more--

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:26.060
you know, if anybody wants
to collaborate on studies,

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:28.730
I have the samples, and
they're more available

01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:32.312
than the twin study samples are.

01:01:32.312 --> 01:01:33.770
And of course the
studies like this

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:40.400
has a lot of Earth relevance for
individuals who are at bedrest

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.900
for aging issues or injuries.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:50.690
So in fact, one of
my colleagues has

01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:54.470
some of the countermeasures that
he's developed for astronauts

01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:59.540
is being used by our
university to help athletes

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.080
who have injuries as well.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:05.630
So there's a lot of
Earth implications

01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:08.690
that come out of
these NASA studies.

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:11.290
So I'm just going to
end with, if there

01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:13.250
are any students here--

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.440
graduate students,
postdocs, undergrads--

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.820
who are interested
in working with NASA,

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.760
NASA has a great program.

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.510
Just go on this intern.nasa.gov.

01:02:26.570 --> 01:02:28.730
They're taking applications
for the summer.

01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:30.950
I think it's due in April.

01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:33.410
And they're a great--

01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:37.490
you know, they're a
federal government unit

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:39.780
but they are fantastic.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:41.720
They are so efficient.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:42.890
I feel they are.

01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:45.230
They might not feel
like that themselves.

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:48.650
But you ask them for
anything, it's there.

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:49.530
It gets done.

01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:52.520
I mean, it's amazing.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.559
You always can call
somebody and get an answer,

01:02:55.559 --> 01:02:56.600
even during the Furlough.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.680
There was someone there.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.170
And then if you're a
researcher and you're

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:05.860
interested in space
studies, I encourage

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:07.722
you to go to this nspires site.

01:03:07.722 --> 01:03:09.055
It's not only the human studies.

01:03:09.055 --> 01:03:15.130
There are educational projects
available, educational grants,

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:21.970
and then also all the
physics and astronomy

01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:23.890
grants are available here.

01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:28.100
So I'm just going
to end with thanking

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:32.450
just my whole group, the two
studies that I'm involved with,

01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:35.810
and the overall group
and Scott and Mark Kelly,

01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:39.380
and just tell you that
we've had a lot of fun

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:43.542
together-- five years together
working together in Houston.

01:03:43.542 --> 01:03:45.500
Who would have thought
Houston could be so fun?

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.800
Hanging out, doing stuff.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.190
And in the course
of this project,

01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:58.590
two of our investigators
got some top awards.

01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:03.540
One of the top awards at
NASA is the Snoopy Award.

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:04.770
The Silver Snoopy Award.

01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:09.060
Mike Stenger, who was the PI
of the physiology on my study,

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:11.270
he was given the
Silver Snoopy Award.

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:12.180
And I was like, what?

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.054
Is that a real thing?

01:04:13.054 --> 01:04:15.036
I totally thought it was a joke.

01:04:15.036 --> 01:04:16.410
But then I looked
it up and like,

01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:19.410
oh my gosh, that's really cool.

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:25.350
And then Alan Hargens of course
gets one of the big awards

01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:26.700
that NASA has to give.

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.970
And then just, if you
haven't been to NASA,

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:31.830
I mean, you watch
these movies and they

01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:34.750
show NASA to look like
this amazing place.

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:38.640
It is an amazing place but
it doesn't look like this.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.510
It's the federal
government building.

01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:47.140
They still have the tiles
from 1950s, '60s, whatever.

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.020
It kind of looks like this.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.960
And this is the
cardiovascular lab there.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:57.389
But that's it, so
thanks for listening.

01:04:57.389 --> 01:05:00.263
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:05.427 --> 01:05:06.260
- Thank you, Brinda.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:08.360
That was great.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:12.830
We have a mic in the middle and
please line up behind the mic

01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:17.560
and ask questions to Brinda.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.440
- What was the story
about the genetic changes?

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.950
Were these epigenetic
methylations or?

01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:30.220
- Yeah, that story, that 7%
came from transcriptomics.

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:35.320
There was a change
in flight that just--

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.210
yeah, that's what it was.

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:44.266
RNA, so it was gene
expression changes.

01:05:44.266 --> 01:05:45.640
Yeah, so there
was a change, they

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:49.270
got that right, they just kind
of put that word "mutated" in

01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:51.550
and it scared everybody.

01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:53.560
- Hi.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.470
This was the first thing ever
that I listened about space

01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:58.500
and twin study and--

01:05:58.500 --> 01:05:59.860
OK, forget my story.

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:06.730
The question that I
have is, as a control,

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:09.970
what was the reason
or not the reason

01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:14.260
why the Earth control was
not given the same food

01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.750
as the space control?

01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:18.190
- Well that is--

01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:21.490
we tried, especially
for the microbiome,

01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:24.190
but if you're a retired
federal employee,

01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:26.780
do you want to eat space
food for two years?

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:28.030
We couldn't get him to comply.

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:31.810
We tried, like can you at
least just eat space food

01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:34.720
for that couple of days
before we do your sampling,

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.720
and the answer was no.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.700
- Even if you made the
statement that it's

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:42.140
for science, still no?

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:43.360
OK, fine.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.470
So I feel that it is a bit
less controlled for designs

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:50.770
where you're looking at
microbiome and stuff.

01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:54.040
The relation between
the gut bacteria,

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:56.410
which would be highly
influenced by the food

01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:58.180
that they are eating.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.700
So maybe I think
there are controls

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:05.080
to normalize with
respect to these aspects,

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.791
like the kind of food and
the nutrients that go in.

01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:08.290
- Yeah.

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:12.550
And not just in the
microbiome study.

01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:15.610
The metabolomic study,
it impacts that, too,

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:17.050
because a lot of
the metabolomics

01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:18.880
has to do with what you eat.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.100
And we realized that.

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:25.720
And we can combine this study
with other astronaut studies

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.626
and my bedrest studies, which
are actually more controlled.

01:07:29.626 --> 01:07:31.500
We know what they ate
in the bedrest studies.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:32.000
- OK.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.080
Regarding the
bedrest studies, what

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:40.000
do you think about something
which people use on Earth

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.370
as a rehabilitation procedure?

01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:46.570
They train some people
inside water, right?

01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:49.870
So how is it different
from the space

01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:53.380
to with gravity, and
I think in water,

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:55.400
the gravity is a
bit reduced, right?

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:55.900
- Yeah.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:08:02.020
They do have the buoyancy
studies as well, but buoyancy

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:02.831
studies are--

01:08:02.831 --> 01:08:04.330
you know, they're
difficult to do it

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.520
for a long period
of time, so that's

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.740
why we use the bedrest studies.

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:11.710
But the astronauts actually
do study in the buoyancy labs.

01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:15.980
- OK.

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.490
Just last question.

01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:18.560
OK, just last question.

01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:28.229
OK, so the ground
control, was he

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:31.649
like as isolated as
the space control?

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:33.210
- Oh, absolutely not.

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:34.439
He was living his life.

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:38.830
And in fact, I joke about him
being a normal middle-aged man

01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:39.330
on Earth.

01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:41.550
He is not a normal
middle-aged man on Earth.

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:43.899
He was flying all over
the United States.

01:08:43.899 --> 01:08:46.920
- That could completely change
the epigenetics and the way

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.510
mRNAs are produced [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:49.051
- That would.

01:08:49.051 --> 01:08:51.312
And that was part of what
we saw, the variation,

01:08:51.312 --> 01:08:52.770
but you know, in
general, we didn't

01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:57.930
see that much variation
in a lot of the proteins

01:08:57.930 --> 01:08:59.040
that I showed you.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:03.470
It was pretty consistent
throughout the two years.

01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.979
- Hi.

01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:05.359
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:08.329
I am an associate fellow at the
Aerospace Medical Association

01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:10.370
and President-elect of
the Aerospace Human Factor

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:12.680
Association.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.600
So I have a couple
of questions for you.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.479
The first is that
I'd like to know

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:20.779
your view on the
personalized countermeasure

01:09:20.779 --> 01:09:25.970
because we can't generalize
too much from two twins--

01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:28.910
well from a couple of twins.

01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:36.200
And then from your work,
can you extract some result

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:44.870
for personalized aging therapies
to rise [INAUDIBLE] population?

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:46.649
- Yeah.

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:50.220
From this study, like
you said, it's N equals 2

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.560
and it's just a first study.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:56.380
I think, in
combination with what

01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:59.860
we see here, with some of what
I saw on the bedrest studies--

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:03.590
I did metabolomics also.

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:08.030
I can put some of
that together and I

01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:11.540
think that will contribute
more to Earth science

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.590
than what I've shown here.

01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:20.650
- I was curious whether
you have discovered

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:25.120
from these many studies, whether
there's a minimal time you can

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:29.050
go into space, have these
molecular adjustments,

01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:31.600
but come back and
totally rebound?

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.970
I'm thinking, you know,
in future decades,

01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:36.010
we're going to have
regular people going up

01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:37.900
into space for vacations.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.570
So what's the
possibilities there?

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:43.000
Is there a minimal
time that you can

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.261
go up and be OK coming back?

01:10:45.261 --> 01:10:45.760
- Yeah.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.790
So I think the next group
of studies we're going to do

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:51.790
is going to help address that.

01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:57.190
They're sending 17 astronauts
up and doing similar studies.

01:10:57.190 --> 01:10:59.950
One-year mission,
six months missions.

01:10:59.950 --> 01:11:00.790
And we'll see.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:03.640
I mean, we saw a lot of
rebounding for the astronauts.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.000
One of the biggest issues
is the ocular issues.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.260
That may not rebound.

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:13.240
And right now, they
have to figure out how

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.200
to prevent that from happening.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.330
So eventually, hopefully they'll
find some countermeasures

01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:22.615
against it, and then
they can rebound.

01:11:22.615 --> 01:11:26.530
And you know, one of the
directors of the program

01:11:26.530 --> 01:11:28.180
gave a talk and
they said, it's not

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.030
what we know that scares us.

01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:32.230
It's what we don't know.

01:11:32.230 --> 01:11:35.560
And as they have more
one-year missions,

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.260
we'll see what other
effects we're going to see.

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:42.280
This is just one
astronaut what we saw.

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:44.830
Females and males may
respond differently.

01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:49.930
There may be issues that are
gender-specific, age-specific.

01:11:49.930 --> 01:11:50.786
- Thank you.

01:11:50.786 --> 01:11:52.770
- The last question.

01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:54.102
- Look at me.

01:11:54.102 --> 01:11:57.840
My name is [INAUDIBLE]
and I'm wondering,

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.760
you were talking
about the effects

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:03.470
that space has on their
eyes for the astronauts.

01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:06.690
From what I understand,
female astronauts,

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:09.331
they have less
effects on their eyes,

01:12:09.331 --> 01:12:10.830
so I'm wondering
if that is correct?

01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:12.690
If there are any
other changes that

01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:15.670
happens to male astronauts
and not females?

01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:19.440
And if that also means
that the first trip to Mars

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.650
will be an all-female mission?

01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:23.250
- Yeah.

01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:27.510
You know, I don't think
there is enough data yet

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:28.860
to know for sure.

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:32.610
You know, you did mention
that female astronauts

01:12:32.610 --> 01:12:35.460
have more issues with the
orthostatic intolerance right

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:36.930
now.

01:12:36.930 --> 01:12:39.690
So we do know there's
gender differences.

01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:44.970
Maybe certain physiological
effects are better in males

01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:47.800
and worse in females and
vise versa for other ones.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.760
So you know, time will tell.

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.860
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:56.210
