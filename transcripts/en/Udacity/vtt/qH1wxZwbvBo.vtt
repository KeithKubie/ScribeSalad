00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.051
So, we talked about domain, we've talked about range, we've talked about how we

00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:08.199
can impose domain restrictions on functions, depending on the situations in the

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:12.164
real world that they're involved in, and we've talked about overall function

00:00:12.164 --> 00:00:15.800
behavior. However, I still want to dig deeper. Let's take a look at this

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.091
function, g of x equals the square root of x. Now remember, that we just have a

00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:24.379
radical sign and no sign in front of it, it's implied that this is the positive

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:28.190
square root, this is not a plus or minus thing. Let's take a look at the graph

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.040
of this function. So, here's our graph of g of x equals the square root of x.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.442
Now, I could describe its behavior by saying that it's increasing from 0 to

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:41.140
infinity. But let's think back to the domain. So, what do you think the domain

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.159
of g of x is? All numbers between what and what?
