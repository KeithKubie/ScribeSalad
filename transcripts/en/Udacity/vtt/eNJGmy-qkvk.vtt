Let's test this again, and this time we study the weight of people.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'll give you a data set of weight, I ask you to do the histogram

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and answer a question about the most common weight category.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Here's a data set called the weight that you can look at,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and I want you to do a histogram for the weight that will look as follows.

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please go ahead to tell the computer to make this graph and hit the run button.
