00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
But being the maintainer of a popular software

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
also means you have to provide lots of support,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which meant that I got plenty of bug reports.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
These ranged from the absurd,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
as in DDD crashed, thought you'd like to know

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to the rather questionable,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
DDD crashed on our Cray.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I have enclosed a core dump.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Please be aware we're working on super-secret data here, so don't share.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Attachment: Core dump 50 MB.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Some of them were very questionable.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
DDD hangs on my new pets@home project.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
All files are enclosed.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Attached: home directory.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The home directory here actually included passwords

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and bank account information.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So much for free software.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
On some days I could easily get

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
dozens and dozens of such bug reports.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Some with helpful information, many without.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Of course, I would have been able to ask for

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
more information on each of these,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but then, you know, I wasn't exactly paid for the job.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Finally, I would set up DDD such that whenever it crashed,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
it would ask for vital information

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that I needed to reproduce the failure.
