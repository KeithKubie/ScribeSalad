00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.550
Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.879
He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:21.019
he grew up extremely close to his mother until
she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.600
Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.450
had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.680
(five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.840
By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.300
so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.340
Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.239
his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.239
 but because they couldn't quite.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.280
Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights:

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.360
One: Things are weirder than we think

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.239
Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.270
more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.810
becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.860
Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.880
At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.560
French seaside town, is on a tram.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.659
He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.220
basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.120
strikes him as deeply strange;

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.920
the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.170
its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.040
to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.660
Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.160
Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.159
of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.219
lent to us by our day-to-day routines.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.000
We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.080
know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.420
Under such a description, it all seems fairly
logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.660
surface normality to show the radical strangeness
lurking beneath.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.880
Dinner really means that:
when your part of the planet has spun away

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.000
from the energy of a distant hydrogen and
helium explosion,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.920
you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up
tree

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.100
and put sections of dead animals and plants
in your mouth and chew,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.700
while next to you, another mammal whose genitals
you sometimes touch is doing the same.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.820
Two: We are free

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.340
Such weird moments are certainly disorienting
and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.840
our attention to them for one central reason:
because of their liberating dimensions.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.300
Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s
also as a consequence far richer in possibilities.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.970
Things don’t have to be quite the way they
are.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.280
In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.120
the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.
Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.700
nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.200
Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.090
any moment.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.000
Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.200
Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living
without taking freedom properly on board.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.700
He called it BAD FAITH.

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.140
We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves
that things have to be a certain way and shut

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.019
our eyes to other options.

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.040
It is bad faith to insist that we have to
do a particular kind of work or live with

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.680
a specific person or make our home in a given
place.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.120
The most famous description of ‘bad faith’
comes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:59.200
notices a waiter who strikes him as overly
devoted to his role, as if he were first and

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.520
foremost a waiter rather than a free human
being.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.819
His movement is quick and forward, a little
too precise, a little too rapid. He comes

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.879
towards the patrons with a step that is a
little too quick. He bends forward a little

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.409
too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an
interest a little too solicitous for the order

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:16.709
of the customer…’

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.760
The man (he was probably modelled on someone
in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.650
himself that he is essentially, necessarily
a waiter rather than a free creature who could

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.990
be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North
Sea trawler.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.680
Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.980
The one factor that most discourages people from

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.529
experiencing themselves as free is money.
Most of us will shut down a range of possible

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:46.429
options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,
leaving a partner) by saying,

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:49.120
 ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.'

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.700
This passivity in the face of money enraged
Sartre at a political level. He thought of

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.419
capitalism as a giant machine designed to
create a sense of necessity which doesn’t

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.559
in fact exist in reality:

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.240
it makes us tell ourselves we have to work
a certain number of hours, buy a particular

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:06.689
product or service, and so on.

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:11.180
But in this, there is only the denial of freedom
– and a refusal to take as seriously as

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.420
we should the possibility of living in other
ways.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.660
It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.820
Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore
their freedom, by reducing the role played

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.510
in their lives by material considerations.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.580
Sartre took part in many protests in the streets
of Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.440
1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him
pardoned, saying,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.880
“you don’t arrest Voltaire.”

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.379
Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara
and admired them both deeply. As a result

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:49.279
of these connections and his radical politics,
the FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.639
to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might
really mean.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.140
Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that
things do not have to be the way they are.

00:05:57.149 --> 00:06:02.129
He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,
as individuals and as a species.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.159
He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:09.159
and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks
and ideas.

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.509
The admission that life doesn’t have some
preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:19.270
can be a source of immense relief when we
feel oppressed by the weight of tradition

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.750
and the status quo.
