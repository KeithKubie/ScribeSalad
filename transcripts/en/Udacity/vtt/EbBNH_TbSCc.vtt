00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Before we start answering the question of "What is motion?" or "How do we describe it?",

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
let's quickly go over why we want to learn about motion at all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well, first, understanding motion gives you an incredible predictive power.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Whether you want to know the path that a soccer ball takes as it flies to the goal

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
or the speed of the rollercoaster as it goes through a loop,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you will need to know about motion.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Second, this is an important tool to have in your physic tool belt.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The math and the physical techniques we used will be used throughout the class.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Finally, and this is the most important reason for me personally, is to solve one of the nature's puzzles.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There're so many facets of nature out there that are just begging

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to be understood, and motion is one of them.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Galileo Galilei did a lot to help us learn about motion, but before we jump into his contributions,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
let's talked a little bit about Aristotle, whose concept of motion

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
was widely accepted until Galileo came on the scene.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
To get some of these historical contexts, let's go to Florence, Italy,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
where we'll talk to Professor Thomas Settle, an expert in the field of Galileo,

00:00:55.000 --> 99:59:59.000
about some of this context.
