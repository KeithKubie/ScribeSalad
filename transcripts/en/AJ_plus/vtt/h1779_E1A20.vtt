00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.300
This is me making sushi ...

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.440
– Bam!

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.480
– ... for 20 people.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.220
Because I'm co-hosting a big iftar dinner.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.640
That's the meal where Muslims
break their fast at the end of the day

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.400
during Ramadan.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.440
And this Ramadan, 
for the first time in my life,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.640
I decided to fast.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.620
My name is Yara and I work at AJ+.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.520
Around the office, 
I noticed a lot of my coworkers

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.540
getting ready for the Muslim 
holy month of Ramadan,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.380
which, yes, on the outside means ...

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.100
no eating,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.980
no drinking,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.820
no smoking,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.820
and no sex

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.960
from dawn to dusk.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.180
(And try to avoid swearing and 
bad behavior throughout the month).

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.280
Fasting is not prescribed for anyone 
who's too young, too old,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.740
sick, traveling, pregnant, breast-feeding,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.620
or on their period.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.440
Ask your imam if fasting is right for you.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.280
Anyway ...

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.880
This has led some to think of Ramadan

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.940
as a sad, joyless month of quiet suffering.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.540
– So have a Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.020
and a solemn, dignified Ramadan.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.180
– People ask, like, 
“Oh my God, you're fasting?"

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.420
– “Oh, you have to not eat for a 
whole day? That's terrible!”

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.280
– They think it's almost like a punishment.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.140
– But as someone who comes from a Muslim background,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.340
I know that's not the case.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.100
I have tons of friends and relatives who fast

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.100
and who happily look forward to Ramadan every year.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.320
– For me it's joyous.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.060
– It's hella fun.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.280
– It's a time where everyone 
gets together.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.420
– I get to see people that 
I haven't seen in so long.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.720
– It's my favorite time of year.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.920
– That's how I know there's this whole other side to it.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.040
It's a holiday that's not only spiritual ...

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.520
It's celebratory, it's fun and it's all about community.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.520
– Ramadan Mubarak. – Thank you.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.840
– So this year, I figured I'd give fasting 
a shot for the first time ever

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.820
to explore that side of Ramadan.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.360
OK, so before I start fasting for Ramadan,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.640
there's one very important thing I need to do:

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.440
That's talking to my Muslim coworkers.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.440
– Lots of water. 
Hydrate. Hydrate at night.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.720
– It's about building your willpower.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.140
– I think you will persevere

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.640
and come to really appreciate it.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.220
– Ramadan is like the most social event of the year.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.060
– Oh yes. Ramadan in America in 2018 is a big deal.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.540
And there's a lot going on ... and a lot of memes.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.520
Before I attended any of these events,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.480
I had to talk to a Ramadan professional.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.140
I asked a lot of people for advice ...

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.280
like this Uber driver.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.880
– Avoid eating salty stuff.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.680
Help poor people. Feed hungry people.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.740
And an Imam.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.400
– Ramadan is the month during which 
the Quran has been revealed.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.480
It's a month of forgiveness, 
so we seek the forgiveness of our Lord

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.580
through our fasting,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.900
through prayers at night,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.140
through charity.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.800
– And now, with all these tips, I was ready to get started.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.340
The first thing I did was go shopping 
to prepare for a super important meal:

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.380
That's the other meal you eat during Ramadan,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.300
besides the iftar dinner.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.600
Think of it as breakfast. But at like 4 am.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.420
It's the very, very, very last time 
you can eat or drink

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.440
before the sun goes up.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.180
What tips do you have for what I should eat for suhoor?

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.920
– You're going to wake up, you're going to be exhausted,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.380
you're gonna eat a banana and go back to sleep.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.940
Because that's what happened with me.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.340
– But I was a bit anxious.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.960
So I spent the night at my friend's house, so he could show me the ropes

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.720
– Why are you filming me?

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.240
I feel very exposed.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.060
– That's Tabish.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.100
Dude's been fasting for like 15 years.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.580
Before I went to bed,

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.940
I drank responsibly ...

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.520
and then slowly drifted into sleep.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.240
Good morning.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.880
Agh, now we have to make this breakfast.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.180
[yawn]

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.800
Mmm ...

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.420
This is an incredible breakfast.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.380
And then, we sat ... and ate until dawn.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.160
Yeah, I can't talk to you. I have to eat.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.240
And I downed another two glasses of water.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.340
Yes

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.560
So now, I have to go back to bed.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.600
And so, my first day of fasting 
began in earnest.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.200
I definitely felt pangs of hunger.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.140
And I got tired.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.560
But it ebbed and flowed. 
And I sort of just got used to it,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.420
especially after I immersed myself in work.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.228
I'm not gonna lie: like a lot of other people,

00:04:18.228 --> 00:04:21.060
I did start counting down the hours 
until I could break my fast ...

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.380
3 hours left.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.560
I got to do it the way
that make my grandma proud.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.600
But it was nice knowing that I was counting down with a tiny community of fasters in the office

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.400
and an even bigger community of 
3.5 million Muslims in the U.S.,

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.720
and a gigantic community of about 
1.8 billion Muslims around the world.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.400
Even among Muslims in the U.S., 
fasting is super popular.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.340
Nearly twice as many American Muslims fast

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.140
compared to those who pray 5 times a day

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.180
Anyway, for me, fasting just got easier.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.900
It seemed like my body was adjusting.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.260
My metabolism slowed down, and I just
didn't need as much food as I thought I did.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.960
And despite being surrounded 
by food all day,

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.740
I felt a greater sense of self-control.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.720
It felt empowering.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.420
What I quickly learned is that Ramadan is just as much about eating as it is about fasting.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.080
Every night, you eat lots and lots of food

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.520
with lots and lots of people close to
your heart.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.780
After not eating for some 16-plus hours,

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.520
I sat down with friends, family, and people
from the local Muslim community,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.880
to share an enormous meal, 
and a conversation.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.360
I never had a single dinner alone, by myself,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.060
during the week I spent documenting this.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.740
And I made new friends in the process.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.600
And, for my first Ramadan, I even participated in the great American Muslim tradition ...

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.780
of going to IHOP

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.880
for suhoor

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.100
at 2:30 in the morning.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.640
– Raise your hand if you need
utensils.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.280
– Oh yes.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.120
But most days, my suhoor was something like this:

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.880
– I accidentally set my alarm for 3:30 pm,

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.860
which means I missed suhoor.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.420
I learned that one of the things I 
personally love most about Ramadan

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.420
is how it brings people together – 
people who might not otherwise see each other.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.020
It's just really, really wholesome.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.100
That was super clear to me when I went 
to a massive iftar in Fremont, California.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.420
There's something undeniably festive
about the Ramadan spirit.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.700
And I noticed it not at just this iftar, 
but at all the other ones I went to as well.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.240
It's like being here amongst all these people makes me feel and warm and fuzzy inside.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.100
Here's the thing, I don't want to make
Ramadan out to be just one big party, night after night.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.580
It's celebratory – and something people look forward to.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.000
But there's also this focus on training yourself to become a better person.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.260
That's why I headed to the local Islamic
Center in Oakland.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.040
– Fasting is recommended to know how 
somebody who is hungry feels.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.500
– That's Azita. She helps run things there.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.980
She's also just an all-around awesome human being.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.520
– I think Ramadan should also influence your actions.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.280
– So we packed food into boxes,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.700
Put on these rad stickers.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.960
And passed them out to homeless people nearby.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.840
It's honestly something I've never done before,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.600
just roll down the window and ask 
a homeless person if they wanted dinner.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
These are people whose struggles I couldn't even begin to imagine.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.300
I chose to fast, they did not.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.760
But in that moment, as I handed them a 
bottle of water or a to-go box of food,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.660
I felt a sense of shared humanity.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.900
You know, I've always been sort of hesitant about donating online,

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.920
but I don't know, that experience
pushed me to be more charitable.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.620
And I guess that's the idea of Ramadan, 
if you do something regularly for 30 days,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.600
chances are it will become a habit, 
even after Ramadan is over.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.100
I've never been the most spiritual 
or the most practicing Muslim,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.440
but Ramadan kind of inspired 
me to look inward.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.720
I went to mosques. 
I listened to the Quran.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.900
I spent some time meditating on my bed,

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.720
but, I don't know I just didn't feel 
comfortable recording myself

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.820
I kind of felt like I needed 
a spiritual advisor.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.300
So I hit up Imam Suhaib Webb.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.500
He converted to Islam 
when he was in college. Which means,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.520
just like me, he fasted for the 
first time in his 20s.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.660
– Every year I've fasted there's been kind of
maybe a different personal purpose, right?

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.980
So this year, like I'm trying to move to
zero-waste lifestyle,

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.660
where there's no plastics in my life 
and it's really, really hard

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.680
But then each of us, like yourself, 
there's this personal construction.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.620
So, I would ask you, what does it mean to you?

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.440
If I could come up with one word to define my experience this Ramadan, it would be:

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.180
– Community.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:15.680
– Community.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.180
– Community.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.060
– Community.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.640
– Ramadan is a time that brings people together, no matter what their background.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.140
– Pakistani.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.280
– Algerian.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:22.780
- Palestinian.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.320
– Iranian.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:23.840
– Pakistani.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.400
– Egyptian.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.160
– People who might not otherwise
see each other,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.180
who may be thousands of miles away from family,

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.110
who may have
differing views and differing beliefs,

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.480
but we all came together during Ramadan.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.180
We all fasted. We all bonded over our shared connection

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.540
to this cool club of 1.8 billion people.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.060
And that's the main reason 
I wanted to make this video.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.340
I wanted to show you that 
Ramadan to them, and to me,

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.080
isn't just solemn and
dignified and full of starvation.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.880
It's a month of celebration.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.000
You celebrate your faith, your friends, 
your family and your blessings.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.120
You celebrate the act of
helping others.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.540
And you get to take part in the 
most simple yet powerful celebration of all ...

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.660
getting together with people you love 
to break bread and make conversation.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.940
And that's why I'm off to another iftar.
