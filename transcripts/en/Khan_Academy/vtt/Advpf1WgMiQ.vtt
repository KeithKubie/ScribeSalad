00:00:00.215 --> 00:00:03.823
- [Narrator] When last we
left our English colonists

00:00:03.823 --> 00:00:07.958
at Jamestown, things were
finally starting to go their way.

00:00:07.958 --> 00:00:12.041
Lord Delaware had successfully
led English forces

00:00:13.698 --> 00:00:17.157
in their war of extinction
against the nearby

00:00:17.157 --> 00:00:19.893
Algonquin tribe, the Powhatans.

00:00:19.893 --> 00:00:23.476
And John Rolfe had
discovered that Virginia

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.449
was a perfect place to grow tobacco.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.330
So even though they didn't
find gold in Virginia,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.042
they found something
that was almost as good

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:41.870
and that was a luxury
commodity that people in Europe

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.094
were very eager to buy.

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:47.686
But, tobacco was
incredibly labor-intensive

00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:49.353
to grow and process.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.599
So, in this video, let's
talk a little bit more about

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:58.209
what that need for labor
meant as the Virginia colony

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:59.625
began to grow.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:03.801
Now in the last video, I
mentioned that the very first ship

00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:07.968
bearing enslaved Africans
arrived in Jamestown in 1619.

00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:15.188
So, just twelve years
after Jamestown was founded

00:01:15.188 --> 00:01:18.398
Africans had been brought to the area.

00:01:18.398 --> 00:01:22.871
So this shows that enslaved
Africans were some of the very

00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:27.038
first people who weren't of
native origin in the new world

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.058
and would help shape the
English colonies pretty much

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:33.725
from the very start.

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:39.282
But even though there were
enslaved Africans in Virginia

00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:41.408
that early,

00:01:43.524 --> 00:01:46.691
the system of broad race-based slavery

00:01:47.814 --> 00:01:51.142
that will really characterize
the American South up until

00:01:51.142 --> 00:01:54.350
the Civil War didn't
get started right away

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.150
and there were a couple
of reasons for that.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.114
One was, as we mentioned many
times, it was not particularly

00:02:01.114 --> 00:02:03.945
healthy to live in this area.

00:02:03.945 --> 00:02:08.112
You can see here, this is
pretty much all a giant swamp,.

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:12.204
To this day some people joke
that one of the reasons that

00:02:12.204 --> 00:02:16.403
Washington DC was founded
here in this area of Virginia

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:19.069
is that it is so unpleasant to be there,

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.860
they thought it would keep the
American government smaller

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.075
because legislators
wouldn't actually want to go

00:02:25.075 --> 00:02:26.307
to the Capitol.

00:02:26.307 --> 00:02:30.474
So a pretty good number of
people who came to the new world

00:02:31.486 --> 00:02:36.208
in the early years died of
mosquito borne diseases.

00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:40.375
So swamp, standing water,
mosquitoes, leads to epidemics.

00:02:42.012 --> 00:02:45.188
So, say I'm an English
planter, and I want to plant

00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:48.987
a lot of tobacco, many acres of tobacco.

00:02:48.987 --> 00:02:51.028
So I'm going to need
some people to help me.

00:02:51.028 --> 00:02:52.476
Now I have some choices.

00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:56.143
I could purchase an
enslaved African person,

00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:00.506
from one of these ships,
and that might cost me

00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:02.089
hundreds of pounds.

00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:05.324
Slaves are pretty expensive,

00:03:05.324 --> 00:03:09.491
and since it's such an unhealthy
environment in this area,

00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:14.668
there is a reasonable chance
that any person that I purchase

00:03:15.718 --> 00:03:18.029
might die within a year or so,

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:19.511
and then I'd lose my investment.

00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:23.678
So, this is a pretty cruel and
terrible form of economics,

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:27.813
but if you're a planter
in this time period,

00:03:27.813 --> 00:03:29.646
this is exactly how your thinking.

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:32.149
Now, my other option for help

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.731
is to bring over white
laborers from England

00:03:35.731 --> 00:03:39.365
and these are called indentured servants.

00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:43.532
So, perhaps there is a
young man living in London,

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.084
he has lots of older brothers,

00:03:47.084 --> 00:03:48.789
so he's not going to inherit anything,

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:53.030
he doesn't have much in the
way of economic opportunity,

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.645
so he thinks I could go for a new start,

00:03:55.645 --> 00:03:58.510
in the New World, but
I don't have the money

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.702
to pay my passage on a
ship across the Atlantic.

00:04:01.702 --> 00:04:04.190
So, what the planters would
do, is they would say,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.681
alright, I will pay your
fare across the Atlantic,

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.348
and maybe that's 15 pounds, say,

00:04:12.507 --> 00:04:17.109
and in exchange you will
work for me for a period of,

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.501
say three to seven years.

00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:21.963
Some indentures were shorter
than that, some were longer,

00:04:21.963 --> 00:04:24.724
but this is kind of a
general guideline of how long

00:04:24.724 --> 00:04:25.813
they might work.

00:04:25.813 --> 00:04:29.286
And at the end of that
three years, you will get

00:04:29.286 --> 00:04:33.036
land of your own and
I'll give you some tools

00:04:34.568 --> 00:04:36.079
and clothes.

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:38.160
Things you need to succeed.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.936
And then you can be your own planter.

00:04:40.936 --> 00:04:45.791
So this was a pretty good
investment, if you were

00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:49.821
a young person without many
opportunities in England.

00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:52.791
There's only one problem and
it's the same problem we've

00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:54.653
been talking about all along,

00:04:54.653 --> 00:04:57.437
is that this is a swamp full of mosquitoes

00:04:57.437 --> 00:05:01.104
and you are quite likely
to die in Virginia.

00:05:02.094 --> 00:05:05.702
So this actually turned out
to be a pretty good deal

00:05:05.702 --> 00:05:08.393
for the planters who were there early.

00:05:08.393 --> 00:05:09.949
They also took advantage
of something called

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.699
the headright system.

00:05:12.548 --> 00:05:15.381
Which meant that they got 50 acres

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.484
of land in Virginia, and of course

00:05:21.484 --> 00:05:23.724
this is just Native Americans land that

00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:25.763
they're just appropriating for themselves,

00:05:25.763 --> 00:05:27.779
but that's a whole separate issue.

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.279
So you got 50 acres more land,

00:05:31.826 --> 00:05:35.171
every time you brought one
person over from England.

00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.475
So if you could afford to
bring more and more of these

00:05:38.475 --> 00:05:42.642
indentured servants over from
England, you could amass huge,

00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:46.871
huge amounts of property.

00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:50.247
Just gigantic tobacco plantations.

00:05:50.247 --> 00:05:55.068
And in early on in the history
of indentured servitude,

00:05:55.068 --> 00:05:57.151
very few of the servants,

00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:01.057
a pretty small percentage,

00:06:01.057 --> 00:06:04.939
actually lived to finish their indenture

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:09.358
and to make good on this
promise of land for themselves

00:06:09.358 --> 00:06:12.256
and tools and clothes to get started.

00:06:12.256 --> 00:06:16.760
So this very quickly, begins
to build a social structure

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.260
in Virginia, where there are few planters,

00:06:22.151 --> 00:06:24.318
who are extremely wealthy,

00:06:25.914 --> 00:06:27.581
who own lots of land

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:34.807
and then there's everybody else.

00:06:34.807 --> 00:06:37.676
There's a large number
of indentured servants,

00:06:37.676 --> 00:06:41.700
who've only been there
for a couple of years,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.796
who may or may not live to see out the end

00:06:44.796 --> 00:06:46.844
of their indenture.

00:06:46.844 --> 00:06:50.011
So this is kind of a large lower class

00:06:51.276 --> 00:06:55.026
and then there are a
handful of small farmers

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.099
who managed to live through
their period of indenture

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:02.730
and are now getting started on their own

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.345
and then there's just a tiny smattering of

00:07:06.345 --> 00:07:10.512
enslaved Africans, so just
a few slaves in Virginia.

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:14.636
This is in the early years of the 1600s.

00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:18.492
So how do we get from a
world where the vast majority

00:07:18.492 --> 00:07:22.404
of workers in the southern
part of what will become

00:07:22.404 --> 00:07:26.922
the United States, are
white, to a world where

00:07:26.922 --> 00:07:31.012
the vast majority of people
working on plantations

00:07:31.012 --> 00:07:33.484
were enslaved black Africans.

00:07:33.484 --> 00:07:36.431
We'll talk more about
that in the next video.
