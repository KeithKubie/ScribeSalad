[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.784 --> 00:00:07.950
KATE LEAHY: Thank you for
such a nice, warm welcome.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.280
It's wonderful to be at this
campus on such a beautiful day.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.680
We're so spoiled
in the Bay Area.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.110
So again, my name is
Kate Leahy, and I'm

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.580
a San Francisco based cookbook
author and food writer.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.070
Desmond, I think what's
one of the great stories

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.170
is how you ended up
owning a restaurant called

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.940
Burma Superstar to begin with.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.235
DESMOND TAN: Well, I
didn't name the name--

00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:31.110
I didn't name the
restaurant Burma Superstar.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.950
I purchased it from a gentleman
who operated Burma Superstar.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.690
It was a failing
Burmese restaurant.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.420
It just happened one
day, I was eating there

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.810
on Saturday
afternoon about 1:00.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.330
And someone walked in, and he
was a little bit hysterical,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.970
and then just found out that
Burma Superstar was sold.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.630
I'm thinking, shit, what
am I going to eat now?

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.850
And in those days, there
were no Burmese restaurants.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.739
There was Burma Superstar,
and there was Mandalay.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.780
And I can think of another one
in Philadelphia, one in DC,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.580
two in New York,
and that was it.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.310
And no one knew Burma.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.010
No one knew Burma Superstar,
Burmese food, or anything.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.260
So to make the long story
short, I was just thinking,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.800
OK, you know, like, I
wanted to know what's going

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.290
to happen to the restaurant.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.680
I got the owner's
phone number to see

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.860
if he might be interested
in selling it to me

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.105
so that I could keep it
as a Burmese restaurant.

00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:42.390
It was sold to a
Chinese gentleman.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.300
I think he was going to turn
that into a Chinese restaurant.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.170
So my conversation with him was,
can you back out of the deal?

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.640
So I could pay you maybe a
little bit more, 10%, 15%.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.280
And what he said
was, OK, hang on.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.730
Let me see what I can do.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.410
So on the next day--

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.090
I went there on
Saturday, Sunday-- he

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.050
called me back about at 10:00
PM, when I was in my office.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.880
And he said, hey,
you know, there

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.820
might be a way where I
could get out of the deal,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.370
and come and take a look at it.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.990
So I made arrangements
to go look

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.520
at the restaurant on Monday.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.200
And if you're looking at a hole
in the wall place, that was it.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.040
I mean, that was really
a hole in the wall.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.860
KATE LEAHY: Well,
because one of the things

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.734
was, at that time,
Clement Street,

00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:28.650
that part of Clement
Street, was really quiet.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.780
No one went onto that
part of Clement Street

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.302
to go out to eat, right?

00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:34.010
It was just the quiet
side of the street.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.468
DESMOND TAN: It
was the quiet side.

00:02:35.468 --> 00:02:39.300
There were cafes, and I think
there were young kids that

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.190
hangs out after school.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.160
Yeah, I would say Clement
Street was a second Chinatown.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.190
And it was in a busy space.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.330
I'd simply just wanted a Burmese
restaurant to stay Burmese,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.840
and to eat Burmese food
with my family and friends.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.420
So I went there on
Monday, looked at it,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.770
and thought about it, and
called him back on Tuesday.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.945
And on Wednesday, we
have a restaurant.

00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:11.310
So it was funny.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.000
Pretty quick-- that all happened
within, I think, four days.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.400
KATE LEAHY: And
that was in 2000?

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.150
And the restaurant was
originally opened--

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.320
DESMOND TAN: Yeah, in 2000.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.920
KATE LEAHY: --in 1992.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.210
So it had been operating--

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.251
DESMOND TAN: Seven years.

00:03:22.251 --> 00:03:23.640
KATE LEAHY: Yeah, but--

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.039
because you grew up in--

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:27.330
well, part of your growing
up was in the inner Richmond

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.410
neighborhood in San Francisco.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.840
But the other part
was in Yangon.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.730
DESMOND TAN: In Yangon, right.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.580
Yeah, I mean, also growing up,
because there were no Burmese

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.810
food, the only Burmese food
I would get would be from

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.120
my mom's.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.890
And I didn't cook,
and I don't cook.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.990
And my mom would ask me,
what will you eat when I die?

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.380
And now, we have
six restaurants.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.830
She doesn't ask me
that question anymore.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.860
KATE LEAHY: That's true.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.360
Right.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.300
Because when you were growing
up, before you came to the US,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.800
it was all the girls
who would learn

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.790
how to cook in the kitchen.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.081
And the boys were off the hook.

00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:06.432
So you just learned how
to be a really good eater.

00:04:06.432 --> 00:04:07.640
DESMOND TAN: A good cleaner--

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.490
KATE LEAHY: And
good cleaner, yeah.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.270
DESMOND TAN: --a
good cleaner, right.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.430
I learned about
food just basically

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.940
from eating, eating a lot of
it, and just understanding

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.460
the flavors.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.209
KATE LEAHY: What are
the kind of, for you,

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.554
what are the most nostalgic
flavors about Burmese food,

00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:22.470
the kind of things when
you smell or you taste

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.770
it or you just think that,
that really reminds me

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.910
of your childhood?

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.410
DESMOND TAN: It
will be the curries.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.170
Curries are a little bit
different from Chinese curries,

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.880
Korean curries, Indian curries.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.730
I think the closest
to Burmese curry,

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.170
I mean, if I have
to compare, would

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.660
be Southern Indian curries,
light, a little bit

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.390
lighter in flavor,
masala, spicy.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.980
But the other one
would be a mohinga,

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.630
which is a catfish
stew-like type of dish,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.430
served with noodles.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.050
And it's a dish that you
stew for a couple of hours,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.652
the catfish, until the
catfish is broken down.

00:05:05.652 --> 00:05:07.860
Maybe you could explain a
little bit more about that.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.318
KATE LEAHY: Yeah,
well, what I love

00:05:09.318 --> 00:05:12.040
about the story about mohinga
is that people order this dish.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.770
It's sort of a
sleeper on the menu.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.280
It's a quieter dish.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.672
But when you go
to visit Myanmar--

00:05:18.672 --> 00:05:21.130
I mean, and we should probably
talk a little bit about just

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.630
the name, just to clarify.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.199
So when you lived in that
country, it was called Burma.

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:25.990
DESMOND TAN: Burma.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.300
KATE LEAHY: And you had
already moved to the US.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.690
And then the government
changed the name to Myanmar.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.060
So in the cookbook, when
we refer to your childhood,

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.200
we talk about Burma.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.770
When we refer the country in
present day, we say, Myanmar.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.410
And one of the reasons,
though, is in 2012,

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.840
President Obama actually
called the country Myanmar.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.770
And that started a change
in Western countries,

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.950
referring to the
country as Myanmar.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.360
But back to something more fun--

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.940
mohinga.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.505
When you go visit Yangon,
the first thing you see

00:05:57.505 --> 00:05:58.840
is all the street vendors.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.460
It's mohinga.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.294
It's like the pho.

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:03.460
It's like you see-- it's a
very popular street food.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.501
You eat it for breakfast.

00:06:04.501 --> 00:06:07.540
Now you eat it for lunch and
dinner, it's become so popular.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.290
But it's really relatively
unknown in the United States.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.090
And no one's really
heard of mohinga.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.760
People come in for good
reason at Burma Superstar

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.440
to order the tea leaf salad.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.054
But mohinga kind
of gets left aside,

00:06:20.054 --> 00:06:21.470
because you don't
know what it is.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.430
So when people order it, they
think, oh, I'm getting catfish.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.860
And then they get it, and
they go, well, where's the--

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.250
DESMOND TAN: Yeah,
where's the beef?

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.166
KATE LEAHY: --catfish?

00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:29.170
Yeah, where's the beef?

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.180
So I learned how to prepare it.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.790
I watched a couple of the
cooks in the restaurants,

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.480
as well as an aunt of Desmond's.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.570
And I saw how they
prepared mohinga.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.220
And there's lots
of ways to do it.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.620
But the key is you
get a whole catfish,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.270
and that becomes the base of the
broth, the stock that you make.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.470
And you cook that catfish.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.670
Then you take the meat off.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:52.630
You put the bones back.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.540
You simmer that.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.000
You strain that broth.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.136
And then you take
the catfish meat

00:06:58.136 --> 00:06:59.260
and cook it with aromatics.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.940
And all of it gets
combined, but you're

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.550
kind of crushing
the catfish meat.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.227
So the soup is thick and rich.

00:07:05.227 --> 00:07:06.310
You won't see the catfish.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.560
But it's definitely in there.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.730
But it's just that it's a really
rich, soul-satisfying dish

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.760
of noodles, broth, catfish.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.380
And in other parts of Myanmar,
they have their own variation.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.880
There's local
variations everywhere.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.620
DESMOND TAN: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.578
KATE LEAHY: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:23.578 --> 00:07:25.450
So in the cookbook,
we decided it

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.780
was such an important
dish for the country,

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:29.860
that we included two.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:35.480
So you have your option of doing
a spicier, more seafood-based.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.730
You don't have to use catfish.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:41.830
You could use more of
a seafood type of fish.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.424
I mean, the fish
you get locally is

00:07:45.424 --> 00:07:46.840
so different from
the fish you get

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.130
in other parts of
the world, that you

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.450
can be flexible with the fish.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.040
But the aromatics
are what change

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.520
from the Rakhine mohinga,
where Rakhine is a state--

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.420
DESMOND TAN: Coastal.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.500
KATE LEAHY: Yeah, coastal state.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.450
And they're cut off from
the rest of the country

00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:59.616
with this wall of mountains.

00:07:59.616 --> 00:08:02.350
So they use a lot more
seafood in their cooking.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.180
And their cooking
is a lot spicier.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.180
So we put a lot of
chilies in there.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.280
It's a lovely broth.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.980
It's just two
different variations.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.800
And if you look at the
cookbook, the back cover

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.480
is the Rakhine mohinga.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.300
And then within the
cookbook, the picture

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.940
that has the sort of
an essay on mohinga,

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.500
that's the classic,
Burma Superstar version.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.380
That would be the version that
would be inspired by Yangon.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.880
But it's your
favorite dish, right?

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.912
DESMOND TAN: It is,
curries, coconut rice.

00:08:33.912 --> 00:08:35.245
KATE LEAHY: And your daughter's.

00:08:35.245 --> 00:08:36.870
DESMOND TAN: Yeah,
my daughter eats it.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.049
This is her favorite dish also.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:43.380
Rather than what I think
that people want to hear,

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.380
are there any questions
that people want to ask?

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.963
KATE LEAHY: Well,
one thing I'll ask--

00:08:46.963 --> 00:08:49.210
well, let's actually talk
about how the recipes came

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.030
to be in the cookbook, because
I think this is something

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.050
that we joke about a lot when
I started working with you.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:02.050
DESMOND TAN: Yeah, so when
we started working with Kate,

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.516
Kate would ask me, can
I see the recipe book?

00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:08.650
I'd say, we actually
don't have a recipe book.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.480
And then Kate wouldn't
believe that we

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.870
don't have a recipe book.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.656
And we actually don't,
considering that we

00:09:15.656 --> 00:09:16.780
have all these restaurants.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.670
And I think it's
a funny situation.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.770
Because we have a lot
of people who've been

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.860
with us for 10, 15, 20 years.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:31.150
And they know how to
do different stations,

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.640
do different things.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.600
And we've never had any
problems with having

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.480
the food to be consistent,
because they've just been there

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.070
for a while.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.900
They know exactly what to do.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.880
And we've never
had a need for it.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.165
So Kate came on.

00:09:46.165 --> 00:09:48.069
All of a sudden, we
have a recipe book.

00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:49.110
KATE LEAHY: Right, right.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.980
So at lot of times,
when I start working

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:56.440
with a chef on a
cookbook, these chefs,

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.020
they have their recipes
written down in some fashion.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.550
Some cookbooks--
I mean, some chefs

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.800
have them written
in just a notebook.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.750
And then I have to
look at all their--

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.990
I have to figure out
what their shorthand is.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.190
Like one chef I worked with,
Mindy Segal, in Chicago--

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.340
she's a pastry chef--

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.870
and she would just write
V-E-X. It's like, what's V-E-X?

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.820
She's like, oh, that's
pure vanilla extract.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.700
It's like, all right, so vex.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.120
Now, I think vex and vanilla.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.070
All right, I'm fine.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.200
But I didn't even
have that to work off.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.765
So other chefs have
these long spreadsheets

00:10:28.765 --> 00:10:31.140
of all the different variations
you can do with the dish,

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.100
and it's all measured
out to the gram.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.250
And with those kinds
of recipes, what

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.680
I do is I have to cut
them down and make sure

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.960
you can do that in a
portion that serves 4 to 6

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.480
instead of 20 to 50.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.470
So this time, though, I just
had to go into the restaurants

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.380
and meet with the
different cooks.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.940
And that's the
one thing, though.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.960
There's not one chef
of all the restaurants.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.669
There are kitchen
managers and cooks.

00:10:55.669 --> 00:10:57.210
And all these cooks
are cross-trained

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.970
on all the stations.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.940
And what's fascinating is all of
them speak different languages.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.950
Even the ones who
came from Myanmar

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.610
speak different local languages.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.995
Because the country, which
is pretty fascinating--

00:11:10.995 --> 00:11:13.500
I mean, I didn't know this,
coming in from the outside--

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.910
there's 135 ethnic
groups in Myanmar

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.230
that are officially recognized.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.430
And there's a lot more
that go unrecognized.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.600
So you have a very,
very diverse population.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.460
I mean, so it's almost
like an Asian melting pot.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.960
DESMOND TAN: Where it's
situated is interesting,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.440
because it's right
between India and China.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.106
Really it's where
China meets India.

00:11:37.106 --> 00:11:40.690
On one side, you have a
billion plus population.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.846
On the other side, you still
have over a billion population.

00:11:43.846 --> 00:11:44.970
So it's really interesting.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.230
And just from that
alone, that put aside,

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.970
there are about 130
different ethnic groups

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:55.770
and a lot of Indian
immigration in the early 1900s,

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.860
because of the
huge economic boom.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.320
When the English
took over, I think

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.210
there were a couple
of millions of Indians

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.180
that immigrated in
the early 1900s.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.382
But also, Chinese immigrated
around that time, a couple

00:12:09.382 --> 00:12:10.590
hundred thousand [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:17.070
And around that time,
the Burma was the--

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:21.990
Yangon port was the most
prosperous port country

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.070
really in that region.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.470
Because around that
time, of a lot of people

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:25.610
went over to Burma.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.276
KATE LEAHY: I mean,
before World War II,

00:12:27.276 --> 00:12:29.640
the biggest rice
exporter in the world

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.599
was Burma, which is just
kind of crazy to even fathom.

00:12:32.599 --> 00:12:33.390
DESMOND TAN: Right.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:37.635
So the diversity
with the population--

00:12:37.635 --> 00:12:40.320
and just because Burmese
food is interesting.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.430
Because the Burma borders
Thailand, India, China,

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.310
Bangladesh, and so forth, you
get a lot of different spices

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.470
from those places.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:54.630
And at the same time, Burmese
food is uniquely Burmese.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.300
The tea leaf salad, mohinga,
that you can't get anywhere.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.860
But then there are
a lot of dishes

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.720
that will remind
you of Thai food,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.910
the Indian food, Chinese
food, and so forth.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.830
KATE LEAHY: And one thing
I like about the recipes

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.880
is that a lot of them
are very doable at home.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.900
This is home cooking, but then
was remade to fit a restaurant.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.030
So what we talked
a lot about was

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.000
how to reintroduce
it to home cooking.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.750
And if anyone's ever looked at
a Thai curry recipe that had,

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.600
I don't know, 100 ingredients,
and you make this paste,

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.460
this is sort of a nice
respite from that.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.030
You can make this, and you
don't need to source a lot

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.470
of hard to find ingredients.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.490
If you have onions and garlic
and turmeric and paprika,

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.720
you can go pretty
far with this book,

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.180
which there are the exceptions.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:43.140
But in general, a lot
of the flavor profiles,

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.660
you can find at most
local grocery stores,

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.690
now that fish sauce is
so widely available.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.610
And fish sauce-- shrimp paste
might be a little harder.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.120
But it's not in every recipe.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.050
And I know sometimes,
it's an acquired taste.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.100
But it really is such-- like
shrimp paste, the salty--

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.420
DESMOND TAN: Spicy.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.066
KATE LEAHY: --spicy, savory
flavors are really what, to me,

00:14:04.066 --> 00:14:05.190
I think of as Burmese food.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.260
It doesn't have
the sweet flavors

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.212
that you might think
of in Thai cooking.

00:14:09.212 --> 00:14:10.670
DESMOND TAN: Yeah,
I think the fish

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.389
sauce are popping up everywhere
nowadays, with the Red Boat.

00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:16.680
KATE LEAHY: And well, Italians
are putting fish sauce--

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.330
DESMOND TAN: Yeah, I know.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:17.600
KATE LEAHY: --in their
tomato sauce now.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.833
DESMOND TAN: And shrimp
paste might be nice.

00:14:19.833 --> 00:14:25.710
I think just how much you put in
it, I think, with Burmese food,

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:26.970
people use it.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.360
And it is very flavorful
and really pungent.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.330
And I'm not sure
people have adopted

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:38.430
to the shrimp past flavors, but
I think a lot of people are--

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.400
they're traveling, they're
tasting, they're trying.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.340
And I'm seeing that at
local stores everywhere.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.340
KATE LEAHY: One thing I
wanted to ask you about,

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.080
too, is just--

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.820
let's talk about tea leaf salad.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.920
I mean, it's something that
Burma Superstar is known for.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.680
It's something that,
I don't know, was--

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.610
you explain it-- maybe
a Samsonite ingredient

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.010
for many years?

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.210
The country was closed
off from the world.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.311
You couldn't legally export
something from Myanmar

00:15:06.311 --> 00:15:07.560
straight to the United States.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.476
It had to go through
these different channels.

00:15:09.476 --> 00:15:13.900
DESMOND TAN: So because Burma
was a sanctioned country

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.980
for the last 50, 60 years,
you couldn't get anything out

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.750
of Burma.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.670
So if you received
products from Burma,

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.420
it might be a product
of Thailand or Malaysia

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.560
or Singapore,
India, and so forth.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.930
Because normally, it
will go to those states

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:34.450
or those countries, and from
there, the country of origin

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.100
disappears.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.410
It becomes a product
of Thailand, Singapore,

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.810
and so forth.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.940
So the way that we've
been getting the tea

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.320
leaf, in the past, was
whoever goes back to Burma,

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.540
bring back some tea leaf salad.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.600
And bring them back
with their luggages.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.975
KATE LEAHY:
Samsonite ingredient.

00:15:53.975 --> 00:15:59.710
DESMOND TAN: And thanks
to the tea label,

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.410
I think that we've been
able to just get the product

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:03.285
without any problems.

00:16:03.285 --> 00:16:04.784
KATE LEAHY: But how
did you do that?

00:16:04.784 --> 00:16:06.970
How did you find the right
people to be able to?

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.970
DESMOND TAN: Well, it became
a pretty lucrative business

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:10.630
for them.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.830
We own several restaurants.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:17.514
We started selling just a lot
of tea leaves in our restaurant.

00:16:17.514 --> 00:16:19.930
KATE LEAHY: Tell me about the
where the tea leaf is grown.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.575
DESMOND TAN: The tea
leaf that we were getting

00:16:23.575 --> 00:16:25.260
are not the best quality.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.550
I think the coloring
that they use

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.020
to keep it green was
questionable; preservatives.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:35.087
And I love MSG, but in those
packets, they were 10%, 15%.

00:16:35.087 --> 00:16:36.670
That was a little
bit too much for me.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.390
And we wanted to give our
customers a better product.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.152
So we started looking around.

00:16:47.152 --> 00:16:49.360
We started looking around
and asked different people,

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.150
how do you make
the tea leaf salad?

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.090
And what's really interesting
is that the tea leaf

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.530
salad is ubiquitous in Burma.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.900
Everybody, they all eat it.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.800
They eat it for a
snack; kids, adults.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.390
You go there.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.580
You see that everywhere.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.450
How many people have
been to Burma in here?

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.867
KATE LEAHY: Did you see the
tea leaf salad there, or a tea

00:17:09.867 --> 00:17:10.574
leaf, in general?

00:17:10.574 --> 00:17:11.176
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:11.176 --> 00:17:12.550
DESMOND TAN: So
everybody eat it.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.285
It's everywhere.

00:17:14.285 --> 00:17:16.410
KATE LEAHY: I remember
seeing it in the snap packs.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.730
You get tea leaf itself--

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.109
lahpet as they call
it in Myanmar--

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.536
but the tea leaf salads
in these little snack

00:17:22.536 --> 00:17:24.619
packs, that you could think
of like someone buying

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:26.140
a pack of chips,
but instead, they're

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.306
buying a pack of tea leaves.

00:17:27.306 --> 00:17:30.055
Then they will just
throwing in the crunchies,

00:17:30.055 --> 00:17:31.782
the fried garlic,
maybe some peanuts.

00:17:31.782 --> 00:17:33.240
DESMOND TAN: That's
their caffeine.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.170
KATE LEAHY: Yeah,
that's your caffeine.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.485
So here are students studying.

00:17:35.485 --> 00:17:36.776
DESMOND TAN: A savory caffeine.

00:17:36.776 --> 00:17:39.270
KATE LEAHY: Just get a
little packet of tea leaf.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.210
DESMOND TAN: So
we asked everybody

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:44.275
in San Francisco,
Burmese people,

00:17:44.275 --> 00:17:45.400
how do you ferment the tea?

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.399
How do you make the tea?

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:47.360
Nobody knows.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.305
So we went to Yangon.

00:17:48.305 --> 00:17:49.096
How do you make it?

00:17:49.096 --> 00:17:49.750
Nobody knows.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.110
It's just really strange.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:55.010
Everybody eat it, but they
don't know how it's made.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.130
And if you have any
Burmese friend, ask them.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.550
I challenge you, that they
will know how it's done.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.620
So anybody from Burma here?

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.220
Nobody.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.240
OK.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.050
So we ended up in
the Shan state,

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:12.790
which is a very conflicted
area and one of the largest

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.150
ethnic region in Burma.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.610
They want their
independent state.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.600
The North want their
own independence.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.760
The South, they want
their own independence.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.840
It's a fairly
remote jungle area.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.610
And then you have
these drug warlords

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:29.300
who wants their own area.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.730
KATE LEAHY: It's part of
the Golden Triangle region.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:31.521
DESMOND TAN: Right.

00:18:31.521 --> 00:18:33.810
And then the Burmese
government, they are all--

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.301
there are four military groups.

00:18:35.301 --> 00:18:36.550
They're always there fighting.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.141
So it's an interesting
area to go.

00:18:39.141 --> 00:18:41.390
KATE LEAHY: Interesting is
a good way to put it, yeah.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.723
DESMOND TAN: So, well, that's
where we get our tea from.

00:18:43.723 --> 00:18:47.820
So we go up to the most
northern part of Shan state,

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.020
a region called
Namhsan just arguably

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:54.250
probably where the best
tea from Burma comes from.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.600
So we go.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.680
We take the small plane to
get to this certain area,

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.320
and from there, drive
another 6, 7 hours

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.194
to this mountainous area, and to
the tea region called Namhsan.

00:19:05.194 --> 00:19:06.610
KATE LEAHY: The
way I always think

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.450
of it is, Namhsan if people
think of wine and terroir,

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.130
and they talk about
soil types, when

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.830
you think of Namhsan,
where the tea is grown,

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.920
it's a sandy type of
soil that drains well,

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.170
that is ideal for
the type of tea

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.730
that you pick,
and then ferments.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.650
It's not the same
as for black tea.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.560
Black tea, at least in
that part of the world,

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.840
grows better in soil
that has more clay.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.010
So the type of soil makes
Namhsan particularly

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.690
great for this type of tea.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.870
And we were looking at different
samples of the tea leaves

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:38.580
when they're dry.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.860
You could tell the ones
that had the brighter, more

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.392
of a yellow kind of
color, gold color.

00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:47.600
Those were sort of-- you
get a higher price for that.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.460
That's supposedly
the higher quality.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:48.580
DESMOND TAN: Tea buds.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.160
KATE LEAHY: The real dark ones
with the really big leaves,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.410
those are sort of a
lesser quality tea leaf.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:56.780
DESMOND TAN: Well, in Burma,
so the quality ones you

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.020
are speaking of are called--

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.480
they're tea buds.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.050
And people refer to do
those as tea for generals.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.456
KATE LEAHY: [LAUGHING]

00:20:08.456 --> 00:20:11.269
DESMOND TAN: But
those people are

00:20:11.269 --> 00:20:12.560
the only one who can afford it.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.190
KATE LEAHY: But what's really
cool is, for the longest time,

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.430
people who were tea farmers,
they had a hard time.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.350
They used brokers in Mandalay.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.620
Mandalay's the biggest
trading, agricultural trading,

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.720
city in the country.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.120
And the tea brokers sometimes
wouldn't pay the tea farmers

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.770
until they had sold
all the product.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.820
So you had these tea farmers.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.331
Maybe they'd do a whole,
three different, four

00:20:34.331 --> 00:20:35.830
different, harvests
during the year.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.760
And then they wouldn't
get paid for a year.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.730
So it's no wonder that
maybe picking opium

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:43.180
became a good option for them.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.990
Now, you're working with a
tea co-op, a newly-formed tea

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.270
co-op, that's now
giving more power

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.280
to the farmers themselves.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.440
Getting more education
from the outside world, now

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.940
that the country
is opening up, they

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.840
can learn better plant
management techniques.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.580
At the same time,
they've always been

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.180
organic, which is pretty great.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.960
So they didn't have to take
away a lot of pesticides.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.440
They didn't have money for
pesticides, to begin with.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.680
The jungle tea was growing
in a wild type of way.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.200
So in a way,
because they skipped

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.630
a lot of this
modern agriculture,

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.310
they actually benefit
in the modern.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.370
DESMOND TAN: Correct.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:23.580
It's just an interesting
market, because the brokers

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.260
were paying them also
so little, to a point

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.431
where, aside from
these crazy terms,

00:21:28.431 --> 00:21:29.680
they were getting very little.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.180
So they were going to
China to do farming work,

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.550
abandoning their farm,
which is a little crazy,

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:41.020
to think the Chinese pay
more money than Burmese.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.630
So you can imagine how little
they were getting paid.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:48.610
So what we did was we paid them
whatever that we were paying

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:53.650
the brokers, a little bit more,
and also work with the farmers

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:58.090
to organize an association
where we buy the tea from.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:02.020
And the farmers go sell their
tea at that association,

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.230
and we buy it from there.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.080
And so they don't
have to negotiate

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.880
with the farmer, the brokers.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.530
So the farmers in
Burma are probably

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:12.610
a little bit different
from the farmers in US.

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:14.180
They don't have a lot of land.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.950
They're probably micro farmers.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.890
Mostly, they're micro farmers,
and they're not wealthy.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.150
They're really poor.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.950
And they're not sophisticated.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.660
So when you negotiate, you
just pay whatever price

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.630
that the brokers were paying.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.570
And also, the terms are
ridiculous, as you were saying.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.934
They don't get paid
until it's sold.

00:22:31.934 --> 00:22:33.350
KATE LEAHY: Can
you imagine if you

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.030
didn't get paid until a
year after the work you did?

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:37.670
It's like, how would you live?

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:38.809
How would you buy food?

00:22:38.809 --> 00:22:40.850
DESMOND TAN: So things
are changing a little bit.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:46.200
I think that we're also
introducing the organic farming

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:46.700
to them.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.720
We are working towards
providing soil.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.840
Because they are
harvesting, but they're

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.760
not taking care of their land.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.110
That also means that the
yield is not that great.

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:04.550
I think that, if we introduce
certain farming methods,

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.190
I think that they can yield
far greater than whatever

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:11.700
it is that they're
getting at the moment.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.000
KATE LEAHY: So one of
the things in the book,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.980
this is not about tea, but
it's related to that area.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.080
There's a salad.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.044
Well, we use the term
salad pretty loosely.

00:23:20.044 --> 00:23:21.710
Salad can mean a lot
of different things

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:22.790
in Burmese cooking.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:26.390
But it's a salad
made with, basically,

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:27.710
shredded, dried mutton.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.160
So we can use it in the states.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.490
We can use beef jerky.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:35.810
And it's just shallots and lime
juice and some crushed garlic

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.280
and some chilies and some oil.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.780
And you toss it
together, and it's--

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:38.960
DESMOND TAN: Onions.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.126
KATE LEAHY: --what we call--

00:23:40.126 --> 00:23:41.540
yeah, yeah.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.370
We call it a Namhsan salad.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.800
It didn't really have a
name, but we came across it

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.790
on the one restaurant on the
way up the mountain to the tea

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:49.290
farmers.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:51.350
There's this little
hole in the wall place.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.850
And it's just--
everyone's like, oh,

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:54.141
that's just Namhsan Restaurant.

00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:55.992
So we stopped
there coming down--

00:23:55.992 --> 00:23:57.950
or coming up the mountain
and coming back down.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:02.732
So Namhsan Restaurant is
in the book for that dish.

00:24:02.732 --> 00:24:04.190
DESMOND TAN: The
dish is delicious.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.334
Nobody can resist it.

00:24:05.334 --> 00:24:07.250
But every time we eat
it, everybody gets sick.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.580
KATE LEAHY: No, no, we didn't.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.829
I think the first time we did.

00:24:09.829 --> 00:24:12.830
Well, that doesn't really--
that doesn't sell the recipe.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:13.940
DESMOND TAN: Maybe we
didn't eat the-- well,

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:14.950
we're not selling the recipe--

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:15.860
KATE LEAHY: No, that's true.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.230
DESMOND TAN: --from Burma.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.230
KATE LEAHY: That's true.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.880
Well, if you make it at
home, you will not get sick.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.300
Yeah, I don't know if people
traveling in Myanmar-- there's

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.367
always a little store.

00:24:24.367 --> 00:24:26.950
You always have to be a little
bit more careful than you would

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:28.640
in other parts of the world.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.260
But we've been talking
with everyone here.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.680
And thank you for
hanging out with us.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.710
But we want to also open
up the floor to questions,

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.900
and see any of your burning
questions about Burma

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:40.939
Superstar.

00:24:40.939 --> 00:24:41.480
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.290
Thanks for coming today.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.810
What is the detailed process
for fermenting the tea leaves?

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.670
KATE LEAHY: That's
a great question.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:56.030
DESMOND TAN: I think tea, they
are picked in April, June,

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.050
and in August.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.300
I think that's
specific to Burma.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.260
Usually, the April
picks are the best,

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.920
because it hasn't touched
water, and so forth.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.120
KATE LEAHY: Right, because
the dry season ends--

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.490
DESMOND TAN: In August,
and it continues.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:12.100
KATE LEAHY: s begins in-- yeah,
it ends in August, and then--

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.550
DESMOND TAN: It start raining
again in about May, June.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:20.180
So the flavor, aroma, typically,
they're a lot more robust.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.400
So the buds are premium.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.050
The April tea buds are premium.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.900
And then you have
the lower leaves

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.460
on the tea branch, and so
the June and then August.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.400
So what happens is
that you pick the tea--

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.420
buds or the middle
layer of the branch.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.290
Same day, you take it
back to your house.

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:48.560
And from there, you
steam the tea leaf,

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.150
very high temperature.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:55.070
And you roll it, and you put
it in a fiber bag from there.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:26:03.830
You bury underground about 10
by 10, 10 feet deep, 10 wide.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.760
And on top, you have
heavy, heavy rocks

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.970
to pressure the tea so
that you squeeze out

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.590
the water, air, and so forth.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:17.490
You let it sit for a minimum
two months, up to six months.

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.070
KATE LEAHY: Sometimes
two years, back

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.030
and before they had a hard
time selling it, right?

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.880
DESMOND TAN: Yeah, I
haven't tasted any of that.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.430
KATE LEAHY: That would be extra
premium premium, double aged.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.524
DESMOND TAN: Yeah, that would
be a little too premium for me,

00:26:28.524 --> 00:26:29.480
yeah.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.540
So it's a pretty easy process.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:37.010
But because it happens
at such a remote area,

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:40.910
no one really knew
how tea is fermented.

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:41.960
But basically, that's it.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.460
KATE LEAHY: Yeah,
and the key is you

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.060
have to have access
to fresh tea plants.

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:49.040
And when you pick them, you have
steam them right after picking,

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.840
before they can
start to turn black.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.631
DESMOND TAN: Right.

00:26:51.631 --> 00:26:52.910
It's how they're oxidized.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:56.150
The Oolong tea-- so you have
your green tea, black tea,

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.310
and so forth.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:58.880
They're oxidized.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.520
I think maybe the correct
word is oxidation.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.317
It's how long you oxidize the
tea that changes the color.

00:27:05.317 --> 00:27:07.400
KATE LEAHY: These teas,
also, they're never dried.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.380
They're always
just kind of kept--

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.570
and they start
releasing that black tea

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.690
oil, oil from the
black-- the tea leaves.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.940
DESMOND TAN: Supposedly, the
guy say it cure baldness.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:17.810
So I haven't tried.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:19.760
KATE LEAHY: Well, no, I think
they also use it for hair dye.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.200
DESMOND TAN: Yeah, well,
hair dye and baldness,

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.730
it kills two birds
with one stone.

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:26.107
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:26.107 --> 00:27:27.690
AUDIENCE: Thanks
very much for coming.

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.066
I'm a very long-time fan of
Mandalay and Burma Superstar.

00:27:30.066 --> 00:27:32.023
DESMOND TAN: Well, thank
you, Mandalay's great.

00:27:32.023 --> 00:27:34.220
AUDIENCE: I go to Burma
Love every single week now.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.016
Thank you very much for
starting that, as well.

00:27:37.016 --> 00:27:39.140
I haven't had the chance
to go to your country yet.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.270
But I was recently in Korea.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.660
And I was very surprised
by the big influence

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.620
that American occupation, in the
early '50s, following the war,

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:49.950
left in their street food.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:54.060
So they eat lots of spam and
canned beans and canned corn.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:58.990
So I was wondering, when the
Japanese occupied [INAUDIBLE],,

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:04.640
and then the British got there
to push them out, I guess,

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.540
did that also leave
any changes, I guess,

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.822
in food culture in
Burma, either from

00:28:10.822 --> 00:28:12.030
the Japanese or British side?

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:13.696
KATE LEAHY: Well,
with the British side,

00:28:13.696 --> 00:28:16.080
I would think the first
thing would be the tea house,

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.030
the tea shops, that serve
the dark tea with milk.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:23.960
And in Burma, they
would use condensed milk

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.160
and evaporated milk.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.560
But I'm sure that's just
because the British probably

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.060
preferred fresh milk,
and they just maybe

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.101
didn't have access to it.

00:28:30.101 --> 00:28:33.350
But that tea is extremely
popular, and actually extremely

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:34.080
delicious, too.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.270
DESMOND TAN: Right,
So you're talking

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.010
a little bit about
history, the Brits

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:45.230
went there in 1885, November 28,
1885, and went over to Burma,

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:52.930
forced out the
monarchy, and basically

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.475
abolished all the monarchy
that existed for over--

00:28:56.475 --> 00:28:57.850
KATE LEAHY: That's
pretty ironic,

00:28:57.850 --> 00:28:58.155
when you think about it--

00:28:58.155 --> 00:28:59.090
DESMOND TAN: 1,000 years.

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:01.300
KATE LEAHY: --the British coming
in and abolishing a monarchy,

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:01.800
you know?

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.220
DESMOND TAN: Right.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.720
So Burma became a
province of India,

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:11.890
but a very prosperous
one because of the rich.

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:16.570
There was a lot of agriculture,
a lot of best teak, best ruby.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:19.840
In terms of natural
gas, right now,

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.480
they're probably number
three in the world.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:27.190
So after that, because you
were talking about Japanese,

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:30.980
during the war, Japanese came
in, invaded for three years.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.270
They got the British to kick
out their Japanese again.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:40.420
And then from that,
communism was very popular.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.730
I'm not sure how much
influence Americans

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:44.980
had in Burma or Spain.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:51.400
But from there, they
basically locked themselves up

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.160
and separated themselves,
kept themselves, away

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.090
from outside world.

00:29:56.090 --> 00:30:01.970
They abolished education,
scholarships, and so forth.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:05.920
So with the Brits, there
was a lot of influence

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:10.470
with agriculture and processes
a system, but not with food;

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:12.170
I think maybe tea.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:14.730
And with Japanese, so
far as I'm aware of,

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:18.130
it just started popping up
in the last five, six years.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.870
And I think, if
anything, it will

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:26.500
be Indians who came in
between, say, 1890 to 2010,

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.720
like [INAUDIBLE] said earlier.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.080
About two million came in.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.730
And Chinese came in
about that time--

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.160
so about a couple of
hundred thousand--

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.570
so a lot of influence with
the Chinese and Indian,

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:45.370
not necessarily English
food or Japanese food.

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:47.530
AUDIENCE: I'm curious--
what do you think

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:52.270
the near future of Burmese
food is in the United States

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.310
in terms of how people
are aware of it,

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:58.031
how people understand it as part
of their everyday experience?

00:30:58.031 --> 00:30:59.780
KATE LEAHY: Yeah, I'll
take that question.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:03.636
I think what I
feel is sometimes,

00:31:03.636 --> 00:31:05.260
things have to start
on the West Coast.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.330
And then New York
has to discover it.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:09.430
And then once New York
discovers it, they own it,

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:11.210
and they make
everyone aware of it.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:13.095
I think that's what
happened with blue jeans.

00:31:13.095 --> 00:31:15.220
So they're invented here,
and then they sent there,

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.130
and then they became popular.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.380
DESMOND TAN: Yeah, the New
York need to talk about it.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.820
KATE LEAHY: So New York needs
more Burmese restaurants.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.540
But on a more
serious note, I think

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.360
what's happening-- the Bay
Area has a very diverse Burmese

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.650
population.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:28.630
And I think the
future of Burmese food

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:32.690
is being able to go deeper
into the regions of the country

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:35.470
and having maybe a restaurant
that's dedicated strictly

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.057
to the Shan state.

00:31:37.057 --> 00:31:38.890
When you go to Yangon,
there are restaurants

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:43.150
that are specific to different
parts of the country.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:46.240
And I could see that being
the next step, that maybe 10

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.060
years from now,
instead of saying

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:51.350
this is a Burmese restaurant,
this is a Chin restaurant.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:52.490
This is a Shan restaurant.

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.200
This is your Kayin restaurant.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.080
And that would be
actually fascinating,

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.270
because we're just
scratching the surface

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:02.570
on the differences between the
different parts of the country.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.960
And I'm excited to learn
more about those parts

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.620
of the country.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.578
DESMOND TAN: So different
things are happening.

00:32:07.578 --> 00:32:09.820
If you go to Burma,
they're more fascinated

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:14.260
with Thai food or Chinese
food or European food.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:18.820
But if they have
guests, they try

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.790
to avoid taking you to
a Burmese restaurant,

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:23.060
because they're everywhere.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:28.660
So going back to
your question, I

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:36.000
think the people are beginning
to just discover Burmese food.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.930
And it could be anything.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:45.300
I think that tea leaf, the
dressing is really flexible.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:50.320
I mean, I think that people were
doing different things that we

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.640
or they are not doing in Burma.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.850
In Burma-- so we used
the fermented tea

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.790
and rub it on chicken
or fish and steam it.

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:01.130
And it's delicious.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.110
It's something that
we don't do in Burma.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:11.262
And in Burma, because of the
availability of refrigerators--

00:33:11.262 --> 00:33:13.345
KATE LEAHY: It's pretty
questionable in most parts

00:33:13.345 --> 00:33:13.970
of the country.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:15.900
DESMOND TAN: Freshness
is questionable.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.540
So you cook everything to
death, just to make sure

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.640
that they're sanitized.

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:28.350
And I think the ingredients here
are readily available and more

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:29.290
fresh.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:33.360
So you could do things a
little bit differently.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.080
What's all that?

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:38.730
So then, maybe now, we're
talking about authenticity.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.880
Then the question
is, what's authentic?

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.200
I think, to me,
authentic is whatever

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.900
your mom made or not what
other people are saying.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.230
Yeah, I mean, my
aunt can make it,

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:53.460
and it's not authentic, because
it's not like my mom's dish.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.280
So the same with
spaghetti-- there

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.240
are so many ways of doing it.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.176
What's authentic?

00:34:00.779 --> 00:34:02.070
People are just discovering it.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.270
I don't know the direction.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:04.140
I can't tell.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.937
I mean, I can only tell you
to come to our restaurant,

00:34:06.937 --> 00:34:07.770
invite your friends.

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:09.739
Go eat there all the time.

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:13.080
And discover where that's
going, and keep coming.

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:18.130
It's a difficult question.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:24.239
I hate to see Burmese
who go a fusion route.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:27.179
I think people
are just beginning

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:28.949
to discover Burmese food.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:35.100
OK, so another
thing-- so growing up,

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:44.520
when I came to US in the early
80s, I or fellow immigrants

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.949
from Southeast Asia
were discriminated.

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:49.780
Maybe the food that we
ate were a little stinky.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.530
Everybody ate
sandwich and burgers.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:56.909
It's like, if I bring rice
to work, they'll beat me up.

00:34:56.909 --> 00:35:01.200
And so it's just
interesting that now,

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.490
today, people want Burmese food.

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:11.344
It's nice that I don't
have to hide fish sauce.

00:35:11.344 --> 00:35:13.260
And I can say, you know
don't know fish sauce?

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.335
Where have you been?

00:35:14.335 --> 00:35:16.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.580
So it's .

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:22.200
Interesting I think we can
do a lot, move forward.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.420
It's an open game.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.450
You know, personally, I
love southeast Asian food

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:28.920
or south Asian food.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:34.290
People are just
beginning to discover

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:37.320
the flavors of South Asia.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.370
But also another thing--

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:43.110
I think with the new generation
of restaurateurs coming up,

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:45.180
in the past, maybe
the older generation

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.640
didn't understand quality
or maybe aesthetics

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.150
or communication or education.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:57.320
So they didn't quite
meet the expectations

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.502
of a lot of the
American audience.

00:35:59.502 --> 00:36:01.460
I think the new generations
might be different.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.560
I think they understand quality.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.020
They understand ambience.

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:10.300
They definitely know how
to communicate the food

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.620
to their customers.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:16.210
So I think the Chinese,
Thai, Indian cuisines

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:18.702
are going to be
interesting, moving forward.

00:36:18.702 --> 00:36:19.910
SPEAKER 1: One more question.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.580
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned the
diversity of Burmese cuisine

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:23.720
in the various provinces.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.490
You've also expanded your
restaurant empire, as well.

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:30.380
So what's your philosophy
for opening new restaurants,

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.600
creating clones of
Burma Superstar?

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.691
How do you get each
one its own identity?

00:36:34.691 --> 00:36:37.190
DESMOND TAN: Well, it's kind
of funny, from that little hole

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:41.403
in the wall restaurant, to
be referred to as an empire.

00:36:41.403 --> 00:36:43.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.860
We have a couple of restaurants.

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.050
KATE LEAHY: One of the
things that I learned,

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:51.000
working with you, Desmond,
is that you always

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.210
made sure that the
restaurants were

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:54.600
their own individual entity.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.020
So if you go to the-- and some
people's favorite location

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:57.770
is in Alameda.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.840
And Alameda has a
totally different feel

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.509
from the one in Oakland, which
has a totally different feel

00:37:02.509 --> 00:37:03.800
from the one on Clement Street.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.880
And each of them act like--
each staff is almost like family

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.380
there.

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.310
And sometimes, they are family.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:09.684
Sisters will be
servers together,

00:37:09.684 --> 00:37:12.440
or brothers will work
in the kitchen together.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.230
And I mean, you don't
have any intention

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:19.700
of maximizing Burma Superstar's
saturation in the city.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.480
Burma Love is a
little bit different.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.260
It's a restaurant that has
a little bit broader menu.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.380
One of the reasons,
the kitchen is-- you

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.334
guys got to design that
kitchen from scratch,

00:37:29.334 --> 00:37:31.250
so you could do certain
things in that kitchen

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:34.850
that you couldn't in the smaller
Burma Superstar kitchens.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:37.910
And so my insider tip
is go to Burma Love

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:40.160
for the palata, which
is that lovely, buttery

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.700
flat bread, because I think
they have the best griddle.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.366
And no offense to the
other restaurants,

00:37:44.366 --> 00:37:45.850
but they have an actual--

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:47.450
they have a larger space.

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:50.835
And the way you guys do the
palata there is just perfect.

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:53.200
DESMOND TAN: Well, yeah, we
adapt to the environment.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:57.530
So maybe a technology people
will call us dumb asses.

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:59.880
You have such a popularity.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.710
Why don't you grow?

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:03.230
You could have 5, 10, 15, 20.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:09.060
But we really haven't really--
in the last 20 years, we

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.540
opened four Burmese restaurants.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:17.240
And it wasn't because we're
really ambitious or smart.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.450
The guy from Alameda suckered
us into buying that restaurant.

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:23.930
It was another Burmese
restaurant called [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.590
And it wasn't doing well.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.640
So we try to be as
helpful as we can be.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.760
So he'll call us,
hey, you know what?

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.510
I'd like to come talk to you.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:34.670
I know your restaurant
is doing really well,

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:38.990
and see if I could pick
your brain, and so forth.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:43.620
So we started talking
to this guy, Nick.

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:47.920
And we identified
a lot of problems.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.800
And at first, you
know, your floors

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.040
really shouldn't be shiny.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.640
And the mango
chicken, or whatever,

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.610
all the Chinese dishes,
needs to go away.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:03.150
I think people
want Burmese food.

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:04.370
You should give Burmese food.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:08.910
But then because his
business wasn't doing well,

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:11.780
he was a cater to whatever
little customers that he had.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.590
He was very unwilling to
give up the chop suey that

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:18.860
was selling to whoever
that was coming in,

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.420
or the mango chicken.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.960
So I think, in the
end, it takes time

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:28.490
to win a little bit of
loyalty from the customers.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:30.139
Maybe he was selling
the wrong dishes.

00:39:30.139 --> 00:39:30.680
I don't know.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:34.020
A lot of things were happening.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:36.640
But in the end, he
didn't want to do,

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.840
and he didn't want to
continue the business.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.110
I think maybe the path to
a successful restaurant

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:45.140
was much different than
what he had thought.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.480
So he asked me if
I wanted to buy it.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.120
So I say, sure, why not?

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.415
So that's how we ended up
with a second restaurant;

00:39:52.415 --> 00:39:54.710
and same with the third,
same with the fourth.

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:57.210
So it wasn't
because of ambition.

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.100
We weren't looking out for it.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:02.540
So even tea leaf was just based
on, hey, we have bad tea leaf.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.810
You know, I think that
we should make our own.

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:07.260
And then with the beer,
hey, you know what?

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:11.109
If Singaporean or Thai or
Chinese have their own beer,

00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:12.650
I don't think there's
a Burmese beer.

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:16.880
So we have our own Burmese beer.

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.590
And on Clement Street, we
have three restaurants.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.820
It was purely out
of really laziness,

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.970
because it's just easier
to manage if they're all

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:27.390
at the same place.

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:29.450
So why do I need to
go different places?

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:30.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.260
KATE LEAHY: Now you have to go
to a lot of different places.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.468
DESMOND TAN: We bought a
coffee shop in [INAUDIBLE],,

00:40:35.468 --> 00:40:37.294
so people could wait
at the coffee shop.

00:40:37.294 --> 00:40:38.960
And we tell the
customer, hey, you know,

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.000
you don't have to buy anything.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.397
But then we teach the people to
sell whenever they are there.

00:40:45.397 --> 00:40:46.480
KATE LEAHY: That's sneaky.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.500
DESMOND TAN: So a lot of
it is just based on need,

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.990
not because we want to
expand or have an empire.

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:56.230
But then, now, we have
products, products

00:40:56.230 --> 00:41:00.460
available at some of the
natural grocery stores,

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:06.160
Bi-Rite, Rainbow, and
the Twitter building,

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:10.450
and so forth, some in the
Whole Foods, because everybody

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:11.980
was asking, where can I buy?

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:12.650
Where can I buy?

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:14.200
So we're working towards that.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.840
I think pretty soon, it
will be available probably

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.160
in about two months.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.930
So product is also just--

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.420
basically, growth
is based on need.

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.271
And I think a lot of
people do ask us to open

00:41:26.271 --> 00:41:27.520
here or there, here and there.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.347
We just haven't done it.

00:41:29.347 --> 00:41:31.930
SPEAKER 1: Let's give one more
round of applause to our guest.

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:32.888
DESMOND TAN: Thank you.

00:41:32.888 --> 00:41:35.880
[APPLAUSE]
