00:00:00.937 --> 00:00:02.523
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:05.010
is use a graphing calculator
to answer some questions

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.724
dealing with binomial random variables

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:10.882
and this is useful because if
you're taking the AP Stats,

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:13.079
the Advanced Placement Statistics test,

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.140
you are allowed to use
a graphing calculator

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.198
and so this could actually
save you significant time.

00:00:18.198 --> 00:00:20.870
So it says here I have a 0.35 probability

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.477
of making a free throw.

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:24.001
What is the probability of making

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.988
four out of seven free throws?

00:00:26.988 --> 00:00:30.613
Well this is a classic binomial
random variable question.

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:34.030
If we said the binomial random variable x

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.107
is equal to number of made

00:00:39.614 --> 00:00:41.531
free throws from seven,

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:47.019
I can say seven trials or seven shots,

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:48.436
seven trials with

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.729
the probability of success

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:56.812
is equal to 0.35 for each free throw.

00:00:57.894 --> 00:01:01.349
So really this question amounts
to what is the probability

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:05.574
that my binomial random
variable x is equal to four?

00:01:05.574 --> 00:01:06.689
Now what we're going to see is

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.301
we can use a function on our TI-84,

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:10.718
not named binomc,

00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:14.714
or binompdf, I should say,

00:01:14.714 --> 00:01:17.173
binompdf which is short

00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:20.334
for binomial probability
distribution function,

00:01:20.334 --> 00:01:22.325
and what you're going to want to do here

00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:24.275
is use three arguments.

00:01:24.275 --> 00:01:26.957
So the first one is the number of trials.

00:01:26.957 --> 00:01:28.734
So in this case, it is seven,

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:30.664
and if you're doing it on
the free response section

00:01:30.664 --> 00:01:33.227
of the AP test, you
should make it very clear

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:35.685
that that right over there is your n,

00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:37.521
the graders will actually look for that

00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:40.465
to make sure that you're not
just guessing what goes where.

00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:42.346
So you would say that is my n

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:46.198
and then you would say
your probability, 0.35,

00:01:46.198 --> 00:01:48.230
and once again if you're taking the test,

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.521
you should mark that.

00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:51.216
That is your p.

00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:52.772
And then last but not least,

00:01:52.772 --> 00:01:55.686
what is the probability
that a binomial variable

00:01:55.686 --> 00:01:57.442
when you're taking seven
trials with a probability

00:01:57.442 --> 00:02:00.716
of success of each of them being 0.35

00:02:00.716 --> 00:02:03.782
that you have exactly four successes.

00:02:03.782 --> 00:02:05.590
So now lets get our calculator out

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.886
and actually do that.

00:02:07.886 --> 00:02:10.620
Alright, so now we have our
graphing calculator out.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.620
So there's a couple of ways to input this.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.887
You could just type it in
directly, that could take time.

00:02:14.887 --> 00:02:18.564
You could do second in this
little blue distribution here.

00:02:18.564 --> 00:02:19.792
So there you have it.

00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:20.970
In order to get to the function,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.221
you could either scroll down

00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:24.822
or you could scroll up to
get to the bottom of the list

00:02:24.822 --> 00:02:27.402
and you see it right over here, binompdf.

00:02:27.402 --> 00:02:29.585
You could do alphaA to
go there really fast

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:33.811
or you could just scroll
up here, click enter,

00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:36.859
and then, you have the number of trials

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:37.872
that you want to deal with.

00:02:37.872 --> 00:02:40.475
Well we're gonna take seven trials,

00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:44.558
the probability of success
in each trial is 0.35,

00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:48.846
and then my x value,

00:02:48.846 --> 00:02:50.117
well I wanna find the probability

00:02:50.117 --> 00:02:53.377
that my binomial random
variable is equal to four,

00:02:53.377 --> 00:02:55.815
four successes out of the trials.

00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:57.777
And now let me go to paste

00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:00.264
and this is actually
going to type in exactly

00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:01.637
what we had before.

00:03:01.637 --> 00:03:03.454
Notice this is the exact same thing.

00:03:03.454 --> 00:03:06.798
So I have seven trials,
p is equals to 0.35,

00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:08.168
and I wanna know the probability of having

00:03:08.168 --> 00:03:09.886
exactly four successes,

00:03:09.886 --> 00:03:12.353
and then I just click enter

00:03:12.353 --> 00:03:14.853
and I get, there you go, 0.14.

00:03:16.427 --> 00:03:18.010
So this is equal to

00:03:20.135 --> 00:03:21.718
approximately 0.14.

00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:28.192
Now based on the same
binomial random variable,

00:03:28.192 --> 00:03:30.679
if we're then asked
what is the probability

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:34.296
of making less than five free throws?

00:03:34.296 --> 00:03:35.942
So we could say this is the probability

00:03:35.942 --> 00:03:38.696
that x is less than five

00:03:38.696 --> 00:03:41.337
or we could say this is the probability

00:03:41.337 --> 00:03:44.670
that x is less than or equal to four,

00:03:45.602 --> 00:03:47.290
and the reason why I write it this way

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.335
is because using it this way

00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:50.826
you can now use the binomial cumulative

00:03:50.826 --> 00:03:53.862
distribution function on my calculator.

00:03:53.862 --> 00:03:56.112
So if I just type in binom,

00:03:57.144 --> 00:04:01.165
and once again, I'm
gonna seven of binomcdf,

00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:04.043
I should say, cumulative
distribution function

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:06.469
and I'm gonna take seven trials

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:10.761
and the probability of
success in each trial is 0.35

00:04:10.761 --> 00:04:13.085
and now when I type in four here,

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:14.236
it doesn't mean what is the probability

00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:16.418
that I make exactly four free throws,

00:04:16.418 --> 00:04:19.202
it is the probability
that I make zero, one,

00:04:19.202 --> 00:04:22.444
two, three, or four free throws.

00:04:22.444 --> 00:04:23.793
So all of the possible outcomes

00:04:23.793 --> 00:04:26.385
of my binomial random variable up to

00:04:26.385 --> 00:04:30.173
and including this value right over here.

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:31.837
So let me get that,

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:34.337
let me get my calculator back,

00:04:35.273 --> 00:04:39.458
so once again, I can go
to second, distribution,

00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:41.815
I'll scroll up to go to
the bottom of the list

00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:42.648
and here you see it,

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:45.728
binomial cumulative distribution function.

00:04:45.728 --> 00:04:48.590
So let me go there, click enter.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.538
And once again, seven trials,

00:04:51.538 --> 00:04:52.621
my p is 0.35,

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:57.612
and my x value is four,

00:04:57.612 --> 00:04:59.339
but now this is not going to
be giving me the probability

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:02.590
that my binomial random
variable equals four,

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.105
this is going to give me the probability

00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:07.710
that I get any value up
to and including four.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.611
So this should be a higher probability.

00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:13.611
And there you have it,
it is approximately 0.94.

00:05:16.436 --> 00:05:18.936
So this is approximately 0.94.

00:05:20.765 --> 00:05:21.871
So hopefully you found that helpful.

00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:23.720
These calculators can be very useful

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.306
especially on something
like an AP Stats exam.
