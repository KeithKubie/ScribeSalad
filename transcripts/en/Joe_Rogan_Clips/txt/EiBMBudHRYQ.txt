Speaker 1:          00:00          Just such a, it's, it's, it's recreational. Yeah. There's a, there's a, I mean it's back to Jack. I mean it's a lot that has a lot to do with social media and Twitter in particular. Yeah. I mean you have like so, so for instance, I missed the whole Covington high school Catholic fiasco, not on Twitter, basically was ignoring Twitter. I saw, I saw it out of the corner of my eye. Like, man, this is interesting. This is, yeah, this is blowing up. But I, I was so off Twitter that I had, there was no temptation for a hot take from me. Right. And I saw these people just torching their reputations by taking these like, like Kathy Griffin basically calling for the doxing of these kids. You know, given all that she has suffered from, from mob behavior online and she's whipping up her own mob.

Speaker 1:          00:47          It was just nuts. But it's normal. That's what people do. It's what the platform is calling out of people. But it's also when people have been shamed and they've done something awful, then they reinforce their base like that. Now she's like his so heavily hard left because the right wing ran after her. Like anyone on the right that does anything. She's calling for her side to go after this person. Like reinforcing the cheese, a part of that tribe that she's a part of that left wing tribe. Yeah. Yeah. Well it's, so obviously everyone has a lot to lose doing this, especially in a case where all the facts aren't in. And if you just waited a beat and even the New York Times got this wrong, the New York Times writes an article about the kids in the Maga hat that they have to resend. And the, so then as the dust is settling and I see these people, some people are doubling down, some people are, are issuing public apologies.

Speaker 1:          01:43          I see somebody who is actually kind of car, you know, branded herself as, you know, one of my enemies for, for a reason. I can't fathom. But th this journalist Kara Swisher, uh, who, um, you know, she, she works for uh, uh, recode and vox now, but she's got a big podcast and she's a bitch. She actually writes for the New York Times. Now she's got an opinion piece, you know, a regular column for the New York Times. She's a tech journalist. Um, and I, you know, happen to know she hasn't liked me because she's tweeted against, you know, she's said some disparaging things about me on Twitter and we had a, you know, an offline conversation about it. Uh, but I saw her, she said one of the most but two parative and you know, fairly crazy things in, in response to the kids initially. And then once more information came out, she walked it back and she basically apologized, you know, good for on Twitter.

Speaker 1:          02:31          And so, so I said, good for you Cara. I just wanted to, to support this norm of acknowledging that you got something wrong and I wanted to do it even. I wanted to actually do it for someone who I know really doesn't like me. Like, I mean, that was an added bonus for me because that, that's, that's another norm that I, that I think we should support this like, like we should, we should play fair even with our enemies. And I mean, honestly, I, you know, I try to play fair even with people who never play with me. Even someone like, you know, Glenn Greenwald's Racsana Salon, I mean, people who have just lied about me endlessly. If I get something wrong about them, I publicly apologize for it. Um, so I did this, and this was at the absolute 11th hour with respect to this, this, uh, you know, a scandal online.

Speaker 1:          03:19          And when I saw the kind of pain I was getting just for a con, you know, s supporting Kara in her walk back of this thing we had at a moment when it was obvious she should've walked this back. I got people saying, you know, unsubscribing from your podcast, you are, you know, now I know you're a fucking racist. You know, it was just, I'm just sure pain. And I just thought, wow, man, that's, you know, it's like you just touched this thing at it's very end and you're, you're, you know, it's, Eh, the slime it gets on you. Um, so yeah, it is. It's the medium, you know, we had no opportunity to do this before. It is the medium and it's also people that don't feel like their opinions are being heard. Like they want their opinion to be heard and they want it to be heard right now.

Speaker 1:          04:01          And it might not be a very well thought out opinion, but they know that they have the ability to blare it out and so they just send it out and that, that, the ability to do that, it's just intoxicating for folks and don't think to reach you. You talked about this with Jack. There is out there. What makes Twitter especially good for this is that everything has the same stature. Like your tweets no bigger than the other tweets that just called you an asshole. Yeah, that's my Kurt Metzger take on it because Kurt Metzger was a hilarious standup comedian. He, uh, he'll write a Facebook blog only. You only writes on Facebook and he's like, I like how it's set up. He's like, it's, there's a big D, it differentiates between me and these fucking idiots who are commenting under there of, although ironically I hate Facebook. I can't even, I mean just the graphic design on Facebook.

Speaker 1:          04:49          I find so offensive that I can't even look at Facebook. So I use it as a publishing channel. But I, you know, I keep threatening in my own mind to just delete the account cause I just don't read the comments three times maybe ever read him. It's like truth is Christ. It's like youtube but alive. I don't know, it's like youtube but with people with their real names, right? It's, you know, this is a new world that we're living in man and everybody's trying to navigate this thing and figure it out as it goes along and not everybody is doing it well. And uh, I think this world is going to get more and more intrusive. I think this is just the beginning. I think we didn't see Twitter coming, whatever comes after Twitter. And this is one of the things that I, before the podcast I wanted to really talk to jack about to get his take on what he thinks is next down the line because there's going to be something that's more invasive. There's going to be something that is more, whether it's a, I think probably something in the line of augmented reality. There were probably a decade away from something that makes this look like books look like, you know, a, a fucking cork board at a bookstore. You know, although strangely we're live, we're living through the golden age of audio here. It's like, like we, we went full into video and we're poised to go like, you know, three d and Vr, and then all of a sudden audio is king.
