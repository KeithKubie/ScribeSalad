00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Good morning everyone.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.640
My name is David Mao and I have
the privilege and honor of serving

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.870 position:56%
as the Acting Librarian of Congress.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.240
So first off, welcome to
the Library of Congress,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.510
the world's largest library

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.110
and our nation's first
federal cultural institution.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.900
Here at the Library of Congress,
we recognize the importance

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.140
of all types of diversity and how
diverse cultures enrich our nation.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.600
So I'm very honored this morning
to open this special program

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.830
which also celebrates the 200th
anniversary of the arrival

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.970 position:56%
of Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins
Gallaudet to America in August 1816.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.750
I understand that nine months after
their arrival, the first school

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.900
for the deaf was founded
in Hartford, Connecticut

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.510
and then 48 years after that,
Gallaudet University here

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.420
in our own Washington, DC.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.790
It became the first school
for the advanced education

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.780
of the deaf and hard of hearing.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.660
So today's program is cosponsored
by the Library of Congress Center

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.340
for the Book and the
National Literacy--

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.630
I'm sorry, National
Literary Society of the Deaf.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.310 position:56%
And it's all about opening the lines

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.220
of communication among
the various deaf cultures

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.160
and the libraries that serve them.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.880
The primary focus of course is to
build support for libraries to work

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.480 position:56%
with organizations serving the deaf.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.500 position:56%
Now, since 1993, the Library of
Congress Deaf Association has served

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.540
as a resource to, not
only the library

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.220
but also the labor
organizations here to identify

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.040
and eliminate discrimination--

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.660
discriminatory policies
that affect deaf and hard

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.140
of hearing employees here at
the Library of Congress and also

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.970
to encourage the employment of
employees here at the library.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.240
The Library's Interpreting
Services Program, benefited here

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.660
of course today by great
people, is part of the Office

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.170
of Equal Employment Opportunity
and Diversity Programs

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.570
and it is currently
hosting a series of programs

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.840
that explores deaf culture
here in the United States.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.930
So I want to thank the National
Literary Society of the Deaf

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.610
and its president, Alec McFarlane,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.740
for bringing this important
program to the library.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.800
The Library Center for the Book
whose mission is to promote books,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.320
reading, libraries and
literacy has for many,

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.590
many years recognized the
society as a long-time reading

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.160
and literacy promotion partner.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.500 position:56%
And we're very, very happy about the
collaboration between the library

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.500
and the society and the
promotion on all the good work

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.560
that the partnership does together.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.140
So now I'm going to turn the
program over to the director

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.920
of the Library Center for
the Book, Dr. John Cole.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.200
Thank you very much
and enjoy the program.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.450
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Thank you, David.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.910
I'm John Cole.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.180 position:56%
I am the director of the Center for
the Book in the Library of Congress.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.530
Its job is to help stimulate public
interest in books, in reading,

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.750
in literary work, and in literacy.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.800
So I have a wonderful
job in the center

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.470
that was created many years
ago by Librarian of Congress,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.530
Daniel Boorstin who many
of you may know about.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.790
He wanted the Library of Congress
to reach out to all audiences,

00:03:51.790 --> 00:04:00.030
to express the importance of books
and literary work and of literacy.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.130
We have a partnership
program and you are part

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.160
of the partnership program.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.410
The National Literary Society
for the Deaf has been a partner

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.520
for about 10 years, and this
is our second major program.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.700
So, I am very happy
that you can be here

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.360
and that we can have a
wonderful day together here

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.880
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.320
You see around you some displays.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.100
We're going to have--
we have posters.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.690
We are going to have
interesting talks.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.400
And from authors, from librarians,
we will be able to at the end

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.590
of the day think about deaf
culture and all cultures together.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.710
So it's a wonderful highlight
day for all of us here.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.450
I will be serving to introduce the
speakers and if you have questions

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:13.390 position:56%
about the Library of Congress today,
please ask me or ask my associate

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.150
and Bonnie who is in the back row

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.490
who also be-- will
be with us all day.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.960
So thank you and we're
beginning to start our day

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.840
with another important person
who's helped plan this for us

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.800
and he has his own special
statement in for you before we move

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.160
in to the program itself.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.420
We are very grateful to Alec
McFarlane who is the President

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:49.240
of the National Literary Society
of the Deaf, not only for his work

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.110
in this society and being a
partner for the Center for the Book

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.100
but especially for his
help in organizing today

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.580
and in responding to you so well.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.820
We have a wonderful group of
people and I look forward to being

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.910
with you today and would like to
call on Alec to say a few words.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.780
Alec?

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.050
&gt;&gt; Alec McFarlane: Thank you, John.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.390
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Thank you, Alec.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.340
&gt;&gt; Alec McFarlane: Thank you.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.190
Hello, everyone here.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.840
My name is Alec McFarlane.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.170
I'm the President of the National
Literary Society of the Deaf.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:39.140 position:56%
I am very happy that John Cole and
Mr. Mao gave us the stage here today

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:46.430
to share our stories about culture,
different things in the deaf world.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.420
And I can't tell you how
our authors are going to say

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.340
and I can't tell you what
workshops we're going to do

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.860
but I can tell you,
there are back stories.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.250
You know, "Oh, it's everything,
culture has back stories."

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.000
And that back story
is that [inaudible].

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.390
We have pay.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.600
We have pay.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.660 position:56%
Give us foundations for our
language that was brought to America

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.480
and America is using them
now as a cultural bridge.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.860
And we're bringing language.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.670
You can go anywhere in the
world and same sign language.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:29.070
But the culture and it's
not something that's

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.940
to sign language, it's not.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.790
You know, the people
are all varies of life.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.480
I mean, we have all the
different kinds of people

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.700
who are deaf by any definition.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.820
We define deaf person as someone

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:50.010
with various hearing
levels and has [inaudible].

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.380
And here with our culture,

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:58.740
we're trying to break a bridge
those barriers to people.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:05.720
And so our authors today will tell
you stories about the world, kids,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.940
and adults, and civil war.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:14.920 position:56%
I mean, we have a lot of things that
are cultural and it's not limited

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:21.270
to the people because we have
the people in every race,

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:28.480
every religion, every corner of
earth who will find that people.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:35.390 position:56%
So here today, what bring people who
can help us bridge that differences,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:40.680
who would bring people
to deaf community to go

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.150
to the outside community.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.540
And we have people doing that now.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:50.370
And I think I'm now going
to introduce our friend here

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:55.900
from Gallaudet University,
Dr. Genie Gertz.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.700
Please.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:14.110
[ Applause ]

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.410
&gt;&gt; Genie Gertz: Good morning.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.300
I'm really proud to be here.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.420
I'm representing Gallaudet
University.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:25.120
I am the dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.280
We call that CAS but
I am not alone in my--

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.870
So, we are not alone
in our acronyms.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.680
We call the Library
of Congress the LOC,

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.710
and we have many, many
acronyms here.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:41.890 position:56%
That being said, the College of Arts
and Sciences, CAS, we look at that

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:46.770
as an exclusive representation of
a variety of fields, from arts,

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:53.250 position:56%
to humanities, to sciences and more.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.660
And that is where the
important collaborations happen

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.470
where we can collaborate
with the Library of Congress.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:04.240
The picture that you see there, the
domes of the Library of Congress,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.820
I can actually see that
everyday from my office window.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.780
So as I look out into the
landscape, I can see that dome

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.740
and I see it right next
to the White House.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:24.210
It's a nice reminder of how
those collaborations happen

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:30.830
and how you can use those to
develop a bank of knowledge

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.890
so that everyone can
benefit from that.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:37.270
And I'm very thrilled to see that
the Library of Congress for many,

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.720
many years has not
battled, but supported us

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.640
and we have collaborate
together because the body

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:50.830
of knowledge feeds us to further
fuel research and continue a field.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:56.190
And without the bases, we
wouldn't have that research.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.340
And Gallaudet University
represents a home for many,

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.950
many people who have
come to our university.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.510
They study.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:09.070
They make it through their
years at Gallaudet in a variety

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.370
of different disciplines.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:19.370
The students who were in those
different disciplines also complete

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:24.190
internships and then they
go out into the world

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:28.230
and are able to affect influence.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:33.190 position:56%
But all of that support comes from
places like the Library of Congress.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.970
You are our foundation for
that body of knowledge.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:49.440
As you know, Gallaudet
University has a specific mission.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.330
And we all work to support
the students to be able

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.430
to go out into the world.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.400
At the same time, we do
support our bilingual mission

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.960
and it is an opportunity for
students to come and study

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:07.070
at Gallaudet to really delve
into those different aspects

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:11.230
of like he was mentioning
culture and the body of knowledge,

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.860
the community, the
culture and the world.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:21.310
Through that progress, you
can see students really grow

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.610
and develop as individuals.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:28.310
And you see them expand
their body of knowledge.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.180
It becomes global knowledge
so that they're ready to go

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:36.590
out into the world and
have an influence on it.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.840
We have many, many
different departments.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.020
And within those, a variety of
skills, we have the Department

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.420
of ASL and Deaf Studies that
feeds into expanding the body

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.670
of knowledge related to
ASL and deaf culture.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:55.420
I had the biggest honor and
privilege of being a coeditor

00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:00.940
of the Deaf Studies Encyclopedia.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.890
It was just released early
this year in the month--

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:07.340
we're in the month of April now.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.210
And so, just at the very beginning
of 2016, that book was released.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:17.340
The Encyclopedia of Deaf studies is
inclusive of a variety of things,

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.430
different disciplines
within deafness.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:26.020
So again, I talk about
art, linguistics, history.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.930
All of these different
disciplines are contained

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:29.580
within the encyclopedia.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.920
And it is my hope that
one day, it will make it

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.060
into the Library of
Congress archives.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:42.120
At the same time, we
developed this with a purpose.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.650
We want to collect the different
contributions that have happened

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:50.160
over the last 300 centuries.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.690
We have over 300 entries
and different authors

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:58.130
who have been included in this
encyclopedia, some of our authors

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.170
who will be actually
presenting later today,

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.690
Dr. Henry Lang for instance.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:11.050
The purposes of this is to share
and disseminate that knowledge.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:16.540
Again, it all circles back
to the purpose of this event,

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.420
to bring us together, to
collaborate, to support one another

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.730
and expand that body of knowledge.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:26.040
I do want to recognize
two of our interns here.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.530
They're interns at the Library
of Congress this semester.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.230
I don't know if they're
in the audience.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.570
But I knew that-- I know
that they plan to come today.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:40.240
It is a clear example
of that partnership

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:45.310
between Gallaudet University
and the Library of Congress.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.940
And what they learn here,
they're going to be able to carry

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.270
with them into their careers.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:56.620
The two interns that I would

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:04.440
like to specifically recognize are
James Newton and Jessica Rimando.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:11.240
If you see them later today,
please congratulate them for all

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.220
of the work that they've
done and encourage them

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.160
to continue that body of knowledge.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.680
I want to thank all of
you for your support.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.470
Now, Gallaudet thanks
you, I thank you.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:31.350
And before I close, I'm not
sure if you all know or not,

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:38.980
but Gallaudet University was
founded by Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.350
for his history with
deafness as I just explained.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.770
The Library of Congress
was established

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.070
and then ultimately Gallaudet.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:53.160
There is a connection to
the Library of Congress

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.110
and Gallaudet University.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:16:01.510
In the Jefferson Building,
this is the Madison Building,

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:09.160
but if you go over to the Jefferson
Building, they have a mural

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.930
or a mosaic that's on the wall.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:18.890
And there are a variety
of different people

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.870
who were important
throughout history.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:26.030
Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet
is in that mosaic.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.840
So, we do have a strong connection
with the Library of Congress,

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.610
and that is further proof of it.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.370
We are embedded into the Library
of Congress and we look forward

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.420
to continuing that
partnership in the future.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.790
So, thank you so much and I hope
you enjoy the rest of your day.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.330
Thank you.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.230
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, thank you
so much for getting us started

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.970
and presenting the
Gallaudet connection--

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:52.660
the physical connection, which
is in one of the galleries

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.650
in the Jefferson Building.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.870
And if you haven't seen it,
someday I hope you will.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:02.410
I will later in the day actually
show you a guidebook to the Library

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.640
of Congress Building
that shows you the hall

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:11.080
for that Gallaudet
recognition is there.

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.810
I forgot to mention earlier
two things that are important.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:21.370
One is that we are
filming this presentation

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:25.850
to show today's work
including the presentations

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:28.710
on the Library of Congress website.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:34.390
So, it will be available in a month
or two and I will let people know

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:40.010
of when they can see the program
and also share the presentations

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:44.760
so people who are not here will
be able to hear the presentations

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:49.410 position:56%
and get a sense of the
partnerships that we are encouraging

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:55.330
through today's cross
sections and conversations.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:18:02.430 position:56%
Second part is that the National
Literary Society for the Deaf is one

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:08.870
of 80 organizations that
already are part of the Center

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:14.210
for the Book's literacy and
reading promotion group.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:19.380
And we meet once a year, the
whole group, to exchange ideas

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.270 position:56%
and to specialize with some little--

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:27.070
some special presentations that
relate to some of our partners

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.280
that others may not know about.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:34.630
And so, next year, we will be able
to talk a little bit about today

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:39.010
and build bridges-- continue
to build bridges I think

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.660
with other partners
who share interests

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.590
in not only American culture,
but specifically in reading,

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.760
in education and promotion.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.780
So, you already are part
of this through our website

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.220
and through our promotions
in our annual meetings.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.840
We will continue the
work that we're--

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.820
have started and that we are
presenting especially today.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.380
I mentioned that the Center

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:12.380
for the Book specializes
in authors and writing.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.390
And today is no exception.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:18.660
And we have two outstanding
authors to hear from.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:23.060
You'll have an opportunity to talk
with them and to buy their books.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:28.140
And then in the afternoon program,
we have some special presentations

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:33.140 position:56%
that makes the history of our
endeavors, the history of Gallaudet,

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.210
the history of a little bit
of the Library of Congress

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.600
and the use of our collections.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.830
So, it's going to be a very
full and wonderful day.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.760
The first president, I believe
Ricardo was the first president.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:53.940
But Ricardo Lopez is here to
get us started before we hear

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.500
from our authors with
some information

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:02.120
about the history of
the literary society.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.570
And I believe he also has
a PowerPoint presentations,

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:10.690
so it's my pleasure now to
welcome to the stage Ricardo Lopez.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:14.510
Ricardo? Thank you.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.530
[ Applause ]

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:19.720
&gt;&gt; Ricardo Lopez: Thank
you, Mr. Cole.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:25.760
It's such a pleasure
to be here once again.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.540
I used to be the president
of NSLD-- NLSD.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.200
I joined the society when
I was still a student

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.500
at the University of Maryland.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.950
And Alice Hagemeyer
invited me to attend some

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.410
of the society's meetings.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.130
And I learned more and
more about the group

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:54.840 position:56%
through attending those meetings and
realized I had found a home there.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.620
I became more and more
involved and decided

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.700
that not only would I be a
member, I would become president.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:07.000
I had had some experience
with libraries prior to that

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.360
but it wasn't until I joined
the society that I learned

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.550
about the rich history in
the deaf community related

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.660
to libraries and literacy.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.820
This organization was
founded in 1907.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.620
So, as I said, it's very
long and rich history.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.830
I remember 10 years ago when
we partnered with the center

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:36.380
for the book, and that we
continue these partnerships

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.840
that we've developed today.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.090
Our goal is to continue
collaborating with others

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:45.810
to promote literacy
in the deaf community.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:50.040
We hope that more deaf people
will be inspired to become authors

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.460
and that they will
help spread the word

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.160
of our deaf culture
and deaf history.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:06.120
I majored in history and so that
is the theme of my presentation.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.120
I'd like to talk to you a bit
today about the founders of NLSD.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.720
I keep saying NSLD.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:21.770
NLSD. If you'd like
to read the slide,

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:28.870 position:56%
NLSD is one of the oldest
organizations of the deaf in the US.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.610
And the mission is to
promote deaf culture,

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:33.830
especially in public libraries.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.440
And so this partnership that
we have with the Library

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.430
of Congress is critical
to that mission.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.800
When I left the position and Alec
McFarlane took over as president,

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.270
he continued that mission.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.840
And it's work that we
are still having today.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:03.610
As I said, the society
was founded in 1907.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:07.590
And what happened was people

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:12.910
who were attending the Kendall
School got together and realized

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:17.020
that they enjoyed reading as a
way of expressing themselves,

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.870
talking about what
they were reading.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:23.360
It was really more like a
book club in its early days.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:28.580
The original meeting location
was Trinity Episcopal Church.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:34.860
And I'd like now to show you the
image that I found of that church.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.250
So here's an image of the church.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.280
You've got the Capitol
Building right behind it.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.840
This photo is from 1964-- 1864.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.930
And this is where the founders

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.660
of our society today
began their meetings.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:10.690
They met on a monthly
basis in this location.

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:14.930
Now this picture I found here
at the Library of Congress.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:23.230
And this shows the exact
location on the map.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:28.390
I was wondering if the
church was still standing

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:32.400
and I could actually see it
for myself, but what I found is

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.200
that it's no longer there.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:41.390
Instead we have this building.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:46.240
This building stands on the
location of the original church

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.780
and I believe it's now housing
the Department of Labor.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:53.600
So if you happen to be
in that neighborhood,

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.390
you might see this building and
imagine the church that used

00:24:56.390 --> 00:25:00.190
to stand there and be inspired
by our society's founders' work.

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:23.400
Here is a list of the
founders of the society.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.940
Herbert, Gilbert, Arthur,
John, Albert and Roy.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:34.900
I'd like to tell you a little
bit more about each of them.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:40.090
Albert was a deaf person
who attended public schools

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:49.940
and he was a cataloguer in
the National Museum Library.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.140
Arthur was an instructor of
art at the Kendall School

00:25:53.140 --> 00:26:02.250
which was Gallaudet College,
now Gallaudet University.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:06.050
Gilbert was the first
secretary of NLSD.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:09.490
He worked as a photo engraver.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:20.310
John Hotchkiss was faculty at
Gallaudet College for 53 years.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:30.310
Herbert worked for
the US Weather Bureau.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:39.980
And Roy Stewart worked
at the US Census Bureau.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:45.350
Now, Francis Higgins
is pretty well known.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:52.010
He was very active.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:27:05.710
And my understanding is that
he became the first president

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:09.230
when NLSD was officially
established as an organization.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:14.300
He was very involved in those
early days encouraging deaf people

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:18.280
to attend the meetings, to express
themselves in different ways,

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:23.210
all with a literary focus, whether
that's poetry, arts, writing.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:27.630
He was a professor of chemistry.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.660 position:56%
I wonder if anyone in the audience
happens to remember Francis Higgins.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.430 position:56%
Are there a few of you who knew him?

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:37.350
Was he a good professor
during his time at Gallaudet?

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.650
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.720
&gt;&gt; Ricardo Lopez: Now this
is Jeannette Mortzfeldt.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.920
And I was lucky enough to get

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.840
to meet here while she was
still president of our society.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:54.860
I think that I could say that I
still carry her message in my heart

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:59.660
of encouraging deaf people to
get involved in literary studies.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:14.640
She passed away rather
recently, just in 2005.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.260 position:56%
In terms of our activities with NLSD
today, you see them listed here,

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:25.790 position:56%
we do storytelling, we have artists
with us, we've formed various clubs,

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:29.930
we emphasize history, we have a
variety of occupations involved.

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.530
And partnering with the Center

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:37.950
for the Book has really helped us
continue the legacy of the society,

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:43.200
spreading the word to different
organizations, to public libraries,

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.430
collaborating with those entities.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.760
Events like today.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.650 position:56%
I hope that you'll take information
and share that with your communities

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:56.940
and consider ways that you can
encourage your public library

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.950
to partner with NLSD.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.450
So here is where I gathered my
information and I especially want

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:08.290
to recognize Agnes Sutcliffe
who's here in the audience.

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:12.060
She helped collect some of this
information for my presentation.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.010
So thank you, Agnes, for your work.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.450
[ Applause ]

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.900
And thank you all for
your attention.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.420
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well,
thank you very much.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.240
Ricardo, are you-- Here we go.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.660
We are now going to move.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:32.600
I must say that I have learned
from Ricardo and our partnership

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.310
with this organization and
I am going to bring out on--

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:43.220
put on one of our tables some
activity brochures and more news

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:47.010
about what the Center for
the Book has been doing.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:55.620 position:56%
And we again have author talks, we
have presentations, we have projects

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.230
that we've developed
and one of the things

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.970
in the future we might consider
would be to do some kind

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:06.330
of a special project together
as we continue our partnership.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:13.710
We're now going to hear from
Myron Uhlberg, who is an author,

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:18.250
who has been published
by Peachtree Press.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.700
He is well known I think
to many of you as an author

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.890
of several different books,
and he is going to talk today

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:31.150
about a new book that he has
forthcoming, but he also,

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:34.520
I understand, is going to talk
a little bit about his career

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:39.510
as an author of books for
the author for the deaf,

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:42.020
talking about deaf
culture and working

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.720
on bringing our two
cultures together.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.490
He also-- You also will
have a chance to beat him

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:53.400
and he will be signing books
at the Peachtree Press booth,

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.600
and we're very grateful
to Peachtree Press

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.310
for helping support him here today.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:01.500
It's my pleasure to
introduce Myron Uhlberg.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.850
Myron. Nice to meet you.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.150
Very nice.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:13.530
&gt;&gt; Myron Uhlberg: Hello,
my name is Myron Uhlberg.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:21.140
I am hearing but my
parents were deaf.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:27.030
I was the firstborn
of two deaf parents

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:31.270
and I learned sign
language from them.

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:35.760
However, I sign very
slowly and not very well.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.370
I sign like an old person.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:43.220
I do more conversational signing,

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:47.390
so I'm going to ask the
sign language interpreters,

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:51.050
the one to my left, to
interpret my presentation.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:54.920
Thank you.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:00.770
As has been said, you
live your life forwards

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:03.260
but you understand it backwards.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:06.070
And so it is for me.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.520
All my life, I have tried

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:12.230
to understand the child-parent
dynamic of my life.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.190
My parents were deaf.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.390
I was their firstborn child.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:20.540
I could hear, and that has
made all the difference.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:25.840
It was 1933, the absolute bottom of
the great depression and the height

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.860 position:56%
of the bad old days when the deaf in
America were treated by the hearing

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.320
as somehow deficient, illiterate,

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.580
largely incapable of
self-sufficiency.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:41.270
And as I witness everyday
of my childhood,

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.920
objects of scorn and often pity.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:49.060
In my childhood some 80 years
ago, the hearing never tried

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:55.270 position:56%
to understand or recognize or accept
my deaf mother and father as equals,

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:59.510
capable as were they of
raising two children.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:03.130
And they often in my presence
expressed their incredulity

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:08.270
by their distaste of the beautiful
expressive gestural language

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:13.900
of the deaf, my first
language, as mere monkey talk.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:18.670
We had no telephone, no
car, there was no TV,

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:21.860
let alone all the electronic
communicative devices

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:23.290
that exist today.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:25.200
Thus, we were isolated.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.040
In plain sight but ignored.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:32.930
Within the larger hearing culture
of the apartment house we lived in

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:37.210
and the block we lived on and
the neighborhood we lived within.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:41.520
The closest deaf family
live five miles away.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.990
I felt as a child as an
immigrant minefield with one foot

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.740
in the old country of their birth
and the other foot in the country

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:55.460 position:56%
and society and culture of the new
country that they had immigrated to.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:59.310
Never for a minute did I feel
as a child that I had succeeded

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:04.240
in integrating the two vastly
different worlds I lived in,

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:10.250
the one of silence, thoughtfulness
and touch that expressed love.

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:15.790
And the other of incredible noise
and hustle and bustle with no time

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.990
for physical displays of emotion.

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:22.470
The one of speaking with
hands and face and body,

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:25.730
a language that demands
total attention.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.440
A beautiful visual
language perceived

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.230
and appreciated through my eyes.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:35.940
The other, spoken casually as if
I had overheard a conversation,

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.970
with little or no thought
or expression or emotion,

00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:41.830
merely a tool for communication.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:45.410
And so I live and grew
and accommodated myself

00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:48.110
to both worlds everyday of my life.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:52.790
Often confused, occasionally
maladjusted, frustrated,

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:55.010
aching to explain to others,

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:58.550
as well as to myself the
predicament I was in.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:02.980
Until one day I left
my deaf home forever.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:07.030
And all my questions unresolved
during my childhood were buried

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:11.080
in the daily short term quest
to fit in, to find a career,

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.930
a way of making my living,
finding a mate, starting a family.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:20.790
I did all that with varying degrees
of success and failure and one day,

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:24.850
rather late in life, all
the questions returned.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:29.770
Now demanding to be addressed
and answered if possible.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.360
And so I began to write.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.150
I had a story to tell.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:39.040
A story I had lived, the story
of a unique culture that exist

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.330 position:56%
in America largely ignored, isolated

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.980
by the larger culture
within which it exist.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:51.620
The first book I wrote was
"Flying Over Brooklyn".

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:55.480
I was new to this game of
literature and storytelling.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.310
So, somewhat unsure of myself,

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:01.570
I approached my story
side ways and not head on.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:04.440
I would tell the tale
through metaphors,

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.780
images, allegories and symbols.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:13.710
For example, never is it stated in
the story that the mother is deaf.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:18.600
Snow would equal silence
and silence deafness.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.910
The stillness of the vast snowfall
would muffle the boy's words

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:27.120
to all harsh meaningless
distracting noise.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.390
The remaining senses
would be magnified.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:34.110
The story is told through
the hearing boy's eyes.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:37.680
Eyes that see everything acutely.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.960
Nothing escapes his sight and
everything he sees has meaning.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.310
I quote from the book.

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:47.530
I could see the parachute jump
and the giant wonder wheel.

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:52.500
Their sharp outlines now
softened by pillows of snow.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.150
He smells the smell of roasted
peanuts and fat hotdogs.

00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:02.710
He taste the sticky sweetness of
cotton candy melting in his mouth.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:08.310
And he touches, he feels the
snowflakes melting on his cheeks

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.700
and the wind on his face.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.470
The boy can fly.

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:14.530
He flies over everything.

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.330
He's above it all,
forever an observer.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:21.580
Aware of, but not really a
part of his everyday world.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:26.920
And in the end, his mother
awakens him from his dream.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:31.800
And in the last illustration
views the deep vast snow.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.320 position:56%
The essence of deafness with her arm

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.110
around the boy's shoulders,
they are connected.

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:43.730
They are co-joined, the deaf
mother and her hearing child

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:46.130
through the love they
have for each other.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:52.530
A love that overrides while
combining all the senses.

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:58.160 position:56%
With my current book, my latest book
published by Peachtree Publishers,

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:03.490
titled "The Sound of All Things",
I begin the quarter of books,

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.940
which subject is the
perceptions of a hearing boy

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:12.460 position:56%
and his beloved deaf mother and
father who live in a world of sound.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.690
The dynamic of the hearing
child and his deaf parents

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:18.590
in a time now long
gone when the hearing

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:23.360
and deaf worlds were too
parallel but separate worlds.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.790
In "The Sound of All Things",
the boy is six years old.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:29.920
As long as he can remember,
the central fact of his life is

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.420
that his mother and father
cannot hear him nor can they hear

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.720
anything else.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.020
They are deaf.

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.080
His deaf father tries to compensate

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.450
by using his remaining
senses to perceive sound.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:46.170
At Coney Island, during a
fireworks display, while--

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:47.760
and I quote from the book.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:52.990
The air was full of buzzing,
whistling, popping and screeching.

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:57.100
The lights and colors danced
across my father's face.

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:04.420 position:56%
He held out his hands sniffing the
air as if to see and taste and touch

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:09.780
and smell the sounds of the
fireworks he couldn't hear.

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.150
This was normal for the boy,
and up until the age of six,

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:15.740 position:56%
he gave the fact no special meaning.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:19.150
But at the age of six,
his deaf father tasks him

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:22.740
to be his interface
with the hearing world.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:26.000
He wants his son to be his ears.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.840
"What do you hear,"
my father asked me.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.710
"What does the ocean sound like?"

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:34.620
A big job for a small boy.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.730
Overnight the roles reversed.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.410
Now, in a way, while they
are out in the hearing world,

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:43.890
the boy is father to the man.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:48.440
This was common back then
before TV and closed captioning,

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:54.120
movies with subtitle, emails,
instant messaging, short messaging,

00:39:54.120 --> 00:40:00.770
TTY, computers, Google, iPhones,
texting, tweeting, fax machines,

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:05.610
and the portability of
iPads, FaceTime and Skype.

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:08.170
None of that existed then.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:11.850 position:56%
This book just published, "The Sound
of All Things", begins my story.

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:15.880
It is the foundation of every
book of mine that follows.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:22.780
In the next book, "The Printer",
the boy is now 10 years old.

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:28.370
His father makes paper hats for
him when he comes home from work.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:30.300
The boy is proud of his father.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.630
His father has a job, a good job.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:37.920 position:56%
And he goes to work in a suit, a
shirt and a tie, and he wears a hat.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.070
But why do the neighbors
feel sorry for him?

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:44.660
His father works for the New York
Daily News, the largest newspaper

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.580
in the world at the
time of the story.

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:50.340
They print two and a half
million copies a day,

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.070
five million on Sunday.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:55.400
He's a printer, a compositor,
a good job.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.780
He's proud to have that
he works with language.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.630
He creates language with his hands.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.980
He's a typesetter, a skill
he learned at Fanwood,

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.770
his deaf residential school.

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:10.630 position:56%
The backstory is that the father
tells the boy how he first was taken

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:15.150
to school by his father
and left there.

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:19.380
The first day, he felt
abandoned and he cried.

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:23.470
But he soon realized that rather
than being lost, he had been found.

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:28.360
He now lived in a familiar world,
populated by boys who were just

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:33.540
like him, no longer that he
feel different and alone.

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:36.500
At night in the communal
bathroom, he learned the language

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.740
from the older boys, the
beautiful language of the deaf,

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:44.920
a gesture language of signs,
utilizing hands, face and body.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.310 position:56%
During the day, he learned to trade.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:52.240
Most of the deaf boys learned
shoe repair or house painting.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.050
He learned typesetting.

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:59.870 position:56%
As a boy, I write, my father
learned how to speak with his hands.

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:02.900
As a man, he learned how to turn--

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:07.130
type letters into words
and sentences.

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:10.480
My father loved being a printer.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.040
One day, the deaf father
takes his son on the subway

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.340
to the place where he works.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:18.880
And now, the boy learns of the
reality of the workplace prejudice

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:23.150
that his father endures
every single day.

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:27.100
Quoting the book, sometimes
my father felt sad

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:31.800
about the way he was treated by
his fellow workers who could hear.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.120
Because they could talk
to him with their hands,

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:38.070
they seemed to ignore him-- I mean,
because they couldn't talk to him,

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.790
they seemed to ignore him.

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:44.980
Years went by as my father and
the hearing worked side by side,

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:49.010
they never exchanged
a single thought.

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:51.170
On the subway ride back home,

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:55.340
he sees a deaf man selling
deaf alphabet cards.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.220
His father is angry.

00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:01.990
He yells in sign languages
into the deaf man.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:03.470
The deaf man runs away,

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:08.000
and the entire subways
caused steer-- stares at us.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.310
Be self-sufficient, the
father tells the boy.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:13.670
Being deaf does not rob
a man of his dignity.

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:19.160 position:56%
Being deaf does not define a person,
who they are or what they do,

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.750
how they live is what's important,
the father tells the boy.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:26.530
The boy hardly understands what
the father is saying to him.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:31.150
The signs pour from his father's
hands in a time of motion

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.600
and meaning, too hard to follow.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:39.410
But the boy instinctively feels
his father's strength, his manhood,

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:44.220
his pride and above all,
his love for his son.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:48.970
My next book, "Dad, Jackie
and Me", which has won many--

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:56.960 position:56%
I'm happy to say, many, many
awards, the boy is now 13 years old.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.440
For his birthday, his father
buys a pair of tickets

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.020
to the Brooklyn Dodger
baseball game at Ebbets Field

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:05.550
to see the first black
baseball player

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:09.220
in Major League Baseball,
Jackie Robinson.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:12.940
The father identifies with
Robinson, a black man,

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.760
but the boy has no idea why.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.890
The father never played
sports at his deaf school.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:22.060
The emphasis was on learning
how to make a living,

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.310
and not how to play games.

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:26.820
At Ebbets Field, the boy
experiences prejudice

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.640
and discrimination
on a larger scale.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:34.040
It seems to him that the entire
baseball world hates Jackie

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:37.050
Robinson, but they
don't even know him.

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:41.590
And the boy realized, it doesn't
matter, Robinson is black,

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:45.570
and having black skin is reason
enough for some people to hate him,

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:48.380
just like it seems to the boy

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:55.230
that some people hate his father
mostly because he cannot hear.

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:59.260
Now, he understands why his father
identifies with Jackie Robinson.

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:02.910
And the boy notes how some
people stare at his father

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:07.600
as he cheers Jackie
on in his deaf voice,

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.840
many with distaste on their face.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:15.650
By the way, please note, the
new Ken Burns documentary film

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:20.350
about Jackie Robinson in
which I get to tell my story

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:24.540
about my deaf father and Jackie
Robinson and the book I wrote

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:30.780
about the two of them will premiere
this coming Monday on April 11th

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.700
on Public Broadcasting Channel.

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:37.680
The date and the time will be
announced in your local newspaper.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.980
It's worth watching,

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.790
it's a tremendous movie
about Jackie Robinson.

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:46.170
As I say, I get to act out a little
bit of it in telling the story

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:48.240
which I love, which is my story.

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.790
The next book in this
story, "Hands of My Father",

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:53.140
which I don't have a copy with me.

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:57.790
I am absolutely proud to
advise you that this book,

00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:03.130
"Hands of My Father", was chosen
by the Library of Congress

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:06.640
to be recorded as an
audible book for the blind.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.830
They don't do that with
every book, but they did it

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:11.770
with my memoir, "Hands
of My Father".

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:16.460
This is a book, a memoir,
for all ages, any age.

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:20.930
It attempts through the eyes and
sensibility of one hearing child

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:24.000
to tell the story of his
deaf parents who were born

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.290
at the turn of the last century.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:30.500
The firstborn in each
of their families

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.690
to hearing immigrant parents

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:36.610
who barely knew the
English language themselves

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:42.390
and never learned a
single word of sign.

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:46.420 position:56%
They met in a place called Brooklyn,
a place that no longer exists.

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:51.460
It was then more rural, a series
of villages than an actual city,

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:57.570
in old Coney Island, the poor man's
Miami Beach, and they fell in love.

00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:01.800
They found in each other their
mirror image, partners for life,

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:05.770
defenders of each other,
taking refuge in each other

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:09.160
in an often hostile hearing world.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.670
They were now complete.

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:15.280
And then, against their
parents' well-intended

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:21.090
but heartless admonition that
they were children themselves,

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:27.170 position:56%
they ignored their parents and they
dared to have a child who they loved

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:31.350
as they loved each other,
but who because he could hear

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:34.860
and they could not never
could be fully a part of them.

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:38.640
And now, they found
themselves in a unique world,

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:43.930
sandwiched between their hearing
parents and their hearing child.

00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:48.800
The bridge in both directions
was for these two special people,

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.340
their infinite capacity for love.

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:56.270
But as is the case with race today,
much has changed for the deaf.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:59.360
And yet, much remains the same.

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.280
You're all aware of the
changes primarily ADA,

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.850
Americans with Disability
Act, the amazing array

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:08.660
of electronic communicative
devices and platforms.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:13.450
But in human terms, in human
interaction with the hearing world,

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:18.120
I've seen this, we all
have, much remains the same.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:21.340
I learned just how little has
changed when I brought my mother

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:25.240
to live with me when she
turned 89 and broke her pelvis

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.480
and then had a series of strokes.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:31.550
Soon upon arriving in my home,
she fell and broke her hip.

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:35.590
In time, her pelvis healed and
she survived a hip replacement.

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:38.470
But now, she was confined
to a wheelchair.

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:43.800 position:56%
For the next six years, I witnessed
a series of events that hearken back

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:48.890
to the '30s and '40s, a time
of no sympathy for the deaf

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:52.650
or accommodation for the
deaf, to mention a few,

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:54.610
hospitals, doctors, nurses.

00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:58.890
In the emergency room which you
all too often found yourself,

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:04.950
there was a sign regarding the
availability of an interpreter,

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:07.350
but there was no interpreter.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:11.940
And when I pointed that out to
the staff, they looked at me.

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.790
I pointed out the sign that
was sitting in plain sight

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:18.250
at the admission desk,
they never noticed it,

00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:21.270
they never didn't know
what an interpreter was.

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:24.610
They weren't aware of the
sign and what it called for.

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:26.240
Her doctors not aware of--

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:30.550
by law that now, he had
to have an interpreter,

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:34.790
were rendered virtually useless
in diagnosing and communicating.

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:39.050
They simply had no
time for a deaf person.

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:42.170
Her nurses, that was
the best of all.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:48.310
Upon admission, I advised the
nurse's station, my mother is deaf.

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:54.060
Next morning above her bed
was a large handwritten sign,

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:57.250
patient is hard of hearing.

00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:01.600
I pointed out that hard
of hearing was not deaf

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.620
and explained the difference.

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:09.690
OK. Early the next morning,
I found a new sign in place

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:12.770
above her bed, patient is deaf.

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:17.900
I swear this is true,
patient is deaf, shout.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:22.550
Shout. And sure enough, while
I was in my mom's bedside,

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:26.770
a nurse came in, saw the
sign and began to shout

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:30.150
at my mother right in her face.

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:35.160
On another-- This is not
1930, this is eight years ago.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:38.670
On another occasion, another
hospital visit, I came to a room

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:43.600
at dawn and she was sleeping,
and her hands were tied

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:47.570
to the bed railing
with strips of cloth.

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:50.810
I raged at the nurses, raged,

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:53.330
telling them that my
mother was deaf.

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:58.360
And the deaf communicate with
their hands using sign language.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.860
One nurse was surprised,
your mother can talk?

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.160
She asked.

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.470
She didn't know that the
deaf had a language at all.

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:09.790
Her hospital said no text,
telephone in the emergency room,

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:12.940
the main library, anywhere--
or anywhere else I could find.

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.390
What's the conclusion?

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:18.630
Without me to interpret for
her in a medical setting,

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:21.920
she would have been
virtually helpless.

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:26.140
And for the general population,
the usual, stares, gaping mouths,

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:29.980
reaction ranging from
pointedly ignoring my mother

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:32.570
to overtly dismissing her.

00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:35.600
But there were some examples
of how nothing has changed

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.790
that I experienced
that I have of my own.

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:40.470
I'm not deaf.

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:45.090
But ironically, I am now diagnosed
as being functionally deaf.

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:47.570
As a child while growing
up, I would often wonder,

00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:49.510
what's it like to be deaf?

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:53.540
I would close my eyes
and imagine being blind,

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:57.040
but I couldn't close my
ears and imagine being deaf

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.800
like my mother and father.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.390
Now, I don't have to
try to close my years,

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:04.770 position:56%
time and age has taken care of that.

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:08.320
Without my hearing aids, the
most powerful in the market,

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:12.490
I would hear very little and
we can comprehend even less.

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:15.780
But even with the aids, I have
trouble understanding speech,

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:20.130
often getting things
wrong, sometimes comically.

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:23.270
But strangers don't find
it funny when I asked them

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:26.020
to please repeat themselves.

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:30.420
Their reactions range from
impatience to outright hostility.

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:33.170
What's the matter, you
stupid or something?

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:35.940
With all of this firsthand
experience between the deaf

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:39.160
and the hearing, with those
of my parents from the 1930s

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.210
on through the new millennium,

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:45.800
I'm convinced that the essential
problem is ignorance on the part

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.600
of the majority of hearing people.

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.110
And the heart of all
misunderstanding

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:52.860
between human beings
is that ignorance.

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:57.410
The more light we can shed on
this subject, deaf history,

00:52:57.410 --> 00:53:02.900
current deaf life in America,
deaf culture and ASL through books

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.890
in libraries available to all,

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:08.580
the better we can tell
and preserve our story.

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:11.240
I've tried in some small
way with my books to provide

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.720
for the hearing a window
into the deaf world.

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:16.540
And in that regard, I
could come for the reading

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:20.040
of many similar reviewers'
comments and I'm quoting,

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:24.610
"This is a touching story
from an unusual perspective.

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:28.170
I learned so much about
the deaf and the ways

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:31.580
that society has mistreated them."

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.320
But the one review of many,

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:37.540
when I read it brought
tears to my eyes was this.

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:43.260
I quote, "I cannot help but think
while reading "Hands of My Father"

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:48.200
that even so many years
after his father's death,

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:54.190
Uhlberg is still acting as Lou's
translator, still bridging the gap

00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:56.830
between his parents
and the hearing world.

00:53:56.830 --> 00:54:01.950
He has become his father's hands."

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:05.260
With such encouragement, I
continue to write helping to learn

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:09.460 position:56%
from writing while dredging up old
memories, long-buried and unexamined

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:13.470
but still burning brightly in mind
as they happened just yesterday,

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:17.700
new insights on those
two remarkable people,

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:22.000
Lou and Sally, my deaf parents.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.510
Thank you.

00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:28.360
[ Applause ]

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.610
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well,
thank you, Myron,

00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:35.140 position:56%
for really a wonderful personal
story based not only on your family,

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:36.850
but on your own experience.

00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:42.550
And there's nothing that brings the
problems of being deaf to others

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:45.720
than the personal kinds
of anecdotes.

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:49.670
And the fact that you have told
these experiences in your books,

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:55.230
well, something is telling the
story and helping in many ways.

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:59.420
I just checked, Myron, the three
books that you will be able to talk

00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:00.720
to Myron about or at least

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.170
to purchase are the
three he talked about.

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:05.190
But he has a wonderful career.

00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:07.950
He's actually the author
of seven books.

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:11.410
And as we learned this
morning, most of those are based

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:17.960
on personal experience and he has
wonderful-- not only a messenger,

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:22.730
but it really personifies what
we're doing about this problem

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:26.480
and communicate-- improving
communication today

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.710
at the Library of Congress.

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:32.620
We have a second wonderful
experience ahead of us.

00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:35.970
Harry Lang-- Dr. Harry
Lang is with us.

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:41.340
He's-- We thank Gallaudet
press for supporting him

00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:44.420
and for the exhibit table
that's here that talks

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:46.040
about a number of his books.

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:51.780
He's going to be actually talking
about a new book that's still

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:54.420
in the works but about
to be published.

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.960
It's called "Fighting
in the Shadows,

00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.250
The American Civil War
through Deaf Eyes".

00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:02.470
And I must point out
that this afternoon,

00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:06.750
he also will be talking a little
bit about his historical research

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:09.440
of that related to
this book and to--

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.730
related to his historical books.

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:16.810
So, this is in a sense
a prepublication event

00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:19.610
where you are going to
learn some of the details

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:22.300
that are forthcoming in the book.

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:25.800
And we are very pleased to
have him here not for one,

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:29.080
but also for two appearances.

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:34.220 position:56%
Harry Lang is not just an author and
an educator, a professor emeritus

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:38.370 position:56%
at the National Technical
Institute for the Deaf at Rochester.

00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:41.000
And as I said, we're very
pleased to have him here.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.860
Let's welcome Harry Lang.

00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:45.490
And where are you, Harry?

00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:47.920
There you are.

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.310
&gt;&gt; Harry G. Lang: Good
morning everyone.

00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:51.960
I'm very happy to be
here today with you.

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:55.590
It's a wonderful honor to be here.

00:56:55.590 --> 00:56:59.870
You know I've been retired now
for five years from the position.

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:02.370
And I never imagined that I would
be standing in front of the Library

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:06.090 position:56%
of Congress, the largest library in
the world, giving this presentation.

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:08.220
And I love libraries, you know.

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:11.130
When you write books, you really
hope that they'll end up there.

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:13.820
So, you've got to like
the-- I like libraries.

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:16.270
I also feel very lucky
because in the audience,

00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:19.280
we have one of the
best editor of books,

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.840
[inaudible] Wallace here with us.

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:29.510
And also many of you are sure to
know the name of Michael Olson

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:34.550
who is also here with us today,
one of the best archivists

00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:36.870
that we can have here
in our presence.

00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:40.780
So again, I've been very lucky
to be working with these folks

00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:44.270 position:56%
who have been supporting me
through the books that I've written.

00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:50.570
I also have to thank Alice
Hagemeyer and Alec McFarlane

00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:53.830
for inviting me here and for
really getting me out of my shell,

00:57:53.830 --> 00:58:00.780 position:56%
out of warm Florida-- or hot Florida
to come up here into chilly DC.

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:02.720
Many of you have such
warm personalities

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:05.360
that I guess that's what
really finally convinced me

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.410
that the temperature would
be warm enough here today.

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:19.070
So this morning, I was asked
to focus on my tenth book

00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:21.480
which is focusing on the civil war.

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:24.880
And this afternoon, I'm going to be
presenting again about how it was

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:28.450
that I used the Library of
Congress during my research

00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:30.330
for that manuscript.

00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:34.980
I'll be giving you more examples
from civil war book research,

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:36.920
but also from other books as well.

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:44.570
So as I said, the focus
here is going to be on the--

00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:45.950
on deaf culture and
the deaf community.

00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:48.890
But as I'm sure you know,
during the civil war,

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:51.670
the deaf community was a very
new thing for deaf people.

00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:54.910 position:56%
We're talking about 1860s of course.

00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:58.740
The first school for the
deaf was established in 1817,

00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:01.900
the American School for
the Deaf in Connecticut

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.760
and was just really
one very small school.

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:07.190
It was from there that the
deaf community was born

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:10.300 position:56%
and propagated in the United States.

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:14.990
So, it was not too far in
advance of the civil war.

00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:19.970
And we certainly see that American
Sign Language was threatened

00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:26.800
and banned with Samuel Howell
trying to discourage students

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:30.070
from using sign language
just there before the war.

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:32.360
So, we can certainly say
from the outset of the war

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.500
that the deaf community
was struggling

00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:36.550
as far as deaf culture went.

00:59:36.550 --> 00:59:40.150
We did have some focus on
sign language, and I was able

00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:44.900
to find some evidence of some deaf
artists who during the war focused

00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:47.440
on the war and documenting
what was happening

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.230
in the American experience.

00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:52.040
But there was really very little
that these artists were doing

00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.740
about the deaf community itself.

00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:58.540
So, I'll focus here in my talk
about that period of history

00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:01.330
and the characters that
were involved in it.

01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:03.750
If we could move on.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:11.790
So, one thing that I learned
from 12 years of research

01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:16.870
on the civil war was that
the deaf community was really

01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:19.310
on the verge of crumbling.

01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:23.750 position:56%
Because of the war's politics being
so strong in the states at the time,

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:26.210
you know, the brotherhood

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:29.340
of deaf people was
really a myth at the time.

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.110
The politics of the war were
dividing people left and right,

01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:35.150
between north and south,
black and white.

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:38.760
And the same things were
happening in the deaf community.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:42.410
And those were some of the issues
that I faced when I wrote the book.

01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:43.820
Really, the deaf community existed

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.150
in small pockets throughout
the United States.

01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:47.740
And the north and south divide.

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:51.240
Among those pockets was very
clear in the stories that I found

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.270
that deaf people wrote conflicting

01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:58.330
with other deaf people
in those other pockets.

01:00:58.330 --> 01:01:03.780
Dr. Gertz talked about Gallaudet
University and the partnership

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:07.160
with the Library of Congress.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:11.090
I actually pulled a quote
from the Jefferson Building.

01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:14.920
If Mr. Cole is here, yeah?

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.480
Here's a quote here from
the Jefferson Building

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.330
if you're familiar with it.

01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:23.190
Did anyone know who
made this quote famous?

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:25.640
It was a deaf writer in fact.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:34.770
And if we go into the next
slide, we'll see who that was.

01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:39.020
Edward Bulwer-Lytton was the
person who coined that quote.

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:41.020
He was deaf from a young man

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:45.530
and became very isolated throughout
his life because of his deafness.

01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:50.170
But that was-- he was very
much an example of how he--

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:54.730
how his deafness was invisible
in the historical record.

01:01:54.730 --> 01:02:00.470 position:56%
I'll talk more this afternoon with
some stories about how the word deaf

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:06.060
when you search for archives comes
up with a lot of hits for the types

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:11.630
of stories that you
might be looking for.

01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:17.050
So, the origins of my work
with the book started in 1984

01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:21.740
when I was lucky to
meet Dr. Stephen Hawking

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:27.410 position:56%
because I was a physicist myself
and the president of an organization

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.420
for scientists with disabilities.

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:31.790
So, Dr. Hawking actually came
here to the United States

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:34.780
and I was invited to
meet him at that event.

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.710
I was able to interview him there
and it was a wonderful honor.

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:41.670
If you look here at this
picture on the right-hand side,

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:44.870
you'll see that I used to have
hair at some point in my life.

01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:46.620
It started to fade here.

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:50.870
But my ASL interpreter is pictured
there in the middle of the picture

01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:54.170
and you'll see Dr. Hawking seated
in his-- in the wheelchair.

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:59.130
So, he has an assistant here at
the time because this was very much

01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:04.840
at the time when-- because of
ALS taking control of his voice.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.210
His muscle control was waning.

01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:11.890
In the middle of the interview
that I conducted with him,

01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:16.250
he would look up and try
to speak for himself.

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:19.520
But sometimes, his assistant
would have to intervene,

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.500
listen to what he was trying
to say and repeat his response

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:28.620
so that the ASL interpreter
could then translate the message.

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:32.300 position:56%
But at one point, he said, you know,
it must be difficult to be deaf.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:36.180
And I said, yeah, you know, I
like to play tennis and, you know,

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:40.560
we've all got some
struggles in life,

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.120
things that prevent
us from doing things.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:47.170
And so, I think that really
inspired me in my research

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:49.770
when I went back to Rochester.

01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:52.510
If we can move on?

01:03:52.510 --> 01:04:00.650
To do what I call NIH research,
who can tell me what NIH means?

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:02.620
OK. So, we've got a
guess from the audience

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:05.530
that this means the National
Institutes of Health.

01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:07.370
No, you're wrong there.

01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:11.990
No. No, that's not at all
what I mean by NIH research.

01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:16.810
My definition of NIH research,
if we can have it on the screen,

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:20.600
is Needle in a Haystack Research.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:25.370
If you're familiar with the
adage, it means that when I go

01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:29.770
to the library, you know, I'd look
at a barrage of science books.

01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:33.850
And in some ways, the only way for
finding the things that I'm looking

01:04:33.850 --> 01:04:38.930 position:56%
for is to read through them and look
for the word deaf because this type

01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:40.600
of research is not easy to do.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.210
There is really very little
published on deaf scientists

01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:45.100
when I began my research.

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:49.470
I went to France at one point and
tried to find the word school.

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:56.160
I read through German books
looking for the words--

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.610
the German words for deaf.

01:04:57.610 --> 01:05:02.010
And one by one, I was able to
find things luckily and found

01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:06.010
over 3000 mentions of deaf
scientists throughout history.

01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:10.710
But really, this traces
back to my meeting

01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:15.110
with Dr. Hawking and
his inspiration.

01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:18.480
There are different approaches
to writing biographies.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:23.640
The first book, "Silence of
the Spheres", which is history

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:26.320
of science from a deaf perspective.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.620
It shows a history of deaf
people, both women and men,

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:33.030
who had been successful in science.

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:36.120
But their stories are
unfortunately not shared very much.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.480
And I was lucky to
find their stories

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.880
and publish them into that book.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:44.000
The second book is "Deaf Persons
in the Arts and Sciences".

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.750 position:56%
This has different biographies, more
in depth than the first publication.

01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:55.210
Next one is "A Phone of Our Own".

01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:58.170
This is about the invention
of the TTY.

01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:01.480
And I'm sure some of the--
us here in the audience,

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.260
especially our last
speaker, remember us growing

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.290
up without any access
to a telephone.

01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:08.840
And it was really the deaf
community fighting for the rights

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.160
to use a telephone that--

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:16.620
against AT&amp;T who had refused
to help us in the community.

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:20.530
That caused us to invent
our own machine, the TTY.

01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:23.490
An interesting story that I
learned from that research is

01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:27.260
that many deaf people who
really loved deaf culture

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:33.650
and really loved the ownership
of the TTY also had kept in mind

01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:41.560
that the TTY was developed
by three oral deaf people.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:45.000
These were members of the
Alexander Graham Bell Foundation

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.930
who developed the TTY.

01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:49.720
And so, there was some, you
know, tension in knowing

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.240
that this machine was
invented by non-signers.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:56.680
And throughout the book
here, we confront the issues

01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:01.100
of these people not being
signers and their membership

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:05.590
in the Alexander Graham Bell
Foundation and how ownership

01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:08.440 position:56%
of the TTY actually came in the form

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:11.380
of collaboration between
AG Bell and NAD.

01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:17.360
It was when the Alexander Graham
Bell Foundation invited NAD members

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.860
to a meeting to show
off the technology.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:23.550
And it was at that point
where we saw this sort

01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:27.500
of landmark collaboration between
non-signing and signing members

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:31.130
of the deaf community
to develop the TTY.

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:35.350
So, I think it was proof
that in collaboration

01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:38.060
between these two parts of
the community, you know,

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:43.850
important collaborations and
innovations can take shape.

01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:48.910
Mr. Sanderson from the National
Association of the Deaf saw how

01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:52.860
that event could move into
other spheres, like education

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:59.900
and cooperation that these two
organizations could bring to light.

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:07.450 position:56%
So, here's another book about Robert
Panara, if you're familiar with him,

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.120
a good friend of 40 years.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:15.210 position:56%
He was very successful both in the
hearing world and in the deaf world.

01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:22.570 position:56%
And Bob Davila, also a good friend
of mine and also a very skilled user

01:08:22.570 --> 01:08:30.520
of Spanish, a trilingual person, I
was able to read a book about him.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:37.800
Here's another one about really
my research on the Civil War

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:44.440
when one night I was reading an
unpublished manuscript that was

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:50.250
of good size, looking
back at Edmund Booth.

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:56.070
So, he was reminiscing about
his children in this document.

01:08:56.070 --> 01:09:01.110
And his son remembered
that one night, working--

01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:05.480
sitting with his mom who was deaf
and several hearing children,

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:11.610
his father, Mr. Booth, came home
from working at the newspaper

01:09:11.610 --> 01:09:15.390
to tell his family that Abraham
Lincoln had been assassinated.

01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:20.460
So I have a quote here from his
son, if you go into the next slide,

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:26.400
that says that, "His
face was white and stern.

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.490
The lines about his mouth were set

01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:32.940
and his eye expressed both
deep anger and sorrow."

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:37.170
That quote really made me think,

01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:41.580
how was it that deaf people
lived during the civil war?

01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:49.100
I wondered what they did, how
they got involved in the war.

01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:53.960
Next slide please.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:10:03.950
So, I had the story of this one
deaf man and he was very involved

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:05.360
in the war I should I say.

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.450
He was an editorial
writer in his life.

01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:15.210
He had many hearing soldiers
in the war he corresponded with

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:18.620
and he would publish
their stories in his--

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:21.810
a newspaper from Anamosa., Iowa.

01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:26.090
He published their stories there
and really called them friends.

01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:29.420
He considered them
very close companions.

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:32.330
But his life was threatened
several times because he fought

01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:38.150
with copperheads, you know, the
peace democrats at the time.

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:41.130
He hated them, they hated him.

01:10:41.130 --> 01:10:45.060
On the streets, they would confront
each other and get in some scuffles

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:47.710
and they would write
notes back and forth.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.790
And Edmund Booth's
daughter wrote that his--

01:10:56.790 --> 01:11:02.830
her father who was deaf
was-- had a very mighty pen,

01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:04.400
much mightier than the sword.

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:09.310
And she felt that he
did more for the Union

01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:12.890
than any soldier potentially
had done rather

01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:17.050
than potentially the exception
of Grant Lee or Sheridan.

01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:20.670
So these newspapers
would copy his editorials

01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:23.520
and publish them across the nation.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.930
So, this raised the
question of, you know,

01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:34.990
I wanted to continue
my NIH research to see

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:36.930
if there were more deaf
people that I could find

01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:38.230
who had been engaged in the war.

01:11:38.230 --> 01:11:43.500
I didn't really find
anything, any specific book

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:47.090
that was the talked-about deaf
people's involvements in the war.

01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:52.610
I did briefly find a few articles
that mentioned a woman by the name

01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:57.110
of Laura Redden who had
written several things.

01:11:57.110 --> 01:12:00.260
I found one website that said
there had been no soldiers

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.470
who were deaf in the civil war.

01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:07.340
But I was skeptical of that truth
and didn't accept it for my own.

01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:09.690
So, I continued my NIH research.

01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:13.800
And I felt like that was really
the only way to go about this,

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:18.470
this journey to find who was deaf
and involved in the civil war.

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:26.370
In the area of writing, you know,
fighting with the pen, if you will,

01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:31.850
I found that deaf writers
and deaf newspaper editors,

01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:35.280
deaf poets were somewhat prevalent.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.530
I found a deaf diarist as well.

01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:45.030
Deaf people corresponded with
each other in letter form.

01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:49.550
So, we were lucky to find a lot of
documentation about their thoughts

01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:52.660
and how it was that they
were believing in the cause

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:59.400
of either the north or the
south through what they wrote.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.130
There's also fighting
with the sword.

01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:06.300
I found several stories
of deaf soldiers, many.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:15.250
Some of whom joined the north, some
of whom joined the south and some

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:20.350
who fought and died, some who
weren't accepted into the army

01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:24.320
because of the medical
test that ruled them

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.570
out where the doctors would refuse

01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:29.710
to admit profoundly deaf
people into the core.

01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:32.680
Although, they would often
accept hard of hearing people,

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:39.310
but they would try to, you know,
limit them to saying that deaf--

01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:41.450
that hard of hearing
people wouldn't know

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:44.220
from which side an
enemy was approaching.

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:48.920 position:56%
And so, a lot of issues came up when
I was finding these deaf soldiers.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:51.390
And the theme was that hard

01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:56.800
of hearing soldiers were more
prevalent than deaf soldiers.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.040 position:56%
Among those who were accepted into
the armies, they were often assigned

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:06.430
to noncombatant roles like
clerks or horse care or cooks

01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:11.380
and not many fought, although there
were some stories there as well.

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:15.490
There were a lot of stories
about hearing men who became deaf

01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:20.840
as a result of their service in the
army, tens of thousands who fought

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:24.130
and who through injuries
became deaf.

01:14:24.130 --> 01:14:26.730
And so, I think that that was
actually an interesting experience

01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:29.890
to read about because you could
see how they had to adjust

01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:32.740
to the deaf world,
but at the same time,

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:35.340
fight for their own
lives and survival.

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:38.960
So, I saw many experiences that
popped up through my research

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:44.790
where these people who were
born hearing began to understand

01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:49.000
that there was this new balance in
their lives, that they were living

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.530
with tinnitus or for those of
you who are deaf like myself,

01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:58.570
learning that vibrations
can mean something to you,

01:14:58.570 --> 01:15:02.410
like that there's a loud noise
somewhere, either far away

01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:06.580
or closer depending on the type
of vibrations that you feel.

01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:12.090
So, these people were learning to
gain these feels in their lives

01:15:12.090 --> 01:15:16.120
as a result of becoming deaf.

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.980
And that, you know, eventually
would actually help them in battle

01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:21.420
if they decided to continue on.

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:25.680 position:56%
I think the most interesting thing
for me was when the war was actually

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:30.220
over and seeing the stories that
emerged there, seeing the tens

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.830
of thousands of hearing
men who became deaf

01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:38.040
who did not receive pensions equal
to those who had other disabilities

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.540
that they sustained during the war.

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:44.670 position:56%
These men actually formed an
organization called the Silent Army.

01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:48.720
And the Silent Army fought
the United States government

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:51.410
for equal pension pay as other--

01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:53.580
as people with other
types of disabilities.

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:56.130
And we can actually thank the
Library of Congress for that

01:15:56.130 --> 01:15:59.060
because the Library of
Congress has a book in fact

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:06.110
in its archives called "The Silent
Army" with 101 actual stories

01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:10.690
of people who became deaf
during the Civil War and later

01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:14.570
on could not get jobs because
of the attitudes that existed

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:19.020
within hearing communities and
the new issues that cropped

01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:22.530
up around communication
with family and colleagues.

01:16:22.530 --> 01:16:30.560 position:56%
Some of you have who have-- who live
here may have visited Fort Defense--

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:31.860
Fort Stevens rather.

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:33.920
It's here in DC on Georgia Avenue.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:40.040
So if any of you have seen it,
you might be familiar with it.

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:43.550 position:56%
For those of you who are not, Fort
Stevens has a very interesting story

01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:45.540 position:56%
that I'll share with you here today.

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:49.230
I'll use a quote that I mentioned
before that some people--

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:51.320 position:56%
some deaf people had joined militias

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.810
because they couldn't actually
be accepted to the official army

01:16:55.810 --> 01:17:00.200
so they joined instead militia
organizations to protect the towns

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:02.720
when the enemy combatants
were approaching.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:05.650
Sometimes the armies, you know,
weren't readily available.

01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:08.690
So, civilians had to fight
the wars for themselves.

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:12.260
So, this is the story of
an 11-year-old deaf boy

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:17.490
who was a gardener in
fact in his community

01:17:17.490 --> 01:17:22.290
with a woman whose husband
was an admiral in the US Navy,

01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:25.090
and she wrote letters to
her husband about this--

01:17:25.090 --> 01:17:30.190
about what was going
on in her hometown.

01:17:30.190 --> 01:17:33.410
And when the south was approaching
and attacking Washington, DC,

01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:37.020
Fort Stevens was the only battle

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:41.390
that President Lincoln had
actually observed in person.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:45.550
So, he actually came to the area.

01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:48.320
The soldiers warned him that
he shouldn't stand up because

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:52.980
as he was very tall, they were
worried that he would be a target.

01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:56.310
That was the only battle as I said

01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:59.030
that Lincoln was there
for in person.

01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:02.290
But at any rate, the soldiers
were there, they were talking

01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:04.360
about that the president was there.

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:09.180
But they actually more talked
about this 11-year-old deaf boy

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:13.290
who stole a rifle from the
woman that he was working

01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:18.940
as a gardener whose husband was
the admiral and joined the battle

01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.770
and killed six rebels
in the process.

01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:24.090
Can you imagine an
11-year-old deaf boy doing this?

01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:27.200
And I have-- Anyway, I have a quote
from her letter, that the woman

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.500
that he was working for, to her
husband describing the situation.

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:34.270
She says, "The soldiers say
that he killed some five

01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:36.620
or six Rebel sharpshooters.

01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:38.380
I do not like to think of anyone

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:42.360
so young taking the
lives of so many men.

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:47.170
But this young gardener
of mine is no common boy

01:18:47.170 --> 01:18:51.460
and has shown marked
character from infancy."

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:58.020
So, there are other quotes that
document most of the story.

01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:02.290
And the book that I'm writing now
has about 200 stories in total

01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:05.910
that talk about deaf people's
involvements in the civil war,

01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:10.750
begets involvement with
pen or with the sword.

01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:17.940
I'm not sure if any of you have
read the fictional story called

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:19.480
"Chickamauga".

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:24.670
But this story is a
story about a young boy.

01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:31.200
And in the story, he
plays with a wood sword.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.620
He goes out into the woods.

01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:37.290
And during the battle
of Chickamauga,

01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:41.180
the deaf boy didn't hear the fact
that there was shooting going

01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:43.370
on around him, continued to play.

01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:48.280
But he started to see some wounded
and crippled soldiers down on hands

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.530
and knees from their battle wounds.

01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:55.600
This young boy actually climbs
up and rides on one of the horses

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:58.270
that had been-- with
one of the soldiers.

01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:02.210
And so at first you think,
goodness, this is so funny.

01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:04.460
This kid is so naïve to believe

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:08.150
that the area is safe
despite what he sees.

01:20:08.150 --> 01:20:10.780
He actually ends up falling
asleep in the middle of the battle

01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:15.040
and wakes up to see a
light off in a distance.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:19.820
He follows it and finds that his
farmhouse has been burned down

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:22.200
and he finds that his
mother is dead now.

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.970
At the end of the story, it turns

01:20:24.970 --> 01:20:31.550
out that the child was a deaf
mute child as the story goes.

01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:35.940
A bit of a surprise ending for me,
I read that and thought to myself,

01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:40.900
it seems like this is one of a
very few stories that we can find

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:43.970
of deaf children's experience
in the world-- in the war.

01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:48.810
And I think that it was interesting
that they would portray this child

01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:54.000
as naïve because we can
see throughout the stories

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.580
that I've found that deaf children
have very much been involved

01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:58.580
in the war and all aspects of it.

01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:06.940 position:56%
In one school for the deaf, the deaf
children made 1.5 million bullets

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:09.480
for the southern army.

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:11.950
Now, if you would--
if you're a teacher,

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.910
anyone here on the audience,

01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:16.950
I'm not sure that you
would allow deaf children

01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:18.290
to play with gunpowder.

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:22.390
But this school for the
deaf supported their--

01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:27.710 position:56%
the southern army and they also
made confederate money as well there

01:21:27.710 --> 01:21:30.630
because they had a print
shop in the school.

01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:36.260
So, they were able to print
money for the southern states.

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:41.130
They also made flags to support
their army depending on what--

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:45.160
you know, where-- what states
these deaf schools were in.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:48.150
Some of the girls would be
assigned to sew up uniforms.

01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:50.580
The boys would be assigned
to make boots.

01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:54.160
And the kids in school wrote
about war time events as well.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:59.170
I just met somebody
from Kentucky here.

01:21:59.170 --> 01:22:05.200
I found that after the battle
of Berryville in Kentucky,

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.610
there were hundreds and hundreds

01:22:06.610 --> 01:22:09.090
of dead bodies just
strewn about the field.

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:12.390
All the soldiers had to leave

01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:14.670
so that they could go
fight other battles.

01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:19.000
So, they went to the
Kentucky School for the Deaf

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.540
and they asked the children
there to help bury the dead.

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:26.830
They said there were about 300
dead bodies after that battle.

01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:28.970
So, those children were
certainly not naïve at all,

01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:31.580 position:56%
they were very aware from their help

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:36.160
in that situation of
death and dying.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:40.270
You know, also keep in mind that
there were a lot of deaf children

01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:44.920
who saw the deaths of their
fathers, brothers, friends,

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:48.090
neighbors throughout the war.

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:57.510
Let's talk a little bit more about
the National Literary Society

01:22:57.510 --> 01:23:00.500
for the Deaf and the context
of what I'm talking about here.

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:03.630
As we mentioned before,
it was founded in 1907.

01:23:03.630 --> 01:23:07.530
And I thought that it was
an interesting coincidence

01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:09.230
that 40 years before that,

01:23:09.230 --> 01:23:12.950
many schools for the deaf had their
own literary societies embedded

01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:14.670
within the schools.

01:23:14.670 --> 01:23:18.480
So, one example of this is the
Kentucky School for the Deaf

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:21.240
in which I found the
minutes from their meetings

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:25.110
in a manuscript that's shown here.

01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:27.900
It's called "The Minute Book
of the Deaf Mute Society

01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:30.400
of the Kentucky Institution
for the Deaf and Dumb."

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.490
So, I read through it.

01:23:32.490 --> 01:23:38.640 position:56%
And these kids were heavily involved
on a weekly basis in debates,

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:43.200
debates on topics that were
really pertinent to the civil war.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:47.630
One question was, was
President Lincoln right

01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:51.940
in declaring war on
the seceding states?

01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:58.460
Another debate was on the
bombardment of Fort Henry.

01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:02.950 position:56%
And there were multiple other topics
that were found here in this book.

01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:08.180
And it certainly was not isolated
to the Kentucky School for the Deaf

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:11.700
or to debate groups but
also to newspapers as well.

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:15.410
The American School for the Deaf,
I'm sure you're all familiar

01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:19.610
with this, they-- celebrating
200 years coming

01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:22.510
up here pretty soon in 2018.

01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:27.960 position:56%
Some people are hoping that the post
[inaudible] is going to commemorate

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:30.860
that anniversary with
a special stamp

01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:34.040
to honor the American
School for the Deaf.

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:38.150
At any rate, ASD is a
very fascinating place.

01:24:38.150 --> 01:24:42.280
Before the war, there
were many abolitionists,

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:47.670
people who opposed slavery
who were teachers at that ASD,

01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:55.200
including Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet,
Lewis Weld after him and so on.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.880
Edmund Booth was a
teacher there as well.

01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:01.480
So, the list of well-known
deaf names is quite long.

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:07.620
The school had kids from the south
actually there before the war.

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:14.260
And because there were
famous abolitionists in the--

01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:18.560
you know, on the teaching
staff or had been invited,

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:26.930
Lewis Weld being one of them, was
surprised to find that deaf kinds

01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:33.640
in Hartford, Connecticut where
ASD is located really proved all

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:39.470
of his beliefs on slavery, all of
his writings on slavery, you know,

01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:42.210
where obviously controversial
to southern children

01:25:42.210 --> 01:25:44.820
who had come from plantations.

01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:49.290
And so, the deaf northern
children had published articles

01:25:49.290 --> 01:25:52.570
that were supporting these
abolitionists' views and some

01:25:52.570 --> 01:25:56.740
of those actually included the
children from the southern states.

01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:59.960
Here's a newspaper for
the deaf community.

01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:02.620
And it talks about
"Boys in the Battle

01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:07.020
of Shiloh" and "The Dying Soldier".

01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:11.150
So again, schools for the deaf were
encouraging deaf schools to read

01:26:11.150 --> 01:26:13.820
about the war and to
write about it as well.

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:16.040
This is coming from the North
Carolina School at Raleigh.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:23.920
Some teachers during the war who
were not involved during the war,

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.390
continue to advocate
the deaf children

01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:27.970
to read about what was going on.

01:26:27.970 --> 01:26:29.680
And I really love this quote.

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:34.900
It says, "Let every parent who has
a deaf child encourage his child

01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:36.420
to read and write.

01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:45.590
Be up and act, ye who give birth
to children of eternal silence.

01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:48.380
Be not weary in this good work."

01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:53.620
I thought it was a really beautiful
quote that shows, you know,

01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:59.430
the 1860 mentality of a teacher
from Philadelphia who believed

01:26:59.430 --> 01:27:02.440
that it was of utmost importance
that parents be involved

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:06.150
in the lives of deaf
children and their education.

01:27:06.150 --> 01:27:10.960
Here's a deaf artist
that I mentioned before.

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:17.200
Imagine during the middle of
the Civil War with the country--

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:22.980
the future of country at
stake and certainly uncertain

01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:28.980
and generally sitting
back posing for a portrait

01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:33.390
by this deaf artist right
in the middle of the war.

01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:35.650
Now, he was not the
only one to do this,

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:38.620
Stonewall Jackson did similarly.

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:42.100
He sat for a portrait by
a deaf artist as well.

01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:47.140
This is the famous John Mosby.

01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:53.040
Mosby was a terrorist
of sorts at the time.

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:59.200
He killed many civilians and
actually sat for a portrait

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:02.170
by this the same deaf artist.

01:28:02.170 --> 01:28:13.050
On the right-hand side here,
I'm showing a lithograph

01:28:13.050 --> 01:28:17.030
of the 10th Massachusetts Regiment.

01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:20.600
And you see the man who's
sitting on the far right

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:23.720
on the right bottom
corner who's painting.

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.680
It's been enlarged in the inset.

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:33.850
That is the deaf artist who's
also a soldier in this instance.

01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:37.680
So again, you see that
enlargement there in the corner.

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:40.690
And Gallaudet University has
a copy of this lithograph

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:43.280
as this Library of Congress.

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:54.630
There are a myriad of stories of
deaf soldiers who are wounded.

01:28:54.630 --> 01:28:58.890
Unfortunately, we don't
have many pictures

01:28:58.890 --> 01:29:01.090
of these soldiers who are wounded.

01:29:01.090 --> 01:29:04.370
But I do have a picture of
the battle that was pertinent

01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:07.720
to the discussion here which
a man from the Virginia School

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.010
for the Deaf joined the army.

01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:12.670
And this, I recently
found in the library

01:29:12.670 --> 01:29:15.370
in Virginia among stacks
of old papers.

01:29:15.370 --> 01:29:21.320
Going through them, I
found the enlistment record

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:27.260
of this man among other soldiers
obviously within the companies.

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:31.070
And so, this deaf man by the name

01:29:31.070 --> 01:29:33.470
of Berkeley [assumed
spelling] is mentioned there.

01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:36.230
They actually list
him as deaf and mute.

01:29:36.230 --> 01:29:40.890
So, you know, these are the ways in
which I'm trying to find evidence

01:29:40.890 --> 01:29:44.990 position:56%
of deaf people's involvements in the
civil war to include in the book,

01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:49.340
so finding things all
over the place.

01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:58.440
So to try to summarize the
research that I was able to do,

01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:02.680
there were deaf doctors, deaf
nurses, photographers, farmers,

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:08.600
carpenters, shipbuilders, sword
makers and I'd like to say,

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:13.910
you know, 10 or 15 deaf people who
were really involved in spycraft.

01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:17.810 position:56%
So, really, some fascinating stories
that, you know, unfortunately,

01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:22.230
can't give you [inaudible]
but the book has, like I said,

01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:25.760
over 200 stories of
these fascinating men

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.740
and women who are involved.

01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:31.360
Schools for the deaf were large--

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:35.990 position:56%
they were sometimes destroyed during
battles, for example in Missouri

01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:39.740 position:56%
and Mississippi, the battles really,

01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:44.990
really destroyed these schools
bringing them down to the ground.

01:30:44.990 --> 01:30:48.160
During the siege of
Jackson, that was one time

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:52.630
when a school was burnt down.

01:30:52.630 --> 01:30:58.270
Many of the people were killed,
just simply walking by, you know,

01:30:58.270 --> 01:31:01.690
and enemy soldiers would come by
and see them and try to stop them

01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:03.960
but because they didn't
hear them and kept walking,

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:06.410
they would shoot them dead.

01:31:06.410 --> 01:31:12.860
Deaf slaves also, were part of
this, deaf slave owners as well.

01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:14.380
Deaf slave catchers.

01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:20.030 position:56%
So, you know, when a slave would
escape, the slave catchers would try

01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:23.020
to find these people and bring
them back to their owners

01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:26.290
and there were some deaf people
among their ranks as well.

01:31:26.290 --> 01:31:34.400
So, as I mentioned, just recently,
I'm nearing the end of my story,

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:38.210
but I'd like you to sit back
and imagine the abolitionist

01:31:38.210 --> 01:31:42.490
that I mentioned before,
Mr. Garrison.

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:53.820
Now, he was involved in the
American School for the Deaf

01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:57.730
and there were some children there
who supported the institution

01:31:57.730 --> 01:31:59.530 position:56%
of slavery and some were against it.

01:31:59.530 --> 01:32:04.010
Imagine John Wilkes Booth,
who killed Abraham Lincoln,

01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:10.270
but just before that had a deaf
woman friend and invited her

01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:13.950
to teach him how to
write love sonnets

01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:17.760
for his fiancé, how to sign them.

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:25.460
So, an interesting story about John
Wilkes Booth who's brother wrote a

01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:29.230
letter to this woman saying
that he's been struggling

01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:31.720
to learn the alphabet
and other signs.

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:38.480
And then, John Wilkes
Booth's sister, Asia Booth,

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:41.410
also started learning
sign language as well.

01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:45.570
Now, I doubt very much if the
deaf woman poet who was associated

01:32:45.570 --> 01:32:50.830
with Mr. Booth knew of his plans to
kill the president because no one

01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:56.130
in his family actually
know about that.

01:32:56.130 --> 01:33:01.660
Imagine also a deaf soldier who was
wounded on the battlefield and had

01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:05.020
to amputate his own
leg before he died.

01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:11.470
Imagine a French prince who came
to the United States to meet

01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:15.560
with President Lincoln and
Lincoln assigned that prince

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:18.410
and his two nephews,
who are both hearing,

01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:27.920
to work with General
McClellan throughout, you know,

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:32.490
eight or nine months period of
time in the peninsula campaign.

01:33:32.490 --> 01:33:38.810
There were deaf people
of all sorts involved

01:33:38.810 --> 01:33:41.840
in the civil war in different ways.

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:47.070
This deaf prince will actually come
back up this afternoon in my talk

01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:50.180
about research and the type of
research that I was able to do here

01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:52.950
in the Library of Congress
to author my book.

01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:56.180
He was an interesting character.

01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:59.540
He had several servants, four
or five men, who followed him

01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:02.790
around to support him in
the work that he was doing.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:13.980 position:56%
So in all, this-- my 10th book,
really shows the amazing involvement

01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:20.880
of deaf people in many
different ways in the civil war.

01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:26.300
We, deaf people, were involved
in determining the future

01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:28.040
of our country, and I think

01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:33.280
that that becomes an important
message as you read the book.

01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:36.500
Now, you know, the title
says the word shadows,

01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:40.300
and I think I should talk a little
bit about what I mean by that.

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:46.050
When you read about the civil
war, you read about Lee and Grant

01:34:46.050 --> 01:34:50.500
and Sheridan, you read about
a lot of hearing people.

01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:56.120
You may hear about hearing writers
like Walt Whitman and others

01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:58.650
but you don't read
about deaf writers

01:34:58.650 --> 01:35:03.580
who really wrote beautiful poems
and other pieces that contributed

01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:07.980
to the literary history
of America at the time.

01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:11.190
Well, we're talking about people
who grew up deaf but were able

01:35:11.190 --> 01:35:15.260
to express themselves quite
eloquently in written form.

01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:18.500
So, I think that it's appropriate
that we talk about fighting

01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:22.910
in the shadows, because, really,
those people were not recognized

01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:25.390
for their work at the
time, but through the book,

01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:30.100
I'm hoping to bring these
personalities into the light

01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:32.280
and much more into the
mainstream of our history.

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.530
So, thank you very much
again for inviting me here

01:35:34.530 --> 01:35:36.270
for allowing me to speak.

01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:38.530
[ Applause ]

01:35:38.530 --> 01:35:40.830
Nice job.

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:53.500
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, thank
you very much Harry,

01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:58.650
this really has gotten us off to
a wonderful start and I'm happy

01:35:58.650 --> 01:36:01.610
to report-- I was fuzzing
a little bit whether all

01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:03.740
of the books would arrive,
and they have arrived.

01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:08.250
So, we have more books for
sale than I originally thought.

01:36:08.250 --> 01:36:13.090
And you'll have a chance to talk
with the authors, get books signed,

01:36:13.090 --> 01:36:19.420
and we're going to take a break
until we reconvene at 1:15.

01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:22.360
But, let me explain,
the cafeteria is next--

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:26.520
practically is next door if you
keep walking through this door,

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:29.960
this is one end of this
beautiful cafeteria,

01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:35.990 position:56%
which is where I hope you'll enjoy
each other and have something to eat

01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:39.370
in order to come back
for the other program.

01:36:39.370 --> 01:36:41.500
I have to share a little
excitement with you.

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:45.740
The Library of Congress-- The
Librarian of Congress is appointed

01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:51.010
by the President of the United
States and confirmed by the Senate.

01:36:51.010 --> 01:36:57.030
And this means that it doesn't
happen very often, but we are--

01:36:57.030 --> 01:37:01.800 position:56%
now have a nominee to be the Library
of Congress, the new librarian.

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:07.280
Dr. James Billington, who
came after Daniel Boorstin,

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.440
who I talked about
as being our founder,

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:15.570
Dr. Boorstin was the
librarian form 1975 until 1987.

01:37:15.570 --> 01:37:19.030
He was nominated by President Ford.

01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:24.780
Dr. Billington, James Billington,
a Russian historian was nominated--

01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:28.720
when Dr. Boorstin resigned, he
was an author, and still working

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:34.940
on a wonderful set of books called
"The Americans", he resigned.

01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:40.230
President Reagan nominated James
Billington, who became a librarian

01:37:40.230 --> 01:37:45.680
in 1987 and he retired last year.

01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:52.460
And now, President Obama
has nominated Carla Hayden

01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:57.680
who is the director of libraries
at the Hayden-- Pratt library.

01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:03.180
And she will be the first
female and the first Black,

01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:06.100
African-American Librarian
of Congress.

01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:09.750
And we've been fuzzing, worrying
about hearings that are coming up,

01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:15.290
because if you know the news, the
US Senate isn't exactly excited

01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:19.860
about holding nominations for
the Supreme Court nominee,

01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:21.930
but nothing has been said.

01:38:21.930 --> 01:38:23.650
And we've had our fingers crossed

01:38:23.650 --> 01:38:27.230
that there will be
hearings for Carla Hayden.

01:38:27.230 --> 01:38:30.770
And I had to leave for a moment
because she's just stopped

01:38:30.770 --> 01:38:36.180 position:56%
by the center for the book, which is
on this floor, to say hello to me.

01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:39.400
And I got back in time
to close this.

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:42.920
But what I asked for her, I
said, "Are there hearings?"

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:45.030
And she said, "Yes, people
aren't talking about it,

01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:47.280 position:56%
but they're holding them next week."

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:50.980
And so, that's very good news
for the Library of Congress.

01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:56.660
And, I think, very good news for
outreach and for-- she's a former--

01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:01.770 position:56%
she's a public librarian and
director of the Enoch Pratt Library.

01:39:01.770 --> 01:39:05.150
So, and I ask her if
she wanted to come down

01:39:05.150 --> 01:39:07.470
and say something-- say hello.

01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:11.210
And she said, no, she's
here on the QT, slightly.

01:39:11.210 --> 01:39:14.620
But it's obviously dropping
by and seeing people.

01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:20.530
So, that is a wonderful way to,
I think, chat, to break things

01:39:20.530 --> 01:39:24.570
and is good news for us, I think,
at the Library of Congress.

01:39:24.570 --> 01:39:29.030
And she did know about
the literary society.

01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:30.690
She actually checked
with the schedule

01:39:30.690 --> 01:39:32.770
and saw that I was here today.

01:39:32.770 --> 01:39:36.420
And she said, she's very happy with
the endorsements that she's getting

01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:40.550
from all parts of the library
and literacy community.

01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:43.530
And so, I feel that we
will have a friend--

01:39:43.530 --> 01:39:46.420
not that we haven't had a friend,
but we will have a special friend

01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:49.700
in the office of the
Librarian of Congress.

01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:54.200
Now, I didn't mention also, the
cafeteria is right through there,

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.060
restrooms are right out here.

01:39:56.060 --> 01:40:03.170
If you want to make a trip to the
Jefferson Building, I'm afraid,

01:40:03.170 --> 01:40:07.430
we have-- those things are
preoccupied with other groups.

01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:12.450
But we have a self guide
that you could take.

01:40:12.450 --> 01:40:17.330 position:56%
And if you would like to go, I would
be happy to get people there and--

01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:19.640
but you would need to
come back on your own.

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:24.930
So, perhaps, if we wanted to do
that, someone who's already been

01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:29.170
to the Jefferson Building
could actually serve as a guide

01:40:29.170 --> 01:40:31.900
with a small group of
people who wanted to go.

01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:35.860
And I would get you there
and the person who went

01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:38.160
with us could get you back.

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.170
But-- And we would give
you a copy of the guide

01:40:42.170 --> 01:40:45.550 position:56%
to the Jefferson Building which
shows you some things you could see.

01:40:45.550 --> 01:40:49.500
It's a little tight, I have to
tell you, to go through the tunnel

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:53.900
and to come back in time
for-- to be back at 1:15.

01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:57.840
And it would not really leave
you time for a leisurely lunch,

01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:00.170
probably, you would
have to skip lunch.

01:41:00.170 --> 01:41:01.670
I'm sorry about that.

01:41:01.670 --> 01:41:05.500
But if someone wants to do
that, I'll be happy to get--

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.170
at least get you over there.

01:41:07.170 --> 01:41:09.960
But I think, we should close
with really, a round of applause

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:12.810
for the speakers this morning
and they've all been wonderful

01:41:12.810 --> 01:41:16.100
and we've gotten ourselves
off to a great start.

01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:17.430
Thank you very much.

01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:19.810
See you back here at 1:15.

01:41:19.810 --> 01:41:22.110
Thank you.

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:28.260
This afternoon's program is
going to be a little less formal,

01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:33.990
not that we were formal this
morning, but this is conceived more

01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:38.150
as a workshop with several
different presentations

01:41:38.150 --> 01:41:44.290
on several different topics that
relate to our overall concern

01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:47.460
about the deaf culture
in our society,

01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:50.510
and particularly in libraries.

01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:56.910
And we're going to begin
with a presentation--

01:41:56.910 --> 01:42:00.370
sorry, I'm getting my
program turned around,

01:42:00.370 --> 01:42:04.450
Chaim is here from
the Copyright Office.

01:42:04.450 --> 01:42:11.430
And he is going to talk a little
bit about copyright and fair use.

01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:15.240
Chaim Levinson has been
in the Copyright Office,

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.990
which is part of the
Library of Congress for--

01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:20.400
he tells me, for five years.

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.910
And his presentation is going

01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:26.730
to be geared towards our
interest in copyright.

01:42:26.730 --> 01:42:30.420
But he also will tell you a
little bit about what fair use is

01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:33.860
and why it's important
in our context.

01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:35.740
So, Chaim, please take over.

01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:38.040
Thank you.

01:42:44.350 --> 01:42:49.220
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: My
name is Chaim Levinson.

01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:54.180
I work in the Copyright Office on
the fourth floor of this building.

01:42:54.180 --> 01:43:07.150
I work in the department of
records-- recording-- recordation.

01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:14.460
It's a big responsibility
that I have.

01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:17.370
But I want to start with
a question for you all.

01:43:21.670 --> 01:43:27.420
Do you all know the difference
between a patent and copyright?

01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:36.460
It seems like that's a stumpy
audience, but I'll be here

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:38.970
to share the information with you.

01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:49.580
So, a patent protects
things and inventions,

01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:53.970
things that are physical in nature.

01:43:58.210 --> 01:44:06.790 position:56%
So, a patent can protect anything
that has that physical nature to it.

01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:13.740
Copyright, on the other hand,
is a little bit different.

01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:16.770
The concept is roughly the same--

01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:23.800
-- but it talks about things
that are not physical.

01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:34.350
So, for instance, a song has
no physical nature to it.

01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:41.690 position:56%
Music, can be notated on paper,
certainly, something that we can see

01:44:41.690 --> 01:44:45.720
and has physical notation to it.

01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:53.880
A copyright protects what it is
that you see on the printed page.

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:58.150
So, the ideas that
are written down on

01:44:58.150 --> 01:45:06.910
to the paper is what copyright
can protect Here at the Library

01:45:06.910 --> 01:45:18.160
of Congress, our responsibility is
to protect your ideas as you sit

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:24.150
down and create new works of art by
writing words on a piece of paper,

01:45:26.370 --> 01:45:32.380
that work can become
protected under copyright.

01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:42.920
So, you may be curious how it is
that you can protect your work

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:47.520
and yourself when you
create these works of art.

01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:52.890
There are several processes that
we have, one being registration,

01:45:52.890 --> 01:46:01.300
and in my department, in
the recording department--

01:46:10.590 --> 01:46:12.290
-- is where we do that work.

01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:15.270
I would like to give
you some examples here--

01:46:20.410 --> 01:46:22.990
-- of useful works.

01:46:22.990 --> 01:46:30.000
A useful work is anything that
you create, it can be a machine,

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.950
anything with a use--
with a moving part.

01:46:34.110 --> 01:46:42.560
So, for example, computers, mobile
phones, household appliances

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.840
and other types of machinery.

01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:52.340
These all fall under the
category of useful works.

01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:54.630
These are things that you
can use for your self,

01:46:54.630 --> 01:46:56.570
for your own personal benefit.

01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:59.530
Things that are made
or manufactured.

01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:08.350
On the other hand, created--

01:47:08.350 --> 01:47:14.290
creative or intellectual
works incorporate things

01:47:14.290 --> 01:47:19.180
such as books, music and art.

01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:23.080
Jewelry also falls
into this category

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.380
and many other things as well.

01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:36.360
So copyright is used to
protect these types of works.

01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:44.240
At the most simple or basic level--

01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:53.970
-- what do you think
copyright may mean to you?

01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:59.290
Imagine that you're at home

01:47:59.290 --> 01:48:02.850
and you're writing a
letter to your mother.

01:48:02.850 --> 01:48:07.330
The moment that you lift
the pen from the page,

01:48:07.330 --> 01:48:11.210
that letter becomes protected under
a copyright, it belongs to you.

01:48:11.210 --> 01:48:14.670
It means that it's your property.

01:48:14.670 --> 01:48:18.310
It can't belong to anyone
else, it can't belong to me

01:48:18.310 --> 01:48:23.110
and I have no rights to copy
that, nor does anyone else.

01:48:23.110 --> 01:48:26.170
That letter is your property.

01:48:26.170 --> 01:48:29.090
Now, through the registration
process here at the Library

01:48:29.090 --> 01:48:35.670
of Congress, that letter can
be registered as your property

01:48:35.670 --> 01:48:38.890
because it belongs to you.

01:48:38.890 --> 01:48:42.020
And if anyone wanted
to use that letter,

01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:45.790
they would be required
to get your permission.

01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:52.680
So, that then becomes
your right to copyright.

01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:58.430
So, in my department,
my responsibility is

01:48:58.430 --> 01:49:03.300
to provide citizens
certificates indicating

01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:08.280
that that property
actually belongs to you.

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:11.430
And if that anyone wants
to steal your work,

01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:17.070
you would be legally protected
to sue that person for damages.

01:49:17.070 --> 01:49:28.320
So that puts that right
in black and white.

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:31.400
So, there was a question
here in the audience.

01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:40.370
That's written down
in black and white.

01:49:40.370 --> 01:49:41.950
On a piece of paper, showing

01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:47.180
that this is your property,
that's correct.

01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:52.680
So, if you make jewelry, if you
take a picture of it and show it

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:58.620
in the registration office here,
that will go into the certificate

01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:02.940
and into the copyright, rights
that are afforded to you.

01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:08.880
Now, this topic is very broad.

01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:11.980
I can only provide you with a
very surface level interpretation

01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:14.280
of what it means--

01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:20.860
-- because most of this
process involves a lot

01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:25.500
of legal obligation,
and I am no lawyer.

01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:30.970
So, my ability to explain the
process in depth is limited.

01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:47.340
Imagine, if you will, that you're
an actor and you write a play.

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:55.660
That work belongs to you and
you therefore own the copyright.

01:51:09.550 --> 01:51:15.140
The works can be creative,
expressive, that can be poetry,

01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:22.120
song, art work, anything
that you see

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:29.040
in picture format can be
protected under copyright.

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:32.380
And I hope that's clear for you.

01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:36.770
Hopefully so.

01:51:36.770 --> 01:51:39.070
Great.

01:51:44.650 --> 01:51:48.100
Now, when you want to
register for a copyright--

01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:56.460
-- your copyright will actually
have a very long lifespan.

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:05.690
In fact, that copyright
can last over 70 years.

01:52:05.690 --> 01:52:10.940
And anyone who wants to use that
work will require your permission

01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:16.510
without exception, otherwise,
that would be considered stealing.

01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:28.630
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:52:28.630 --> 01:52:32.900
Question from the audience, when
is the copyright no longer valid?

01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:39.110
That's a very good question.

01:52:39.110 --> 01:52:46.730
I can't say for sure,
because I know, first of all,

01:52:46.730 --> 01:52:48.980
that it is over 70 years.

01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:53.860
But you can add periods of 25

01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:55.940
or 50 years depending
on the circumstances.

01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:59.710
So, it can go on for
a very long time.

01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:09.660 position:56%
So, in the same way that patents can
be extended, copyright can as well.

01:53:18.710 --> 01:53:22.480 position:56%
Question from the audience, can that
be passed down to a family member

01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:25.570
since it's the person's property?

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:37.570
My understanding is that, through
a legal process, you can do that.

01:53:37.570 --> 01:53:41.790
But no one else has the right to
use your work unless that is--

01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:45.430
that happens because
your name is on it.

01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:53.230
So, is it a lifetime copyright?

01:53:55.090 --> 01:53:58.090
That's the answer.

01:53:58.090 --> 01:54:00.550
Another question from the audience.

01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:07.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; When you have a copyright,
essentially, that copyright can last

01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:11.370
for over 70 years or
lifelong, really.

01:54:11.370 --> 01:54:17.380
There is a book, for example,
if it is under a copyright,

01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:22.460
then that book, in theory,
can be yours forever?

01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:23.940
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: Yes.

01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:34.360
It will last, unless you
decide, through a legal process,

01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:40.500
that your wishes are otherwise
and you make that very clear

01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:42.270
that you would allow another use.

01:54:42.270 --> 01:54:49.280 position:56%
But yes, it would continue but
there's a time in which it would end

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:53.150
and become what is called,
in the public domain.

01:54:53.150 --> 01:55:00.860
And what that means is that at that
point, anyone is free to use it.

01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:06.640
So, yes, your copyright can
be renewed but you have to go

01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:11.710
through the correct legal
processes to do that.

01:55:11.710 --> 01:55:15.750
&gt;&gt; So, is there any time
limit to a copyright?

01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:21.820
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: Not as
long as you're living, no.

01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:28.510
That property belongs
to you and you alone.

01:55:28.510 --> 01:55:35.460
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:41.270
&gt;&gt; And if the copyright legal owner
passes away then they can pass

01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:43.570
that right on to someone else?

01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:49.650
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: Again,
through legal methods, yes.

01:55:55.810 --> 01:55:59.060
&gt;&gt; What about material
that's put online?

01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:01.600
Do the same rights apply?

01:56:04.650 --> 01:56:08.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: Now, that
question is actually beyond my role.

01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:11.670
As I said, I'm able to talk
about the copyright process

01:56:11.670 --> 01:56:14.160
on a rather surface level.

01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:16.930
But any questions that go beyond

01:56:16.930 --> 01:56:21.760
that knowledge would probably best
be answered by a copyright lawyer.

01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:28.380
And copyright law is a
complex thing to understand.

01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:32.950 position:56%
And someone better versed in it
would be able to explain that to you

01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:35.690
or someone in the office
in which I work.

01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:44.510
&gt;&gt; I have an additional question.

01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:49.300
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:52.500
I just have a person in mind.

01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:58.170
Let's say an individual
named John wrote a song.

01:56:58.170 --> 01:57:03.120
And this person named John
has a copyright on that song

01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:06.940
and let's say, for instance
someone who wasn't aware

01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:10.010
that that song existed
had used that song

01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:12.760
that was originally made by John.

01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:17.930
If John took legal action
for theft of his property,

01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:24.020
would it be in the best
interest of that other person

01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:26.690
to avoid getting sued to
research and make sure

01:57:26.690 --> 01:57:29.900
that they have a right
to use that song?

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:33.490
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: Well,
that is a very good question.

01:57:36.290 --> 01:57:38.300
Well, so during the
certification process,

01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:42.430
you would have a certificate
that's given to you.

01:57:42.430 --> 01:57:47.350 position:56%
And in the registration, it would
claim that that is indeed your work.

01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:50.420
What then happens is
that is transferred

01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:57.900
over to my department
and we record that fact.

01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:02.740
That's all uploaded to our database
system for tracking purposes.

01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:09.240
So, if another person comes
up with the same idea,

01:58:11.810 --> 01:58:17.680 position:56%
copyright law will protect you
saying that this work belongs to you

01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:27.590
but it does not decide who it
belongs to but there is a process

01:58:27.590 --> 01:58:31.480
that would be made clear to
you what actually belongs

01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:33.780
to you in that situation.

01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:41.800
So, you don't really have to
be afraid of the ramifications,

01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:43.990
you can be confident
that any creative work

01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:47.700
that you make has been
recorded correctly

01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:54.560
and that we will protect
you through that.

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:56.520
Any other questions
from the audience?

01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:59.970
Yeah? I love questions.

01:59:02.180 --> 01:59:05.750
&gt;&gt; So, I'm going to pick
on you here a little bit.

01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:07.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: Yeah, no worries.

01:59:07.410 --> 01:59:09.880
&gt;&gt; So, for a copyright--

01:59:14.910 --> 01:59:17.360
-- is that required to be on set?

01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:20.020
&gt;&gt; Is that what he said?

01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:21.570
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: A concept
is what you're asking?

01:59:21.570 --> 01:59:23.520
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, concrete,
I meant to say.

01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:29.110
Does that apply to something that's
concrete such as a piece of paper?

01:59:29.110 --> 01:59:33.910
An example that I have in mind, for
example, if I made a song about,

01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:37.100
you know, my love for birds,
for me, that's my right.

01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:39.620
However, if there's
no documentation,

01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:42.080
does my copyright still exist?

01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:43.450
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: Right.

01:59:43.450 --> 01:59:45.620 position:56%
So you actually have to record that.

01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:49.960
You have to put it down on some
medium and when you're done,

01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:53.490
when you're finished with
the work at that moment is

01:59:53.490 --> 01:59:58.140
when it becomes protected
under copyright.

01:59:58.140 --> 02:00:01.940
&gt;&gt; OK. So, you're saying, in order
for you to have that copyright,

02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:06.890
whatever that song is, has to
be noted on concrete paper?

02:00:09.450 --> 02:00:10.750
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: Yeah.

02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:12.650
It has to be in physical form.

02:00:12.650 --> 02:00:18.590
But it can, you know,
be a voice recording

02:00:18.590 --> 02:00:22.000
or anything else like that.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.430
It can be a video of
the performance.

02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:32.890
But it has to be original work and
it has to show that it's yours.

02:00:32.890 --> 02:00:36.240
It can't be anybody else's.

02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:43.250
Once you establish that, from that
point on, you don't have to worry

02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:45.050
about it being used by anyone else.

02:00:45.050 --> 02:00:47.550
&gt;&gt; Thank you for lessening
my worries.

02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:56.830
And if you were to write
something on paper,

02:00:56.830 --> 02:00:59.210
would it have to be in pen?

02:00:59.210 --> 02:01:02.020
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: Oh, no.

02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:05.600
No, you could write it with
a feather if you wanted.

02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:09.610
I do it all the time.

02:01:09.610 --> 02:01:14.350
I write in calligraphy quite a lot.

02:01:14.350 --> 02:01:19.400
So, anything that you do,
for example, if it's art,

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:22.830
something that you've
created yourself,

02:01:22.830 --> 02:01:26.850
anything that you establish
in a physical form

02:01:26.850 --> 02:01:31.250
that belongs to you
can be protected.

02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:36.370
The next step is to register it.

02:01:36.370 --> 02:01:41.750
So, our job is to record it,
to input that in our system

02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:44.820
and to provide you with
the certificate, again,

02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:49.800
that shows that that work is yours.

02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:53.900
So, if there's any competitor
to you, we can come back

02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:57.040
to the original submission
and you can show proof

02:01:57.040 --> 02:01:59.000
that this work is actually yours

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.820
and has been registered
through my office.

02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:06.610
I hope that's clear for everyone.

02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:17.200
&gt;&gt; So, the copyright is
really based on a date, right?

02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:21.020
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson:
Yeah, that's part of it.

02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:23.190 position:56%
So, through the registration office,

02:02:23.190 --> 02:02:28.670
we will examine what has
been submitted and decide

02:02:28.670 --> 02:02:32.520
if that is really able to
receive copyright or not and then,

02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:37.330
we'll let you know what
the decision is from then.

02:02:37.330 --> 02:02:42.170
Because some things are not covered
under the concept of copyright,

02:02:42.170 --> 02:02:46.620
I'll give you an example
of some things.

02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:54.580
A fashion designer could
not copyright cloth.

02:02:59.290 --> 02:03:04.100
If, however, there was
art on the garment,

02:03:04.100 --> 02:03:09.000
then that could be copyrighten
[phonetic], but not cloth.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:15.770
The design on the paper-- of
the garment can be copyrighten

02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:22.040
but the cloth form of it cannot be.

02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:24.730
&gt;&gt; So, let's suppose that
I had ideas on a paper

02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:28.840
that I have copyrighted, and
then, several weeks later,

02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:32.990
someone else has tried to submit
a document with the same ideas

02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:35.760
and they get a copyright,
how would you determine

02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:37.860
who actually owns that copyright?

02:03:37.860 --> 02:03:40.520
Would you go back to
the date of submission?

02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:43.330
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: It always
depends on who's first.

02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:51.820
And sometimes, that happens.

02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:56.900
If several people come up with the
same idea around the same time,

02:03:56.900 --> 02:04:03.230
when you come to the registration
office, a group of lawyers

02:04:03.230 --> 02:04:06.830
who are employed by the office
will decide who would win

02:04:06.830 --> 02:04:09.930 position:56%
out if those have all been submitted
roughly around the same time.

02:04:09.930 --> 02:04:12.690
So, there is a priority for time.

02:04:17.690 --> 02:04:21.270 position:56%
Not everyone who would submit means
that their idea is actually original

02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:25.240
and that's why we employ that
group of lawyers to decide

02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:27.760
who had the original idea.

02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:33.350
So they are employed by our office
to make those types of decisions.

02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:37.150
Some people come up with
ideas that are really vague.

02:04:37.150 --> 02:04:40.080
I mean, they probably
just went on the internet

02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:44.720
and stole those ideas
from other authors.

02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:55.880
&gt;&gt; I'm actually going to sit
and ask my question from here.

02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:57.530
There was a situation
that I was made aware

02:04:57.530 --> 02:05:05.280
of where two people having
a conversation on the phone

02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:07.960
and somewhat submitted
an idea claiming

02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:10.460
that they were the first one
to come up with this idea,

02:05:10.460 --> 02:05:13.010
but really, it was someone else.

02:05:13.010 --> 02:05:14.310
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: OK.

02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:18.200
So, from the perspective of my
office, when I provide someone

02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:27.710
with a certificate, that includes
documentation and also the number

02:05:27.710 --> 02:05:31.780
of the certificate
that appears on it.

02:05:33.070 --> 02:05:37.830
The registration and
documentation offices work together

02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:43.220
to support you 100% of the
way regarding your work,

02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:45.770
to help you determine
what belongs to you.

02:05:45.770 --> 02:05:49.360
At that point, you don't
really have to worry

02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:56.680
about other people competing with
you because you have that proof

02:05:56.680 --> 02:06:01.690
of what it is that we are
saying belongs to you.

02:06:01.690 --> 02:06:05.100
At that point, it doesn't
matter what anyone else may have

02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:08.950
because that is not
valid under the law.

02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:11.090
We are saying that it
is indeed that your idea

02:06:11.090 --> 02:06:13.410
and that you have the rights to it.

02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:28.950
&gt;&gt; I actually have
two questions for you.

02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:32.950
The first question is, are blogs
recognized under copyright?

02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:42.520
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: I
really can't speak to that.

02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:50.670
So, if it's on the internet, to me,

02:06:50.670 --> 02:06:53.640
that means that it's
in the public domain.

02:06:53.640 --> 02:06:57.860
It's been released to
be shared by everyone.

02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:04.450
If, however, your ideas
originated on physical paper,

02:07:04.450 --> 02:07:07.000
that would be a very
different story.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:12.450
And it's then that the
lawyers can help you

02:07:12.450 --> 02:07:15.870
out in making that determination.

02:07:15.870 --> 02:07:22.230
Publishing on the internet is
not generally a good source.

02:07:22.230 --> 02:07:23.530
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:07:23.530 --> 02:07:28.000
And my second question is for
those of us who sign on video,

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:31.410
why is that not recognized
under copyright?

02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:40.050
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: If it's in
video format and we can tell

02:07:40.050 --> 02:07:44.550
that it's your work, like
potentially seeing you in it.

02:07:44.550 --> 02:07:49.780
So, for example, movies are
protected by copyright law.

02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:52.730
&gt;&gt; I'm referring to more of
a blog, like a video blog

02:07:52.730 --> 02:07:57.610
of someone signing their thoughts
on video as oppose to a movie.

02:07:57.610 --> 02:08:05.830
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: In this case,
I'd have to ask you if you wanted

02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:08.790
to talk more with a lawyer
to feel more comfortable

02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:10.530
about that determination.

02:08:10.530 --> 02:08:13.430
So, if you did that, they would
give you a more professional answer

02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:16.660
than I could provide with you here.

02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:19.840
So, that is the reason why we
have the registration office here

02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:22.640
at the Library of Congress
to be able to ask--

02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:26.060
answer those very specific
questions that you may have.

02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:34.680
Copyright law can be very general
and also very legal in nature,

02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:37.330
very complicated sometimes.

02:08:37.330 --> 02:08:40.450
So that's why we provide those
lawyers to help support you

02:08:40.450 --> 02:08:41.800
and answer your questions.

02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:44.100
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:48.100
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: All right.

02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:49.840
&gt;&gt; John Cole: You have
time for one more question

02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:52.490
if there's another question.

02:08:52.490 --> 02:08:55.440
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson:
OK, my friend here.

02:09:00.490 --> 02:09:04.640
&gt;&gt; I actually just saw
Alice's statement earlier

02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:06.530
and she made a good point.

02:09:06.530 --> 02:09:13.860 position:56%
If someone does have a similar idea,
and they attempt to get the idea

02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:22.700
under copyright, and they happen
to go and try to get the copyright

02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:26.390
and the idea I made originally
because I don't have a chance

02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:30.270 position:56%
to make it in there as soon as they
do, do they still get the copyright,

02:09:30.270 --> 02:09:32.950
although, I came up
with the idea first?

02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:36.880
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: So, if yours
gets approved, then it's yours.

02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:39.110
It has nothing to do
with the other person.

02:09:39.110 --> 02:09:41.220
&gt;&gt; So, essentially, you would
have to be the first one

02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:44.380
to arrive physically
to get your copyright.

02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:47.270
&gt;&gt; Chaim Levinson: Mm-hmm.

02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:50.690
And the team would decide with you

02:09:50.690 --> 02:09:57.250
if that work was a true
copyright, so to say.

02:09:57.250 --> 02:09:59.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

02:09:59.070 --> 02:10:00.370
Great job with your information.

02:10:00.370 --> 02:10:01.670
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:10:01.670 --> 02:10:04.050
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Thank you.

02:10:08.690 --> 02:10:14.120
Well, you opened up interesting
questions, series of questions.

02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:18.280
And if we're-- As I said before,
we just had an introduction

02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:23.470
to not only copyright and fair
use but especial implications

02:10:23.470 --> 02:10:26.220
for the world that
we're talking about now.

02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:29.980
And I want to thank Chaim for
a straightforward presentation

02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:33.320
and now you know the Copyright
Office, which is filled

02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:37.130
with brochures and lawyers
and a place that you can call.

02:10:37.130 --> 02:10:41.390
There's a copyright phone line
you can call and get information.

02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:45.070
It's a good source and it's also--

02:10:45.070 --> 02:10:48.020
there are some controversies
sometimes about whether

02:10:48.020 --> 02:10:51.430
or not copyright should be
in the Library of Congress,

02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:55.280
in most countries it's an
executive office agency.

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:58.310
But Chaim actually, sort
of showed you the balance

02:10:58.310 --> 02:11:03.000
of having both the legal
responsibility and concern

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:07.240
about author's rights in the
digital age and counterbalanced

02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:10.660
by these magnificent
collections that we have.

02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:16.160
And we are also trying to make
as freely available as we can.

02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:20.080
So, the Library of Congress
walks a tight line as well.

02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:25.830
And I think that that balances
an attempt to look at both sides.

02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:30.380
And in that way, I'm glad that
we have a chance at the Library

02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:34.790
of Congress to perform that role
in American society and culture.

02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:39.130
As I said, we're going to
have several workshop kinds

02:11:39.130 --> 02:11:42.620
of presentations that are
different from each other.

02:11:42.620 --> 02:11:46.540
But we're going back
to Harry Lang again.

02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:49.410
But as you've already heard
him this morning talking

02:11:49.410 --> 02:11:53.210
about his wonderful books,
today, he's putting--

02:11:53.210 --> 02:11:56.830
this afternoon, he's putting on
his researcher's hat and he's going

02:11:56.830 --> 02:12:01.170 position:56%
to talk a little bit more about
resources at the Library of Congress

02:12:01.170 --> 02:12:05.050
and the use that he has
made resources in his work.

02:12:05.050 --> 02:12:06.990
So, let's welcome him back.

02:12:06.990 --> 02:12:10.510
Harry, there you are.

02:12:10.510 --> 02:12:16.240
[ Applause ]

02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:19.680
&gt;&gt; Harry G. Lang: Well,
hello again everyone.

02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:31.850
I'm wondering, how many of you
have some experience with googling

02:12:31.850 --> 02:12:34.180
on the Library of Congress website?

02:12:34.180 --> 02:12:38.080
Can I get a show of hands?

02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:43.380
Has anyone here who has a great
deal of experience show of hands?

02:12:43.380 --> 02:12:49.570
Well, I have to disclose,
I am not an expert.

02:12:49.570 --> 02:12:52.790
I'm an example of a person

02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:55.140
who frequently uses the
Library of Congress.

02:12:55.140 --> 02:13:00.140
The Library of Congress
contain not only books

02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:05.340
but also other articles published
by college professors along

02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:09.380
with presentations similar
to what you're seeing today

02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:13.320
that often give you a lot
of in depth information.

02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:16.970
If you could please
move forward two slides.

02:13:20.190 --> 02:13:25.920
The Library of Congress I mostly
use for science, education,

02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:30.540 position:56%
and deaf history, however, I have to
say that I found many other things

02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:34.170
such as photographs, letters,
et cetera that are related

02:13:34.170 --> 02:13:37.170
to deaf history, which I
didn't happen to use today,

02:13:37.170 --> 02:13:42.390 position:56%
but I like to give you some examples
and four strategies that were used.

02:13:45.610 --> 02:13:49.970
Now, I was asked to
share my perspective.

02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:57.360
And my perspective is really from
a college professor who is involved

02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:59.770 position:56%
in training teachers for many years.

02:13:59.770 --> 02:14:05.540
Often, I don't write for children,

02:14:05.540 --> 02:14:07.710
I find myself writing
for the adult crowd.

02:14:07.710 --> 02:14:12.810
And particularly, adults
who have experience working

02:14:12.810 --> 02:14:17.370
with children can glean information
from what I publish in order

02:14:17.370 --> 02:14:20.040
to provide that information
to their students.

02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:24.550 position:56%
So, my point in saying that is that,
I might not fit all age groups.

02:14:24.550 --> 02:14:30.500
Very rarely, I write material for
children, but again, high school,

02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:34.740
college aged students are
typically my target audience.

02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:43.060
Even though I am retired, I still
have a burning desire in my heart

02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:46.720
to inspire young deaf children.

02:14:51.050 --> 02:14:56.580
There are many biographies
written related to deaf children,

02:14:56.580 --> 02:14:59.840
speaking from their first-person
perspective about their experience

02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:04.040
as a child and what inspirations
they had and ultimately,

02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:07.230
how their desire for them to reach
for the star has allowed them

02:15:07.230 --> 02:15:11.210
to continue their work in writing,
in searching for other ways

02:15:11.210 --> 02:15:14.170
to continue inspiring
younger people.

02:15:14.170 --> 02:15:18.400 position:56%
So, there are many wonderful stories
that are out there, many on the web,

02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:22.430
and some you might not
have even imagined.

02:15:22.430 --> 02:15:25.640
Very surprising what
you may find online.

02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:30.670
Now, I would like to
discuss four strategies.

02:15:30.670 --> 02:15:34.470
The first of the four
include browsing.

02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:37.370
For example, searching
for the word deaf.

02:15:37.370 --> 02:15:41.370
And this concept is actually
more complicated than it seems.

02:15:41.370 --> 02:15:47.160
The second strategy, if you already
know the name of a person or topic,

02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:49.340
you can possibly find more
information just based

02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:52.190
on that alone.

02:15:52.190 --> 02:15:55.590
Third strategy is to find
evidence and verify whether

02:15:55.590 --> 02:15:59.800
or not the information that I
found is true, looking for proof.

02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:04.120
And lastly, if there's
something that I've discovered,

02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:10.600
I try to make a connection between
that information and other points

02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:13.970
that might not be apparent
to me at first glance.

02:16:20.260 --> 02:16:23.680
Here is an infamous
quote from Aristotle.

02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:29.680
This quote emphasizes the
importance of patience.

02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:34.020
I say this because the Library of
Congress is not the easiest place

02:16:34.020 --> 02:16:35.660
to search and find information.

02:16:35.660 --> 02:16:42.220
There are many search engines that
are within the Library of Congress.

02:16:42.220 --> 02:16:45.670
And often, documents
have to be found

02:16:45.670 --> 02:16:48.480
by utilizing the proper
search method.

02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:52.690
And sometimes, that means,
using your own two eyes

02:16:52.690 --> 02:16:54.990
to find what you're looking for.

02:17:04.510 --> 02:17:08.020
I also like to add, if you're
searching for the term deaf,

02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:09.770
you may find multiple hits.

02:17:09.770 --> 02:17:13.220
If you search for deaf
mute, the deaf--

02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:16.450
the hits that you may
find are different.

02:17:16.450 --> 02:17:19.790
Such as deaf and dumb,
another example of something

02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:21.580
that may produce different results.

02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:23.670
And if you have deaf mute together,

02:17:23.670 --> 02:17:26.120
that in it self will
produce different results.

02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:30.410
So again, depending on what
combination you use to search,

02:17:30.410 --> 02:17:33.520
you can find various results.

02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:42.600
Last week in particular, I
searched for the term deaf

02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:52.230
and I found 3277 hits online,
however, that's only half.

02:17:52.230 --> 02:18:01.160 position:56%
Here, if you note 7832 hits, so
what that tells you is that you have

02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:05.190
to go to the Library of Congress
to find those other hits,

02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:08.670
because those results might
be very valuable for the work

02:18:08.670 --> 02:18:12.750
that you're trying to complete.

02:18:12.750 --> 02:18:15.930
Hopefully, online, the Library

02:18:15.930 --> 02:18:18.970
of Congress will have all
those hits available for you.

02:18:22.260 --> 02:18:30.370
So, her question or more so
comment was that along with deaf,

02:18:30.370 --> 02:18:35.710
a term you can search
is hearing impaired.

02:18:35.710 --> 02:18:38.500
As for me, I didn't use
that term in my search

02:18:38.500 --> 02:18:42.640
but there are many other terms
as well such as hard of hearing.

02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:47.420
Some people might refer
to an individual as hard

02:18:47.420 --> 02:18:50.450
of hearing although they
might identify as deaf.

02:18:50.450 --> 02:18:54.900
So again, my point here is that
it takes a lot of experimentation

02:18:54.900 --> 02:19:00.760 position:56%
but I have to say that the fruits of
your labor are worth it in the end.

02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:10.510
So, going back to my
personal experience,

02:19:10.510 --> 02:19:12.260
I searched for the term deaf.

02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:16.970 position:56%
And outside the Library of Congress,
for example, by using google--

02:19:20.260 --> 02:19:23.560
-- I use a negative quote.

02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:26.910
So, deaf Smith will
actually remove all the hits

02:19:26.910 --> 02:19:31.940
that tie into that person.

02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:43.400 position:56%
Sometimes, I can type deaf soldiers,
minus deaf smith or minus deaf to

02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:53.480 position:56%
or minus deaf ears and even deaf ear
without the s. So, there are a lot

02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:59.270
of variations that you can
use when you're searching.

02:19:59.270 --> 02:20:01.820
However, not every search
engine at the Library

02:20:01.820 --> 02:20:04.780
of Congress is capable to do that.

02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:12.510
A question?

02:20:12.510 --> 02:20:24.270
[ Inaudible Remark ]

02:20:24.270 --> 02:20:27.330
&gt;&gt; Instead of a minus
like you do in Google.

02:20:32.110 --> 02:20:33.410
&gt;&gt; Harry G. Lang: That's correct.

02:20:33.410 --> 02:20:36.530
You can use the not option.

02:20:36.530 --> 02:20:38.930
Now, there are many search engines.

02:20:38.930 --> 02:20:41.240
And is another example.

02:20:41.240 --> 02:20:43.560
Not, like you just
mentioned, is another example.

02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:51.400
However, again, I can only
share a few examples here.

02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:53.710
Right now, the message that
I'm trying to drive home

02:20:53.710 --> 02:20:56.800
to the audience is you really
need to exercise patience

02:20:56.800 --> 02:21:00.100
in your research, especially
when you're using the Library

02:21:00.100 --> 02:21:02.400
of Congress search engines.

02:21:03.550 --> 02:21:12.910
One example I have in mind, if
you go to Alexander Graham Bell

02:21:12.910 --> 02:21:17.220
and you search all letters,

02:21:17.220 --> 02:21:19.970
I see some of your facial
expressions here not fans

02:21:19.970 --> 02:21:25.110
of Alexander Graham Bell, but
nonetheless quite interesting.

02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:32.090
When you read the letters
that are pertaining to Bell,

02:21:32.090 --> 02:21:39.590
you see a famous deaf
poet, Laura Redden.

02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:43.180
And she actually wrote to Bell.

02:21:43.180 --> 02:21:47.960
Laura, Laure Redden was a
highly respected figure noted

02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:49.520
for all her hard work.

02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:57.360
However, most people know
of her after her divorce

02:21:57.360 --> 02:22:01.660
from her hearing lawyer, she became
quite financially challenged,

02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:07.560
asking for help from friends, and
her story is quite a sad story.

02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:10.540
She suffered for many years
of her life financially.

02:22:10.540 --> 02:22:13.500
She had a daughter that she
was looking to help raise.

02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:18.440
So, in the Bell papers, with the
search results, you can see some

02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:22.360
of the correspondence that
took place between Laura

02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:25.930
and Alexander Graham Bell.

02:22:25.930 --> 02:22:28.860
So, even though Bell has
his own personal attitudes

02:22:28.860 --> 02:22:32.210
about sign language, this
individual was still willing

02:22:32.210 --> 02:22:36.800
to lend a helping hand and
support Laura by sending her money.

02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:41.550
So, sometimes you have to take
things with a grain of salt.

02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:50.220
Another interesting comment
I'd like to make, right now,

02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:56.290
I'm not sure if you're aware, but
there's a controversy taking place

02:22:56.290 --> 02:22:59.860
between Alexander Graham Bell
and his negative comments

02:22:59.860 --> 02:23:05.080
about Nyle DiMarco, the dancer.

02:23:05.080 --> 02:23:10.260
I do know that Nyle is a
dancer, however, Bell has been--

02:23:10.260 --> 02:23:14.060
The Bell Foundation has been very
critical of him, in his support

02:23:14.060 --> 02:23:20.350
of early ASL and education
of deaf mute.

02:23:20.350 --> 02:23:22.410
So, Bell wrote in the letter

02:23:22.410 --> 02:23:26.220
that he actually used
signs with deaf children.

02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:27.990
That's something that
we already knew.

02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:34.640
And even further, he talks
about the numbers in Arabic

02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:37.480
when he was teaching
them to deaf children.

02:23:37.480 --> 02:23:41.440
You can find many examples
similar to that

02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:46.200
in which he used the sign
language to educate them.

02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:52.340
Would you find him on Gallaudet
signing with students on campus?

02:23:52.340 --> 02:23:58.290
That's something you can see in
the photographs that are archived.

02:23:58.290 --> 02:24:06.420
But again, those Bell letters,
you can't just Google them.

02:24:06.420 --> 02:24:10.820
However, you can download
and read them.

02:24:10.820 --> 02:24:15.740
Some other letters, for example,
the Abraham Lincoln papers,

02:24:15.740 --> 02:24:20.040
you can actually download
the handwritten letters.

02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:27.320
If you click on the transcript
option, that's an option

02:24:27.320 --> 02:24:33.880
that can be googled easier for any
critical word such as civil war.

02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:36.050
So, that's something that
you can find in a letter

02:24:36.050 --> 02:24:38.780
that might be important to you.

02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:49.650 position:56%
In the Abraham Lincoln papers, I
decided to search for the term deaf.

02:24:49.650 --> 02:24:53.870
I found a letter of a
father who actually wrote

02:24:53.870 --> 02:24:59.530
to Abraham Lincoln requesting his
permission to allow him to travel

02:24:59.530 --> 02:25:02.860
through the army lines
in order for him

02:25:02.860 --> 02:25:05.600 position:56%
to live closer to his deaf daughter.

02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:09.870 position:56%
And that was in Raleigh, North
Carolina, school for the deaf there.

02:25:09.870 --> 02:25:13.770
Abraham Lincoln actually
denied his request.

02:25:13.770 --> 02:25:20.250
And my point in that is that
the letter doesn't explain the

02:25:20.250 --> 02:25:21.550
whole story.

02:25:21.550 --> 02:25:23.840
So, once you find that
piece of information,

02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:25.890 position:56%
you can then do additional research.

02:25:25.890 --> 02:25:27.680
You can look for that farther.

02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:34.420
All right, in the-- in the
documents on Library of Congress

02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:37.070
and in my research I found out
that the father was actually known

02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:40.920
to be a spy, so that's the reason
that he was denied the request

02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:46.620
to travel through the army lines.

02:25:46.620 --> 02:25:51.190
Another example of something you
can download is a PDF document.

02:25:51.190 --> 02:26:00.230
Often, PDFs are something that
you can search within the engine.

02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:03.440
Although the manuscript might
have been originally handwritten,

02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:07.860
you can still search
for that file as a PDF.

02:26:07.860 --> 02:26:20.330
I previously mentioned using
transcripts in a prior example.

02:26:20.330 --> 02:26:23.270
Referring back to Laura Redden,

02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:27.380
she was a very instrumental
woman throughout the civil war.

02:26:27.380 --> 02:26:30.260
The curiosity I had was what
relationship did she have

02:26:30.260 --> 02:26:31.750
with Abraham Lincoln.

02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:35.150
It turned out that she was
actually very good friends

02:26:35.150 --> 02:26:38.020
with Abraham Lincoln.

02:26:38.020 --> 02:26:45.080
She was also a great acquaintance
with Mary Dodd-- Mary Todd Lincoln,

02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:51.190
along with the sons
of Abraham Lincoln.

02:26:51.190 --> 02:26:55.480
Laura actually had a copy of
a poem that a young boy wrote.

02:26:55.480 --> 02:27:00.820
She gave it to Mary
Todd, and the next day,

02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:05.900
the White House actually sent a
huge bouquet of powers to that--

02:27:05.900 --> 02:27:09.580
of flowers to that poet
for such an exquisite poem.

02:27:09.580 --> 02:27:15.070
So again, these all began with
that brief excerpt that I found

02:27:15.070 --> 02:27:20.050
on my original search and
sometimes that requires searching

02:27:20.050 --> 02:27:24.360
through the national archives,
Library of Congress, on the web.

02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:30.820
If you go to genealogy.com
for example,

02:27:30.820 --> 02:27:33.090
you can find evidence
of family papers there.

02:27:33.090 --> 02:27:37.600
So there are a number of
ways that you can follow up.

02:27:44.050 --> 02:27:51.680 position:56%
Here is an example of one photograph
out of thousands that showed Edison.

02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:56.140
And in this image I found
at the Library of Congress,

02:27:56.140 --> 02:27:59.460
I noticed one peculiar
thing about this photograph.

02:28:03.050 --> 02:28:06.260
I was wondering to myself,
why did the gentleman

02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:13.950
on the left have his finger on the
knee on the gentleman to the right?

02:28:13.950 --> 02:28:16.250
Edison was very deaf.

02:28:16.250 --> 02:28:20.220
I would assume that he
was almost fully deaf.

02:28:20.220 --> 02:28:24.930
He probably had about
70 decibel hearing loss.

02:28:24.930 --> 02:28:30.280
It was actually a museum
in my place in Florida

02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:34.060
that I've seen a number of times.

02:28:34.060 --> 02:28:37.560
He was not skilled when
it came to reading lips.

02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:41.570
His hearing was also not great.

02:28:41.570 --> 02:28:45.550
Also, sign language was not
something that he was fluent in.

02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:49.240 position:56%
So, how he actually communicated was
through something called Morse code.

02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:57.110
He was a very strange man and
he gave a nickname to his nephew

02:28:57.110 --> 02:29:00.180
and the nickname was Dash.

02:29:00.180 --> 02:29:04.170
And his niece he nicknamed Dot.

02:29:04.170 --> 02:29:14.290
So-- He also had other scientists
come visit and have discussions

02:29:14.290 --> 02:29:19.030
on his inventions and often
the communication was done

02:29:19.030 --> 02:29:20.780
by touching on the knee.

02:29:20.780 --> 02:29:23.680
Thomas Edison's girlfriend
before they were married went

02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:30.730
to the theaters with him and by
using the index and middle finger,

02:29:30.730 --> 02:29:37.020
had a system of communication
that was quite fascinating.

02:29:37.020 --> 02:29:38.830
One night, he actually
tapped on his--

02:29:38.830 --> 02:29:40.660
This is a true story by the way.

02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:43.930
He would tap repeatedly
on his girlfriend's knee

02:29:43.930 --> 02:29:47.980
and that was how he proposed to her
and asked if she would marry him,

02:29:47.980 --> 02:29:52.820 position:56%
by this Morse code that they had
utilized, and of course he said yes.

02:29:56.340 --> 02:29:59.340
Her question was, did everyone
have to learn Morse code.

02:29:59.340 --> 02:30:03.640
My response is only a few people.

02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:07.180
Henry Ford would actually
scream in one ear that was--

02:30:07.180 --> 02:30:11.880 position:56%
that he could hear out of better but
that wasn't a great help for Edison.

02:30:11.880 --> 02:30:17.420
Most often, people would
use a paper and pencil

02:30:17.420 --> 02:30:21.150
to communicate instead
of Morse code.

02:30:21.150 --> 02:30:23.450
Another example pertaining
to the Library

02:30:23.450 --> 02:30:29.140
of Congress includes
handwritten expert--

02:30:29.140 --> 02:30:33.730
excerpt by a gentleman who was
alive during the civil war.

02:30:33.730 --> 02:30:38.290
In his story, he referred
to a gentleman by the name

02:30:38.290 --> 02:30:42.600
of Freshour I think his last
name was, a deaf individual

02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:47.910
who was walking along, and
Union soldiers shouted an order

02:30:47.910 --> 02:30:49.240
at him to stop walking.

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:52.130
And because he was deaf, he
didn't hear it and they ended

02:30:52.130 --> 02:30:54.590
up shooting him in the
back and killing him.

02:30:54.590 --> 02:30:56.300 position:56%
Other people found out what happened

02:30:56.300 --> 02:31:00.490
and then became infuriated
with what happened.

02:31:00.490 --> 02:31:02.920
The woman ended up having
to bury this gentleman.

02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:07.020
And there are many other
individuals who had points of view

02:31:07.020 --> 02:31:09.240
that added on to that story.

02:31:09.240 --> 02:31:11.970
So, this excerpt was
quite fascinating.

02:31:19.460 --> 02:31:23.290
A heed of warning, sometimes
you have to be careful

02:31:23.290 --> 02:31:28.740
because errors may exist.

02:31:28.740 --> 02:31:32.250
There are millions and millions
of documents that are coming

02:31:32.250 --> 02:31:33.580
in to the Library of Congress.

02:31:33.580 --> 02:31:37.230
It's their responsibility to verify
the information that's accurate

02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:39.960
and you need to double check that.

02:31:39.960 --> 02:31:45.330 position:56%
I found one nice image here and then
it said it was St. Rica's School

02:31:45.330 --> 02:31:48.560
for the Deaf but that
wasn't the correct spelling.

02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:51.490
It was actually St.
Rita's School for the Deaf.

02:31:51.490 --> 02:31:54.300
So with that said, you have to
double check on the accuracy

02:31:54.300 --> 02:31:58.440
and verify information
that you find.

02:31:58.440 --> 02:32:03.400
A nice feature that the Library
of Congress has on the website is

02:32:03.400 --> 02:32:06.430
that it allows you to submit
corrections to the Library

02:32:06.430 --> 02:32:09.790
of Congress, that way they
can make the proper addition--

02:32:09.790 --> 02:32:13.970
proper edits and make sure that
the information there is accurate.

02:32:17.480 --> 02:32:22.060
Another example of a situation that
requires a little bit of follow-up,

02:32:22.060 --> 02:32:25.380
this image has a woman
of-- image of a woman

02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:28.820
at the National Association
for the Deaf.

02:32:28.820 --> 02:32:31.130
Now, on the Library
of Congress website,

02:32:31.130 --> 02:32:36.000
you might not find
the answers to that.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.530
You may use this image there.

02:32:38.530 --> 02:32:41.110
I hope Mike Olson still
likes me here.

02:32:41.110 --> 02:32:43.990
But he's extremely helpful and
I would recommend that you reach

02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:46.930
out to him when it comes
to things like this.

02:32:56.040 --> 02:33:00.140
I'm not sure if Gallaudet
has his letters.

02:33:00.140 --> 02:33:03.980 position:56%
Sometimes I have to navigate between
Gallaudet and Library of Congress.

02:33:03.980 --> 02:33:06.240
But one thing that I
found interesting is

02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:12.090 position:56%
that Thomas Gallaudet actually wrote
letters to a gentleman in Ohio.

02:33:12.090 --> 02:33:18.110
And in those letters, he explained
how it was challenging to set

02:33:18.110 --> 02:33:19.410
up a school for the deaf.

02:33:19.410 --> 02:33:22.910 position:56%
There were a lot of complications
that were involved in those efforts,

02:33:22.910 --> 02:33:27.410
and it was fascinating to read
those letters and he really wanted

02:33:27.410 --> 02:33:31.970
to help this gentleman in Ohio but
his warning was that it's not work

02:33:31.970 --> 02:33:34.650
that should be taken lightly.

02:33:34.650 --> 02:33:39.140
Setting up a program, curriculum,
those are some of the challenges

02:33:39.140 --> 02:33:43.170
that are incorporated with that.

02:33:43.170 --> 02:33:46.160
Again, some of that
information I found at Gallaudet,

02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:48.230
some of it I found at
the Library of Congress.

02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:53.470
Now ultimately, I had to utilize
both sources to get images

02:33:53.470 --> 02:33:59.650
of American School for the Deaf
and it was a great way to see

02:33:59.650 --> 02:34:03.560
that the evidence of how it
started at that school and then

02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:05.540
from American School for the Deaf,

02:34:05.540 --> 02:34:12.770
it spread the other
institutions that were built.

02:34:12.770 --> 02:34:15.980
So, for the 200th anniversary
of ASD,

02:34:15.980 --> 02:34:19.690
I believe some people might
search for images or any evidence

02:34:19.690 --> 02:34:22.200
that pertains back to
its original founding.

02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:25.960
A question?

02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:33.300
&gt;&gt; Hi. I had one more idea
of one source and the Library

02:34:33.300 --> 02:34:37.340
of Congress is helping
personally a lot.

02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:43.650
If you get stuck, they have the
most wonderful research library use

02:34:43.650 --> 02:34:46.390
in the Library of Congress.

02:34:46.390 --> 02:34:51.450
They really are a very important
[inaudible] who know so much

02:34:51.450 --> 02:34:56.800
to [inaudible] and who have a lot
of energy and a lot of interest

02:34:56.800 --> 02:34:59.090
in a different work with them.

02:34:59.090 --> 02:35:01.390
So, contact them to--

02:35:03.270 --> 02:35:06.610
&gt;&gt; Harry G. Lang: Yes, I certainly
agree with you 100% on that.

02:35:06.610 --> 02:35:12.830
No. I did use the librarian's
help personally in trying

02:35:12.830 --> 02:35:17.140
to better understand why it was
that I couldn't use negatives

02:35:17.140 --> 02:35:19.690
when I was searching in the engine.

02:35:19.690 --> 02:35:22.470
For example, you know,
negative Smith in my searches.

02:35:22.470 --> 02:35:25.010
But the librarians are
very nice, very friendly.

02:35:25.010 --> 02:35:31.780
They responded to my question about
that with several ways to search

02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:35.500
on the website differently
than how I have done.

02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:40.230 position:56%
So, that's a great point and you can
certainly follow up and email them

02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:45.130
and they're more than
happy to respond to you.

02:35:45.130 --> 02:35:46.430
&gt;&gt; Minus sign.

02:35:46.430 --> 02:35:47.730
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:35:47.730 --> 02:35:51.440
&gt;&gt; Harry G. Lang: Another example,
if you know the name of the person

02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:56.740
in mind, for example the
French Prince de Joinville.

02:35:56.740 --> 02:36:02.040
He was the gentleman I mentioned
this morning who came to America

02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:06.000
and met with Abraham Lincoln.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.910
He asked Abraham Lincoln
for permission

02:36:08.910 --> 02:36:13.040
to join the Union Army
as role of an adviser.

02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:20.950
And he also came to America with
his two French hearing nephews.

02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:30.670
Because he was an expert in his
observations, Lincoln assigned him

02:36:30.670 --> 02:36:37.100
to the Peninsula campaign
under General McClellan.

02:36:37.100 --> 02:36:43.620 position:56%
You can find a lot of great pictures
of this deaf prince from France

02:36:43.620 --> 02:36:46.140
on the Library of Congress website.

02:36:46.140 --> 02:36:50.970
I have one picture here and
he is actually the gentleman

02:36:50.970 --> 02:36:56.350
with the large cap, and
the second from the right.

02:36:56.350 --> 02:37:03.220
When it came to communication, that
was something he struggled with

02:37:03.220 --> 02:37:05.360
but he was not alone in that.

02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:11.820
I found roughly 10 to
12 various generals

02:37:11.820 --> 02:37:15.380
who were significantly
deaf, not profoundly deaf.

02:37:15.380 --> 02:37:22.270
I actually call them
pre-enlistment deaf,

02:37:22.270 --> 02:37:26.360
which means that they already
had hearing loss before the war.

02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:31.910
President Lincoln and the
southern president, Jeff Davis,

02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:36.370
needed leaders badly, and
they needed them so badly

02:37:36.370 --> 02:37:39.170
that they are able to look
past the fact that some

02:37:39.170 --> 02:37:40.790
of these leaders had hearing loss.

02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:47.310
Now, some of these leaders did
become more deaf in the war,

02:37:47.310 --> 02:37:51.340
and some of those leaders
also died in the war

02:37:51.340 --> 02:37:55.790
because they were not able to hear
some of the gunshots and warnings

02:37:55.790 --> 02:38:01.770
of their fellow soldiers before
getting killed in the line of war.

02:38:01.770 --> 02:38:07.720
This morning, I'll also mention
that the prince had servants.

02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:11.450
And pictured here, you
can see those servants.

02:38:11.450 --> 02:38:15.170
And I found this at the Library
of Congress and it's interesting,

02:38:15.170 --> 02:38:17.770
you can see the servants
who supported prince

02:38:17.770 --> 02:38:21.340
and the prince was a great
adviser to Abraham Lincoln.

02:38:21.340 --> 02:38:24.340
And again, at the Library
of Congress website,

02:38:24.340 --> 02:38:26.590
you can find the letters
that are actually written

02:38:26.590 --> 02:38:34.190
from the deaf prince de Joinville
to Abraham Lincoln warning him

02:38:34.190 --> 02:38:37.760
of things that he needed to
know regarding some decisions

02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:39.840
that Abraham Lincoln were made.

02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:44.460
And Abraham Lincoln
was one to take heed

02:38:44.460 --> 02:38:46.880
from this deaf prince's
other advisers.

02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:55.520
An example-- an example
is the Trent Affair.

02:38:55.520 --> 02:39:02.430
So when the Union Army
captured sailboats,

02:39:02.430 --> 02:39:09.170
they were carrying two
southern officers to England.

02:39:09.170 --> 02:39:15.210
So, they captured them and
imprisoned them but the waters

02:39:15.210 --> 02:39:18.480
that the boat was on was
considered international waters.

02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:21.760
So, the prince gave
a warning about that

02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:24.690
that you are violating
international rule.

02:39:24.690 --> 02:39:26.150
So, because of that warning,

02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:29.660
Abraham Lincoln dismissed
these two gentlemen.

02:39:33.250 --> 02:39:39.480
There are many drawings that
were found, many arts of work.

02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:42.410
One example here is
of the deaf prince.

02:39:42.410 --> 02:39:49.050
When the ships that were sunk
in the battle of the Ironclads,

02:39:49.050 --> 02:39:54.220
which is a very well known battle,
there was actually a hearing artist

02:39:54.220 --> 02:39:58.150
who was drawing him
at the same time.

02:39:58.150 --> 02:40:04.510
So, the artist, Waud, was a hearing
artist who is drawing a portrait

02:40:04.510 --> 02:40:07.680
of the deaf prince as the deaf
prince was drawing a portrait

02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:09.980
of the boat that had sunk.

02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:17.710
I mentioned previously that some

02:40:17.710 --> 02:40:21.400
of the generals had some
pretty serious hearing loss.

02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:23.250
Maxcy Pregg--

02:40:23.250 --> 02:40:24.550
&gt;&gt; Gregg.

02:40:24.550 --> 02:40:27.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Harry G. Lang: -- or Maxcy
Gregg, a southern general was killed

02:40:27.710 --> 02:40:31.200
in the Fredericksburg battle.

02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:33.890
And the reason for that was

02:40:33.890 --> 02:40:39.170
because he didn't hear his own
soldier's warning that the enemy,

02:40:39.170 --> 02:40:41.970
the Union enemy was approaching.

02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:50.260
And the other officers
said that the reason

02:40:50.260 --> 02:40:53.280
for his death was because
he was deaf.

02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:56.870
I didn't realize that
right before the war,

02:40:56.870 --> 02:41:01.770
Maxcy Gregg was actually
very involved

02:41:01.770 --> 02:41:13.790
with the South Carolina secession,
specifically from the Union.

02:41:13.790 --> 02:41:17.390
So, some stories that you're
writing have deeper connections

02:41:17.390 --> 02:41:19.970
than you might realize
at first glance.

02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:29.660
Many of you might be aware that
Abraham Lincoln was actually

02:41:29.660 --> 02:41:31.300
in the middle of the war.

02:41:31.300 --> 02:41:35.260
Not only was he in
the middle of the war

02:41:35.260 --> 02:41:37.880
but he read a full book of poems.

02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:40.850
He was very encapsulated by poems.

02:41:40.850 --> 02:41:46.270
And these were the days of war
where there was no security

02:41:46.270 --> 02:41:49.490
around the White House, and
someone can simply just walk

02:41:49.490 --> 02:41:55.300
in to the White House and hand
the president poems for him

02:41:55.300 --> 02:41:59.790
to read, and that happened.

02:41:59.790 --> 02:42:03.360
Did he really read
some of those poems?

02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:07.000
Well, there's a quote that he
said the poems are very pretty,

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.230
particularly the ones that
are related to the war,

02:42:09.230 --> 02:42:11.520
so I was looking for
evidence of that.

02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:15.840
In the Library of Congress there's
a letter from Laura writing--

02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:18.760
thanking Abraham Lincoln
for his support in her book

02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:21.620
and you can actually see
the original writing here

02:42:21.620 --> 02:42:22.920
in that letter.

02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:28.380
She says thank you
for endorsing my book.

02:42:29.970 --> 02:42:33.160
Here's another example.

02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:39.800
So I might be wondering, you
know, did Edward Miner Gallaudet,

02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:42.090
I believe this is the correct sign.

02:42:42.090 --> 02:42:46.920
Some might be wondering, did Edward
Miner Gallaudet really write a

02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:48.590
letter of invitation
to the president?

02:42:48.590 --> 02:42:54.250
Well, here on the screen
you can see that's true.

02:42:54.250 --> 02:42:57.480
And also I believe the
Gallaudet archives has a copy

02:42:57.480 --> 02:43:00.810
of this invitation extended
to the president on behalf

02:43:00.810 --> 02:43:03.850
of Edward Miner Gallaudet.

02:43:03.850 --> 02:43:06.430
So, by using the Library
of Congress search engine,

02:43:06.430 --> 02:43:10.210
I was able to verify this.

02:43:10.210 --> 02:43:13.880
Now, the fourth strategy that
I used was making connections

02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:18.640
for the deaf prince
that I was referring to.

02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:22.680
He actually wrote a letter
to a Massachusetts politician

02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:29.690 position:56%
and in this letter, the deaf prince
expressed that he was very impressed

02:43:29.690 --> 02:43:35.380
with a young man that
he had met who happened

02:43:35.380 --> 02:43:38.520
to be the famous General Custer.

02:43:38.520 --> 02:43:42.320
Now, I wasn't even aware that
myself that they knew each other.

02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:47.480
And one has to wonder
how they communicated.

02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:53.600 position:56%
I'm sure that the prince did know a
lot of sign language but Custer did.

02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:57.420
And the reason for that was because
he visited a school for the deaf

02:43:57.420 --> 02:44:02.040
in Texas and there he went
to encounter deaf children.

02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:08.240
Also, Custer's wife wrote a
book talking about his journey

02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:12.930
to the school for the deaf where
he encountered those deaf children.

02:44:12.930 --> 02:44:18.650
And also communication with Native
Americans was done by signing.

02:44:18.650 --> 02:44:23.770
Here's another example
of making connection.

02:44:23.770 --> 02:44:25.220
Are you aware that the Library

02:44:25.220 --> 02:44:31.800
of Congress has more
than five million maps?

02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:33.240
Five million.

02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:43.110 position:56%
So with that said, I was looking for
the term deaf in any of the maps,

02:44:43.110 --> 02:44:48.870 position:56%
and an option you have are selecting
based on letters, photographs, maps,

02:44:48.870 --> 02:44:51.920
drawings, and from
that-- from those options,

02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:53.600
you can select what you want.

02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:57.450
So, in my mind I thought I'd search
for deaf as it related to maps

02:44:57.450 --> 02:45:01.010
and this is something I found.

02:45:01.010 --> 02:45:06.130
In the left top corner here, I
just happen to spot something.

02:45:06.130 --> 02:45:11.890
There's a picture of the North
Carolina School for the Deaf,

02:45:11.890 --> 02:45:15.770
and I wondered why would
that be on the map, right,

02:45:15.770 --> 02:45:17.650
in the top left corner there.

02:45:17.650 --> 02:45:23.170
And it just so happened
that a person by the name

02:45:23.170 --> 02:45:27.990
of Cooke was the principal and
he moved there from Virginia

02:45:27.990 --> 02:45:32.020
and he became the president
at that school in Raleigh

02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:36.180
and be brought equipment to
print at that school with him

02:45:36.180 --> 02:45:38.960
and ultimately went on
to set up a print shop

02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:43.410
for young boys to learn
how to print.

02:45:43.410 --> 02:45:48.580
So, from the name Cooke, I was
able to make that connection.

02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:52.440
I saw the deaf school on
the map and I realized

02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:56.930
that Cooke ultimately
helped the deaf children

02:45:56.930 --> 02:46:01.140
to become very proficient
in publication and printing.

02:46:01.140 --> 02:46:06.040
So when the war began,

02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:10.290
all the confederate money
was actually printed there,

02:46:10.290 --> 02:46:15.530
and bullets were also something
that the children made there.

02:46:15.530 --> 02:46:20.290
But more importantly, there were
training manuals for soldiers.

02:46:20.290 --> 02:46:23.280
So what that told me was that
this particular deaf school

02:46:23.280 --> 02:46:28.240
on North Carolina was very
supportive of the Confederate Army.

02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:31.510
Here is an enlarged image
of the school for the deaf

02:46:31.510 --> 02:46:33.490
that was in the top left corner.

02:46:33.490 --> 02:46:40.500
I'm curious, how many of
you here are from Maryland.

02:46:40.500 --> 02:46:42.800
Show of hands.

02:46:45.220 --> 02:46:49.750
Are you familiar with the
song "Maryland, My Maryland"?

02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:51.720
&gt;&gt; It's still the state song.

02:46:51.720 --> 02:46:53.570
&gt;&gt; Harry G. Lang: Is it
still the state song?

02:46:53.570 --> 02:46:57.830
I heard that it was very
controversial, and there were talks

02:46:57.830 --> 02:47:02.500
that they might drop this song.

02:47:02.500 --> 02:47:05.860
"Maryland, My Maryland"
actually has the word deaf

02:47:05.860 --> 02:47:09.280 position:56%
but it's not related to deaf people.

02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:17.050
So, referring to Maryland,
all right,

02:47:17.050 --> 02:47:24.970 position:56%
she is not deaf, nor dead, nor dumb.

02:47:24.970 --> 02:47:30.200 position:56%
Huzza! she spurns the northern scum.

02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:36.880
So I think this song is
actually still used today.

02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:40.130
And first, I'd like to
mention, well, for some of you,

02:47:40.130 --> 02:47:41.930
this might be insignificant,

02:47:41.930 --> 02:47:46.580
the fact that they mentioned
deaf and dumb is very broad.

02:47:46.580 --> 02:47:50.460
And it's not referring
to what they called--

02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:53.930 position:56%
what they called people at the time.

02:47:53.930 --> 02:47:58.350
But if you know enough, you
can actually make a connection.

02:47:58.350 --> 02:48:02.090
Because based on the same
Library of Congress website,

02:48:02.090 --> 02:48:04.550
you can actually find another song.

02:48:04.550 --> 02:48:12.540
In Belle Missouri, their
fighting song, their fighting song

02:48:12.540 --> 02:48:23.860
for the Missouri soldiers were
actually written by Laura Redden.

02:48:23.860 --> 02:48:28.670
So she was the deaf woman who was
actually invited to write that song

02:48:28.670 --> 02:48:35.400
in response to "Maryland,
My Maryland".

02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:37.590
So here we have a deaf
woman who was invited

02:48:37.590 --> 02:48:41.030
to make a response
to the Maryland song.

02:48:41.030 --> 02:48:43.150
Both of those songs
are part of the history

02:48:43.150 --> 02:48:45.690
and my point here is it's
interesting how you can make

02:48:45.690 --> 02:48:49.320
connections between those findings.

02:48:49.320 --> 02:48:56.410 position:56%
Now before you read this, I believe
I have two slides left before I wrap

02:48:56.410 --> 02:48:57.710
up here.

02:48:57.710 --> 02:49:02.060
If you recalled in the
beginning of my presentation,

02:49:02.060 --> 02:49:06.030
I said that I was an
educator for 41 years.

02:49:06.030 --> 02:49:09.050
And I also said that in
my heart, I have a desire

02:49:09.050 --> 02:49:11.710
to inspire deaf children.

02:49:11.710 --> 02:49:15.730
There was an occasion where
I was giving a presentation,

02:49:15.730 --> 02:49:19.070
and afterwards the Library
of Congress is where I went

02:49:19.070 --> 02:49:22.340
to find information about
deaf scientists as well

02:49:22.340 --> 02:49:27.490
as engineers among other
things that I found on the web.

02:49:27.490 --> 02:49:32.970
My presentation was given to deaf
children in schools for the deaf

02:49:32.970 --> 02:49:35.140
and I recall parents along

02:49:35.140 --> 02:49:37.950
with other professionals
who were present.

02:49:37.950 --> 02:49:41.840
There was one mother who
actually wrote this letter to me

02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:48.340
and from this letter, I was
actually moved to tears.

02:49:48.340 --> 02:49:53.000
Clarification, in the letter it was
stated that the mother was moved

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:57.850 position:56%
to tears as she listened to Dr.
Lang's tell of the gifts given to us

02:49:57.850 --> 02:50:01.960
by our deaf predecessors
with admiration and respect.

02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:12.940
From my presentation, this
woman felt far more confident

02:50:12.940 --> 02:50:16.640
that her son could excel
and succeed in science,

02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:23.660
and that to me was worth
writing the whole damn book.

02:50:23.660 --> 02:50:29.290
Another story related to science,
about women and men science,

02:50:29.290 --> 02:50:34.190
I can think of actually happened
with a young woman in Pittsburg.

02:50:34.190 --> 02:50:39.370
This young woman applied
for a master's degree.

02:50:39.370 --> 02:50:42.530
Well, she applied to get
into a master's program.

02:50:42.530 --> 02:50:47.200
She already had her bachelor's
in biology and she wanted

02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:49.090
to get a master's in neuroscience.

02:50:49.090 --> 02:50:55.100
And I actually have permission
from her to share the story.

02:50:55.100 --> 02:51:00.740
The University of Pittsburg
at the time said that science

02:51:00.740 --> 02:51:04.830
for a deaf woman wouldn't be a
good fit, and they turned her

02:51:04.830 --> 02:51:08.720
down in her application
to join the program.

02:51:08.720 --> 02:51:15.000
Now, she went to see a counselor
and this counselor actually knew me

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:19.660
because it was counselor at Western
Pennsylvania School for the Deaf

02:51:19.660 --> 02:51:22.070
in Pittsburg where I graduated.

02:51:22.070 --> 02:51:27.930
And the first book I actually
wrote and he gave her this copy,

02:51:27.930 --> 02:51:31.310
and this copy of what
I wrote referred

02:51:31.310 --> 02:51:34.400 position:56%
to a woman, a deaf woman in science.

02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:37.730
So that led-- that led this deaf
woman to go back to the University

02:51:37.730 --> 02:51:41.580
of Pittsburg with this book,
and after they read it,

02:51:41.580 --> 02:51:43.990
they had changed their mind.

02:51:43.990 --> 02:51:47.720
Afterwards, they accepted her.

02:51:47.720 --> 02:51:51.630
After accepting her into the
program, she completed her master's

02:51:51.630 --> 02:51:56.690
in neuroscience, went
on to pursue her PhD.

02:51:56.690 --> 02:52:00.640
And one nice thing about this young
deaf woman was that she asked me

02:52:00.640 --> 02:52:03.560
to be a part of her dissertation.

02:52:03.560 --> 02:52:06.930
So, from my book, I
found that the people

02:52:06.930 --> 02:52:09.970
who I influenced ranged
from young and old.

02:52:09.970 --> 02:52:15.660 position:56%
And at the Library of Congress you
can find those kinds of information.

02:52:25.750 --> 02:52:29.000
&gt;&gt; I was actually wondering
where can I have access

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.880
to that book you mentioned
in your previous slide,

02:52:31.880 --> 02:52:36.920
or that quote in your previous
slide, where can I find that?

02:52:36.920 --> 02:52:40.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Harry G. Lang: I can't recall the
gentleman's name, but this gentleman

02:52:40.700 --> 02:52:43.420
who helped me out with
the slides and he told me

02:52:43.420 --> 02:52:47.080
that all my slides will be
accessible on the Library

02:52:47.080 --> 02:52:54.040
of Congress website, so you
can pull it out from there.

02:52:54.040 --> 02:52:56.720
&gt;&gt; I would like a copy of this.

02:52:56.720 --> 02:52:58.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Can you go back to the previous--

02:52:58.590 --> 02:53:00.890
&gt;&gt; Could you-- Could--

02:53:05.040 --> 02:53:07.870
&gt;&gt; Harry G. Lang: When you
actually pull it up on the website,

02:53:07.870 --> 02:53:09.340
you can download that letter.

02:53:09.340 --> 02:53:11.760
Or if you like, you can
email me afterwards.

02:53:11.760 --> 02:53:14.510
I have the copyright.

02:53:14.510 --> 02:53:18.230

02:53:18.230 --> 02:53:23.680
&gt;&gt; Well, I guess, I'm sorry but I
interrupted you to ask [inaudible].

02:53:23.680 --> 02:53:29.710
&gt;&gt; Harry G. Lang: Well, in
summary, there's a ton of rich,

02:53:29.710 --> 02:53:32.080
wonderful information at
the Library of Congress.

02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:36.580
And also, the Library of
Congress is very supportive

02:53:36.580 --> 02:53:39.480
of people with other disabilities.

02:53:39.480 --> 02:53:45.780
Thirdly, understanding deafness as
not only the educational aspect,

02:53:45.780 --> 02:53:48.730
but the cultural history
is helpful as well.

02:53:48.730 --> 02:53:54.930
And lastly, I highly commend
the Library of Congress

02:53:54.930 --> 02:53:57.360
in the National Literacy--

02:53:57.360 --> 02:53:58.660
&gt;&gt; Literary--

02:53:58.660 --> 02:54:00.270
&gt;&gt; Harry G. Lang: Literary
Society for the Deaf

02:54:00.270 --> 02:54:05.410
in promoting the reading and
writing in deaf education,

02:54:05.410 --> 02:54:07.300
and ultimately I found
that in my research.

02:54:07.300 --> 02:54:10.510
Thank you so much for inviting
me here to speak today.

02:54:10.510 --> 02:54:14.520
[ Applause ]

02:54:14.520 --> 02:54:17.400
&gt;&gt; John Cole: That was a wonderful
presentation, the second one.

02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:19.200
Thank you, Harry.

02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:22.420
[ Applause ]

02:54:22.420 --> 02:54:25.840
Before we move on, I have a--

02:54:25.840 --> 02:54:30.040
one very brief Library of
Congress Abraham Lincoln story.

02:54:30.040 --> 02:54:31.950
Many of you know that the Library

02:54:31.950 --> 02:54:36.280
of Congress is the first
presidential library.

02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:43.490
Before the FDR, Franklin Delano
Roosevelt started his library,

02:54:43.490 --> 02:54:46.500
all of the presidential
papers came here

02:54:46.500 --> 02:54:50.210
and they came here
including for Abraham Lincoln.

02:54:50.210 --> 02:54:54.750
And when my boss, Mr. Boorstin,
became Librarian of Congress

02:54:54.750 --> 02:54:59.840
in 1975, he went in the closet
in the librarian's office

02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:03.530
in the old building and he
said there was a package

02:55:03.530 --> 02:55:07.410
that said the contents of
Lincoln's pockets the night he

02:55:07.410 --> 02:55:09.190
was assassinated.

02:55:09.190 --> 02:55:13.030
And we didn't understand what that
could be or if it were even true

02:55:13.030 --> 02:55:17.700 position:56%
because the Lincoln papers of course
had come earlier in the century

02:55:17.700 --> 02:55:21.230 position:56%
from Robert Lincoln who was his son.

02:55:21.230 --> 02:55:26.730
But it turned out that the family
hung on to indeed a package

02:55:26.730 --> 02:55:31.240
that had the contents of his
pockets and that was placed

02:55:31.240 --> 02:55:33.640
in the librarian's office.

02:55:33.640 --> 02:55:37.070
And Dr. Boorstin was the
Librarian of Congress

02:55:37.070 --> 02:55:40.120
and so he rapidly opened it up

02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:46.220
and it contained indeed
Lincoln's wallet, his eyeglasses.

02:55:46.220 --> 02:55:51.070
And in his wallet, it was filled
with clippings about himself,

02:55:51.070 --> 02:55:56.940
but also confederate
money was in his pockets.

02:55:56.940 --> 02:56:02.560
And Dr. Boorstin immediately put
this on display but it turned

02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:06.040
out the family, it was
part of the initial gift

02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:11.640
but the family had held it
back and it came in the 1930s

02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:16.700 position:56%
and no one knows why the Librarian
of Congress didn't open the package.

02:56:16.700 --> 02:56:20.370
But maybe he was just
respecting the Lincoln family.

02:56:20.370 --> 02:56:25.420
So there's a little bit of
mystery related to the relationship

02:56:25.420 --> 02:56:28.620
between Lincoln and the
Library of Congress,

02:56:28.620 --> 02:56:32.190
but it's been a strong
historical relationship.

02:56:32.190 --> 02:56:36.500
And Harry has gone ahead and added

02:56:36.500 --> 02:56:40.160
to that a great deal I
think this afternoon.

02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:44.410
Our next speaker, Alice of--

02:56:44.410 --> 02:56:49.650
Hagemeyer is going to talk about
deaf cultures and American parents.

02:56:49.650 --> 02:56:54.860
And do you have-- Is Noah
Beckman here to help you, Alice?

02:56:54.860 --> 02:56:56.250
Oh, there you are.

02:56:56.250 --> 02:56:57.550
Thank you.

02:56:57.550 --> 02:57:02.610
And let me have the two of you
come up and take another look

02:57:02.610 --> 02:57:06.980
at our general discussion,
but this time it's

02:57:06.980 --> 02:57:09.560
from quite a different perspective.

02:57:09.560 --> 02:57:15.920
So I will turn the stage
over to Alice and to Noah.

02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:18.610
Deaf cultures, American parents.

02:57:18.610 --> 02:57:21.510
And I've also noticed
that from now on,

02:57:21.510 --> 02:57:25.860
we are in our presentations going
to actually feature a number

02:57:25.860 --> 02:57:28.420
of personalities who
have been important

02:57:28.420 --> 02:57:30.640
in the history of deaf culture.

02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:33.880
And I look forward to your
presentation very much.

02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:36.180
Thank you.

02:57:50.710 --> 02:57:58.460
&gt;&gt; And we'll have Ricardo
Lopez come up in a bit as well.

02:57:58.460 --> 02:57:59.760
&gt;&gt; Noah Beckman: Good
afternoon, everyone.

02:57:59.760 --> 02:58:01.060
I am thrilled to be here.

02:58:01.060 --> 02:58:06.520
And before we get started, go
ahead and interrupt me at any point

02:58:06.520 --> 02:58:08.160
if you feel like you've
missed something or you want

02:58:08.160 --> 02:58:10.630 position:56%
to clarify something that I've said.

02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:15.410
Before we really get started,

02:58:15.410 --> 02:58:18.500
there are some different
parts to our program.

02:58:18.500 --> 02:58:22.890
Alice Hagemeyer will
talk for a portion of it

02:58:22.890 --> 02:58:24.990
and then she'll hand it off to me

02:58:24.990 --> 02:58:29.190
and then Wesley Arey
will also be speaking,

02:58:29.190 --> 02:58:32.870
and then we'll have Ricardo
facilitating the FAQs at the end.

02:58:32.870 --> 02:58:35.490
So I believe we have a
really exciting program.

02:58:35.490 --> 02:58:38.050
Alice, would you like
to introduce yourself?

02:58:38.050 --> 02:58:41.180
For the first part

02:58:41.180 --> 02:58:45.570
of our presentation, we
have Alice Hagemeyer.

02:58:45.570 --> 02:58:49.080
And you may know her as the
founder of the Red Book,

02:58:49.080 --> 02:58:52.830
that became FOLDA,
that is now the NLSD.

02:58:52.830 --> 02:58:55.150
And she can explain that
a little bit further.

02:58:55.150 --> 02:58:57.280
It is my honor to introduce
her, so please,

02:58:57.280 --> 02:58:59.510
welcome Alice Hagemeyer
to the floor.

02:58:59.510 --> 02:59:12.170
[ Applause ]

02:59:12.170 --> 02:59:14.480 position:56%
The slides will be advanced for you.

02:59:14.480 --> 02:59:16.330
You simply just have
to let them know.

02:59:16.330 --> 02:59:17.630
&gt;&gt; Alice L. Hagemeyer: That's good.

02:59:17.630 --> 02:59:18.930
I'm not so good with
technology myself.

02:59:18.930 --> 02:59:20.980
Hello everyone.

02:59:20.980 --> 02:59:25.200
My topic today is deaf
cultures and American parents.

02:59:25.200 --> 02:59:29.200 position:56%
So you've seen different themes come

02:59:29.200 --> 02:59:33.260
through during the
presentations of today.

02:59:33.260 --> 02:59:37.840
And we've talked quite a
bit about deaf culture,

02:59:37.840 --> 02:59:42.480
which includes lifestyles
and behaviors

02:59:42.480 --> 02:59:44.970
and perspectives and so forth.

02:59:44.970 --> 02:59:48.630
So we often refer to
this as deaf culture.

02:59:48.630 --> 02:59:52.170
Rather than saying deaf and
hard of hearing community

02:59:52.170 --> 02:59:54.530
or the deaf community,
we really do want

02:59:54.530 --> 02:59:57.850
to emphasize the cultural
aspect this afternoon.

03:00:04.110 --> 03:00:06.300
If you can advance the slide.

03:00:06.300 --> 03:00:10.520
&gt;&gt; Noah Beckman: We have someone
taking care of that for you.

03:00:10.520 --> 03:00:12.520
So you just simply have
to kind of look their way.

03:00:12.520 --> 03:00:13.930
You see, you see him
waiving right there?

03:00:13.930 --> 03:00:17.380
That's the person responsible
for advancing the slides.

03:00:17.380 --> 03:00:21.230
So as soon as you give them the
cue, they will advance it for you.

03:00:21.230 --> 03:00:22.530
&gt;&gt; Alice L. Hagemeyer: Very good.

03:00:22.530 --> 03:00:23.830
Thank you.

03:00:23.830 --> 03:00:29.040
Of course, one size of
services doesn't fit all.

03:00:29.040 --> 03:00:32.340
So we've developed a
variety of guidelines

03:00:32.340 --> 03:00:34.970 position:56%
for better serving our deaf culture.

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:45.440
When I first joined the
American Library Association,

03:00:46.550 --> 03:00:50.250 position:56%
this was when they were
celebrating their 100th anniversary.

03:00:50.250 --> 03:00:52.060
That was 1976.

03:00:52.060 --> 03:00:54.550
At that time, there were
no specified services

03:00:54.550 --> 03:00:56.850
for the deaf community.

03:00:58.970 --> 03:01:04.360
They had services for
the blind and the serve--

03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:07.740
and services for physically
handicapped,

03:01:07.740 --> 03:01:10.190
but there was no mention of
services for deaf people.

03:01:10.190 --> 03:01:15.410
So I was involved in
setting up those services.

03:01:15.410 --> 03:01:19.160
We discussed what they
should be called

03:01:19.160 --> 03:01:22.060
because this was a very
new concept for librarians

03:01:22.060 --> 03:01:25.850
who for the most part
hadn't met deaf people.

03:01:27.330 --> 03:01:30.150
There were people who were
hard of hearing involved

03:01:30.150 --> 03:01:32.030
in the Library Association

03:01:32.030 --> 03:01:34.330
who didn't really identify
with deaf culture.

03:01:34.330 --> 03:01:38.750
And so this whole concept
of deaf culture was very new

03:01:38.750 --> 03:01:41.110
to the Librarian Association.

03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:50.230 position:56%
And just went to call those services
led to quite a bit of discussion.

03:01:50.230 --> 03:01:52.610
Today we just say deaf and
hard of hearing to refer

03:01:52.610 --> 03:01:55.220
to the deaf services
provided the libraries.

03:01:55.220 --> 03:02:01.560
Now the members of the American
Library Association wanted

03:02:01.560 --> 03:02:05.820
to make it easier for Library
of Congress and public libraries

03:02:05.820 --> 03:02:07.120
to serve the deaf community.

03:02:07.120 --> 03:02:09.250
They realized the gap existed.

03:02:09.250 --> 03:02:16.170
And we decided at that time to just
refer to these services as deaf,

03:02:16.170 --> 03:02:18.490
because we see that
as a positive term.

03:02:18.490 --> 03:02:22.900
And it is an umbrella term
that encompasses all sorts

03:02:22.900 --> 03:02:26.510 position:56%
of healing loss and deaf identities.

03:02:28.090 --> 03:02:32.880
So, hearing children with
deaf parents can identify

03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:36.410
with this term deaf when
we refer to deaf services.

03:02:36.410 --> 03:02:38.710
So it's a very broad term.

03:02:42.570 --> 03:02:46.850
Now the reason why the American
Library Association established

03:02:46.850 --> 03:02:50.090
these services was, as I
said, to make the job easier

03:02:50.090 --> 03:02:53.920
for all libraries, not just Library
of Congress but all libraries

03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:55.810
to serve the deaf community.

03:02:55.810 --> 03:02:59.810
So as Harry Lang was saying with
his research that he's done,

03:02:59.810 --> 03:03:03.740
that's there because of
the work of the libraries

03:03:03.740 --> 03:03:06.380
to get these resources in place.

03:03:07.610 --> 03:03:12.370
And so as I said earlier,
we're talking this afternoon

03:03:12.370 --> 03:03:16.900
about deaf cultures and within
the American Library Association,

03:03:16.900 --> 03:03:20.960
there is a group that's
called Bridging Deaf Cultures

03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:22.510
at your library.

03:03:22.510 --> 03:03:25.810
And that's led by Alec McFarlane.

03:03:25.810 --> 03:03:32.030
He is not a librarian but is
certainly a friend of libraries.

03:03:32.030 --> 03:03:35.750
And so we've worked quite
closely on this program

03:03:35.750 --> 03:03:43.960
to make the jobs easier, the work
easier for librarians to connect

03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:45.630
with their deaf communities.

03:03:45.630 --> 03:03:50.880
I-- remember this is a workshop
format, so I want to make sure

03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:55.810
that at any time you have question
that you feel free to ask them.

03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:03.630
&gt;&gt; OK, if we could
advance to next slide.

03:04:12.090 --> 03:04:14.810
&gt;&gt; Alice L. Hagemeyer: This morning
we had various speakers talking

03:04:14.810 --> 03:04:18.370
about different topics, all
of them of course related

03:04:18.370 --> 03:04:21.620
to deaf or hard of hearing.

03:04:21.620 --> 03:04:28.480
And you might wonder about the
differences between these terms.

03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:32.910
When I joined American
Library Association,

03:04:32.910 --> 03:04:37.590
the word library was not
seen as in positive terms.

03:04:37.590 --> 03:04:40.640
They wanted it to be
library and information.

03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:46.000
A similar process happened
within the deaf community.

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:50.550
There's deaf, there's hard of
hearing, what terms do we embrace.

03:04:50.550 --> 03:04:55.510
And again, we decided upon the
term deaf to include all of us.

03:04:55.510 --> 03:04:59.990
But you might remember
a time-- I'm sorry.

03:04:59.990 --> 03:05:04.050
You of course might have
personal experience with people

03:05:04.050 --> 03:05:08.300
who call themselves deaf
because of hearing loss related

03:05:08.300 --> 03:05:11.100
to aging or variety of reasons.

03:05:11.100 --> 03:05:15.450
And so it's become a word that
has become positive in nature.

03:05:15.450 --> 03:05:20.360
It can include, as I said as an
umbrella term, it include children

03:05:20.360 --> 03:05:23.610
with deaf parents, people
who are hard of hearing.

03:05:23.610 --> 03:05:29.950
And this morning we talked
about children and the right

03:05:29.950 --> 03:05:33.890
to access a language
that's accessible to them.

03:05:33.890 --> 03:05:36.420
We're all working together
within this community

03:05:36.420 --> 03:05:38.350
because we have common goals.

03:05:38.350 --> 03:05:42.500
Is there a question?

03:05:57.620 --> 03:06:01.920
&gt;&gt; Noah Beckman: I am not great
at mirroring those questions

03:06:01.920 --> 03:06:04.100
and repeating them, so I'll
just have an interpreter step

03:06:04.100 --> 03:06:06.240
on stage for you.

03:06:06.240 --> 03:06:14.770
&gt;&gt; And you do the questions
and I'll do that [inaudible].

03:06:14.770 --> 03:06:16.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

03:06:16.070 --> 03:06:17.370
&gt;&gt; Hi, Alice.

03:06:17.370 --> 03:06:18.670
I would like to add some input.

03:06:18.670 --> 03:06:20.480
I think there are some good
examples of that, of the dialogue

03:06:20.480 --> 03:06:26.650
that happens between Art
Roehrig about those types

03:06:26.650 --> 03:06:30.940
of discussions and those additions.

03:06:30.940 --> 03:06:34.580
So I would say that you should
have a conversation with Art.

03:06:34.580 --> 03:06:38.230
He is one of my old friends,
and I would like to ask

03:06:38.230 --> 03:06:42.490
where your recognition is of those
individuals who are deaf-blind.

03:06:42.490 --> 03:06:48.690
We were in Cleveland
recently just for a visit.

03:06:48.690 --> 03:06:51.760
We were visiting some
old friends of ours.

03:06:51.760 --> 03:06:57.720
Chuck Williams, who is
very well known in the--

03:06:57.720 --> 03:07:00.430
as a black death advocate.

03:07:00.430 --> 03:07:04.070
He is on the board at
Gallaudet University

03:07:04.070 --> 03:07:06.390
and we were having a conversation
with him while we were there,

03:07:06.390 --> 03:07:08.000
and it just so happened
that another friend

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:10.910
of ours had gone to the library.

03:07:10.910 --> 03:07:18.480
They're in Cleveland and had
found your book and was surprised

03:07:18.480 --> 03:07:22.570
that his name was actually
in the book.

03:07:22.570 --> 03:07:32.150
And his visual arts name was in
the book and he was described

03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:35.640
as vision impaired
when he identifies--

03:07:35.640 --> 03:07:40.750
When you say you're using
the word deaf but adding all

03:07:40.750 --> 03:07:45.750
of those other identifying
terms is not as acceptable.

03:07:45.750 --> 03:07:48.800
So it's just something that I
wanted to call to your attention.

03:07:48.800 --> 03:07:50.100
&gt;&gt; Alice L. Hagemeyer:
This is a good point.

03:07:50.100 --> 03:07:54.380
I have spoken with some deaf-blind
friends and they have felt much

03:07:54.380 --> 03:07:58.040
like second class citizens, like a
subcategory in the deaf community

03:07:58.040 --> 03:07:59.810
and we certainly don't
want that to be the case.

03:07:59.810 --> 03:08:03.640
There are deaf people with
intellectual disabilities,

03:08:03.640 --> 03:08:10.920
physical disabilities, et cetera,
and what we want to see is one term

03:08:10.920 --> 03:08:13.870
that encompasses it--
the entire community

03:08:13.870 --> 03:08:16.880
so that we can best provide
services to this group

03:08:16.880 --> 03:08:20.990
as an entire community
even though it is diverse.

03:08:20.990 --> 03:08:26.310
So we established the deaf--
the Deaf Culture Digital Library

03:08:26.310 --> 03:08:29.750
which describes many of
our services that we offer,

03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:32.410
and it's used by a lot
of people doing research.

03:08:32.410 --> 03:08:36.800
It helps them save on time when
they're working on their projects.

03:08:36.800 --> 03:08:40.360
So again, this is a term that
encompasses the entire community.

03:08:40.360 --> 03:08:42.660
Did somebody else have a question?

03:08:54.970 --> 03:09:01.280
&gt;&gt; So, if Thomas had become deaf
later in life but still identified

03:09:01.280 --> 03:09:07.160
as hearing, that aspect
of it is lost.

03:09:07.160 --> 03:09:09.250
There are people with hearing loss

03:09:09.250 --> 03:09:13.890
and maybe not a profound hearing
loss, but do we still identify them

03:09:13.890 --> 03:09:16.320
as deaf or could they
identify as hard of hearing?

03:09:16.320 --> 03:09:20.890
&gt;&gt; Alice L. Hagemeyer:
The rules that we follow

03:09:20.890 --> 03:09:25.870
with our library services is not
to consider this a disability.

03:09:25.870 --> 03:09:28.850
We look at people first concepts.

03:09:28.850 --> 03:09:31.700
We look at our customers as people.

03:09:31.700 --> 03:09:35.350
So when a person enters a library,
they don't have to check the box,

03:09:35.350 --> 03:09:37.610
are they deaf or hard
of hearing, deaf-blind.

03:09:37.610 --> 03:09:42.330
We respect all people equally
with the programs that we serve.

03:09:42.330 --> 03:09:46.640
Now, a person who becomes deaf
later in life we hope will be able

03:09:46.640 --> 03:09:52.270 position:56%
to accept that fact as part of their
life, and we have storytellings,

03:09:52.270 --> 03:09:57.810
a variety of programs that draw
in that particular audience,

03:09:57.810 --> 03:10:00.710
people who were deafened
later in life.

03:10:01.870 --> 03:10:07.070
So, the idea is not to consider
hearing loss but deaf gain.

03:10:07.070 --> 03:10:09.540
This is a new term
that's come on the scene.

03:10:09.540 --> 03:10:14.270
I had a cousin I haven't seen for
many years, we grew up together,

03:10:14.270 --> 03:10:19.010
and this person never
really saw me as an equal.

03:10:19.010 --> 03:10:21.980
It was a common perspective
on me as a deaf person.

03:10:21.980 --> 03:10:25.920
And my cousin said they are
now, as an older person,

03:10:25.920 --> 03:10:28.920
experiencing hearing loss and
that they don't have enough money

03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:30.220
to buy hearing aids.

03:10:30.220 --> 03:10:34.210
And so, I was trying to help
them understand that instead

03:10:34.210 --> 03:10:37.140
of seeing this is a process of
loss, it's a process of gain

03:10:37.140 --> 03:10:38.690 position:56%
that you're adding to your identity.

03:10:38.690 --> 03:10:43.210
And so, they have so many
anecdotal stories like this

03:10:43.210 --> 03:10:46.500
about people trying to
adjust to that change

03:10:46.500 --> 03:10:49.100
and then coming to embrace it.

03:10:49.100 --> 03:10:54.520
Now, we do want to talk
about parents as part

03:10:54.520 --> 03:10:56.960
of deaf culture in America.

03:11:02.020 --> 03:11:05.450
And Noah is going to share with
us a story of one hearing parent

03:11:05.450 --> 03:11:08.150
of a deaf child from our history.

03:11:14.210 --> 03:11:18.230
And we prepared this because it's
a story that's been told throughout

03:11:18.230 --> 03:11:21.090
our history in libraries
and elsewhere.

03:11:21.090 --> 03:11:24.580
It's the story of a hearing
man with a deaf daughter.

03:11:27.450 --> 03:11:33.500
This was Maxwell Fitch
Cogswell-- Mason Fitch Cogswell.

03:11:33.500 --> 03:11:35.920
His daughter, Alice,
you may know was famous

03:11:35.920 --> 03:11:37.880 position:56%
at the American School for the Deaf.

03:11:37.880 --> 03:11:44.890
And this is a story that has
become part of our heritage and one

03:11:44.890 --> 03:11:48.170
that Noah is going to share
with us as an example of stories

03:11:48.170 --> 03:11:51.820
that can be told at any public
library to help spread the message

03:11:51.820 --> 03:11:53.470
of the deaf community
and deaf culture.

03:11:53.470 --> 03:11:55.770
&gt;&gt; Noah Beckman: Thank you.

03:12:01.990 --> 03:12:05.130
You could advance, yup, perfect.

03:12:09.350 --> 03:12:15.920
This seems to be a better place
to stand behind the podium.

03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:21.670
Mason Fitch Cogswell, which I will
abbreviate MFC so I won't have

03:12:21.670 --> 03:12:23.010
to fingerspell his name every time.

03:12:23.010 --> 03:12:28.190
I actually got the content
from Alice's readings,

03:12:28.190 --> 03:12:30.830
it's actually really quite
fascinating and I'm happy

03:12:30.830 --> 03:12:32.130
to share that story with you.

03:12:32.130 --> 03:12:33.870
Hopefully, it'll be a
learning moment for you.

03:12:33.870 --> 03:12:35.540
I am not a historian.

03:12:35.540 --> 03:12:40.650
I'm a librarian at Gallaudet
and became fascinated with this.

03:12:40.650 --> 03:12:42.850
So, if you could show
the picture please.

03:12:42.850 --> 03:12:46.160
I don't know, do we
look similar maybe?

03:12:46.160 --> 03:12:48.300
[ Laughter ]

03:12:48.300 --> 03:12:52.330
This is an example of what
he look like, no mustache

03:12:52.330 --> 03:12:55.580
but a nice beard and
very well dressed.

03:12:55.580 --> 03:12:59.260
He's got his spectacles on there.

03:12:59.260 --> 03:13:01.360
So, this is Mason Fitch Cogswell.

03:13:01.360 --> 03:13:06.210
And this year, we could
celebrate his 255th birthday

03:13:06.210 --> 03:13:08.770
if he were still living.

03:13:08.770 --> 03:13:11.430
Being 255 years old,
that's something

03:13:11.430 --> 03:13:13.200
to keep in mind for this story.

03:13:13.200 --> 03:13:19.980
He was born in the fall
of 1771 in Connecticut

03:13:19.980 --> 03:13:25.300
in a town called Cadbury.

03:13:32.750 --> 03:13:34.840
He was born in 1772.

03:13:34.840 --> 03:13:38.150
His mother did pass not
long after he was born.

03:13:38.150 --> 03:13:41.630
He was survived by
his-- with his father,

03:13:41.630 --> 03:13:44.510
John Cogswell and he was a pastor.

03:13:44.510 --> 03:13:49.790
And he was offered a position
at a church in Scotland.

03:13:49.790 --> 03:13:54.450
But he had a young son.

03:13:54.450 --> 03:13:59.010
At that time, he had Mason and
so he got in touch with someone

03:13:59.010 --> 03:14:04.990
who was rather famous at
the time, Samuel Hutchinson,

03:14:04.990 --> 03:14:11.410
who was a delegate in the congress
when he was in Philadelphia.

03:14:11.410 --> 03:14:18.130
He ran the Continental Congress

03:14:18.130 --> 03:14:22.340
and he had also signed the
Declaration of Independence.

03:14:22.340 --> 03:14:25.160
He is one of many signatures
on the declaration.

03:14:25.160 --> 03:14:28.420
And so, he was a very
reputable person at that time.

03:14:28.420 --> 03:14:32.170
And so, he brought Mason Fitch
Cogswell under his tutelage.

03:14:32.170 --> 03:14:37.950
And he was a very brilliant man.

03:14:37.950 --> 03:14:43.000
He got accepted into
Yale and was one

03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:45.720
of the brightest scholars at Yale.

03:14:45.720 --> 03:14:53.350
He finished his studies at 19 years
old, me finishing my studies at 23.

03:14:53.350 --> 03:14:57.560
He was the valedictorian
of his class.

03:14:57.560 --> 03:15:00.420
He chose to study medicine.

03:15:00.420 --> 03:15:06.990
And Mason Fitch Cogswell
had an older brother,

03:15:08.010 --> 03:15:12.610
also named James Cogswell, who
was a physician in New York City

03:15:12.610 --> 03:15:18.010
and he was a physician during the
time of the American Revolution.

03:15:18.010 --> 03:15:21.390
And so, he worked and studied
under his older brother

03:15:21.390 --> 03:15:25.520
so that he could get more
experience in the medical field

03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:28.960
and would be ready to be
able to practice on his own.

03:15:28.960 --> 03:15:31.140
When deciding where to
live, he decided to go back

03:15:31.140 --> 03:15:37.650
to Connecticut and
rode there by horse.

03:15:37.650 --> 03:15:40.720
And when he got to his hometown,
he became very overwhelmed

03:15:40.720 --> 03:15:45.080
by his memories of Connecticut
and being at Yale, and he decided

03:15:45.080 --> 03:15:48.790
to actually move to Hartford,
Connecticut and settle.

03:15:48.790 --> 03:15:52.410
There were too many memories
and friends in his hometown.

03:15:52.410 --> 03:15:58.980
As a physician, he
grew quite famous.

03:15:58.980 --> 03:16:03.690
He was recognized for
two great acts.

03:16:03.690 --> 03:16:08.580
He removed a cataract-- and if
you give me just one second.

03:16:08.580 --> 03:16:11.480
Yes, he was able to
remove a cataract off

03:16:11.480 --> 03:16:16.280
of an eye before the
actual cataract broke.

03:16:16.280 --> 03:16:19.010
He removed it in one piece.

03:16:19.010 --> 03:16:23.220
He was also very famous for-- what?

03:16:24.310 --> 03:16:25.810
&gt;&gt; Tying off the carotid artery.

03:16:25.810 --> 03:16:28.040
&gt;&gt; Noah Beckman: Tying
off the carotid artery.

03:16:28.040 --> 03:16:31.730
And he was the first one
to do that successfully.

03:16:31.730 --> 03:16:36.540
So, he was a very well-renowned
physician at that time.

03:16:36.540 --> 03:16:41.150
He became famous due to
those two large feats.

03:16:41.150 --> 03:16:43.650
Give me one second to
find my notes here.

03:16:43.650 --> 03:16:49.810
The State of Connecticut, the
Medical Society, the individual

03:16:49.810 --> 03:16:55.760
who ran that at that
time studied under him.

03:16:55.760 --> 03:16:57.380
He had many people
under his tutelage

03:16:57.380 --> 03:16:59.890
that became doctors in Connecticut.

03:16:59.890 --> 03:17:04.510
They offered him the head of
a medical school position.

03:17:04.510 --> 03:17:08.020
He decided to decline that
offer because he wanted to stay

03:17:08.020 --> 03:17:09.730
in Hartford, Connecticut.

03:17:09.730 --> 03:17:15.250
And you can see his contributions.

03:17:15.250 --> 03:17:20.920
He founded the school--
or founded a residence--

03:17:20.920 --> 03:17:24.560
residential school
for mental health.

03:17:24.560 --> 03:17:27.780
And I just checked last week
and it's actually still running.

03:17:27.780 --> 03:17:32.700 position:56%
And so, that's a contribution that
he was able to give to the community

03:17:32.700 --> 03:17:35.480
that is still functioning today.

03:17:36.890 --> 03:17:40.770
He ultimately married and had
a family and had some children

03:17:40.770 --> 03:17:44.980
and Alice was the third
of those children.

03:17:47.920 --> 03:17:52.940
She was identified as deaf
and they wanted to try,

03:17:52.940 --> 03:17:56.760
obviously as a physician,
to fix her hearing.

03:17:56.760 --> 03:18:03.320
And so, while socializing with
friends, they saw an article

03:18:03.320 --> 03:18:07.040
from the Braidwood School that
they had successfully educated

03:18:07.040 --> 03:18:09.020
deaf children.

03:18:09.020 --> 03:18:17.460
And there was a school in Virginia
but it was a residential school

03:18:17.460 --> 03:18:22.450
and it was only a temporary
school at that time.

03:18:22.450 --> 03:18:24.350
They knew Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet.

03:18:24.350 --> 03:18:29.120
He had known him from-- Mason
had known him from Yale and being

03:18:29.120 --> 03:18:30.850
in the community together.

03:18:30.850 --> 03:18:34.290
And so, they got to talking.

03:18:34.290 --> 03:18:35.590
And remember at that time,

03:18:35.590 --> 03:18:39.240
Mason Fitch Cogswell
was very well connected.

03:18:39.240 --> 03:18:42.320
He had several lawyer buddies.

03:18:42.320 --> 03:18:44.800
He was connected and
affiliated with congressmen.

03:18:44.800 --> 03:18:46.300
He was able to easily
raise the money

03:18:46.300 --> 03:18:50.770
to send Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet to
London to see the Braidwood School

03:18:50.770 --> 03:18:53.410
and ultimately get
their teaching methods.

03:19:01.450 --> 03:19:03.800
Give me just one second.

03:19:09.480 --> 03:19:13.040
And because of all of
these interaction, it was--

03:19:13.040 --> 03:19:14.480
ultimately, the first school

03:19:14.480 --> 03:19:16.460
for the deaf was founded
in the United States.

03:19:16.460 --> 03:19:19.020
So, we want to thank
Mason Fitch Cogswell

03:19:19.020 --> 03:19:22.670
for him planting the initial
seed that created education

03:19:22.670 --> 03:19:24.970
for deaf individuals
in the United States.

03:19:24.970 --> 03:19:29.100
Schools ultimately were
founded from the American School

03:19:29.100 --> 03:19:30.690
for the Deaf's graduates.

03:19:30.690 --> 03:19:37.630
They went on to open their
school and this was in 1817.

03:19:37.630 --> 03:19:41.570
He passed away in 1830.

03:19:41.570 --> 03:19:46.510
And Alice was very close with
Mason Fitch Cogswell, her father,

03:19:46.510 --> 03:19:48.590
and was very proud of the
work that he had done,

03:19:48.590 --> 03:19:51.110
they had developed a
very strong connection.

03:19:51.110 --> 03:19:54.410
And once her father
passed, she was very upset.

03:19:54.410 --> 03:20:00.970
She actually passed 13 days after
him, at the young age of 25.

03:20:02.830 --> 03:20:06.160
So now, I want to take the
opportunity to commemorate

03:20:06.160 --> 03:20:10.020
and celebrate Mason Fitch Cogswell
for his contributions and the work

03:20:10.020 --> 03:20:12.480
that he's done for
the deaf community.

03:20:12.480 --> 03:20:16.000
He is an American parent
of a deaf child.

03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:21.430
We're very proud of him.

03:20:21.430 --> 03:20:22.850
Thank you.

03:20:22.850 --> 03:20:24.220
&gt;&gt; Alice L. Hagemeyer:
Thank you Noah.

03:20:24.220 --> 03:20:32.330
And if you would like access
to this story, please join LDS.

03:20:32.330 --> 03:20:36.540
And then you'll see examples
of stories just like this

03:20:36.540 --> 03:20:39.250
that you can use in your
own research efforts

03:20:39.250 --> 03:20:42.620
and to help spread the word to
your libraries and your communities

03:20:42.620 --> 03:20:45.400
about stories in our
history like this.

03:20:45.400 --> 03:20:48.550
We have these services
in all 50 states plus DC

03:20:48.550 --> 03:20:50.680
and the US territories.

03:20:50.680 --> 03:20:52.980
Thank you.

03:21:02.230 --> 03:21:05.530 position:56%
And let me check if Wesley is ready.

03:21:05.530 --> 03:21:10.410
Are there any other
questions at this point?

03:21:15.860 --> 03:21:18.040
How many of you know
who this person is?

03:21:18.040 --> 03:21:19.440
Laurent Clerc?

03:21:19.440 --> 03:21:25.190
You know, many of the younger
generation don't know who Clerc is

03:21:25.190 --> 03:21:27.950
which is really a travesty.

03:21:27.950 --> 03:21:30.690
That falls on the job--

03:21:30.690 --> 03:21:34.310
the job falls on people
like yourself and me.

03:21:34.310 --> 03:21:36.990
We need to keep on
teaching deaf history.

03:21:36.990 --> 03:21:43.130
We can't forget people in our
heritage like Laurent Clerc.

03:21:43.130 --> 03:21:48.500
He, Cogswell, Thomas
Hopkins Gallaudet,

03:21:48.500 --> 03:21:52.330
together founded the first
school for the deaf in America.

03:21:52.330 --> 03:21:57.450
It was the first school
on the western hemisphere,

03:21:57.450 --> 03:22:00.820 position:56%
first public school for deaf people.

03:22:00.820 --> 03:22:05.430
And this year, we recognize
the 200th anniversary of Clerc

03:22:05.430 --> 03:22:10.650
and Gallaudet's arrival, their trip
from France to found this school.

03:22:10.650 --> 03:22:17.490
So we commemorate that
200th anniversary.

03:22:17.490 --> 03:22:22.360
And next year, the school AST will
be having their own celebrations

03:22:22.360 --> 03:22:25.350
to commemorate their
200th anniversary.

03:22:25.350 --> 03:22:28.340
So now, we'll call up Wesley Arey.

03:22:31.610 --> 03:22:33.450
Make sure I've got his name right

03:22:33.450 --> 03:22:35.970
because this is only the
first time I've met him.

03:22:51.480 --> 03:22:54.590
&gt;&gt; Wesley Arey: This is the first
time I've actually stand on a stage

03:22:54.590 --> 03:22:56.100
with a podium so please forgive me

03:22:56.100 --> 03:22:57.640
as I'm learning how
get through this.

03:22:57.640 --> 03:22:59.940
I'm a little bit awkward.

03:23:02.510 --> 03:23:08.020
I'm not quite a pro but
I'll give it a shot.

03:23:08.020 --> 03:23:10.410
My actual name is Wesley Arey.

03:23:10.410 --> 03:23:14.960
But in the story, I will take
the character of Laurent Clerc.

03:23:18.710 --> 03:23:23.150 position:56%
I'll try to make this very clear and
I'm going to have to put my glasses

03:23:23.150 --> 03:23:27.020
on here because my vision
is getting worse as I age.

03:23:27.020 --> 03:23:29.510
So, bear with me.

03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:32.290
[ Laughter ]

03:23:32.290 --> 03:23:34.480
You know, actually, if
I put my glasses on,

03:23:34.480 --> 03:23:36.550
I have a hard time
seeing the audience.

03:23:36.550 --> 03:23:38.900
So, I'll leave the glasses off.

03:23:42.710 --> 03:23:45.570
I'm going to try my best here.

03:23:52.880 --> 03:23:54.760
Laurent Clerc.

03:23:54.760 --> 03:23:58.050
This is in sign so I'm
taking on my character now.

03:24:05.490 --> 03:24:14.320
On Tuesday, June 18th 1816,
Laurent Clerc is traveling

03:24:14.320 --> 03:24:16.760
to America with Gallaudet.

03:24:21.880 --> 03:24:25.570
The name of the ship
is Mary Augusta.

03:24:25.570 --> 03:24:29.270
It's a rather small ship.

03:24:29.270 --> 03:24:38.260 position:56%
As we enter the boat you see six
individuals, two of which are French

03:24:38.260 --> 03:24:42.260
and four of which are American.

03:24:42.260 --> 03:24:45.190
One of the French men
seems to be unhappy.

03:24:45.190 --> 03:24:48.830
And the reason is well,
there's no communication

03:24:48.830 --> 03:24:53.870 position:56%
and this person doesn't know English
so, he's out of conversation then.

03:25:02.590 --> 03:25:04.150
All passports are checked
to make sure

03:25:04.150 --> 03:25:07.520
that they can go on their voyage.

03:25:24.270 --> 03:25:26.570
Here, we see the deck on the ship.

03:25:26.570 --> 03:25:34.220
And inside the ship we have a
cabin where daily prayers was held.

03:25:34.220 --> 03:25:38.690
We have our routine there in the
morning, afternoon and the evening.

03:25:47.550 --> 03:25:55.010
Upon standing on the deck you
see the glorious ocean there.

03:25:55.010 --> 03:25:58.980
And afterwards go back down
to the cabin, do some reading,

03:25:58.980 --> 03:26:00.970
go back to the daily routine.

03:26:00.970 --> 03:26:05.970
All in all, the trip
took about 52 days.

03:26:18.360 --> 03:26:26.110
Laurent Clerc, a French gentlemen
looking at Gallaudet, an American,

03:26:26.110 --> 03:26:29.190
language, culture was exchanged.

03:26:30.620 --> 03:26:33.810
So I learned English
being a Frenchmen knowing

03:26:33.810 --> 03:26:40.960
that I have quite a
long journey ahead of me

03:26:40.960 --> 03:26:45.240
and I'm not fluent in English.

03:26:45.240 --> 03:26:50.320
So, as I'm being taught,
I also teach.

03:27:03.340 --> 03:27:07.880
Before eating, of course,
washing of the hands,

03:27:07.880 --> 03:27:15.250 position:56%
making sure that you're well
groomed, appear to be taken care of,

03:27:15.250 --> 03:27:22.960
prayer, tea, nightly
readings and an array of food

03:27:22.960 --> 03:27:25.910
as well as water and wine.

03:27:41.060 --> 03:27:43.530
Again, knowing no English,
I'll try my best

03:27:43.530 --> 03:27:47.700
to learn English language asking
Thomas get question after question.

03:27:47.700 --> 03:27:51.970
One month into the voyage.

03:27:58.130 --> 03:28:04.710
I noticed that fluency in the
language is picking up quite fast.

03:28:04.710 --> 03:28:07.480
Almost as fast as the
ship is traveling

03:28:13.210 --> 03:28:14.510
And this exchange of language

03:28:14.510 --> 03:28:17.970
and culture takes place
everyday on this journey.

03:28:30.930 --> 03:28:35.580 position:56%
On the ship, while the gentlemen are
exchanging stories, a man is spotted

03:28:35.580 --> 03:28:38.040
on the shroud of the ship.

03:28:39.270 --> 03:28:43.800
Captain, a gentlemen on
the shroud is prohibited.

03:28:49.460 --> 03:28:55.510
A letter is given to the
captain and the captain laughs

03:28:55.510 --> 03:28:59.810
because in is his mind, being
on the shroud isn't prohibited.

03:29:03.290 --> 03:29:07.620
Clerc responds, on the ship that
I boarded, it was prohibited to be

03:29:07.620 --> 03:29:13.250
on the shroud when I was
traveling from France to England.

03:29:13.250 --> 03:29:17.430
It appears that you allow
that, quite different.

03:29:21.330 --> 03:29:24.260
Friday, June 21st.

03:29:28.350 --> 03:29:32.890
Looking back at how far I've come,
picking up this English language,

03:29:32.890 --> 03:29:37.070
riding back and forth in
English day in and day out.

03:29:37.070 --> 03:29:41.390
There's nothing else to do aside

03:29:41.390 --> 03:29:45.770
from observe the waves
crashing as I'm aboard the ship.

03:29:49.710 --> 03:29:52.260
June 22nd.

03:29:52.260 --> 03:29:56.170
Gallaudet explains
the American culture.

03:29:57.210 --> 03:30:00.410
So, that's what American
culture is like, I say to myself.

03:30:11.010 --> 03:30:15.260
Every Sunday, we respect the
tradition of the Sabbath.

03:30:15.260 --> 03:30:17.950
And every Sunday, there
would be sermons

03:30:17.950 --> 03:30:22.580
and those sermons will be
preached to the crew on the ship.

03:30:22.580 --> 03:30:29.370
And me being deaf, I
wasn't able to hear that.

03:30:29.370 --> 03:30:32.450
So, written sermon is
given to me instead.

03:30:32.450 --> 03:30:34.140
I look at the dictionary
doing my best

03:30:34.140 --> 03:30:36.780
to follow what everyone
else is following.

03:30:40.760 --> 03:30:45.280
Treacherous waters
calmed by the sermon.

03:30:46.640 --> 03:30:49.210
Prayer, serenity.

03:30:55.890 --> 03:31:00.540
The next night, bouts of
sea sickness, not for me

03:31:00.540 --> 03:31:03.970
but for others I observe on
the ship, including Gallaudet.

03:31:07.400 --> 03:31:11.730
As someone who frequents the ship,
sea sickness doesn't affect me

03:31:11.730 --> 03:31:16.300
but I'm not able to sleep
with the ship rocking back

03:31:16.300 --> 03:31:19.420
and forth, I lie restless.

03:31:21.630 --> 03:31:25.510
Finally, in the early hour
of five in the morning,

03:31:25.510 --> 03:31:30.580
I'm able to fall sleep and
shortly after, I'm woken up.

03:31:30.580 --> 03:31:34.240
Painfully, I get up out the bed.

03:31:34.240 --> 03:31:38.580
Going to eat breakfast,
morning prayer,

03:31:38.580 --> 03:31:40.890
stand on the deck and observe.

03:31:49.280 --> 03:31:54.690
I recall Gallaudet mentioning
Alice Cogswell and his desire

03:31:54.690 --> 03:31:57.070
for all of us to meet together.

03:32:06.150 --> 03:32:10.230
It just so happened
that once upon a time,

03:32:10.230 --> 03:32:14.490
we actually had crossed paths
and I wasn't even aware.

03:32:28.990 --> 03:32:34.330
Conversations with the crew ensue,
letters written back and forth.

03:32:42.020 --> 03:32:44.810 position:56%
Is my wife deaf and dumb, I'm asked.

03:32:44.810 --> 03:32:51.050
And my response, of course,
we share the same suffering.

03:32:51.050 --> 03:32:52.920
We share the same challenges.

03:32:52.920 --> 03:32:58.380
June 27th.

03:33:02.710 --> 03:33:07.980
Another day of entries on
my battery and I'm shocked

03:33:07.980 --> 03:33:10.050
to see crews screaming,
there's a monster

03:33:10.050 --> 03:33:12.780
in the ocean, monster in the ocean.

03:33:12.780 --> 03:33:16.230
After looking in the
ocean and seeing nothing,

03:33:16.230 --> 03:33:20.130
I thought to myself,
perhaps it was a whale.

03:33:31.340 --> 03:33:35.020
I recall Gallaudet continuing
to help my English skills,

03:33:35.020 --> 03:33:37.880
helping me with my writing.

03:33:44.400 --> 03:33:49.000
I recall being praised
for my ability to pick

03:33:49.000 --> 03:33:51.010
up the English language
by Gallaudet.

03:33:51.010 --> 03:33:55.410
All this time we're on the
ocean, I'm doing my best.

03:33:56.450 --> 03:33:59.730
Other members on the crew realizing
that I've made some progress

03:33:59.730 --> 03:34:02.870
and they make comments about that.

03:34:08.920 --> 03:34:14.370 position:56%
Throughout our voyage, Gallaudet and
I are talking about ideas on setting

03:34:14.370 --> 03:34:17.230
up a school for the deaf.

03:34:17.230 --> 03:34:18.530
What should we do?

03:34:18.530 --> 03:34:19.830
What's the best way to go about it?

03:34:19.830 --> 03:34:25.840 position:56%
What would be the age of these
students at the school for the deaf?

03:34:25.840 --> 03:34:30.310
Often, parents don't want to let go
of their kids at such a young age.

03:34:30.310 --> 03:34:37.540
That's something we
had to think about.

03:34:37.540 --> 03:34:39.050
How long will they be in school?

03:34:39.050 --> 03:34:41.350
Another consideration.

03:34:45.170 --> 03:34:46.550
Perhaps, for those who are coming

03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:49.260
from wealthy families,
they'll stay longer.

03:34:55.220 --> 03:34:57.520
June 30th.

03:35:05.010 --> 03:35:10.130
I recall the design of the ship
with a gentleman standing there

03:35:10.130 --> 03:35:17.950
and just barely gets missed by
a part on the ship that falls

03:35:17.950 --> 03:35:22.600
from the shroud, just
barely missing him.

03:35:32.420 --> 03:35:40.280
Duck, chicken, pig,
canary, the canary was not

03:35:40.280 --> 03:35:42.580
for eating, don't be fooled.

03:35:44.140 --> 03:35:49.230
It was only for song purposes, to
listen to the joys of the music.

03:35:52.420 --> 03:35:59.680
I recall a hog and
slaughtered, coming nauseous,

03:35:59.680 --> 03:36:03.210
avoiding the deck what-- with
all the blood being spilled.

03:36:03.210 --> 03:36:07.970
Quiet a traumatizing experience.

03:36:12.840 --> 03:36:16.510 position:56%
Perhaps an experience best withheld.

03:36:16.510 --> 03:36:23.510
[ Laughter ]

03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:33.310
[ Inaudible Remark ]

03:36:33.310 --> 03:36:37.930
Six hundred miles away,
600 nautical miles.

03:36:37.930 --> 03:36:41.890
So, does that mean, it'll
take 90 days to seashore?

03:36:44.960 --> 03:36:55.320
With the wind picking up, it gave
us hope to take less than 90 days.

03:36:55.320 --> 03:37:01.180
July 2nd. Now, it's
our second month.

03:37:17.170 --> 03:37:21.550
On July 3rd, going about my
normal routine in the morning,

03:37:21.550 --> 03:37:24.470
brushing my teeth,
I'm shocked to get hit

03:37:24.470 --> 03:37:26.810
with such a strong gust of wind.

03:37:26.810 --> 03:37:29.630
A gust so strong it knocks
the glass out of my hand

03:37:29.630 --> 03:37:32.970
and shatters on the
deck of the ship.

03:37:41.470 --> 03:37:47.930 position:56%
Alas, the 4th of July, celebrations,
discussions about pride

03:37:47.930 --> 03:37:53.350 position:56%
of your country over glasses of
wine leading to a great night sleep.

03:38:01.810 --> 03:38:08.910 position:56%
July 6th. Again, a restless night
uncomfortable quarters of the cabin.

03:38:22.450 --> 03:38:28.950
Torrential weather, a fog, unable
to see, of course, making me think

03:38:28.950 --> 03:38:35.610
to sleep and rest while
we travel through that.

03:38:35.610 --> 03:38:41.790
July 10th, we've run out of papers.

03:38:41.790 --> 03:38:45.290
How can we communicate?

03:38:45.290 --> 03:38:50.620
Luckily, we have a clean
slate at our disposal.

03:38:50.620 --> 03:38:56.950
A slate for us to communicate
back and forth.

03:39:04.360 --> 03:39:12.010
An odd silence upon the ship,
so silent the hearing crew

03:39:12.010 --> 03:39:15.920
on the ship could even
hear a cat eating a mouse.

03:39:21.560 --> 03:39:28.810
Similar to the ducks that
were eating the mouse.

03:39:28.810 --> 03:39:32.640
And because the crew found out
that ducks were eating the mice,

03:39:32.640 --> 03:39:36.680
they no longer wanted to continue
eating the duck because they felt,

03:39:36.680 --> 03:39:39.550
in turn, they were
eating the mice as well.

03:39:45.220 --> 03:39:47.520
July 11th.

03:39:49.450 --> 03:39:52.800
With the canary in the cage day

03:39:52.800 --> 03:39:56.760
after day finally, it's
freed out the cage.

03:39:56.760 --> 03:40:01.840
And because it's been confined
to this cage for so long,

03:40:01.840 --> 03:40:04.660
its bearings have been lost.

03:40:04.660 --> 03:40:08.570
It stumbles off the
deck into the ocean.

03:40:11.530 --> 03:40:15.260
A life boat is lowered
of the side of the ship

03:40:15.260 --> 03:40:17.820
to rescue this revered duck.

03:40:17.820 --> 03:40:23.620
And lo and behold a
turtle in the ocean,

03:40:23.620 --> 03:40:26.790
for eating purposes of course.

03:40:32.410 --> 03:40:34.970
Again, a terrible fog.

03:40:42.510 --> 03:40:46.690
And the ship is carefully
navigating us to not hit anything

03:40:46.690 --> 03:40:48.960
that might be in the ocean.

03:40:48.960 --> 03:40:57.360
And at last, on August
6th, the fog passes.

03:40:59.980 --> 03:41:04.210
And before us, we're looking at
the coast of Boston, Massachusetts.

03:41:06.420 --> 03:41:11.430
On August 8th, we see
the shores of New York.

03:41:14.870 --> 03:41:16.880
Thanks to good weather
we've made it safely.

03:41:16.880 --> 03:41:18.680
The end.

03:41:18.680 --> 03:41:22.410
[ Applause ]

03:41:22.410 --> 03:41:26.280
And I apologize that I had
to look back to my notes

03:41:26.280 --> 03:41:29.550
as I didn't have the whole
story memorized, but thank you.

03:41:40.020 --> 03:41:43.630
&gt;&gt; Alice L. Hagemeyer: Do you know
where he got that information from?

03:41:43.630 --> 03:41:48.090
From Clerc's letters that he wrote.

03:41:48.090 --> 03:41:52.100
And so, you can tell that that
story comes from the heart.

03:41:52.100 --> 03:41:55.850
And if you want access to that
story, please sign your name up on

03:41:55.850 --> 03:41:57.370
to the e-mail list
and I'll make sure

03:41:57.370 --> 03:41:59.260 position:56%
that I can get you more information.

03:41:59.260 --> 03:42:02.220
Not only stories about
Clerc but other stories

03:42:02.220 --> 03:42:05.390
that you can tell in
your home areas.

03:42:05.390 --> 03:42:07.460
So, thank you so much.

03:42:07.460 --> 03:42:09.400
&gt;&gt; Wesley Arey: Thank you
for inviting me to come here.

03:42:09.400 --> 03:42:10.700
It's been an honor.

03:42:10.700 --> 03:42:12.000
I appreciate it.

03:42:12.000 --> 03:42:13.980
&gt;&gt; Alice L. Hagemeyer: We
are proud to have you here

03:42:13.980 --> 03:42:15.620
and I think that's
your first time here

03:42:15.620 --> 03:42:17.670
in the Library of Congress, right?

03:42:17.670 --> 03:42:18.970
&gt;&gt; Wesley Arey: Yes.

03:42:18.970 --> 03:42:23.670
And I would also like
to deeply thank you

03:42:23.670 --> 03:42:26.320
for making a first
blog in the history.

03:42:26.320 --> 03:42:32.850
Now, she knows how to make
a video log, imagine that.

03:42:32.850 --> 03:42:34.150
&gt;&gt; Alice L. Hagemeyer:
Oh, thank you.

03:42:34.150 --> 03:42:35.450
Thank you so much.

03:42:35.450 --> 03:42:43.310
I'm happy to have you here with us.

03:42:43.310 --> 03:42:46.090
I think that that's it.

03:42:46.090 --> 03:42:47.390
Pardon me.

03:42:47.390 --> 03:42:51.400
The next portion of our
workshop is the FAQs,

03:42:51.400 --> 03:42:53.720
the frequently asked questions.

03:42:53.720 --> 03:42:56.330
And I'm going to ask
that Ricardo Lopez come

03:42:56.330 --> 03:42:58.770
up to moderate those questions.

03:42:58.770 --> 03:43:02.450
We're happy to answer
anything that comes to mind.

03:43:34.330 --> 03:43:35.630
&gt;&gt; Ricardo Lopez: Hello.

03:43:35.630 --> 03:43:37.810
Hello everyone.

03:43:37.810 --> 03:43:44.100
Again, it's been great
watching Wesley tell that story.

03:43:44.100 --> 03:43:50.380 position:56%
Many years, he was president of
NLSD, and that's exactly what I mean

03:43:50.380 --> 03:43:55.510
by that, being able to
pass down that legacy.

03:43:55.510 --> 03:44:00.360
And we bring legacy forward related
to deaf culture via story telling.

03:44:00.360 --> 03:44:05.190
And so, that's how we preserve
our legacy, we pass it forward.

03:44:05.190 --> 03:44:06.910
So, I hope you enjoyed his story.

03:44:06.910 --> 03:44:12.450
There are many, many different
ways you can express your legacy.

03:44:12.450 --> 03:44:13.750
Sometimes, it's funny.

03:44:13.750 --> 03:44:15.050
Sometimes, it's serious.

03:44:15.050 --> 03:44:17.400
It depends on your own
individual preference.

03:44:17.400 --> 03:44:21.750 position:56%
But that's exactly what we're about.

03:44:21.750 --> 03:44:25.380
I was just informed that there
is a small change to the plan.

03:44:25.380 --> 03:44:28.320
We're going to take a
limited number of questions

03:44:28.320 --> 03:44:31.110
because are very limited
related to time.

03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:33.700
So, I'll take about
two or three questions

03:44:33.700 --> 03:44:35.450
and then we'll need
to wrap things up.

03:44:35.450 --> 03:44:39.040
And I would invite you to-- if
you have any other questions be it

03:44:39.040 --> 03:44:43.710
to the NLSD or anyone else,
anything that you want to know,

03:44:43.710 --> 03:44:45.590
any burning questions
that you really need

03:44:45.590 --> 03:44:49.650
to get off your chest,
now is the opportunity.

03:44:49.650 --> 03:44:55.680
And so, we have an interpreter to
copy sign the questions on stage.

03:45:06.170 --> 03:45:10.970
&gt;&gt; Well, I actually wanted
to acknowledge Wesley Arey.

03:45:16.160 --> 03:45:18.460
&gt;&gt; Sit down.

03:45:21.030 --> 03:45:22.690
&gt;&gt; I would like to
acknowledge his work

03:45:22.690 --> 03:45:28.060
because I think it's been my
dream to have a story told

03:45:28.060 --> 03:45:32.870
about the journey that took
place, the voyage from France

03:45:32.870 --> 03:45:36.130
to America loud and
clear, Thomas Gallaudet.

03:45:36.130 --> 03:45:38.680
The exchange of culture, language,

03:45:38.680 --> 03:45:41.120
all those important
things that took place.

03:45:41.120 --> 03:45:47.560
And I'm really looking for someone
who can write some of those stories

03:45:47.560 --> 03:45:51.840
and disseminate that,
because ultimately,

03:45:51.840 --> 03:45:54.450
I think that it would be ideal
to make a movie from that.

03:45:54.450 --> 03:45:59.430
So, for your great work Wesley,
I would like to thank you.

03:45:59.430 --> 03:46:00.730
&gt;&gt; Wesley Arey: Right.

03:46:00.730 --> 03:46:04.890
I think that that's a great
idea, potentially filming a movie

03:46:04.890 --> 03:46:06.540
to preserve deaf history.

03:46:06.540 --> 03:46:10.820
And so, there's the beginning
of an idea right there.

03:46:10.820 --> 03:46:13.050
Any other questions?

03:46:13.050 --> 03:46:17.410
No? Any burning questions you
want to get off your chest?

03:46:17.410 --> 03:46:18.710
Yes.

03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:25.550
&gt;&gt; I work at an academic library
here in DC and we don't have a lot

03:46:25.550 --> 03:46:29.890
of deaf students [inaudible]
deaf students in DC tend--

03:46:29.890 --> 03:46:34.250
they tend to go to Gallaudet
but, I wonder if there's--

03:46:34.250 --> 03:46:37.850
if you have ideas for how we
can help with the preservation

03:46:37.850 --> 03:46:43.130
of deaf culture in a community
where-- that's mostly hearing.

03:46:49.600 --> 03:46:53.450
&gt;&gt; Wesley Arey: I think that
that's a great question for Noah.

03:46:58.060 --> 03:46:59.360
&gt;&gt; Noah Beckman: OK.

03:46:59.360 --> 03:47:02.530
I do think that that is a
great question and I work

03:47:02.530 --> 03:47:05.170
at Gallaudet University
as a librarian.

03:47:05.170 --> 03:47:12.490
And just as an example, we
celebrated women's history month.

03:47:12.490 --> 03:47:18.700
And so, we included the
aspect of deaf women.

03:47:18.700 --> 03:47:20.840
Next year, we're going to
plan on having an exhibit.

03:47:20.840 --> 03:47:24.370
We're going to have films by
deaf individuals and we're going

03:47:24.370 --> 03:47:27.050
to invite students to
come and watch that.

03:47:27.050 --> 03:47:31.410
In terms of service, I think

03:47:31.410 --> 03:47:35.160
that things are mostly
communication related.

03:47:35.160 --> 03:47:37.230
You need someone who is
comfortable communicating

03:47:37.230 --> 03:47:40.420
with the deaf community.

03:47:40.420 --> 03:47:42.340
And for deaf students,

03:47:42.340 --> 03:47:44.850
their research is not
always specifically related

03:47:44.850 --> 03:47:49.630
to deaf culture, any
academic field of study,

03:47:49.630 --> 03:47:55.910
any service like that would also
be a benefit to the deaf community.

03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:59.240
So, the cultural awareness
aspect, the identity,

03:47:59.240 --> 03:48:01.890
there are some things
that you can try.

03:48:01.890 --> 03:48:03.980
But even at Gallaudet,
we're still kind

03:48:03.980 --> 03:48:06.080
of working our way
through those waters.

03:48:06.080 --> 03:48:08.490
And I think that that's the
best answer that I can give you

03:48:08.490 --> 03:48:13.110
for now is to really focus on the
accessibility communication aspect.

03:48:13.110 --> 03:48:15.380
&gt;&gt; Wesley Arey: And if you're
talking about program activities

03:48:15.380 --> 03:48:20.040
for the library, perhaps you can
reach out to Noah or someone else

03:48:20.040 --> 03:48:23.430
who works in the library
for more specific ideas.

03:48:27.570 --> 03:48:34.350
&gt;&gt; They already have a school
in DC that works specifically

03:48:34.350 --> 03:48:40.610
with DC public libraries,
Janice, get in touch with her.

03:48:40.610 --> 03:48:45.000
It's DC public schools
and that's affiliated

03:48:45.000 --> 03:48:49.450
with the deaf library services so
that can be an in as well for you.

03:48:49.450 --> 03:48:52.610
&gt;&gt; Wesley Arey: And you work in DC?

03:48:52.610 --> 03:49:03.170
&gt;&gt; I work at George-- at GW
University, at the library there.

03:49:03.170 --> 03:49:04.470
&gt;&gt; Wesley Arey: OK.

03:49:04.470 --> 03:49:11.030
&gt;&gt; I have an idea, GW is very
close, why not invite lecturers

03:49:11.030 --> 03:49:18.710
from Gallaudet University or the
library itself to come and sign

03:49:18.710 --> 03:49:27.720
and lecture or a panel
or a group discussion.

03:49:27.720 --> 03:49:33.620
That's it.

03:49:33.620 --> 03:49:34.950
&gt;&gt; Wesley Arey: The power
of networking, right?

03:49:34.950 --> 03:49:39.050 position:56%
Are there any other final questions?

03:49:39.050 --> 03:49:40.350
Maybe one more?

03:49:40.350 --> 03:49:45.250
OK. Seeing none, I want
to thank you for coming.

03:49:45.250 --> 03:49:47.080
I want to thank you
for your attention.

03:49:47.080 --> 03:49:51.610
We have Travis up to make
a final presentation.

03:50:12.880 --> 03:50:14.180
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: Hello everyone,

03:50:14.180 --> 03:50:16.280
this will be the last
presentation today.

03:50:16.280 --> 03:50:18.350
And today, I'm going to talk

03:50:18.350 --> 03:50:23.000
about bridging culture
with the library here.

03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:30.410
So, how do we bridge culture?

03:50:30.410 --> 03:50:31.710
Internships.

03:50:31.710 --> 03:50:35.250 position:56%
So, here at the Library of Congress,

03:50:35.250 --> 03:50:37.810
we have different kind
of internships.

03:50:44.340 --> 03:50:47.450 position:56%
So, if you look at the employment
climate right now, and you see a lot

03:50:47.450 --> 03:50:50.940
of competition but
you'll also notice

03:50:50.940 --> 03:50:53.860
that employers really
desire experience.

03:50:53.860 --> 03:51:01.000
But, if you've never had a job,
how will you get experience?

03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:04.230
So, there's this paradox of trying
to figure out how to make this work

03:51:04.230 --> 03:51:07.160
and we've done that by
creating internships.

03:51:14.290 --> 03:51:17.540
So, it seems, once
people graduate college,

03:51:17.540 --> 03:51:22.980 position:56%
they're ready to start a career and
get on with their life but they kind

03:51:22.980 --> 03:51:27.020
of have to take a few steps back
to take an internship in order

03:51:27.020 --> 03:51:29.320
to develop their work skills.

03:51:32.730 --> 03:51:36.920
So here at the Library of
Congress, in the year 2000,

03:51:36.920 --> 03:51:43.800
we developed a program, MIP,
the Model Internship Program.

03:51:43.800 --> 03:51:51.470
That consisted of 17
deaf students from MSSD.

03:51:51.470 --> 03:52:01.590
And all together, their work
hours ended up being about 4500.

03:52:07.470 --> 03:52:10.450
So-- And that was within one year.

03:52:10.450 --> 03:52:12.940
So, in that one year, they were
able to contribute to the goals

03:52:12.940 --> 03:52:16.570
of the library through
their internships.

03:52:16.570 --> 03:52:17.960
And they worked in
different divisions,

03:52:17.960 --> 03:52:21.530
they worked in Germanic
and Slavic [inaudible].

03:52:21.530 --> 03:52:23.760
They worked in copyright as well.

03:52:23.760 --> 03:52:25.530
And so, they got to
have an experience

03:52:25.530 --> 03:52:29.870
in all these different
divisions within the library.

03:52:31.000 --> 03:52:34.510
And also, there's a nice
quote at the bottom.

03:52:46.550 --> 03:52:51.120
So, that was our experience
with internships in the past.

03:52:51.120 --> 03:52:55.450
And right now, we actually have
developed a new internship program

03:52:55.450 --> 03:52:58.560
within ISP, which is the
Interpreting Services Program here

03:52:58.560 --> 03:52:59.860
at the library.

03:52:59.860 --> 03:53:02.200
So, what we have done
is we have taken

03:53:02.200 --> 03:53:06.200
in one student, her
name is Mekaella.

03:53:06.200 --> 03:53:08.600
And if you listen to
the voice right now,

03:53:08.600 --> 03:53:12.770
that is actually Mekaella
interpreting for me.

03:53:12.770 --> 03:53:14.540
And she's our intern.

03:53:14.540 --> 03:53:18.960
And she's actually
the first ISP intern

03:53:18.960 --> 03:53:21.350
that we've had here at the library.

03:53:21.350 --> 03:53:25.940 position:56%
So, we're kind of developing a pilot
to see if it's going to work out.

03:53:25.940 --> 03:53:31.710
And then, we also have deaf interns
and so, we're seeing how that works

03:53:31.710 --> 03:53:34.810
as far as having internship
experience with people

03:53:34.810 --> 03:53:37.850
who have disabilities and
internship experience with those

03:53:37.850 --> 03:53:40.040
who work in the deaf community.

03:53:40.040 --> 03:53:49.340 position:56%
So, from Gallaudet, we just recently
had an intern named Swanhilda

03:53:49.340 --> 03:53:53.150
and her internship
consisted of a few things.

03:53:53.150 --> 03:53:59.100
It consisted of researching
and looking into deaf culture,

03:53:59.100 --> 03:54:01.520
using library resources
and equipment

03:54:01.520 --> 03:54:08.330
to really find the library's
resources that are available.

03:54:08.330 --> 03:54:11.110
And then, she developed
a presentation.

03:54:11.110 --> 03:54:15.570
At her presentation, there were
about 50 people in attendance.

03:54:16.980 --> 03:54:21.510
She's from a seventh
generation deaf family.

03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:25.850
So, really, the work that she
produced was very deeply analyzed.

03:54:28.280 --> 03:54:33.250
The next slide I'm going to show a
short three-minute clip of a video

03:54:33.250 --> 03:54:36.790
that summarizes her time
here at the library.

&gt;&gt; Swanhilda Lily: [Background
Music] I'm doing my internship

03:54:55.940 --> 03:55:00.440
at the office of inclusiveness
and compliance which focuses

03:55:00.440 --> 03:55:04.550
on accommodations for disability
access, such as interpreters

03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:08.280
for deaf people or
services for blind patrons.

03:55:11.110 --> 03:55:15.120
I'm doing two separate internships,
one for my ASL major and the other

03:55:15.120 --> 03:55:16.580
for my deaf studies major.

03:55:16.580 --> 03:55:20.220
I teach two ASL classes for
the Library of Congress staff

03:55:20.220 --> 03:55:22.810
who have deaf work colleagues.

03:55:22.810 --> 03:55:25.990
For the deaf studies major, I
research about deaf culture,

03:55:25.990 --> 03:55:29.940
deaf history, folk life
and other similar topics.

03:55:29.940 --> 03:55:33.820
We have a research shelf here so if
I want to request specific books,

03:55:33.820 --> 03:55:36.510
they'll bring these in
for me to do my research.

03:55:41.650 --> 03:55:43.710

picked an in-depth topic

03:55:43.710 --> 03:55:48.420 position:56%
for her research using the materials
and resources here in the library.

03:55:48.420 --> 03:55:52.740 position:56%
She developed her research and then
did her presentation, which was open

03:55:52.740 --> 03:55:56.210
to the public for the
library's employees.

03:55:56.210 --> 03:55:58.510
It was well received.

03:56:02.340 --> 03:56:03.770
&gt;&gt; Swanhilda Lily:
Internships are important

03:56:03.770 --> 03:56:07.720
because they allow you the
opportunity to learn, make mistakes

03:56:07.720 --> 03:56:11.510
and to grow your experience
before you enter the workforce.

03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:15.230
[ Music ]

03:56:15.230 --> 03:56:19.180
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: The internship
is a perfect match for the library

03:56:19.180 --> 03:56:21.640
because of our focus on education.

03:56:21.640 --> 03:56:24.740
Interns observe the work
environment and they learn

03:56:24.740 --> 03:56:29.080
about various service units, their
roles and how the library runs

03:56:29.080 --> 03:56:31.680
as a cohesive institution.

03:56:33.770 --> 03:56:37.530
Even just showing up for work,
they learn about being on time,

03:56:37.530 --> 03:56:40.020
about time management
and interacting

03:56:40.020 --> 03:56:42.400
and learning from professionals.

03:56:42.400 --> 03:56:45.110
Also, they learn about the
importance of communicating

03:56:45.110 --> 03:56:48.510
with their supervisors
and other administrators.

&gt;&gt; Swanhilda Lily: After I graduate,
I'd like to pursue a masters degree

03:56:55.140 --> 03:56:58.600
in sign language teaching
at Gallaudet University,

03:56:58.600 --> 03:57:01.160
known for having the best
program in the country.

03:57:01.160 --> 03:57:02.840 position:56%
I'll learn about linguistics and how

03:57:02.840 --> 03:57:05.510
to analyze the language
in order to teach it.

03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:09.060
[ Music ]

03:57:09.060 --> 03:57:10.840
My internships here at the Library

03:57:10.840 --> 03:57:13.140
of Congress have helped
me understand the dynamics

03:57:13.140 --> 03:57:14.750
of working with hearing people.

03:57:14.750 --> 03:57:17.490
I've also learned more about the
deaf community in my research.

03:57:17.490 --> 03:57:20.040
So, these two internships
have been instrumental

03:57:20.040 --> 03:57:22.900
in increasing my overall
understanding, which will enable me

03:57:22.900 --> 03:57:25.510
to become a better
advocate and teacher.

03:57:25.510 --> 03:57:41.190
[ Music ]

03:57:41.190 --> 03:57:44.770
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: So Gallaudet
actually produced that video.

03:57:44.770 --> 03:57:47.690
They came and did all the
filming of Swanhilda and the work

03:57:47.690 --> 03:57:50.300
that she had done here
at the library.

03:57:51.430 --> 03:57:55.500
And one of her goals
here was to teach ASL.

03:57:55.500 --> 03:58:00.230
She had two classes with
about 15 students in each one.

03:58:00.230 --> 03:58:06.320
And so, on the lunch break
that the employees have,

03:58:06.320 --> 03:58:09.280
they would go to class
and actually learn ASL.

03:58:09.280 --> 03:58:13.890
So, the employees here at the
library are really motivated

03:58:13.890 --> 03:58:16.980
and interested to pick up
the language and get involved

03:58:16.980 --> 03:58:18.280
and learn that communication.

03:58:18.280 --> 03:58:24.500
Here at the library, there are
about 20 deaf staff members

03:58:24.500 --> 03:58:26.790
and that provides a
lot of opportunity

03:58:26.790 --> 03:58:29.620
for interns that are placed here.

03:58:38.090 --> 03:58:41.250
So, one of the benefits of
having an intern here is

03:58:41.250 --> 03:58:44.530
that they have mentors,
such as a language mentor

03:58:44.530 --> 03:58:48.170
and it helps them learn
how to go from--

03:58:48.170 --> 03:58:54.960
it helps them understand
bibliographic and monographs

03:58:54.960 --> 03:58:58.210
and all these big technical words
that we use here at the library

03:58:58.210 --> 03:59:01.830
and to understand the
technical signs that are here.

03:59:01.830 --> 03:59:04.830
And a lot of the times, the deaf
staff are actually teaching the

03:59:04.830 --> 03:59:07.230
interpreters the signs
that we use, so,

03:59:07.230 --> 03:59:10.800
that also benefits
the interns as well.

03:59:12.090 --> 03:59:18.670
Another lesson that interns learn
here is how to be a self advocate.

03:59:18.670 --> 03:59:24.000
To have a deaf model, someone to
look up to, so that when they go

03:59:24.000 --> 03:59:28.510
out into the world, they know how
to figure out how to be successful.

03:59:28.510 --> 03:59:34.270
I'm just going to back up a little
here, and here at the library,

03:59:34.270 --> 03:59:39.080
there's two different programs
and they can somewhat coincide.

03:59:39.080 --> 03:59:44.460
So, the first program
is like an internship.

03:59:44.460 --> 03:59:47.520
And that is the work
experience program.

03:59:51.890 --> 03:59:55.580
So, I talked about how to be
successful as a professional

03:59:55.580 --> 03:59:59.800
and that comes with the
WEP and then the SPP,

03:59:59.800 --> 04:00:04.310
which is the Selective
Placement Program.

04:00:04.310 --> 04:00:07.040
That works in a somewhat
different way.

04:00:07.040 --> 04:00:11.530
For example, if you have submitted
an application with a letter--

04:00:11.530 --> 04:00:15.580
a schedule A to prove that
you have a disability,

04:00:15.580 --> 04:00:18.460
the library also has a list.

04:00:18.460 --> 04:00:25.230
So, it's easier to be placed
in an available position

04:00:25.230 --> 04:00:29.180
when there's a list and a resume
that coincide with one another

04:00:29.180 --> 04:00:34.460
and we can somewhat fast-track
your hiring here at the library.

04:00:37.270 --> 04:00:42.130
So, if the SPP wants
to hire someone,

04:00:42.130 --> 04:00:45.010
they're going to look
at the WEP program.

04:00:45.010 --> 04:00:47.850
They're going to look at
interns who have experience here.

04:00:47.850 --> 04:00:50.220
The manager is already familiar
with their work performance

04:00:50.220 --> 04:00:55.040
and they're going to know that
they're capable of doing the job.

04:00:55.040 --> 04:00:59.570
So then, the internship becomes
a position and they transfer

04:00:59.570 --> 04:01:01.870
into a fulltime employee.

04:01:06.530 --> 04:01:09.220
So, these are two--
this is a picture of two

04:01:09.220 --> 04:01:11.760
of our current employees
here at the library.

04:01:11.760 --> 04:01:18.350
And this is an example of
two people who were first WEP

04:01:18.350 --> 04:01:23.550
and then became permanent employees
at the library through the SPP.

04:01:30.170 --> 04:01:37.540 position:56%
Typically, you see that the managers
in a work environment are hearing.

04:01:37.540 --> 04:01:42.490
And they have an understanding
somewhat of what deafness means.

04:01:42.490 --> 04:01:47.250
But they don't really
know how to apply that.

04:01:47.250 --> 04:01:51.310
So, when they have an intern come
in who's deaf, they're just kind

04:01:51.310 --> 04:01:54.360
of shocked in understanding that,
oh wow, they actually can do

04:01:54.360 --> 04:01:55.950
that or they can do this.

04:01:55.950 --> 04:01:58.710
And so, oh, you know, sometimes,
you get questions like, oh,

04:01:58.710 --> 04:02:01.260
deaf people can drive
and things like that.

04:02:01.260 --> 04:02:05.610
And so, this is a very
up-front way for them to see

04:02:05.610 --> 04:02:08.090
that deaf people are
able to communicate.

04:02:08.090 --> 04:02:12.360
They can type, they can do
tactile, they can make video calls.

04:02:12.360 --> 04:02:14.320
They have all of these
solutions to problems

04:02:14.320 --> 04:02:18.960
that hearing people may
perceive as troublesome.

04:02:24.870 --> 04:02:26.940
So, the best way to
learn about culture is

04:02:26.940 --> 04:02:30.650
to be social within that culture.

04:02:32.480 --> 04:02:38.630
Now, before you all leave, I
actually want to introduce you

04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:43.020
to the interns, one, the one
that's voicing right now,

04:02:43.020 --> 04:02:47.400
and then the other intern that
we have here from Gallaudet.

04:02:47.400 --> 04:02:50.450
So, if you both don't
mind, if you could come up.

04:03:02.030 --> 04:03:03.450
&gt;&gt; And for those of you
listening to the English,

04:03:03.450 --> 04:03:04.890
we'll have a switch in voices here.

04:03:04.890 --> 04:03:09.110
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: And I'll let
the interns introduce themselves.

04:03:09.110 --> 04:03:10.430
&gt;&gt; Jessica: Hi, I'm
Jessica [assumed spelling],

04:03:10.430 --> 04:03:12.890
a current Gallaudet
student who's interning here

04:03:12.890 --> 04:03:15.920
at the Library of Congress.

04:03:15.920 --> 04:03:17.550
&gt;&gt; Mekaella: And my
name is Mekaella.

04:03:17.550 --> 04:03:26.590
I am the interpreter intern here
from Eastern Kentucky University.

04:03:26.590 --> 04:03:32.140
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: Would you
mind talking about your major,

04:03:32.140 --> 04:03:34.870 position:56%
your graduation plans and how you've
been using your experience here

04:03:34.870 --> 04:03:39.420
at the library to achieve the goals
that you have for your futures?

04:03:40.540 --> 04:03:43.400
&gt;&gt; Jessica: My major is
international studies.

04:03:43.400 --> 04:03:46.840
I have a friend who actually
works at the Library of Congress

04:03:46.840 --> 04:03:49.650
who recommended that I come
here for the internship.

04:03:49.650 --> 04:03:51.310
And I was very fortunate.

04:03:51.310 --> 04:03:55.480
I do know French and English.

04:03:55.480 --> 04:04:02.160 position:56%
So, coming from the African-American
department, I have some experience--

04:04:02.160 --> 04:04:05.000
but because I wasn't familiar
with Library of Congress,

04:04:05.000 --> 04:04:07.570
I had someone here who
was able to help guide me

04:04:07.570 --> 04:04:10.760
through that learning curve.

04:04:10.760 --> 04:04:18.830
And I immediately felt comfortable
because of that relationship.

04:04:18.830 --> 04:04:22.330
I wasn't expecting that they would
be so accommodating when it came

04:04:22.330 --> 04:04:25.240
to interpreters and other
things that I may need in order

04:04:25.240 --> 04:04:27.940
to successfully go
about my internship.

04:04:27.940 --> 04:04:30.700
It really helped me feel
more comfortable as an intern

04:04:30.700 --> 04:04:33.200
and ultimately, it
was very empowering.

04:04:36.850 --> 04:04:39.820
I learned a lot and
I'm learning a lot.

04:04:39.820 --> 04:04:44.640 position:56%
For example, if someone asks me to
refer to a particular research item,

04:04:44.640 --> 04:04:47.360
I can go through the
Library of Congress,

04:04:47.360 --> 04:04:49.910
find whatever it is that's needed.

04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:53.100
So, I highly recommend an
internship experience here

04:04:53.100 --> 04:04:56.050
at the Library of Congress.

04:04:56.050 --> 04:05:02.270
&gt;&gt; Mekaella: I'm a double major
at-- in school, in deaf studies

04:05:02.270 --> 04:05:05.490
and interpreting, in the
interpreting training program.

04:05:05.490 --> 04:05:08.920
I also have a minor
in political science.

04:05:08.920 --> 04:05:11.280
When I started here
at this internship,

04:05:11.280 --> 04:05:13.820
I really got involved in a lot.

04:05:13.820 --> 04:05:18.940
I've planned three events that
have focused on deaf culture.

04:05:18.940 --> 04:05:21.970
The first one has been about
the technological influence

04:05:21.970 --> 04:05:23.990
in the deaf world.

04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:28.170
So, looking at TTY's or video
phones, cochlear implants

04:05:28.170 --> 04:05:32.730
and hearing aids and how those
things have influenced deaf culture

04:05:32.730 --> 04:05:35.740
and ASL or deaf language.

04:05:35.740 --> 04:05:42.560
I've also looked at
De'VIA, which is deaf art.

04:05:42.560 --> 04:05:46.760
And that is art that's made by
deaf people or that is influenced

04:05:46.760 --> 04:05:49.040
by deaf culture in some way.

04:05:49.040 --> 04:05:54.550
A third event, which will actually
be taking place next Tuesday is

04:05:54.550 --> 04:05:59.470
going to be talking about
how to preserve deaf culture.

04:05:59.470 --> 04:06:04.410
If you remember in
the past, you know,

04:06:04.410 --> 04:06:07.510
that its had his famous
video reminding people

04:06:07.510 --> 04:06:09.440
that education was
going to be important

04:06:09.440 --> 04:06:11.830
for the success of
the deaf community.

04:06:11.830 --> 04:06:16.010 position:56%
Unfortunately, we have seen a lot
of deaf schools shutting their doors

04:06:16.010 --> 04:06:19.670
and deaf studies-- deaf
clubs can seize to exist.

04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:21.840
So, we're going to have
an interesting discussion

04:06:21.840 --> 04:06:25.710
on which ways we can continue

04:06:25.710 --> 04:06:28.520
to preserve the deaf
culture here in America.

04:06:28.520 --> 04:06:31.830
My fourth event is also related to
culture, but it's actually related

04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:35.670
to my own heritage
as a Samoan American.

04:06:35.670 --> 04:06:41.110
So, we'll be talking about
Samoan culture and all four

04:06:41.110 --> 04:06:45.630
of these events have been part
of my internship assignments

04:06:45.630 --> 04:06:50.200
that have required research
through the library's resources,

04:06:50.200 --> 04:06:54.820
but also interacting with folks
who have first-hand experience

04:06:54.820 --> 04:06:57.150
in the topics that
we've been studying.

04:06:57.150 --> 04:07:01.010
So, I'm very happy to have-- I had
mentorship opportunities with some

04:07:01.010 --> 04:07:04.470
of the interns here at the library.

04:07:04.470 --> 04:07:09.350
To have a critical eye on my
work and to get into experiences

04:07:09.350 --> 04:07:14.650
that I wouldn't otherwise had which
has really improved my confidence

04:07:14.650 --> 04:07:18.120
and my ability not just
in my interpreting skills

04:07:18.120 --> 04:07:22.200
but in my social skills with the
consumers with whom I worked, so.

04:07:22.200 --> 04:07:27.710
Yeah, I guess that was
a lot but that's it.

04:07:27.710 --> 04:07:29.010
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: All right.

04:07:29.010 --> 04:07:33.010 position:56%
Thank you very much and thank you
to everyone here for your attention.

04:07:35.040 --> 04:07:37.650
A question from the audience?

04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:50.490
&gt;&gt; I actually have
three questions here.

04:07:50.490 --> 04:07:53.240
For the first-- Well,
for the first comment,

04:07:53.240 --> 04:07:57.510
I really appreciate
Travis making combinations

04:07:57.510 --> 04:08:00.490
for deaf-blind interpreter here.

04:08:00.490 --> 04:08:03.580
I greatly appreciate that and I
really would like to thank you

04:08:03.580 --> 04:08:05.650
from the bottom of my heart.

04:08:05.650 --> 04:08:09.970
As an individual who has done
a great deal of volunteer work,

04:08:09.970 --> 04:08:14.810
unpaid, I have a great love
for the deaf-blind community.

04:08:14.810 --> 04:08:18.800
It can be sort of a
dark work, if you will.

04:08:18.800 --> 04:08:24.570
The next comment I like to make
is that I've noticed the luck is

04:08:24.570 --> 04:08:28.880
in the Library of Congress,
you know,

04:08:28.880 --> 04:08:32.720
when it comes to deaf-blind I just
like to make a quick statement.

04:08:32.720 --> 04:08:40.340
I wen to Cleveland where they had a
library for the blind and a friend

04:08:40.340 --> 04:08:44.000
of mine named Art [assumed
spelling] was--

04:08:44.000 --> 04:08:48.900
&gt;&gt; Was there and was
shocked by their resources.

04:08:48.900 --> 04:08:52.170
&gt;&gt; Was there and was floored
by the resources available.

04:08:52.170 --> 04:08:55.510
The number of recordings
and tapes, for example.

04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:58.390
And now, to come here today,

04:08:59.450 --> 04:09:04.460
the idea of having braille
is something mentioned here.

04:09:04.460 --> 04:09:10.720
I know that DC has two separate
buildings, one is the Library

04:09:10.720 --> 04:09:14.080
of Congress and the other
is Library for the Blind.

04:09:14.080 --> 04:09:17.320
So, I'm wondering if there is
someone else who can be connected

04:09:17.320 --> 04:09:20.040
on behalf of the Library
of Congress.

04:09:20.040 --> 04:09:29.350
I know that deaf-blind individuals
are in the cultural group of deaf,

04:09:29.350 --> 04:09:31.330
in general, so I think,
it would be nice

04:09:31.330 --> 04:09:35.090
to have an internship opportunity
that would include members

04:09:35.090 --> 04:09:42.380
of the community who
might be deaf-blind.

04:09:42.380 --> 04:09:47.300
Once I transfer from my former
school to Gallaudet University,

04:09:47.300 --> 04:09:51.580
I felt like it was a life-changing
experience to be in a community

04:09:51.580 --> 04:09:53.810
where I can communicate on my own.

04:09:53.810 --> 04:09:59.340 position:56%
When I went back to Ohio to
explain the advocacy for individuals

04:09:59.340 --> 04:10:00.760
who might be deaf-blind,

04:10:00.760 --> 04:10:03.200
it seem like it wasn't received
as well as I would like.

04:10:03.200 --> 04:10:06.060
So, that's why I'm putting
that out there to you.

04:10:06.060 --> 04:10:13.370
And lastly, I like to mention,
I've been to Jamaica and I've been

04:10:13.370 --> 04:10:17.900
to Africa twice and
at the embassy there,

04:10:17.900 --> 04:10:22.800
they said that they actually
have a library for those coming

04:10:22.800 --> 04:10:24.680
from international places.

04:10:24.680 --> 04:10:26.630
And I was also floored by that.

04:10:26.630 --> 04:10:30.270
So, something that I'm impressed
with is the fact that America feels

04:10:30.270 --> 04:10:34.130
that it is important to have a
library, to educate individuals

04:10:34.130 --> 04:10:42.260
and have materials
available for them to read.

04:10:42.260 --> 04:10:45.430
And, you know, there is this
woman in mind, a deaf woman,

04:10:45.430 --> 04:10:48.650
who knows all things
related to the library.

04:10:48.650 --> 04:10:51.470
So, I was wondering if it would
be possible for you to correspond

04:10:51.470 --> 04:10:53.820
with other countries because I know

04:10:53.820 --> 04:10:57.000
that Gallaudet University
is recognized

04:10:57.000 --> 04:11:01.340
as a fairly funded
university in Washington DC,

04:11:01.340 --> 04:11:04.550
so I guess my question to you is
that do you have relationships

04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:08.270
with other countries in which you
can educate about deaf culture

04:11:08.270 --> 04:11:11.340
and also about deaf-blind?

04:11:11.340 --> 04:11:15.210
And the reason I say that
is because I've noticed

04:11:15.210 --> 04:11:19.700
in those international countries,
often, there is no education on how

04:11:19.700 --> 04:11:22.060
to serve community members
that may be deaf-blind.

04:11:22.060 --> 04:11:25.020
So, with that, I'd
like to say thank you.

04:11:26.800 --> 04:11:28.100
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: All right.

04:11:28.100 --> 04:11:31.280
That's great, yeah, we are
always open to many opportunities

04:11:31.280 --> 04:11:37.420
to learn things and to be exposed
to new situations from employees.

04:11:37.420 --> 04:11:42.540
You are correct that Taylor
Street is the location of that--

04:11:42.540 --> 04:11:45.620
the library, it's called,
Library for the Blind

04:11:45.620 --> 04:11:48.810
and Physically Handicapped
and what is it?

04:11:48.810 --> 04:11:50.110
NL--

04:11:50.110 --> 04:11:51.670
&gt;&gt; NLS.

04:11:51.670 --> 04:11:54.530
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: -- NLS,
yeah, thank you very much

04:11:54.530 --> 04:11:58.140
for that, from the audience.

04:11:58.140 --> 04:12:04.270
So, that is typically, the place
that blind patrons would go

04:12:04.270 --> 04:12:07.160
for resources and there are
no deaf employees there.

04:12:07.160 --> 04:12:10.270
We do have a blind intern
here at this location.

04:12:10.270 --> 04:12:13.980
He works in the IT department.

04:12:13.980 --> 04:12:19.290
And there's also a deaf person who
works in the IT division as well.

04:12:19.290 --> 04:12:20.950
So, to see the interactions

04:12:20.950 --> 04:12:24.510
that those two people have
had has been interesting.

04:12:24.510 --> 04:12:29.420 position:56%
As far as I know, there have been no
deaf-blind people who have applied

04:12:29.420 --> 04:12:31.960
for internships here at
the Library of Congress.

04:12:31.960 --> 04:12:35.950
If you have the any
further information or would

04:12:35.950 --> 04:12:39.300
like to refer anyone my way, I
would certainly be happy to see

04:12:39.300 --> 04:12:44.160
that program improved by the
inclusion of deaf-blind people.

04:12:44.160 --> 04:12:48.590
&gt;&gt; Hi, this is Dan again.

04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:51.570
I think I might refer you to Art.

04:12:51.570 --> 04:12:57.080
Art actually lives in DC and he's
someone who's more knowledgeable

04:12:57.080 --> 04:12:59.670
when it comes to the
deaf-blind community.

04:13:02.160 --> 04:13:03.600
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: All right.

04:13:03.600 --> 04:13:06.290
Well, please take down my e-mail
address which is listed here

04:13:06.290 --> 04:13:08.750
on the slide and be in contact.

04:13:12.220 --> 04:13:15.610
I wasn't sure that I was
supposed to have an open question

04:13:15.610 --> 04:13:20.450
and answer period but if that's
what the audience would have for--

04:13:20.450 --> 04:13:24.890
I'm also available after
the workshop is over.

04:13:24.890 --> 04:13:28.080
If you'd like to come up to me
personally and have a conversation

04:13:28.080 --> 04:13:30.510
about the opportunities here.

04:13:30.510 --> 04:13:35.510
So, I think I will turn it back
to John Cole to close us out.

04:13:35.510 --> 04:13:41.920
[ Applause ]

04:13:41.920 --> 04:13:45.380
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, all I can
say is thank you to the audience

04:13:45.380 --> 04:13:50.800 position:56%
and for everyone who has planned
this and participated in this today.

04:13:50.800 --> 04:13:56.940 position:56%
At the beginning of the day, I told
you it would be a varied informative

04:13:56.940 --> 04:14:01.710
but also informal day where
we would cut across some

04:14:01.710 --> 04:14:05.140
of the usual specialties
that are presented.

04:14:05.140 --> 04:14:11.410
And also have a chance for a
discussion and a sharing of ideas.

04:14:11.410 --> 04:14:16.560
And one of the reasons that we
are pleased to record this is

04:14:16.560 --> 04:14:21.940
to keep track of the ideas and
of the people in a friendly way

04:14:21.940 --> 04:14:25.000
so we can get back to you
to take advantage of some

04:14:25.000 --> 04:14:30.630
of the wonderful thoughts and
ideas that have come forth today.

04:14:30.630 --> 04:14:34.530
This, as I said in
the past, has been a--

04:14:34.530 --> 04:14:39.640
an annual event, really not even
quite annual, of between the center

04:14:39.640 --> 04:14:44.230
for the book, which is the outreach
part of the Library of Congress

04:14:44.230 --> 04:14:49.070
which itself reaches out to NLS,
the National Library for the Blind

04:14:49.070 --> 04:14:50.810
and Physically Handicapped.

04:14:50.810 --> 04:14:54.800
And this is a way that we are
determined to continue to reach

04:14:54.800 --> 04:14:56.760
out to the deaf community.

04:14:56.760 --> 04:14:59.710
And who knows, maybe even
the center, the book can help

04:14:59.710 --> 04:15:04.070
in an informal way in
bringing these groups together.

04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:09.090
That's what the Library of Congress
does it is an open institution

04:15:09.090 --> 04:15:12.540
funded by the American
tax payer supported

04:15:12.540 --> 04:15:15.410
by our country our government.

04:15:15.410 --> 04:15:19.480
And it's the right
thing that we want to do

04:15:19.480 --> 04:15:21.960
and you have helped us do it.

04:15:21.960 --> 04:15:25.550
I'm just very pleased today
that the meeting started

04:15:25.550 --> 04:15:28.560
with our acting librarian Mr. Mao.

04:15:28.560 --> 04:15:32.370
We had him visit even though I
reported to you on the person

04:15:32.370 --> 04:15:36.660
who has been nominated to
become the Librarian of Congress

04:15:36.660 --> 04:15:38.990
who is the form-- who
is the head currently

04:15:38.990 --> 04:15:41.330
of Enoch Pratt Free Library.

04:15:41.330 --> 04:15:44.810
She was quite interested in the
fact we were doing this today.

04:15:44.810 --> 04:15:46.580
She wasn't able to join us.

04:15:46.580 --> 04:15:52.260
She's not official yet but the
prospects, I think, are good.

04:15:52.260 --> 04:15:58.760
But most of all, I really like to
thank everyone from Alec, Alice,

04:15:58.760 --> 04:16:04.350
Ricardo, Travis our two
wonderful speakers, Myron Uhlberg

04:16:04.350 --> 04:16:09.370
and Harry Lang who brought a
perspective to what we're doing,

04:16:09.370 --> 04:16:13.960
historic perspective that
helps us for the future.

04:16:13.960 --> 04:16:19.390
And I'm a historian just of the
Library of Congress but I believe

04:16:19.390 --> 04:16:22.750
that we go forward in the future
with the Library of Congress

04:16:22.750 --> 04:16:25.920
with knowledge of our
history and that is saying,

04:16:25.920 --> 04:16:29.830
it is certainly is true for deaf
culture and some of the areas

04:16:29.830 --> 04:16:32.280
that we care about
deeply as the society.

04:16:32.280 --> 04:16:36.130
Unless we have the historical
perspective and the guidance

04:16:36.130 --> 04:16:39.910
from the past, we aren't
going to make the progress--

04:16:39.910 --> 04:16:43.710
the kind of progress that we
want to have in the future.

04:16:43.710 --> 04:16:47.600
So, I would like now to
thank the participants

04:16:47.600 --> 04:16:51.250
for not only your questions
but your close involvement

04:16:51.250 --> 04:16:54.610
for your different opinions
and your different ideas.

04:16:54.610 --> 04:16:58.930
And I can assure you that using
this platform in the future

04:16:58.930 --> 04:17:05.270 position:56%
that we will go ahead and explore
together and make progress together.

04:17:05.270 --> 04:17:07.840
And we will be continuing
to do things

04:17:07.840 --> 04:17:12.250
through the National Literary
Society of the deaf Alec

04:17:12.250 --> 04:17:17.880
and Ricardo, too and Alice
all that are involved in this.

04:17:17.880 --> 04:17:21.320
And I look forward to the
next time we can get together.

04:17:21.320 --> 04:17:23.650
I'd like to conclude
with a round of applause

04:17:23.650 --> 04:17:26.390
for our participants
and our sponsors.

04:17:26.390 --> 04:17:29.750
They've done a wonderful job
for bringing as all together.

04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:32.960
