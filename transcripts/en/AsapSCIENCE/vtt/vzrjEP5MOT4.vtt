00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
In a busy world, with unending work and responsibilities piling up,

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.700
stress can get to the best of us.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.000
But how bad is it for you really? Can stress actually kill you?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.500
From a biological perspective, stress makes perfect sense.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.000
If you're about to get chomped on by a bear, your stress hormones better kick your but into gear.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But it turns out that your mortgage, unemployment, and looming exam

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
all trigger the same stress response in your body.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and, unlike most animals,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which experience a major decrease in these hormones,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.800
humans cant seem to find the "off switch"!

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.500
Even though it's not life and death,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.800
our psychological blows consistently bathe our bodies in these hormones,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.200
making our heart pound, muscles tense, and stomach turn.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.100
In Japan, they have the term Karoshi, which literally translates to "death from overwork".

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.800
What is now deemed an overworking epidemic,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.000
these individuals who are seemingly healthy and in their prime, suddenly die.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
After being officially recognized and documented in Japan,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
these sudden heart attacks and strokes were quickly linked to stress.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.500
But, how does stress cause this?

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.800
Cortisol is one of the main stress hormones which helps divert energy to where you need it

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.300
and away from non essentials functions of the body.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.200
But with chronic stress exposure, problems arise.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.300
The immune system shuts down, inflammation is inhibited, white blood cells are reduced,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.600
and susceptibility to disease increases.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.800
Some evidence also suggests that prolong stress may be involved in the development of cancer.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.600
When looking at the arteries of macaque monkeys, those under significant stress have more clogged arteries.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.600
This prevents blood from getting to the heart quickly

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.600
during stress and can ultimately lead to heart attacks.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.200
The brain also takes a toll, when looking at mice exposed to stress,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.600
we see dramatically smaller brain cells with fewer branch extensions than normal mice.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.600
This is particularly prevalent in the areas associated with memory and learning.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.600
Which may stir up some memories for you of those wonderful all night study sessions;

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.600
the acute stress and sleep depravation can make it increasingly difficult to remember the things we want to.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.500
Perhaps the most telling story is in our DNA.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.100
We contain something called telomeres at the end of our chromosomes,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.000
which decrease in size with our age. Our video on "Aging", here, explains this process.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.300
Eventually, the telomeres run out, at which point the cell stops duplicating and dies.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.100
So, telomeres are directly related to aging and length of life.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.600
And it turns out, stress may actually accelerate the shortening of these telomeres.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.300
But not all hope is lost for the perpetually stressed.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.500
Another hormone, oxytocin, has been shown to reduce this stress response.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.400
It helps our blood vessels relax and even regenerates the heart from stress related damage.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.500
So, how do we get more oxytocin? It's sometimes dubbed the cuddle hormone,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.600
because it's released during positive social interactions and while caring for others.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.200
People who spend more time with others, create a buffer or resilience to stress.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.500
So when life gets the best of you, just remember, you dont have to go it alone.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.600
Spend some time with those you love - it may just save your life.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.300
