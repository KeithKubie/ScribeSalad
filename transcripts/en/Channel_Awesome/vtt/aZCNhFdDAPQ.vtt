00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.340
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.198
I remember it so you don't have to!

00:00:09.728 --> 00:00:12.320
Are you sick to death yet of CGI?

00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:15.034
Nobody would blame you, it's practically

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.519
impossible to see a movie that
doesn't have some form of CGI -

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.860
aka Computer Generated Imagery - in it.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.328
And it's not just movies! It's
in our commercials, our phones

00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:26.225
It's even in our breakfast cereals!

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.220
And the consensus from
people seems to be the same:

00:00:29.268 --> 00:00:34.540
"We're sick of it, it's everywhere.
We want a little bit more variety!"

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.928
So, how come it keeps popping
up all over the place?

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:39.780
And should we just flat-out put a stop to it?

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.740
Well, the first thing to
analyze is why people are

00:00:41.772 --> 00:00:43.900
getting annoyed by the
use of it to begin with.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.558
Because, before, people
couldn't get enough of it.

00:00:46.978 --> 00:00:49.720
When they saw it bring ground-breaking effects to life in

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.640
movies like "Jurassic Park" and
"Terminator 2", people were hypnotized.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.429
They never saw anything like it.
And even to this day,

00:00:56.454 --> 00:00:58.834
these effects still
hold up pretty well!

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.700
Part of that is because it was
the filmmakers' first time

00:01:01.716 --> 00:01:04.820
using it, and so they felt they
had a lot more to prove and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.360
mix the effects with a
lot of other elements.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.500
For example, there's motion
capture after motion capture

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.860
after motion capture of
Robert Patrick as the T-1000.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.700
Which would most likely would be
filmed in just one shot today

00:01:16.727 --> 00:01:19.200
just to get an idea of
the lighting and movement.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.061
On top of that, not every effect
was CGI. Any time the T-1000 was injured,

00:01:24.086 --> 00:01:26.500
it was always a practical effect

00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:29.900
on the set. Yeah, that's an
animatronic right there.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.480
Pretty damn impressive, huh? The
same thing with Jurassic Park.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.275
The dinosaurs, half the time, were CGI.
But the other

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.760
half were life size robots
that were right there

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.120
in front of the actors.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.608
Like many effects in the past,
this worked effectively

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:44.960
because they were constantly
using different methods

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.782
to fool the eye. The more
variation you use, the more

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:50.760
difficult it'll be for the eye
to get used to the effect,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.360
and thus spot it.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.553
But then, somewhere down the
line, we got too fucking greedy.

00:01:56.576 --> 00:01:59.681
And, I guess really, it's no big surprise.
You could suddenly

00:01:59.706 --> 00:02:02.435
see things and do things you
couldn't have done before.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.149
You could get shots or
perform stunts that still

00:02:05.174 --> 00:02:07.780
look cool, but didn't
have to endanger anybody

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.780
and it was usually at half the cost.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.749
But, because it was used so often,

00:02:11.774 --> 00:02:14.607
we naturally trained our
eyes to spot it easier.

00:02:14.892 --> 00:02:17.258
When we first saw
"Jurassic Park", we didn't know

00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:19.340
what was computer
and what was a robot.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.620
But now, because we've been so exposed
to it, it's a little easier to spot.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.963
And because computers work
in a way where you can

00:02:25.988 --> 00:02:28.560
just take an existing
program and add onto it,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.560
less time is needed to create a
creature from the ground up.

00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:33.997
You can't just take
something like a ninja turtle

00:02:34.022 --> 00:02:36.000
and build a Jabba
the Hutt out of it.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.878
However with computers, the lighting
and movement of a dinosaur can now be

00:02:39.903 --> 00:02:43.624
reproduced in a totally different
monster in a totally different movie.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.520
The idea being if it worked in one film,
logically it should work in the next.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.420
But like I said before, people started
to catch on to these patterns.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.700
And they were becoming
more and more noticeable.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.180
When you look back on films
like "(Who Framed) Roger Rabbit", you

00:02:56.198 --> 00:02:58.524
ask yourself, "How did
they make those cartoons,

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.700
that were obviously drawn, still
somehow seemed three-dimensional?"

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.040
Well, that's because they did a
test shot for every take they did

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.900
to get an idea where the
lighting was going to be,

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.494
so they could see how the camera capture
it and reproduce it as best as they could.

00:03:11.985 --> 00:03:14.613
But here, we have programs
that can do the math for us

00:03:14.654 --> 00:03:16.459
and figure out where the lighting would be.

00:03:16.951 --> 00:03:20.212
But the reason this doesn't always fool
people is because in reality,

00:03:20.237 --> 00:03:24.786
light is not always going to fall where the
mathematical equation says it will.

00:03:25.034 --> 00:03:28.232
Whether it be the environment,
the camera angle, whatever

00:03:28.262 --> 00:03:30.214
there's always going to be
something a little different about

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.817
real life that a computer
is not going to catch.

00:03:33.043 --> 00:03:37.209
Why do I know that this Yoda was
really there and this Yoda wasn't?

00:03:37.618 --> 00:03:41.285
Because the one that was there had the
light hit it in it's own unique way

00:03:41.563 --> 00:03:45.007
because this Yoda is an illusion
in that he's an animated puppet.

00:03:45.143 --> 00:03:47.999
But this Yoda is not
only an animated puppet,

00:03:48.024 --> 00:03:50.941
but an animated puppet
that's not really there.

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.131
So now you have to deal with
two filters of reality -

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.840
two illusions going on at the same time.

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.123
And when there's two illusions
going on as opposed to one,

00:04:00.148 --> 00:04:03.381
that makes it a lot easier for
people to spot what's false.

00:04:03.754 --> 00:04:07.036
Now there are times where CG
can still look very realistic.

00:04:07.068 --> 00:04:11.353
I mean, my god, Gollum from "The Two
Towers" still looks fucking unbelievable.

00:04:11.508 --> 00:04:14.278
Once in a while he looked a little
phony, but for the most part,

00:04:14.303 --> 00:04:18.214
it looked and felt like he was
honest-to-god really there.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.727
And that's because - he was really there.
Andy Serkis who provided the voice

00:04:22.727 --> 00:04:26.877
also got dressed up in costume and
shot the scenes with the other actors.

00:04:26.877 --> 00:04:29.702
So not only did the animators
have on-set movement

00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:32.028
and on-set performances,
but they also had

00:04:32.053 --> 00:04:34.518
an on-set model that
they could capture the

00:04:34.543 --> 00:04:37.007
life from that was really
there in the scene.

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.775
And on top of that, the guy
that got to do the textures

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.560
for the skin wasn't a computer
guy, he was a make-up guy.

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.361
In fact, he was originally designing
a puppet/costume for Gollum.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.711
But, when they decided to do the
CG route, they taught him the program

00:04:50.736 --> 00:04:54.128
because they figured he
knew what texture should look like.

00:04:54.153 --> 00:04:56.109
And he did! And it looks unbelievable!

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.739
So this wasn't just all
computer programmers that

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.860
were putting this together,
it was a variety of artists

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.200
who all knew how to do different illusions
in order to bring the major one to life.

00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:09.931
But, that's pretty ballsy saying
computer animators do nothing

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.100
but type in a program, I know
there's a lot more than that.

00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:15.593
You'll have to fool people
to thinking something

00:05:15.618 --> 00:05:18.498
is in front of you from
literally nothing.

00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:21.064
But like I said before,
because it's an illusion

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:24.509
of an illusion - convincing an audience
of something that's fictional exists

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.380
while also convincing them it's
in the scene, when it's not -

00:05:27.412 --> 00:05:28.863
- it's harder to fool people.

00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:33.221
However, that's when the accepting
of the illusion comes in.

00:05:33.372 --> 00:05:36.181
You don't watch movies like "Lion
King" or "Beauty and the Beast" with

00:05:36.206 --> 00:05:39.831
the idea that what we're seeing
in front of us is really there.

00:05:40.004 --> 00:05:43.044
We see it, because it has a story
and characters that we enjoy.

00:05:43.115 --> 00:05:47.141
And we give in to the illusion more
because we know there are benefits to it -

00:05:47.237 --> 00:05:49.398
like how expressive it
can be, how artistically

00:05:49.423 --> 00:05:51.313
pleasing it can be and
so on and so forth.

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:55.354
I think that is why CG animated
movies have caught on so much.

00:05:55.407 --> 00:05:57.366
Because now, it's reversed.

00:05:57.423 --> 00:06:00.703
Rather than CGI being an illusion
of an illusion, in the world of

00:06:00.703 --> 00:06:04.860
animation, it's the closest thing
to looking realistic that we have.

00:06:05.024 --> 00:06:07.294
You always come across those
people who say they can't

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.960
watch cartoons, because
they know it's not real,

00:06:09.984 --> 00:06:12.343
they know it's a bunch of
drawings and nothing else.

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:17.169
But CGI has helped audiences like that
because even though they're clearly animated,

00:06:17.225 --> 00:06:19.728
they look more three-dimensional
and realistic.

00:06:20.038 --> 00:06:23.895
So now, the hand drawn style is
the illusion of the illusion.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.630
And as much as I adored 2D animation, there's
no doubt that 3D animation looks more

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:33.308
like real life and thus is probably going
to be more acceptable to wider audiences

00:06:33.484 --> 00:06:35.551
and has been for the past several years.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.860
Granted, when CG animation first started,
it was piss-poor, with the faces

00:06:39.885 --> 00:06:44.138
seeming like lifeless puppets, because -
let's face it - that's what they were.

00:06:44.163 --> 00:06:48.126
But as it evolved, CG animation has
managed to capture almost as much,

00:06:48.151 --> 00:06:52.056
if not just as much, emotion as the
classic hand-drawn animated films.

00:06:52.665 --> 00:06:56.910
This accepting of the illusion has also led
to some great imagery in live action films.

00:06:57.147 --> 00:07:00.836
"Sin City", as well as a lot of of
Robert Rodriguez movies, clearly

00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:04.542
have most of their world in very
fake looking CGI backgrounds.

00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:09.108
But they're so stylized and so
artistically pleasing that we don't care.

00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:11.198
We just love looking at them.

00:07:11.287 --> 00:07:13.940
This is usually a risk, seeing
how most audiences want to

00:07:13.965 --> 00:07:16.709
believe as much as possible that
what they're seeing is real

00:07:16.734 --> 00:07:19.354
But still, films like "300"
have found an audience,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.380
despite our awareness that
it's obviously not there.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.174
And speaking of not there, that's
another great effect CGI can pull off -

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:27.450
getting rid of the strings.

00:07:27.808 --> 00:07:30.820
That is to say, we've all
seen puppets, stop-motion

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.320
animation or other green
screen effects before.

00:07:33.416 --> 00:07:37.535
And you're almost always aware that that's
what you're watching with that pesky line

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.762
because the lighting in two different
locations never quite matched up.

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:44.885
But now, CGI can blend that
line out almost flawlessly.

00:07:44.985 --> 00:07:47.092
Allowing two different
elements from two totally

00:07:47.117 --> 00:07:49.396
different rooms to seem like
they're in the same one.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.909
As laughingly noticeable some of the
effects in "Forrest Gump" are today

00:07:52.933 --> 00:07:57.099
we're still pretty blown away by
the absence of Gary Sinise's legs

00:07:57.226 --> 00:08:00.887
There's also no trouble believing that
the headless horseman really is headless.

00:08:00.976 --> 00:08:05.516
So, maybe CGI is better at convincing
that something is not there rather

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.600
than something is, and there's definitely
a lot of benefits to it after all.

00:08:09.693 --> 00:08:12.826
So, should we be sick of CGI?
In some respects,

00:08:12.851 --> 00:08:15.391
but I don't think that means
stop it altogether.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.937
CGI is great for creating
worlds and illusions,

00:08:18.962 --> 00:08:21.940
but it shouldn't probably
be used for every part

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.320
of that world or every
element of those illusions.

00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:27.700
Every story is going to
tell itself differently,

00:08:27.725 --> 00:08:30.423
and if the idea is to be like
a magic trick where you know

00:08:30.448 --> 00:08:33.190
it's an illusion, but you
appreciate the showmanship anyway,

00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:34.700
CGI is going to be great.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.520
But if the idea is to tell a story where the
illusion is supposed to completely fool you,

00:08:38.554 --> 00:08:44.094
then it's probably wiser to mix it up with
models, puppets and other practical effects.

00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:46.211
As an art form, it's come a long way

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:49.172
and opened up all sorts of
avenues and visual wonders,

00:08:49.304 --> 00:08:51.804
but people forget, how
many avenues can be opened

00:08:51.804 --> 00:08:54.384
up by combining old
tricks with new tricks

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.700
and can often create much
more powerful illusions.

00:08:57.734 --> 00:09:01.756
So, CGI shouldn't go away or being
criticized for all that its done

00:09:01.781 --> 00:09:04.480
but it should be
acknowledged as only one

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.040
method that could be used
in creating an effect -

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.640
not just for the sake of
variety and creativity, but

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.540
because the common person
is just catching onto it.

00:09:12.754 --> 00:09:17.441
Because the more a magician repeats his
trick over and over and over again, the

00:09:17.466 --> 00:09:22.269
more likely an audience is going to be to
catch onto it and beg for something more.
