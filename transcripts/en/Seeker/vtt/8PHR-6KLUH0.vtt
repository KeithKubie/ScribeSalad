00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.290
Ancient wisdom suggests don’t read the comments.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.310
If you do, tread lightly.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.370
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.940
Whenever you read about a new study, do you
ever skip to the comment section and find

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.390
it filled with especially nasty posts?

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.350
Well this could be a real problem for science,
because recent research from the University

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.210
of Washington showed that people trust online
comments more than credible sources.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.550
In their study “Reexamining Health Messages
in the Digital Age" the researchers ran two

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.550
experiments.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.649
In the first, 129 participants watched made-up
PSAs about vaccines.

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.659
One was pro, the other was against.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:40.499
Afterwards they read fake comments.

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:42.250
The results shocked the researchers.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.200
When the participants filled out questionnaires
on vaccines, people trusted a Joe Schmoe commenter

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.639
as much as the PSA.

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:53.260
In the second experience the commenters were
identified as an English literature student,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.879
a lobbyist specializing in healthcare issues
and a medical doctor specializing in infectious

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.769
diseases and vaccinology.

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.239
Not so surprisingly, the doctor’s comments
outweighed the others in terms of credibility

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.930
and their opinions impacted the participants
attitudes MORE than the PSAs.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.190
It’s this phenomena that lead to Popular
Science shutting down its comment section

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.409
in September of 2013.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.960
Citing that a “vocal minority of "shrill,
boorish specimens of the lower Internet phyla"

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.189
were ruining it for everyone else.”

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.440
So why do comment sections get so horrible?

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.630
A recent study showed that comment sections
get testy for controversial scientific topics

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.270
because of a concept called social identity
theory.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.789
The idea is that we tie our sense of self
worth to membership with a group.

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.320
And it’s within our own interest to boost
up our group by sometimes degrading the “opposing”

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.060
groups since it reflects back on us.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.659
Think of like sports fans or political parties.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.499
For some scientific topics, there are groups
that hold certain positions.

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.149
People are really proud to be affiliated with
these groups.

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.640
If a study contradicts the group’s opinion,
people take the science personally.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.859
Like a sports fan talking smack about the
other team, people turn to the comment sections

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.649
and hope their buddies back them up.

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.579
The researchers say that “Posting a negative
comment appeases a need for affirmation.”

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.840
Both of these studies together point to a
larger issue in our culture.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.510
This could be one of the reasons why science
has a publicity problem.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.819
A new Pew study showed scientists and the
public disagree more on topics now than ever.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.270
And that there’s an increase in skepticism
of science in general.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.209
uh oh.

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.430
I mean we’re emotional creatures, as much
as we like to think we wouldn’t be persuaded

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.810
by
comments, we are.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.049
And as it stands, the comment sections aren’t
the best place for fruitful conversations.

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.489
And this is a problem for talking about the
hot button issues of our time.

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.290
So how do we communicate science without triggering
a social identity threat?
