00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.360
Graduates from evil medical school have long
dreamed of sharks with frickin' laser beams

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.850
on their heads; but when they moved into their
first volcano fortress they were disappointed

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.760
sharks couldn't survive there…

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.380
OR CAN THEY.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:25.020
80 percent of volcanic eruptions likely happen
under water; even on the ocean floor, volcanoes

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.390
produce explosions and molten lava, even though
there's high-pressure, and it's verrrry cold.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.770
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
reports the Pacific flood West Mata volcano

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.370
spews water that's akin to the acidity somewhere
between battery and stomach acid.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.390
And yet, some shrimp were spotted living nearby.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.640
Volcanoes may be deadly, but are considered
rich environments because of ample bacteria,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.219
minerals and warmth.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.820
During a survey in 2012 of the volcanically
active Kermadec Ridge by New Zealand's National

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.649
Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research,
scientists found rainbow colored Polychaete

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.510
(polly-keet) Worms, sometimes called bristle
worms.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.510
They've got extending, protruding jaws like
an H.R. Geiger wet dream… they're creeptastic.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.510
Because of the rarity of undersea exploration,
scientists often discover new species once

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.510
they get down there; like the Crown Jellyfish,
spotted 5000 feet below the surface (1500M).

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.510
This unidentified species uses its long tentacles
to sweep for bioluminescent zooplankton.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.510
So weird.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.779
On another expedition in 2009, Oregon State
University researchers explored new species

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:09.100
around a highly active volcano near Guam.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.549
They found "shrimp, crab, limpets and barnacles,"
and one of them, the Loihi shrimp, has "tiny

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.380
claws like garden shears" which allow it to
graze on bacterial filaments.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.709
They also found a species of shrimp that preys
on things killed by the noxious plumes emanating

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:26.929
from these mouths of hot volcanic death.

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.849
Obviously, when the volcano erupts, the animals
have to flee, but the benefits outweigh the

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:32.849
costs.

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:38.279
This is why most of the animals that live
near volcanoes are small, crabs, shrimp, worms

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:39.279
and coral.

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:43.929
Evolutionarily, they can take that risk, but
a large animal?

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:44.929
That's hot.

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.979
Pacific Sleeper sharks are normally found
in the North Pacific from Japan to Mexico,

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.380
and are generally sluggish, sleepy sharks.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.639
They're considered non-aggressive and live
really deep, so they're difficult to see.

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:02.049
But in July a team from National Geographic
was taking video of the Kavachi volcano and

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.229
found two species of shark hanging out inside
the volcano's caldera.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.520
The researchers freaked because Kavachi erupted
two dozen times in the 20th century, including

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.540
twice in the least 15 years!

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.840
It's considered one of the most active volcanos
in the Southwest Pacific, and yet, 12 miles

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.560
from the deadly volcano… there were these
sluggish sharks!

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.659
The water would be far hotter, and more acidic
than they normally could handle, and it raises

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.069
more questions than answers.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.909
If confirmed, they would be the furthest south
they'd ever been seen, and it begs the question:

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.760
how can these sharks survive in such an extreme
environment.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.830
I haven't said this in a few weeks, so bear
with me.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.769
More reasaearch is nedeed.

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:44.769
More shark research?

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:45.769
Yes, please!

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:46.769
Sharks are jawsome.

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.720
Do you have any ideas why a shark would want
to live near a volcano?

00:02:49.720 --> 00:03:07.140
At this point, your guess is might be as good
as 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:18.650
the scientists'.
