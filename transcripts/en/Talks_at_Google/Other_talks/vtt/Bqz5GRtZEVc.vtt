MARY GROVE: Hi
everyone, good morning,

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.790
and thank you so
much for joining us.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.940
My name is Mary Grove
and I'm the director

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.650
of Google for Entrepreneurs,
and it is my pleasure

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.020
to introduce our special
guest, Secretary Hank Paulson.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.990
He served as the 74th
Secretary of the Treasury

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.290
during the Bush
administration, and prior to

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.790
that he spent over 20
years at Goldman Sachs,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.800
where he eventually became
the Chief Executive Officer.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.760
He began his career at the
Pentagon as a staff assistant

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.130
to the Assistant
Secretary of Defense,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.970
and spent a year as well working
for the Nixon administration.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.260
Secretary Paulson is the subject
of a newly released documentary

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.600
film called "Hank: 5
Years from the Brink,"

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.690
which chronicles his tenure as
Treasury Secretary from 2006-9

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.610
during the US financial
crisis, an unprecedentedly

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.330
difficult time.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.620
Following his service
as Treasury Secretary,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.190
he launched and continues
to work full time

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.160
as the Chairman of the Paulson
Institute at the University

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.000
of Chicago, a think
and do tank, working

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.310
to advance global
environmental protection

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.230
and sustainable economic growth
between the US and China.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.260
Mr. Secretary,
welcome to Google.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.080
HANK PAULSON: Well Mary,
thank you very much.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.020
I'd say thank you all.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.387
This is my first visit
to Google and thank you

00:01:24.387 --> 00:01:25.470
for what you're all doing.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.930
You're making a positive
difference in many,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.314
many people's lives
every day, so thank you.

00:01:30.314 --> 00:01:32.230
MARY GROVE: It really
is an honor to have you,

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.870
and congratulations on the
launch of the documentary film.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.470
I found it riveting and
really, really insightful,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.050
and it's called "Hank:
5 Years from the Brink."

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.440
Is it OK if I call you Hank?

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.481
HANK PAULSON: It sure is.

00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:46.300
It's strange if you don't.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.050
MARY GROVE: Great.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.330
Well I'd love for you to
talk a bit about your path

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.440
to Treasury, and you said
that when you graduated

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.590
from Dartmouth, you wanted
to be a forest ranger.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.064
And you ended up instead
starting at the Pentagon,

00:01:58.064 --> 00:01:59.480
eventually going
to Goldman Sachs,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.800
eventually becoming the
Chief Executive Officer.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.070
Can you talk a little bit
about your career path?

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.840
HANK PAULSON: Well first
of all, some people

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.470
have got it all
planned out in advance,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.800
but I'm always a bit
suspicious of career engineers.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.480
I always said that
when I was recruiting

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.142
at Goldman Sachs, if someone
came out of their mother's womb

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.100
knowing they wanted to
be an investment banker,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.713
I was deeply suspicious.

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:28.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.920
But with me whatever
I'm doing at the time

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.620
seemed very important,
and I would focus on that,

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.290
and I would tend not
to look that far ahead.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.535
And I was an English major.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.080
I took a lot of math courses.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.100
I was an English major.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.285
I actually had thought
that I might be a professor

00:02:55.285 --> 00:03:03.260
or write books and as it turned
out, I took a different course.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.280
I ended up at--
there was the Vietnam

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.920
War was going on at the time.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.040
I ended up working
in the Pentagon,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.700
and when I was in the
Pentagon I learned

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.580
that I liked working
on projects and I

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.350
did financial
analysis pretty well.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:34.760
And so I ended up, when
I left government--

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.750
one of the things I
learned in government

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.040
was almost as important as what
you do is do you do it with.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.690
And I worked for five
or six different people.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.090
I had the same
strengths or weaknesses.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.190
I found that a couple
of bosses really

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.270
appreciated what I did it
and were very helpful to me,

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.250
and so when I picked
Goldman Sachs,

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.480
Goldman Sachs was not the
top investment banking

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.430
firm in those days.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.380
It probably didn't rank
in the top seven or eight,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.490
but I really liked
the people I met with,

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.170
and it sort of seems
silly right now,

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.750
but I was convinced that I would
never have to live in New York.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.454
I could--

00:04:19.454 --> 00:04:21.079
MARY GROVE: You were
in Chicago, right?

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.040
HANK PAULSON: --live in
Chicago, and so I picked it,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.760
and it was basically
the people I met.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.580
People that you
might know of, like

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.504
Bob Rubin and Steve Friedman
and some of the other people

00:04:35.504 --> 00:04:36.170
that were there.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.560
And it was-- and
again I wasn't looking

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.300
to go back to government.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.520
MARY GROVE: So on
that note, in the film

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.260
you talked about-- I found it
so interesting that you were

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.200
offered the position of
the Treasury three times

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.180
in the spring of 2006
before you accepted.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.130
So was that a really
difficult decision to go back

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.980
into the public sector,
and ultimately what

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.541
made you change your mind?

00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:03.290
HANK PAULSON: Well it
was a strange thing,

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.690
because I found I was-- when
I was running Goldman Sachs,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.360
I'd go speak to business
schools all the time.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.330
And I'd say welcome change,
change is your friend.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.560
And of course human
beings always say that,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.830
but most people really
don't like change.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.840
And I had been-- I liked
my job at Goldman Sachs.

00:05:25.466 --> 00:05:29.430
I very, very much enjoyed
doing what I was doing.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.630
My family were not big fans
of the Bush administration,

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:43.450
to put it mildly, and so I
twice had turned it down.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.840
And just before-- the second
time I turned it down,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.930
I had-- it was just before I was
at the White House for a lunch

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.040
that President Bush was having
for President Hu of China.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.150
And as we were walking out--
it was a beautiful May day,

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.850
and I looked out toward
the Treasury Building.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.710
And I remembered
the one year when

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.080
I was working in the
Nixon White House,

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.500
I'd spent time going over to
see George Shultz, his Treasury

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.050
Secretary, and my wife could see
I was sort of in deep thought.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.670
And so she said
to me, well Hank,

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.690
I sure hope you didn't turn down
the job because of me, because

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.130
of course, if it was
really important to you,

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.920
I would have agreed to do it.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.600
And I said, yeah,
yeah, of course not.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.510
And I took that as permission.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.530
And so--

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.426
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:42.426 --> 00:06:42.608
MARY GROVE: I thought
you were going

00:06:42.608 --> 00:06:43.770
to say that you told her
you had suffered already.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.686
HANK PAULSON: And so
then, when they came back

00:06:45.686 --> 00:06:49.440
the third time, which
really shocked me,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.660
it occurred to me
that the reason

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.750
I had said no the first
two times was fear.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:02.140
And that I knew I was doing
what I was doing quite well.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.655
And I couldn't think
of many people that

00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:07.160
had gone to Washington
for a cabinet job that

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.030
left with a higher reputation
than they came with.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.170
And so as soon as that hit me,
the last thing I wanted to do

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.880
was to give into that.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.090
So I immediately
reversed myself, said yes

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.710
and it really ended
up shocking Wendy

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.650
because I didn't talk to her the
third time before I went back.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:34.040
But in any event, it
was a-- and I'm really,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.610
really glad I did it.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.070
When I think back what an honor
it is to serve your country--

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.480
and I'm very glad
I was there, even

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.170
though during that horrible
time-- that how close

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.750
I came to not being there.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.850
MARY GROVE: Absolutely.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.440
And you said that you
predicted that at some point

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.940
during the Bush
administration there

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.030
would be a financial crisis.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.020
Did you take the position going
in sort of eyes wide open?

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.210
What made you think that
a crisis was looming?

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.800
HANK PAULSON: Well Mary,
the very first meeting

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:10.600
I had with the president and
his economic advisors was

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.549
at Camp David, and I was asked
to speak on entitlement reform,

00:08:15.549 --> 00:08:17.090
and-- which is one
of the reasons why

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.100
I'm going to Washington.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.020
And I said, Mr.
President I'd like

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.010
to speak about
something else instead.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.800
And I just said I
see so many excesses,

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.820
and they've been
going on for some time

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.630
and I think we're overdue
for a financial crisis.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.559
I'd watched them come
every eight to ten years.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:39.309
And when he said to me, what
do you think would cause it?

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:40.510
I said I don't know sir.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.890
But with 20/20 hindsight,
later it'll be obvious.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.520
I didn't see the
Russian default.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.510
I didn't see some of
these other things.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.350
So I talked about
credit default swaps,

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.880
I talked about a
complicated securities.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:09:00.160
I never once mentioned mortgages
and residential home prices.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
And as I said, I
think the reason

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.010
so many of us missed it--
you could see excesses there,

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:10.570
but ever since World War II,
if you look at housing prices

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.680
the US, it going up.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.540
There hadn't been any
big nationwide decline

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.010
in residential home prices.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.470
So if you owned a diversified
pool of mortgages,

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.289
the biggest risk you
worried about was you

00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:25.705
would get your
money back to soon.

00:09:25.705 --> 00:09:27.920
It wasn't that you'd
get-- rates would drop,

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.500
people would prepay.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.660
And so we hadn't seen that.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.130
But I was glad we focused on the
problem generally of a crisis,

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:42.370
because we started work
right away in preparing,

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.390
and so it gave me a great
chance to build relationships

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.420
with Ben Bernanke
and Tim Geithner.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.440
And I actually had started,
got to know and build

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.460
a strong relationship
with Barney Frank,

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.830
because right away in
2006 we were working

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.310
on reforming Fannie and Freddie.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:06.480
We didn't get it done, but
it took them about ready

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.760
to go down in June of 2008.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.840
But at least it was,
I think, important

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.990
that I had a year
before the crisis

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.710
to build some of
the relationships.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.150
MARY GROVE: So "5 Years from
the Brink," also the title

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.670
of the film.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.220
Was there a specific
moment of the crisis

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.720
that you would call the
pinnacle, or the brink,

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.750
ranging from the beginning
with Bear Stearns all

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.200
the way through Lehman Brothers?

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.700
Is there actually a
palpable brink for you?

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:41.250
HANK PAULSON: Well I would
say if I looked at the week,

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:46.580
and there were some--
from mid-August,

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.910
where we were racing to
stabilize Fannie or Freddie,

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.056
and you remember they're
nine times bigger

00:10:54.056 --> 00:10:54.930
than Lehman Brothers.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.480
And can you imagine
if they'd failed,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.070
or if we hadn't had mortgage
funding during the crisis

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.000
where real estate
prices would have been?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.300
So it seemed like right
up from mid-August

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:14.630
through mid-October, when we
put the capital in the banks,

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:20.350
that whole period was
particularly difficult.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.370
But I think the time that I
saw things like the clearest,

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.890
and how close we
were to disaster,

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.130
was-- we had what I call
Lehman Brothers weekend,

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.790
where we had Merrill Lynch,
AIG and Lehman Brothers

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.990
all going down at the same time.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.900
And we didn't have a
single legal authority

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.130
that we could find that
would work for a Lehman.

00:11:46.245 --> 00:11:48.720
And it turns, if you look
back at it, if B of A

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.380
had bought Lehman then
Merrill would have gone.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.360
And it would've been worse.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.770
But that week-- and so during
that week after Lehman went

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.260
down and where we
went up for the TARP ,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.730
the time when I saw it the
clearest was when the money

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.760
market funds started, the run
generally started on money

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.140
market funds.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.040
And 30 million Americans
had $3.5 trillion

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.670
in the money market funds.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:19.950
But the linkage which
we had not focused on

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:24.790
was the money market funds were
funding commercial paper, which

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:30.830
many of the biggest
industrial companies used

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.830
to meet their financing needs.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:38.340
So I received a call that
week from a CEO of a AAA

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.970
company-- AAA consumer products
company-- said that his CFO had

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.650
called him and said,
boss we may not

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.290
be able to make
it a $800 million

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.130
quarterly dividend
payment on our stock.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:54.750
And the commercial paper
markets started to freeze,

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.380
and I could just
see as plain as day

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.240
what was going to happen if
big companies couldn't pay

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.220
their suppliers, and the CFO
was calling him up, saying boss,

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.140
we may not be able to--
we may have to stretch out

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.400
our pay-ables, cut back
on our inventories.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.720
And then you look-- they don't
pay the smaller companies,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.150
and as that ripples through
and you get all these layoffs

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:23.110
and failures going from
Wall Street to Main Street.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:28.915
I mean I could see
what we were facing,

00:13:28.915 --> 00:13:33.100
and I think we came very
close several times.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.765
MARY GROVE: A few
brinks, so to speak.

00:13:34.765 --> 00:13:35.890
HANK PAULSON: A few brinks.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.870
MARY GROVE: So your wife Wendy
is profiled in the documentary

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.390
as well, and you allow us
a lovely and personal peek

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.810
into your relationship.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:45.400
There's this great
anecdote where,

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.650
when you were just becoming more
established at Goldman Sachs,

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.270
you came home one day with a
beautiful expensive new winter

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.360
coat from Bergdorf Goodman,
and she tells you, Hank, you

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.290
already have a perfectly
fine coat, and you return it.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.660
These wonderful stories
of-- she was definitely

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.670
is a source of strength
for you in tough times.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.280
I'd love to know
what kept you calm

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.400
and focused during the crisis.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.820
HANK PAULSON: Well first
of all on the documentary,

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.950
you keep saying,
you gave us a look.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:19.120
Bloomberg did this, and at
the time-- I look at it now

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.490
and I'm happy with the
result, because I think

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:27.330
it gives you a sense of
what we were dealing with

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:32.470
and figures out how to tell
a complex story in ways

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.320
it's readily understandable.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.620
And there's the human
side to it, also.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.480
But at the time, I didn't
have an editorial control,

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:48.110
and the documentarian-- it
took a lot to persuade Wendy.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.690
Wendy voted against doing the
documentary to begin with,

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.900
and so she showed
up and she finally

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.470
agreed to do it
three days before,

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:01.390
and showed up and
made her contribution.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:06.401
But yeah, this is-- I would
just say something to all of you

00:15:06.401 --> 00:15:06.900
here.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.670
And it's probably as important
as anything I can say,

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:16.260
is that I don't know
any-- I've worked

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:22.460
with a lot of important
people, a lot of CEOs,

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:27.590
a lot of successful former
heads of state, heads of state--

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.510
and I don't know of
any one who says,

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.640
gee, I'm happy because
I had a great career

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.361
but I screwed up
my personal life.

00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:35.860
I don't know anybody--
and there are

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.443
plenty of people that don't have
quite the career they'd like,

00:15:38.443 --> 00:15:41.920
but that they have a
balanced personal life.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:51.340
And one of the great decisions
I made was marrying Wendy,

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.820
and she did a lot
to keep me grounded.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.820
She's the one that got me
interested in conservation

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:04.950
and I went on-- she served
on the board of the Nature

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:09.250
Conservancy, was a vice
chairman and chairman

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:10.830
of the New York and
Illinois chapters

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.790
and got me involved
there, got me involved

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.690
in many of the
things we've done.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.960
And she's frugal.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.770
She went to college
on a scholarship.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.790
Her father was a
military officer.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.592
She worked her way
through and she's generous

00:16:26.592 --> 00:16:28.050
when it comes to
giving away money.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:32.620
She does not like
to spend money,

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.370
and so that anecdote was
one of many I could've told.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.850
But anyway, she--
during the crisis,

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:50.188
she was a great sense of support
and a strong sense of support.

00:16:50.188 --> 00:16:51.580
MARY GROVE: Wonderful.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.690
You've said in your
motivation to participate

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.950
in the documentary that you
felt it important to have

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.580
a historical record of what had
happened so that we don't play

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.730
this movie all over again.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.520
Given Dodd-Frank
and other policy

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.020
changes, what do you think the
odds are that we do, in fact,

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.384
play this movie all over again?

00:17:08.384 --> 00:17:11.280
HANK PAULSON: Well,
you're right in terms

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.460
of the lessons we
need to learn and I

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:22.010
am hopeful we won't play this
movie over again anytime soon.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.140
If you were to ask me, are we
going to have financial crises?

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.109
Of course we're going to
have financial crises.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:29.930
I don't care what
economic system you have,

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:33.590
how the financial system is
structured, how it's regulated.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.310
As long as you have
banks and as long

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.070
as you have a financial
system, you're

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.920
going to have financial crises.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.630
But most of them
have been manageable,

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.640
and manageable in so that they
can be handled in such a way,

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.000
and so it doesn't spill
over to the broader economy.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.830
And so what we want
to do, is we want

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.427
to avoid massive disruptions.

00:17:55.427 --> 00:17:58.010
The Great Depression-- which I
think we could very easily have

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:05.140
had something where we had
unemployment rivaling, or maybe

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.690
exceeding, the level of 25% we
had during the Great Depression

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.870
during the crisis
we went through.

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:17.670
And I think to avoid these
massive disruptions there's

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.640
two things that are important.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.520
First, we really can't let
excesses build up to the point

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.570
that they've built
up, and so you

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:30.410
need to deal with
fundamental economic issues.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.840
And to me the question to
really ask ourselves here

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:38.810
is, what policies give us
sustainable economic growth?

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.760
And those are going to
be the policies that

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.880
are going to give us
generational equity, that

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.980
are going to increase
our national security

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.800
and our economic security.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.250
And I think the kinds
of policies we really

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:59.700
need to be fighting for are
all structural changes that

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.380
take bipartisan cooperation.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:07.530
And so I'm talking
about policies

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:14.190
that help us manage our fiscal
problems in a balanced way,

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.240
while at the same
time we've got growth.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.540
So we can't raise taxes too much
or cut so much that we really

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.740
undermine this
fledgling recovery.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.640
And so what kinds of
things are we need?

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:32.150
I think we need tax reform,
we need entitlement reform,

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:37.690
we need immigration reform,
we need trade issues.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.060
And one of the things
I'm proudest of

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.600
is that we worked as
well-- that when I say we,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.810
it's Ben Bernanke,
Tim Geithner, and I--

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:53.220
I think we worked as well with
Democrats as with Republicans.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.450
Congress twice acted before
we had real disaster.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.840
We had policy continuity going
from the Bush administration

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.520
to the Obama administration
on these capital stabilization

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.370
programs.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.570
So that's what you need
in the longer term.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:15.502
On the short term, we need
to clean up our messes, OK,

00:20:15.502 --> 00:20:17.210
the problems that led
to the last crisis,

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.990
and we need to make sure we have
the tools to manage a crisis

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.410
when it comes along.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.270
Now in terms of
cleaning up the messes,

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.800
the thing that I
think we did a lot,

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.780
and I think Dodd-Frank
gives us a lot

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.000
of the authorities we need.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.010
For instance, we now
have the authorities

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:40.370
to wind down a failing financial
institution, even if it's not

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:45.200
a bank, tools we could have
used with Lehman Brothers.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.210
So no institution should
be-- if they fail,

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.480
should be propped up
in their current form.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:56.620
And so with Dodd-Frank,
we've now got this resolution

00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.860
authority, we've got
banks are better managed,

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.790
much better
capitalized-- which is

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:06.000
the ultimate defense--
better regulated.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.850
So my focus is
really on the housing

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.280
still because, as
I said, I think

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.700
the most important thing we
did was put Fannie and Freddie

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.070
into conservator-ship.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:23.000
But if you look then, they
backstopped, they guaranteed,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.810
about half of the residential
mortgages in this country.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.170
Now-- and when we
did that, it never

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.770
dawned on me that we would keep
them in their current form.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.590
Never in a hundred years.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:37.790
I referred to it as a time out.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:43.420
It was a flawed structure
behind those agencies,

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.890
so they need to
be phased out, we

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:47.310
need to figure out what they're
going to be replaced with.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.930
Well today, the government-- if
you look at the FHA and Fannie

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.880
Freddie, and other
programs, is backstopping

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.489
almost half the
residential mortgages.

00:21:56.489 --> 00:21:58.030
Which means the
government is setting

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:01.230
the price and terms,
not the markets.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.160
And I think that's unacceptable.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.810
But now they're coining
money, making billions

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.420
of dollars a year,
there in the budget.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.820
And so any way to
deal with them,

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.460
to reform, which
needs to be done,

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.860
is going to have a budget cost.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.160
So that needs to be done.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:23.320
And then of course the
key, I think, to a crisis

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.440
is when we're
confronted by a crisis,

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.760
to have the tools you
need to manage it.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.310
And we had a really flawed
regulatory structure

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.630
without the necessary
authorities.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.130
I think now we've got
a lot of what we need,

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.200
but there's still
some big problems.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.105
We still have five regulators
falling all over each other,

00:22:45.105 --> 00:22:46.900
and competing with
each other, and that's

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.190
why it's been so hard
to implement Dodd-Frank.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.500
And I don't think
that's a good thing.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.050
Why we should have
a SEC and CFTC

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.470
just makes no
sense in the world.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.590
One to regulate
the cash markets,

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.870
the other to regulate
the futures markets.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:06.225
But by and large, I think
we've got more work to be done.

00:23:06.225 --> 00:23:08.950
But I think there's been
a lot of progress made

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.790
and a lot of Americans
are still suffering,

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.930
and it's going to
take a while, I think,

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.290
for our economy to get back
where it needs to come back to.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:23.684
But again, I think
even then some

00:23:23.684 --> 00:23:25.100
of the problems
we're dealing with

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:30.900
are longer term
circular problems that

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.270
aren't going to
be fixed until we

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.740
get some fundamental reforms.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.850
Because even during,
for instance,

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:42.940
the 10 bubble years before the
crisis, where Americans were

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:47.460
doubling their borrowings to
maintain a standard of living

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:51.860
they couldn't afford,
you saw median income

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.740
was flat in this country.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.440
And that's a sign of
declining competitiveness.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.920
And in some of the
fundamental issues

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.025
we're dealing with, I'll
say this knowing that I'm

00:24:01.025 --> 00:24:03.590
in Silicon Valley--
and technology,

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:07.960
is great we need it--
but I will tell you

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:14.190
technology and globalization
are killing jobs.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:18.750
And you name the industry,
and almost any industry,

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.850
and every time I hear
of something new that's

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:25.390
being developed which is going
to improve all of our lives,

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.880
it's going to mean that
there are less jobs.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.720
And I can give you
all kinds of examples,

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.550
so I think that's
another case where

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:35.450
we need to be working
on training programs

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:43.470
and preparing people to live
in the world that all of us

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:45.702
are going to be living
in in the future.

00:24:45.702 --> 00:24:47.410
MARY GROVE: So speaking
of globalization,

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.670
you have kept a
pretty low profile

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.140
since leaving
government, and I'd

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.722
love to hear more
about what you've

00:24:52.722 --> 00:24:54.180
been up to for the
last five years.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.310
I understand you're working
on releasing a new book called

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.020
Dealing With China,
that you've traveled

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.680
to China over 80 times.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.710
Talk to us about
your perspective

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.812
on this globalization,
specifically

00:25:04.812 --> 00:25:06.520
with the view towards
your work in China.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.680
HANK PAULSON: Well I'd say,
so Mary, the two things--

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.710
I do not for profit work.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.630
So I have-- and I'm
interested in conservation

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:18.530
and the environment and
sustainability issues.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.030
So I've got one thing
I won't talk about,

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.320
but which is a Latin
American Conservation

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:29.040
Council with a good
number of-- 35 CEOs,

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.700
a lot of them in Latin America--
focused on conservation issues

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.680
there-- water security,
saving the watershed,

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:41.350
smart infrastructure
development, and food security.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.850
And then in China, we have the
Paulson Institute's roughly 20

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:50.570
people-- five in Beijing, people
in Washington, and in Chicago

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.510
at the University of Chicago.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.090
I refer to it as a
think and do tank,

00:25:55.090 --> 00:26:01.200
and I happen to think that
some of the major issues that

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.840
challenge us right now
are taking place in China.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.620
The next 300 million
people going to the cities

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.890
will drive economic and
environmental outcomes

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:14.430
for China and for the
rest of the world.

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.320
They have some big opportunities
and some very, very big

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.540
challenges, and so the
sorts of programs we work on

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:25.360
are programs that have to do a
sustainable urbanization, work

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.150
on conservation
programs, leadership--

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:32.420
because I also think another
big development in the next 25

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.300
years will be major
Chinese companies going

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.795
out and becoming
global companies.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:48.110
And their behaviors and
their governance systems,

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.490
and their environmental
practices,

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:55.840
training, hiring practices,
will make a big difference

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.670
throughout the world.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.440
And so that's how
we spend our time

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:07.070
and I'm going through--
hopefully getting

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:14.780
near finishing a book on China,
which will hopefully come out

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.280
later this year, on China.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.780
MARY GROVE: So
following up on that,

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.488
just to go back to
the film for a second.

00:27:19.488 --> 00:27:22.000
You talked about-- in
those moments on the brink

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.690
when you knew that a run
on the money markets,

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.352
for example, would lead to
a collapse of the US market

00:27:27.352 --> 00:27:29.310
in a matter of hours,
which in a matter of days

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.950
would lead to the collapse
of global financial markets.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.800
In light of your
comments about China

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.200
and the global economy
being knit together,

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.710
do you think that the
balance of power is shifting?

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.240
Are there other
major economic player

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.840
to keep an eye on who could have
such an impact in the future?

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:51.370
HANK PAULSON: First of all,
obviously, for some time

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:56.490
there's been a trend
which is that a increasing

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:01.120
percentage of the economic
activity and economic growth

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:06.380
is taking place away from the
developed and Western world.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:11.810
Now these developing countries--
some of these major developing

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.360
countries-- have got plenty
of challenges on their own

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:20.620
as we have seen recently, as
you've watched what's happening

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:28.090
in countries like India, Brazil,
Russia, and of course China

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:31.030
has got plenty of
their challenges.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:39.140
And right now they have--
the new leadership team

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.810
is early in their tenure.

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:45.660
They have an economic
model that has clearly

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.140
run out of gas, that
needs to change.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.330
It's going to be very
difficult for them

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:53.220
to do the things
they need to do.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.260
They're a strong
leadership team,

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:59.450
but there's also strong vested
interest against-- they'll

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:03.452
be opposing reforms
and greater opening up.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.670
I've been one that has
been cautiously optimistic

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:15.630
that China will do well
over-- in the years

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:20.980
ahead, just simply because their
leaders understand the problems

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.750
and they have a
lot of strengths.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:30.840
But I would again say that
those jobs are tough jobs.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:36.070
So I would, as
you look at China,

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:43.320
I would say that the new
leadership team-- coming out

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.090
of their third Plenum, which
is where they put forward

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:50.170
their platform for
their time in office--

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:53.050
have given themselves
a longer period of time

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.900
to put some of these
reforms in place.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:30:01.050
And they've got
they're hands full

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:07.120
but I think they
will ultimately have

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.440
a good chance of
being successful.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.010
But I think what this
means for all the rest

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:17.550
of us is that, in this
world that's increasingly

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.120
interconnected, I
think we're going

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:24.440
to expect to see
continued volatility

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:31.300
and I think we are going to see
continuing opportunities also

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.210
for global businesses,
because-- and I think

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:40.720
when you look at the rule
that a company like Google

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.110
plays in bringing
people together,

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:47.768
I think it's a very
important function.

00:30:47.768 --> 00:30:49.010
MARY GROVE: Thank you.

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:50.020
In about three or
four minutes, we'll

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.590
shift gears and take
audience questions,

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.965
so if you have questions, if
you can go ahead and line up

00:30:53.965 --> 00:30:56.260
at the microphone we'll
switch over a few minutes.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.830
But speaking of Google, Hank.

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:59.350
We are at Google today.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:03.990
I understand you had a chance to
demo Google Glass this morning.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.580
Is that true?

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.705
working hear your thoughts.

00:31:05.705 --> 00:31:08.180
Do you think in a few years
you could see traders wearing

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.476
Google Glass the
floor of the exchange?

00:31:10.476 --> 00:31:12.350
HANK PAULSON: Well I
would-- let me say this.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:14.410
I'm looking forward to
doing this afterwards,

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:16.790
so I didn't get a
chance yet this morning.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:17.190
MARY GROVE: We'll
do it over lunch.

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:19.773
HANK PAULSON: We'll do it over
lunch and I look forward to it.

00:31:19.773 --> 00:31:22.755
But I'll tell you
one thing I do know,

00:31:22.755 --> 00:31:25.510
and you're talking
to someone who

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:30.210
is a Luddite when it
comes to using devices.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:35.602
So I'm still at the stage
where iPhones and iPads and--

00:31:35.602 --> 00:31:37.310
MARY GROVE: What is
your phone of choice?

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.270
HANK PAULSON: What?

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:40.325
MARY GROVE: What mobile
phone do you use?

00:31:40.325 --> 00:31:42.200
HANK PAULSON: I started
off with a BlackBerry

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.620
because I could feel the
keys, and so now I've

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:45.900
advanced to an iPhone.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.840
But the one thing I will
say in terms of markets.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.930
I think there's a
lot more that can

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:59.860
be done in terms of
technology and markets.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:05.260
And I think markets are,
when properly regulated

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.740
and structured, are hugely
And speaking about China,

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:14.690
with the new leadership team in
China has said very powerfully,

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:16.640
is they recognize
that markets have

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.440
got to play a
bigger role, by far.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.370
The government
playing a lesser role.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:24.080
And they cited all the examples
where the government has

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.692
been involved, and you've
got excess capacity,

00:32:26.692 --> 00:32:28.150
whether it's steel
or shipbuilding,

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.290
you could just go through
industry and industry,

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.140
and they see the private sector.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:37.045
And so I think-- and
so I have no doubt

00:32:37.045 --> 00:32:39.390
that technology is
going to continue

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.080
to be a powerful
force in markets.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:47.140
But it's also something we
need to understand better,

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:52.060
because with technology
and the upside

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.124
comes some very real risks.

00:32:54.124 --> 00:32:55.790
MARY GROVE: Some great
responsibilities.

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:56.885
HANK PAULSON: Yep.

00:32:56.885 --> 00:32:57.760
MARY GROVE: Question.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.010
MALE SPEAKER: Everybody's
looking for the next crisis.

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.480
About 10 to 15 years ago, I
read this book by Frank Partnoy,

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.020
it's called "Fiasco," which
talks about derivatives.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:11.900
And I remember he talks about a
lot of stuff that will blow up

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:19.880
in 2016, 2017, 2015, some bet
that Morgan Stanley or somebody

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.990
else has made at the
time with some company

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:23.830
in the world or
some pension fund.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:26.630
So I was wondering
whether you think

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.550
there is a real issue
with this, and if there

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.510
is, what can be done about it?

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:36.576
HANK PAULSON: Well interesting
that you raise a question

00:33:36.576 --> 00:33:38.890
because when I
talked about that,

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.260
alluded to this
first session I had

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.680
with President Bush
and his advisors

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.260
and we talked about
a financial crisis,

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:54.580
I talked about derivatives
because the complexity--

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.840
it's just like technology,
with anything--

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.380
you don't get in trouble
in financial markets

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.630
if you've got a bad idea.

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:03.921
Because it doesn't go anywhere.

00:34:03.921 --> 00:34:07.230
You have trouble when you
get too much of a good idea.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:13.730
And whether it's
securitization or derivatives.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:18.130
And at the time when
I went to Washington,

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.949
we had a problem
because everyone

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:24.093
knew how much-- if
you're looking at debt,

00:34:24.093 --> 00:34:25.384
let's say General Motors' debt.

00:34:25.384 --> 00:34:27.258
You know how many bonds
they had outstanding.

00:34:27.258 --> 00:34:29.389
But nobody knew how
many derivatives

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:31.730
had been written
against that debt.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:44.800
A number of
institutions-- trades

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.739
weren't being settled
sometimes for six,

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:50.219
nine months after
they were made.

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:53.449
And it was very, very
hard for the industry

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:54.960
to figure out how
to clean it up,

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.506
because it took
their counterparts--

00:34:58.506 --> 00:35:00.130
when I was at Goldman
Sachs I had begun

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:02.400
working on this with
the New York Fed.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.010
Now I think today,
we've come a long way

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:08.460
and I'm much less focused
on the derivative problem

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:14.910
because there's a-- if
you look at Dodd-Frank,

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:18.780
there's a requirement
that derivatives be traded

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:23.060
on either exchanges or
central clearinghouses.

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.800
I don't like the way
it's been watered down,

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.906
in the sense with certain
derivatives being exempted.

00:35:29.906 --> 00:35:34.430
I think what you really want
to do with derivatives is have

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:38.830
greater transparency and
so if you can't put them

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.499
on an exchange or
in a clearinghouse,

00:35:41.499 --> 00:35:43.290
and they're so complex
they can't go there,

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.080
then you've got to get them
with a big capital charge.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.617
Because complexity is enemy.

00:35:48.617 --> 00:35:50.700
But I think there's been--
I should have given you

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.100
a much shorter
answer and just say

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:56.497
there's been a lot done
to deal with this problem.

00:35:56.497 --> 00:35:58.330
So I think the things
that have got the most

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:03.330
focus-- the big banks, and
too big to fail-- sure,

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.720
that's still an issue, but
much better capitalized, better

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.500
regulated.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:14.450
There are now emergency
authorities to deal with them.

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:17.730
The derivatives-- a lot has been
done with the derivatives area.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.520
A lot more is being done.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.760
So the things that I'm
tending to focus on

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.030
are the problems were there
hasn't been as much done--

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:29.650
Fannie or Freddie, or some
of the shadow banking market.

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:33.530
Looking at-- still the
commercial paper issue.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:37.680
The SEC's got proposals, but
I'd like to see them enacted,

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.242
and I'm not sure
it's gone far enough.

00:36:40.242 --> 00:36:42.450
MALE SPEAKER: What are your
thoughts on moral hazard?

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.033
HANK PAULSON: That's
one of the things

00:36:44.033 --> 00:36:49.700
that the documentary does
a pretty good job on.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.780
I think moral hazard is a
really important issue--

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:57.610
and for those of you, I think
you all pretty much know

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:01.350
what moral hazard is-- which
is, if there's a presumption

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:05.170
that the government's going to
be there to bail someone out,

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:08.730
then you're not going to have
all of the other stakeholders,

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.730
the shareholders the
borrowers, the depositors,

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:16.550
aren't going to be as
vigilant as they need to do.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:20.220
Now as we went through
the financial crisis,

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:23.230
I was forced to do things that
wasn't really hard to decide

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:25.200
to do them, that we're
very objectionable,

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.530
but they're better
than the alternative.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:30.490
In other words, there's
a moral hazard when

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:33.870
the government steps
in, but the alternative

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:38.610
is taking the system down and
everybody suffers even more

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:39.790
than they have.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:45.810
Now I will say that
as I look back,

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.840
I don't think
there are many CEOs

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.540
of failed institutions
that wanted

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:54.270
the other institutions
fail, or are didn't suffer.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.650
And if you look at what was
done with AIG and Fannie

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:01.180
or Freddie in terms of
management being replaced,

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.390
parachutes going, et cetera.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:09.300
But to cut to the
chase, with moral hazard

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.180
I think one good
way to think about

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:15.970
is this: no matter how
well a regulatory system is

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:21.200
structured, we can
never rely on regulation

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.930
to solve all the problems.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:24.100
It just won't.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:28.320
Unless you believe the banks are
trying to blow themselves up,

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:34.850
it's hard to believe that
the regulators are always

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:36.810
going to find
problems that bankers

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:38.670
couldn't find themselves.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:43.320
And so that's why you
need-- because of that,

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.900
you really should be
concerned about moral hazard,

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.050
and you really need
market discipline.

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:51.750
And so to me, the key thing
is we want to have the tools

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:55.720
so that when an
institution fails

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.010
you're not propping it
up in its current form.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:00.800
And I think the
reason so much of what

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:05.860
we did was unpopular is
even though it-- putting

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:10.630
a cap on the banks prevented
failure, the money came back

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:14.370
that we put in, came
back plus $32 billion--

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:19.840
but because people don't want
to see institutions propped up

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.180
in their current form.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:26.650
And so because moral hazard
is as important as it is.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:29.920
I think is very
important that we always

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.730
maintain market discipline.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:37.630
But during the crisis, I
might have-- moral hazard

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:39.620
wasn't the number
one thing in my mind.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:42.980
Preventing disaster was
the number one thing.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.489
MALE SPEAKER: One thing about
the crisis that was clear

00:39:46.489 --> 00:39:49.030
as it was unfolding is that it
brought both parties together.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:50.530
I mean, TARP
couldn't have gotten

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:52.363
through if Democrats
and Republicans weren't

00:39:52.363 --> 00:39:53.640
working alongside each other.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.765
As you were talking through
some of the things that

00:39:55.765 --> 00:39:57.920
need to happen to
prevent future crises,

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.767
bipartisanship came
out of your mouth,

00:39:59.767 --> 00:40:01.600
and I'm wondering if
you look at Washington,

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.750
you look at the way things
are going right now,

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.084
if you're concerned at all
that fighting between the two

00:40:06.084 --> 00:40:08.333
parties prevents things like
immigration reform, which

00:40:08.333 --> 00:40:09.630
you touched on, or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:13.050
HANK PAULSON: Well, I've thought
a lot about that because I

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:20.870
don't-- I've never been partisan
and the one thing that I could

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:23.910
not stand, and never
been able to stand,

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:27.410
is ideologues or people
who say, I know I'm right,

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:29.890
and we're only going
to do it my way,

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:32.850
and we're not going
to compromise.

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:39.580
And I had a-- one of the things
that was very important to me

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:45.775
when I came to Washington was
having the authority to replace

00:40:45.775 --> 00:40:51.110
and choose my team, and choose
my team regardless of party.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:54.540
And then had a president that
really, not only allowed me,

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:58.290
but encouraged me to
work across the aisle.

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:01.090
So I just-- and I'll
answer your question,

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:05.370
but when I-- the interesting
change in my thinking

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:08.380
between the time I wrote the
book on the financial crisis,

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.080
called On The Brink, and
the time I participated

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:15.500
in this documentary, was at
the time I wrote the book,

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.550
right afterwards,
it just seemed to me

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:21.540
like I couldn't believe Congress
took so long to act twice

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:22.870
when we're on the precipice.

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:24.940
I now look at it and say, twice!

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.810
We got these
incredible authorities,

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:30.940
and working across
party lines twice,

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.110
people made votes that they knew
was going to be very unpopular.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:37.075
Everybody that voted, unless you
had your head screwed on wrong,

00:41:37.075 --> 00:41:39.540
knew it was going
to be unpopular.

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:43.790
But when I came to Washington,
President Bush's approval

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:45.690
rating was 28%.

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.340
It was a poisonous
atmosphere and we

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:50.590
had time to get in
the trenches and work.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:55.670
So today, it's
even more poisonous

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:58.080
and I've asked myself why.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.620
Why is it?

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:04.090
And I think there are certain
structural issues when

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:07.410
you look at the extent to which
we've had this redistricting

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:11.220
and gerrymandering, which I
look at as in some ways almost

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:15.740
political corruption, where
80% of the seats in the House

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.560
are safe for one
party or the other,

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.796
so you're worried about
attack from either the left

00:42:19.796 --> 00:42:20.920
or the right.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:24.410
And so the fastest
way to lose your job,

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.330
if you're in
Congress, is to move

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:30.250
to the middle and
compromise with someone.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:35.394
You look at the way people
get their news on blogs today.

00:42:35.394 --> 00:42:37.310
My friends that are on
the far right, they all

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:39.720
talk to each other, they listen
to the same set of facts.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:43.640
On the left, they've
got their own facts.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.050
And remember,
members of Congress

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:49.020
reflect the voting public.

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:53.320
That's their job security.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:57.140
But having said all that,
I still think our system is

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:02.170
the best of the world, and
I've-- it was alluded to.

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:04.080
I was in the Nixon White House.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.060
I joined in April of '72, six
weeks before the Watergate

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.020
break-in.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.520
So I witnessed that,
and so you talk

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.690
about poisonous atmosphere.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.000
So I've got to tell
you, people that

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.550
say it's more poisonous
than they've ever seen

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:20.960
don't know their history,
and even going back further.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.475
So I think what it takes
is strong leadership,

00:43:25.475 --> 00:43:28.760
it takes strong leadership
from the president,

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.530
because he or she will
be the one person--

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:40.790
and some day it'll be
a she-- and are there

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:42.460
to represent all the people.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:48.140
And then it's just going to take
working hard across the aisle,

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:54.500
and I tell you, you can't
do anything this important

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:59.010
really important
in Congress that's

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:02.105
structural without
bipartisanship.

00:44:05.084 --> 00:44:06.000
MARY GROVE: Thank you.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.874
So we currently have
about five minutes left.

00:44:07.874 --> 00:44:10.810
If I could ask a favor of
our four colleagues to each

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:13.007
ask their questions in
a row, and then Hank,

00:44:13.007 --> 00:44:14.340
if you can make general remarks.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.631
HANK PAULSON: MALE SPEAKER:
You are so polite and nice.

00:44:16.631 --> 00:44:19.010
What you mean to say is, ask
a favor-- please be brief.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.630
That's not one of my virtues.

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.730
MARY GROVE: No, no.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:20.066
You can ask them in
a row, and maybe you

00:44:20.066 --> 00:44:21.360
can make some general remarks.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.830
HANK PAULSON: I'll try okay.

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:25.190
MALE SPEAKER: So one of
the benefits of free market

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:28.020
capitalism versus the
crony capitalism version

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:32.590
that we currently have-- and
a lot of the programs help--

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:36.730
is that there's a good
side effect to failure

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:40.680
of a commercial
enterprise, is that whoever

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.901
emerges from the ashes
learns their lesson.

00:44:42.901 --> 00:44:43.650
HANK PAULSON: Yep.

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:46.190
MALE SPEAKER: And
if we'd done this

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:49.480
during LTCM the current
crisis wouldn't have happened.

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.156
But we didn't do
anything for these guys

00:44:51.156 --> 00:44:52.030
to learn the lessons.

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:53.640
Couldn't we have
attached a condition

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:57.614
to the recapitalization that's
limiting bonus, something

00:44:57.614 --> 00:44:59.030
that someone would
have, at least,

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:00.405
would have learned
their lessons.

00:45:00.405 --> 00:45:02.112
HANK PAULSON: I got it.

00:45:02.112 --> 00:45:03.570
MALE SPEAKER: I
just wanted to know

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:07.240
what you believe
poses the biggest risk

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.260
today to bring about a
future financial crisis.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.100
HANK PAULSON: OK.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:12.710
MALE SPEAKER:
Something different

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:13.790
than financial crises.

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:16.560
I wanted your thoughts
on banking rules

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.010
and how they relate to
the recent legalization

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.630
of marijuana in
Washington and Colorado,

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:24.920
and whether there's
a way for those rules

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.410
to be adjusted so
those states can

00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:28.000
make their democratic
experiment,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.550
or would that be
a loophole that's

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:31.217
too dangerous for the
system as a whole?

00:45:31.217 --> 00:45:33.549
FEMALE SPEAKER: What are your
thoughts on that Bitcoins,

00:45:33.549 --> 00:45:35.536
and should I put
all my money in it?

00:45:35.536 --> 00:45:36.036
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:36.036 --> 00:45:36.304
HANK PAULSON: What's that?

00:45:36.304 --> 00:45:36.804
I missed it.

00:45:36.804 --> 00:45:38.495
FEMALE SPEAKER: On Bitcoins.

00:45:38.495 --> 00:45:39.620
HANK PAULSON: Oh, Bitcoins.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.350
OK.

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:44.200
So, this is going to be--
these are going to be easy

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:48.440
because there's two
questions I can answer.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:53.540
There's two I don't really
have terrific answers for,

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.720
but so let me
start with the two.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:46:00.110
First of all, on the
question I-- one question,

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:02.450
the idea whether the
documentary, which

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:06.400
is, I think a
terrific question--

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:12.681
is the one about
capitalizing the banks,

00:46:12.681 --> 00:46:13.805
and why weren't we harsher?

00:46:17.106 --> 00:46:23.420
And again, I believe that
institutions, when they fail,

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.350
they should bear
the consequences.

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:28.200
But financial
institutions, in the middle

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.410
of a crisis-- let me say, no
bank is too big to liquidate.

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:35.170
Almost any bank is too
big to liquidate quickly

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:37.340
in the middle of a
crisis, any bank of size.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.650
And I think what people didn't
understand about our capital

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:47.050
program is that traditionally
what has been done

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:50.920
is, during a crisis when
an institution fails,

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:51.989
you nationalize it.

00:46:51.989 --> 00:46:53.530
And when you
nationalize it, then you

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:55.330
can have all kinds
of restrictions

00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:56.570
you can place on it.

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:58.930
But we did something that
had never been done before,

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:01.950
that I can find in history.

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:05.770
Before institutions went
down, we went out very quickly

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:09.020
and we recapitalized
the banking system.

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:13.400
And if you don't do that-- and
we did with attractive terms.

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:20.300
If we had tough terms, banks
wouldn't take the capital

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.990
until they're ready to fail.

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:23.902
Everyone's the
tallest midget when

00:47:23.902 --> 00:47:25.610
you're going through
something like that.

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:28.050
So what we did was
we did something,

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:30.630
and if you want to know
why our stress tests work,

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:33.550
why our financial
systems come back,

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.870
why our economies come
back better than Europeans,

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:40.170
it's because what
they did was they

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:43.540
were very tough with the terms,
but they nationalized them.

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.920
And so that's one of the
biggest reasons why what we did

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:46.690
was unpopular.

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.240
It's pretty hard
to punish and save

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.700
the banks at the
same time, and I

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:57.220
know that the
American public wanted

00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:00.080
us to hold them accountable.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:02.930
But I tilted toward
the sides of stability.

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:04.640
Now I've got to
tell you, in terms

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:11.870
of your question about marijuana
and the banking system,

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:13.243
I don't have a clue.

00:48:13.243 --> 00:48:14.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.746
I've got a daughter--
the closest I am to it

00:48:16.746 --> 00:48:20.847
is I got a daughter-- with
her husband and her kids-- who

00:48:20.847 --> 00:48:22.430
lives in Boulder and
I was just skiing

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:23.850
with them over the weekend.

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:26.250
And the power was up
to here, it was great.

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:32.310
We were talking about what this
experiment is doing in Boulder.

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:34.570
We had quite a
family debate on it,

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:37.110
you can imagine looking at
me what side of the debate

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:38.580
I came down on.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:39.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.650
But in any event.

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:42.437
I don't know.

00:48:45.706 --> 00:48:49.750
In terms of the question
about what things

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:52.440
I'm most concerned about.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:58.200
What I am most concerned about,
in terms of the obvious masses

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.520
that we haven't dealt with,
is Fannie and Freddie.

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:05.520
We haven't dealt with housing
policy in the United States.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.490
And I'm not against
home ownership,

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:09.080
I'm all for home ownership.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.690
But why is it fair
that any of us

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:14.790
could deduct interest on
a $1 million mortgage?

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:16.400
How is that fair to renters?

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.500
Why does that make sense?

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.410
And if you look at that, and
Fannie and Freddie, and the FHA

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:25.570
programs, when the government is
backing almost every mortgage,

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:27.660
then the markets aren't working.

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:33.340
And there's just not-- so
I'm concerned about that,

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:37.170
but I'm even more
concerned, longer term,

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:40.030
we need to put some
policies in place

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.750
that are going to give us
sustainable economic growth.

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:45.480
And in terms of the
Bitcoin, I think

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:48.520
you could probably find
it strange for someone

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.520
in my position-- I
haven't studied it.

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.090
I'm suspicious about it.

00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:03.550
And maybe I just don't know
enough about it, but as I said,

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:10.840
I am for innovation in a whole
lot of areas, and for change.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.840
When I ran Goldman
Sachs, all the time

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.050
I was just telling
people constantly how

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:16.480
they had to welcome change.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.270
But when you look
at rapid change

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:24.690
when it comes to markets,
and when it comes to finance,

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:26.640
I think innovation
is something we

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.510
have to be very careful
about, because when you get

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:35.050
extreme volatility and when you
get either extreme volatility

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:42.890
or complexity, it can really
hurt people and undermine

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:45.000
their financial security.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.830
So let's say this
is an amazing group

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:51.160
and you had terrific questions.

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:51.927
Thank you.

00:50:51.927 --> 00:50:58.509
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:58.509 --> 00:51:00.050
MARY GROVE: For
everyone in the room,

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:01.590
I really appreciate
you joining us,

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:04.310
and I highly encourage you
to check out the documentary

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:05.740
"Hank: 5 Years from the Brink."

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.300
It's available on Netflix,
and Secretary Paulson,

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:10.420
thank you for your
service to our country

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.890
and for joining us
at Google today.

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:13.530
HANK PAULSON: And
Mary, thank you.

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:16.574
This has been a lot easier
than a congressional hearing.

00:51:16.574 --> 00:51:17.074
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:18.550
