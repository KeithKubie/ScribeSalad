00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:09.660
We usually think of rhythm
as an element of music,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.615
but it's actually found everywhere in
the world around us,

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:15.060
from the ocean tides
to our own heartbeats,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.066
rhythm is essentially an event repeating
regularly over time.

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:22.091
Even the ticking of a clock itself
is a sort of rhythm.

00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:23.320
But for musical rhythm,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.826
a steady string of repeating single
beats is not enough.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:30.790
For that, we need at least one opposing
beat with a different sound,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.064
which can be the unstressed off beat
or the accented back beat.

00:00:35.064 --> 00:00:37.544
There are several ways to make
these beats distinct,

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:43.419
whether by using high and low drums,
or long and short beats.

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:47.345
Which ends up being heard as the main
beat is not a precise rule,

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:52.334
but like the famous Rubin's vase, can be
reversed depending on cultural perception.

00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:56.411
In standard notation, rhythm is indicated
on a musical bar line,

00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:57.833
but there are other ways.

00:00:57.833 --> 00:00:59.440
Remember that ticking clock?

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.446
Just as its round face can trace the
linear passage of time,

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:05.399
the flow of rhythm can be 
traced in a circle.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.998
The continuity of a wheel can be
a more intuitive way to visualize rhythm

00:01:08.998 --> 00:01:13.016
than a linear score that requires moving
back and forth along the page.

00:01:13.016 --> 00:01:15.968
We can mark the beats at different
positions around the circle

00:01:15.968 --> 00:01:19.841
using blue dots for main beats,
orange ones for off beats,

00:01:19.841 --> 00:01:22.358
and white dots for secondary beats.

00:01:22.358 --> 00:01:29.987
Here is a basic two beat rhythm with
a main beat and an opposing off beat.

00:01:29.987 --> 00:01:38.195
Or a three beat rhythm with a main beat,
an off beat, and a secondary beat.

00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:42.162
And the spaces between each beat
can be divided into further sub-beats

00:01:42.162 --> 00:01:44.805
using multiples of either two or three.

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:47.433
Layering multiple patterns using
concentric wheels

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:49.961
lets us create more complex rhythms.

00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:53.577
For example, we can combine a basic 
two beat rhythm with off beats

00:01:53.577 --> 00:01:56.913
to get a four beat system.

00:01:56.913 --> 00:02:01.320
This is the recognizable backbone of
many genres popular around the world,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.268
from rock,

00:02:04.268 --> 00:02:06.800
country,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.538
and jazz,

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:12.810
to reggae

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.142
and cumbia.

00:02:15.142 --> 00:02:22.215
Or we can combine a two beat
rhythm with a three beat one.

00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:25.684
Eliminating the extra main beat
and rotating the inner wheel

00:02:25.684 --> 00:02:32.065
leaves us with a rhythm whose 
underlying feel is three-four.

00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:39.126
This is the basis of the music of
Whirling Dervishes,

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:41.772
as well as a broad range of 
Latin American rhythms,

00:02:41.772 --> 00:02:48.602
such as Joropo,

00:02:48.602 --> 00:03:00.419
and even Bach's famous Chaconne.

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.769
Now if we remember Rubin's vase
and hear the off beats as the main beats,

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.566
this will give us a six-eight feel,

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:10.779
as found in genres such as Chacarera,

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:14.455
and Quechua,

00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:20.333
Persian music and more.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:23.018
In an eight beat system,
we have three layered circles,

00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:37.073
each rhythm played by 
a different instrument.

00:03:37.073 --> 00:03:39.009
We can then add an outermost layer

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:41.647
consisting of an additive 
rhythmic component,

00:03:41.647 --> 00:03:55.850
reinforcing the main beat
and increasing accuracy.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.678
Now let's remove everything
except for this combined rhythm

00:03:58.678 --> 00:04:00.877
and the basic two beat on top.

00:04:00.877 --> 00:04:07.301
This rhythmic configuration is found
as the Cuban cinquillo,

00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:11.615
in the Puerto Rican bomba,

00:04:11.615 --> 00:04:19.194
and in Northern Romanian music.

00:04:19.194 --> 00:04:22.303
And rotating the outer circle
90 degrees counterclockwise

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:31.074
gives us a pattern often found
in Middle Eastern music,

00:04:31.074 --> 00:04:37.196
as well as Brazilian choro,

00:04:37.196 --> 00:04:43.695
and Argentinian tango.

00:04:43.695 --> 00:04:48.223
In all of these examples, the underlying
rhythm reinforces the basic one-two,

00:04:48.223 --> 00:04:52.223
but in different ways depending on 
arrangement and cultural context.

00:04:52.223 --> 00:04:55.440
So it turns out that the wheel method
is more than just a nifty way

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.670
of visualizing complex rhythms.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.996
By freeing us from the tyranny
of the bar line,

00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:02.511
we can visualize rhythm 
in terms of time,

00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:06.889
and a simple turn of the wheel can take us
on a musical journey around the world.
