there are way tricks that people use to

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760
there are way tricks that people use to
 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.400
there are way tricks that people use to
learn is to store more numbers that way

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410
learn is to store more numbers that way
 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.470
learn is to store more numbers that way
is it's very bored of the exercise at

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480
is it's very bored of the exercise at
 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.690
is it's very bored of the exercise at
learning I bet that relying too much on

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700
learning I bet that relying too much on
 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.970
learning I bet that relying too much on
your notebook or your blackberry or

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980
your notebook or your blackberry or
 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.510
your notebook or your blackberry or
whatever it does not help in this

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520
whatever it does not help in this
 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.470
whatever it does not help in this
direction because we are confident that

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
direction because we are confident that
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.760
direction because we are confident that
we do not need to learn but because as I

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770
we do not need to learn but because as I
 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.040
we do not need to learn but because as I
said at the beginning attention is very

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050
said at the beginning attention is very
 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.819
said at the beginning attention is very
important so if you do not pay enough

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829
important so if you do not pay enough
 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.849
important so if you do not pay enough
attention because you write that kind of

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859
attention because you write that kind of
 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.200
attention because you write that kind of
thing then obviously you will learn rest

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210
thing then obviously you will learn rest
 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.209
thing then obviously you will learn rest
so the secret would be just a minute

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219
so the secret would be just a minute
 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.400
so the secret would be just a minute
obviously if you repeat 10 times the

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410
obviously if you repeat 10 times the
 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.779
obviously if you repeat 10 times the
same thing you have more chances to

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789
same thing you have more chances to
 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.930
same thing you have more chances to
learn it or if you use association with

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940
learn it or if you use association with
 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.340
learn it or if you use association with
in what you're learning with something

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350
in what you're learning with something
 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.439
in what you're learning with something
else and you store this association in

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449
else and you store this association in
 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.090
else and you store this association in
in the brain then then you will remember

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100
in the brain then then you will remember
 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.960
in the brain then then you will remember
that particular thing better than

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970
that particular thing better than
 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.500
that particular thing better than
another so it's a there are ways people

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510
another so it's a there are ways people
 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.810
another so it's a there are ways people
uses and to memorize and and then there

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820
uses and to memorize and and then there
 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.290
uses and to memorize and and then there
are also exceed in our difference

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300
are also exceed in our difference
 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.140
are also exceed in our difference
between one person to the other for

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150
between one person to the other for
 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.210
between one person to the other for
instance I'm very bad with member

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220
instance I'm very bad with member
 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.430
instance I'm very bad with member
numbers but a much better will remember

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440
numbers but a much better will remember
 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.800
numbers but a much better will remember
geographical names location etc so I bet

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
geographical names location etc so I bet
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.090
geographical names location etc so I bet
there are people are better remember no

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100
there are people are better remember no
 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.360
there are people are better remember no
news notes in music than others depends

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370
news notes in music than others depends
 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.100
news notes in music than others depends
also what you like it what you don't

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110
also what you like it what you don't
 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.810
also what you like it what you don't
like just because you pay more attention

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820
like just because you pay more attention
 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.110
like just because you pay more attention
to what you like and what you don't like

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120
 
 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.450
 
as I said before the only thing this

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460
as I said before the only thing this
 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.850
as I said before the only thing this
issue is just to exercise your brain and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
issue is just to exercise your brain and
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.670
issue is just to exercise your brain and
just like you do with the gym nor with

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
just like you do with the gym nor with
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.510
just like you do with the gym nor with
your muscles and that's for sure should

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
your muscles and that's for sure should
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.460
your muscles and that's for sure should
help because the brain we have to see

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470
help because the brain we have to see
 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.389
help because the brain we have to see
the brain also like like an organ it has

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
the brain also like like an organ it has
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.820
the brain also like like an organ it has
a reserve so if we built up bigger

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830
a reserve so if we built up bigger
 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.570
a reserve so if we built up bigger
reserve and then when diseases will heat

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580
reserve and then when diseases will heat
 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.610
reserve and then when diseases will heat
or the main we program we will start

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620
or the main we program we will start
 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.170
or the main we program we will start
occurring you will have more time to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180
occurring you will have more time to
 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.650
occurring you will have more time to
compensate for the for the problem so it

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660
compensate for the for the problem so it
 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.820
compensate for the for the problem so it
diseases should be start later and

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830
diseases should be start later and
 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.570
diseases should be start later and
slower and just not that we will avoid

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580
slower and just not that we will avoid
 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.770
slower and just not that we will avoid
the disease but it almost likely what we

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
the disease but it almost likely what we
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.540
the disease but it almost likely what we
scientists think most likely happen is

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550
scientists think most likely happen is
 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.630
scientists think most likely happen is
just with more reserved in the brain so

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640
just with more reserved in the brain so
 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.890
just with more reserved in the brain so
that's for sure I have to say also that

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900
that's for sure I have to say also that
 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.450
that's for sure I have to say also that
although it needs to be confirmed

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460
although it needs to be confirmed
 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.850
although it needs to be confirmed
validated and one cannot exclude it to

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860
validated and one cannot exclude it to
 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.800
validated and one cannot exclude it to
end up like with the aluminum story that

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810
end up like with the aluminum story that
 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.610
end up like with the aluminum story that
you know people say that died like the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620
you know people say that died like the
 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.280
you know people say that died like the
Mediterranean diet with the present of

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290
Mediterranean diet with the present of
 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.860
Mediterranean diet with the present of
antioxidant this kind of stuff in your

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870
antioxidant this kind of stuff in your
 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.729
antioxidant this kind of stuff in your
type they should protect and against the

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739
type they should protect and against the
 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.500
type they should protect and against the
problem like health and this or be more

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510
problem like health and this or be more
 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.510
problem like health and this or be more
protected which does not mean again that

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520
protected which does not mean again that
 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.310
protected which does not mean again that
the does not mean that it will not

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320
the does not mean that it will not
 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.590
the does not mean that it will not
happen but it will happen there will be

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600
happen but it will happen there will be
 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.920
happen but it will happen there will be
less incidence of Alzheimer disease in

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930
less incidence of Alzheimer disease in
 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.100
less incidence of Alzheimer disease in
this population or a population that eat

this population or a population that eat
 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.290

fish and fish this time is obviously we

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300
fish and fish this time is obviously we
 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.940
fish and fish this time is obviously we
have to be careful because there's

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950
have to be careful because there's
 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.759
have to be careful because there's
things showing it but they might not be

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769
things showing it but they might not be
 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.750
things showing it but they might not be
confirmed in the future but that's what

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760
confirmed in the future but that's what
 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.720
confirmed in the future but that's what
in the exercise and eating healthy

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730
in the exercise and eating healthy
 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.300
in the exercise and eating healthy
it's not tell the memory also others

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310
it's not tell the memory also others
 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.480
it's not tell the memory also others
problems

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490

whatever you you like to do and it's not
 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.050
whatever you you like to do and it's not
just yet to take it like a pill now I

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060
just yet to take it like a pill now I
 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.070
just yet to take it like a pill now I
have to do trend across word puzzle and

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080
have to do trend across word puzzle and
 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.050
have to do trend across word puzzle and
instead of five it does not it doesn't

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060
instead of five it does not it doesn't

work like that it just to be involved

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250
work like that it just to be involved
 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.080
work like that it just to be involved
with your life and and being active and

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090
with your life and and being active and

not fortunately when sometime people

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489
not fortunately when sometime people
 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.890
not fortunately when sometime people
become all that they tend to be less

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900
become all that they tend to be less
 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.740
become all that they tend to be less
stressed out by life and they all right

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750
stressed out by life and they all right
 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.840
stressed out by life and they all right
that tend to be depressed so let's

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850
that tend to be depressed so let's
 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.210
that tend to be depressed so let's
involve less interested so that's the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220
involve less interested so that's the
 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.250
involve less interested so that's the
thing is just to be active mentally

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260
thing is just to be active mentally
 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.680
thing is just to be active mentally
active and to be mentally active I bet

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690
active and to be mentally active I bet
 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.600
active and to be mentally active I bet
you need to like what you are doing i

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610
you need to like what you are doing i
 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.130
you need to like what you are doing i
mean you cannot oblige yourself to be

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140
mean you cannot oblige yourself to be
 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.170
mean you cannot oblige yourself to be
mentally active i have to be mentally

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180
mentally active i have to be mentally
 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.740
mentally active i have to be mentally
that i don't think it works like that
