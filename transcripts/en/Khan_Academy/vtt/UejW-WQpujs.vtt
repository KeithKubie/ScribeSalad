00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:01.988
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.988 --> 00:00:04.082
Welcome to the English parts of speech.

00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:06.630
We're gonna begin with the noun,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.626
the lovely wonderful noun,
your friend and mine.

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:12.660
They're mostly what you're
gonna encounter in sentences.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.728
Most sentences in English
contain at least one noun

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:18.848
or a pronoun, but we'll
get to pronouns later.

00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:22.827
A noun is basically anything.

00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:28.506
And I know that's not an
especially helpful definition,

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:31.574
but we'll get more specific in a minute.

00:00:31.574 --> 00:00:34.070
A noun is basically anything at all.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.410
Now the way this is taught
in traditional grammar

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.973
is to say that a noun is
a person, place or thing,

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:44.522
which is fine, I think we can
make that a little bit sharper

00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:47.077
and expand that out by
saying that they are,

00:00:47.077 --> 00:00:51.152
that nouns are people or living things,

00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:52.725
places,

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:59.069
things, or ideas.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.063
I think ideas is the one
that usually gets left out.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:07.532
So nouns can be people,
places, things and ideas.

00:01:07.532 --> 00:01:09.533
Let's put that in action.

00:01:10.993 --> 00:01:13.648
So, this is Raul.

00:01:13.648 --> 00:01:15.596
He is from Argentina.

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:17.416
He is a penguin.

00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:19.870
Raul has big dreams.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.930
Now, okay.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.824
So, I wanna take these three sentences

00:01:22.824 --> 00:01:26.074
and find the noun in them using the test.

00:01:26.074 --> 00:01:30.070
So the test is, is it a person

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.702
or a living thing, a place,

00:01:33.702 --> 00:01:37.620
a thing, or an idea?

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.366
And if it's any of those things,

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:42.054
then it falls into the
category of words in English

00:01:42.054 --> 00:01:44.127
which we call nouns.

00:01:44.127 --> 00:01:45.823
So, sentence number one.

00:01:45.823 --> 00:01:47.573
This is Raul.

00:01:48.873 --> 00:01:50.069
What is Raul?

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.781
Well, Raul is a person or a living thing

00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:56.151
so we're just gonna say person so noun.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:59.069
Next sentence.

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.708
He is from Argentina.

00:02:01.708 --> 00:02:04.612
Now Argentina happens to be a place

00:02:04.612 --> 00:02:06.436
so therefore, it is also a noun.

00:02:06.436 --> 00:02:08.356
It's a kind of noun called a proper noun,

00:02:08.356 --> 00:02:10.900
just like Raul is but
we'll get to that later.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.868
So, Argentina is a noun.

00:02:12.868 --> 00:02:15.640
Argentina incidentally is a country

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.024
and the word country is also a noun

00:02:19.024 --> 00:02:21.962
because it is a thing.

00:02:23.488 --> 00:02:24.951
So, sentence the third.

00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:27.313
He is a penguin.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:30.951
Now, a penguin is a
living being or a thing

00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:35.223
so we can say oh yes, penguin,
that is a noun as well.

00:02:35.223 --> 00:02:39.903
So, you've noticed I'm
not circling he or this.

00:02:39.903 --> 00:02:42.903
These words are pronouns,
relative pronouns,

00:02:42.903 --> 00:02:45.807
and they can sometimes behave like nouns,

00:02:45.807 --> 00:02:48.256
but I wouldn't call them nouns.

00:02:48.256 --> 00:02:49.408
That'll just get confusing.

00:02:49.408 --> 00:02:51.652
So, these are pronouns and
we'll get to them later.

00:02:53.562 --> 00:02:54.763
Sentence number four.

00:02:54.763 --> 00:02:56.850
Raul has big dreams.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.266
So, here we have Raul again.

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:01.074
We know from the first sentence
that it's a person's name.

00:03:01.074 --> 00:03:04.289
So, we're just gonna say
this is also a noun again.

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.233
And dreams.

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:08.657
Now, dreams isn't a person, a place.

00:03:08.657 --> 00:03:11.153
It's a thing, sure.

00:03:12.253 --> 00:03:14.921
The reason I put in idea
as a fourth category is

00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:17.986
to get it stuff that you can't pick up.

00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:21.078
Like for example, so dream,
yes, dream is a noun.

00:03:23.058 --> 00:03:24.859
Dream is maybe a little tangible

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.023
'cause it's something you can imagine,

00:03:27.023 --> 00:03:30.526
but the idea of like a word like bigness.

00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:35.438
Or if you prefer, you know, size.

00:03:40.238 --> 00:03:45.052
The size of Raul's
plumage was astonishing.

00:03:46.202 --> 00:03:48.255
Look at that gorgeous plumage.

00:03:48.255 --> 00:03:50.473
It's a little penguin mohawk.

00:03:50.473 --> 00:03:52.455
(high-pitched murmurs)

00:03:52.455 --> 00:03:55.801
The size of Raul's plumage was astounding.

00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:58.392
Now in that sentence, size is a noun,

00:03:58.392 --> 00:04:00.860
but it's not a physical thing,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.290
it's not a person, it's not a place,

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.578
it's not something you can pick up.

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:05.644
It's an idea.

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:08.010
So, that's why I include
this fourth category.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.844
So, if you're trying to figure out

00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:12.950
whether or not a word is a noun,

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.614
just apply this test.

00:04:14.614 --> 00:04:17.760
Ask yourself, is it a person, a place,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.753
a thing, or an idea?

00:04:21.556 --> 00:04:24.262
And you, my friend, will be golden.

00:04:24.262 --> 00:04:25.944
You can learn anything.

00:04:25.944 --> 00:04:27.084
David out.
