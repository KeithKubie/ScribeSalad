00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
 

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.200
Farming, as we now
associate the word,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.880
has been around for about
7,000 to 10,000 years.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.040
And when we think of
farming, we imagine a farmer

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.550
planting seeds, and later
harvesting the crops.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.690
Or maybe having cattle that
they can allow to graze,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.680
and then using that cattle for
either meat, or milk, or wool.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.680
But there's actually a
different type of farming

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.990
that predates this association
with I guess what we could call

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.060
the traditional form of farming.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.740
And it predates it by several
tens of thousands of years.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.260
And we believe that it started
with the original inhabitants

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.900
of Australia.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.387
And what they did is-- and this
is why we call it farming--

00:00:40.387 --> 00:00:41.970
and because if you
think about farming

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.520
in the most general sense, it's
really humans using technology

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.560
to manipulate their
environment so it

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.680
becomes more
suitable for humans.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.520
So it becomes more
suitable for things

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.300
that humans might want to eat,
or get milk from, or whatever.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.865
And this type of farming is
called firestick farming.

00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:02.710
 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.530
And I think you can already
imagine what it might involve.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.050
It involves using fire, which
is really a form of technology--

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.140
or it can be a form of
technology-- using fire

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.940
to make the environment more
suitable for human activity.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.050
And so what the original
Australians did--

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.700
the indigenous
Australians, or sometimes

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.575
referred to as the
Aboriginal Australians.

00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:28.629
 

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:31.170
And if you're wondering where
the word Aboriginal comes from,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.320
you might recognize
some parts of it.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.200
Original-- you know
what that means.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.230
The first things.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.380
The things that were
there from the beginning.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.020
And then you have ab,
which is Latin for from.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.730
So this is literally
from the beginning.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.040
So when you say
Aboriginal Australians,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.540
you're really saying
the Australians

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.750
that were there
from the beginning.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.980
And so what they would do is, is
that we believe if you go back

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.260
50,000 or 60,000 years
before the first Aboriginal

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.280
Australians settled Australia,
Australia had much more forest.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.290
It still has forest.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.510
This is a modern
picture, obviously,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.510
of an Australian forest.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.979
But what they did is that
they set up controlled burns.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.770
And what these
controlled burns did

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.480
is that they cleared
away a lot of the forest.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.510
They cleared away a lot of
the brush that's over here,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.040
and it made it
much more suitable

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.467
for grassland to develop.

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:24.550
And the reason why they
liked grassland-- so let's

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.310
make a little cycle
here of what they did.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.640
So they have controlled burns.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.380
Controlled fires.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.390
Those controlled fires
helped promote grassland.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.880
And then once you
have grassland,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.080
that made the
environment more suitable

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.490
for animals that the
original human settlers

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.939
could essentially live off of.

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:48.980
That they could hunt, that
they could potentially

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.000
eat their meat.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.370
And so, for example,
things like kangaroos.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.250
And these supported
the human population,

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.332
which obviously, would then
do the controlled burns.

00:03:03.332 --> 00:03:05.290
And you see here-- so we
could have started off

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.900
with something like this.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.070
Someone provides
a controlled burn.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.010
And they were actually
pretty scientific

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.960
about how they did it.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.418
They wouldn't just go at the
end of summer, when everything

00:03:14.418 --> 00:03:17.430
was hot, and ready
to just blow up,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.700
and then start a fire that
they couldn't control.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.810
They would often do
these in seasons knowing

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.890
that it had a certain level
of moisture in the air,

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.340
it wasn't too hot.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.310
And to a large degree, by
doing these controlled burns,

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.770
not only did it provide an
environment-- kind of do

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.375
this firestick
farming-- not only did

00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:36.090
it provide an environment
that was suitable for things

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.520
like kangaroos, some type of
things that humans could eat--

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.050
but it also prevented
major fires.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.280
And you still see forest rangers
doing this type of thing.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.820
And there's some
reason to believe

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.550
that what the original
Australians did, on some level,

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.370
was more nuanced and
more fine-tuned than even

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.770
what we do, in a modern
sense, in controlled burns.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.895
So these controlled fires also
prevented major uncontrollable

00:04:02.895 --> 00:04:03.395
fires.

00:04:03.395 --> 00:04:06.080
 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.800
Because what happens
is if you don't

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.480
have these controlled
fires, then you

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.450
have brush building up,
year after year after year.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.050
You have stuff building up.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.420
And then, when the
fires do occur,

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.190
the uncontrolled fires are
less likely to be started

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.925
during the winter,
when the air is cool

00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:25.590
or when there might
be some moisture.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.890
They're more likely to
occur in the dry season.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.540
So you have all
this stuff build up.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.210
And then when the
fire does happen,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.394
it happens in the driest season.

00:04:33.394 --> 00:04:35.560
And then what happens with
all of the stuff built up

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.320
in the dry season, it just
becomes uncontrollable.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.350
One of the byproducts--
or actually there

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.930
are several byproducts of this
firestick farming-- we believe,

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.950
is a lot of the
grassland in Australia

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.320
now might have been
more forested before.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.080
And even when the
first European settlers

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.200
came in the late 1700s,
they were kind of surprised

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.700
when they went into what is now
Sydney Harbor and they said,

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.200
wow, look at all
the grassland here.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.570
It almost looks like park space.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.007
And then they would let
their sheep graze there.

00:05:06.007 --> 00:05:07.590
And they were
surprised-- because they

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.454
had driven out the
original inhabitants.

00:05:09.454 --> 00:05:11.370
And then they were
surprised when forests just

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.496
started to grow up
in that grassland.

00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:15.870
And it was because the original
Australians were actually

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.920
controlling that
forest growth to make

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.370
it more inhabitable for
things like kangaroos.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.370
And then when the
English settlers came,

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.440
they started to have their
sheep graze in those grasslands.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.610
And it also was responsible
for the disappearance,

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.180
we think, of many
major-- I guess,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.880
for lack of a better
word-- megafauna.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.510
So really large animals
that inhabited Australia,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.851
for really millions of years,
until humans showed up.

00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:43.850
And this is one of them.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.700
It's just neat to look at them.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.590
This is called
Diprotodon optatum.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.740
Or, another way to think
of it, the giant wombat.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.240
And there's fossils of the
giant wombat around 40,000,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.620
50,000 years ago.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.464
But they disappeared
with humans showing up.

00:05:56.464 --> 00:05:57.880
And there's multiple
ways that you

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.600
can think about why
they disappeared.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.190
They might have--
and this is probably

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.460
the case-- they might have been
more dependent on the forest

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.260
habitat.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.580
Or this was a more
favorable habitat for them

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.190
than the grasslands.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.610
Maybe because they ate
leaves that were high up.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.010
Or another thing is, once
the forest habitat goes away,

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.990
they were actually also
easier to hunt down.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.470
Or either way you
think about it,

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.261
they might have just
been hunted by humans.

00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:22.970
But we do see that
with humans coming

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.567
to the Australian
continent, you start

00:06:25.567 --> 00:06:27.900
to see the disappearance--
and this isn't the only one--

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.540
but there were several
major species of megafauna,

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.770
of super large animals, that
disappeared at that time

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.320
period.
