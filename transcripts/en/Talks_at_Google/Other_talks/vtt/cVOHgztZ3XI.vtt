00:00:04.449 --> 00:00:05.740
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome everyone.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.927
Today we have a very
special guest, Sean Carroll.

00:00:08.927 --> 00:00:10.510
And thank you so
much for coming here.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.230
He's written a brilliant
book, "The Serengeti Rules."

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.730
And this is his fifth book.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.970
And I was just asking him,
you've already written four.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.770
Why the fifth book?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.070
And it was just joking around.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.940
And he said, this is
an important story

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.790
that needs to be told.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.320
And there are things
that we've learned

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.860
at the molecular level,
things that we've learned

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.600
are the ecological level.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.150
But there are sharp contrasts.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.720
And it's a story of those
contrasts that he wants

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.420
to highlight through this book.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.090
So without giving
much about the book

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.110
away, without any
further ado, actually,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.660
let me just welcome
him to the stage.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.159
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join me

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.850
in welcoming Sean B. Carroll.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.992
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:00.450
SEAN B. CARROLL: Thanks, very
cool to be here-- first visit

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.141
to Google.

00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:03.640
I have that creepy feeling that
you know a lot more about me

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.556
than you're admitting.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.885
So we have to get there.

00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:14.380
And thanks for spending
your lunch hour with me.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.040
I'm going to try to tell
you a couple of stories.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.960
I guess my major hope
is that you'll come out

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.630
of here with a little bit
different view of life,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.730
and maybe just a little
more hope and optimism

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.950
about our ability to do some
things on this planet to put

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.940
her back in better shape.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.460
So my tales today are
going to largely take

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.460
place on the Serengeti.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.060
But before I go there, I want
to give you some context.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.530
In the summer of 2014,
I'd just finished work

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.440
on a film for the
Smithsonian Channel called

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.950
"Mass Extinction."

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.790
And in the course
of that film, I

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.490
worked with a couple
of ecologists,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.740
sort of examining where we were
at this time in the world's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.990
history.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.390
And I learned by going to
places like Yellowstone

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.770
that even some of our
most protected places

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.400
were having certain issues.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.960
And like you, I saw
headlines like in newspapers

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.100
about what was going on with
wildlife across the globe,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.220
and even stories like
this about the plan

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.780
to build a road through the
middle of the Serengeti--

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.470
a paved road through the
middle of the Serengeti.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.660
And really, it was just
my own personal concern

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.870
that maybe these places
weren't going to be around

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.590
or not going to be in the same
condition in a decade or two

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.630
from now.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.890
But I took my family
for the first time

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.790
to the Serengeti in 2014.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.560
And there we are at the rather
simply marked entrance gate.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.470
You sort of expect
the famous Serengeti,

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.520
that there's going to
be bells and whistles,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.920
and food trucks right there.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.760
Not at all.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.740
And in fact, this is the
view going through the gate.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.440
And as you can see,
it's a gravel road.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.240
And it was late
June, but the grass

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.440
was kind of brown
and fairly high.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.100
And as we started
driving in, I started

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.100
getting kind of worried.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.960
I'm the only
biologist in my clan,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.910
and they weren't seeing
anything for a little while.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.150
It's like, this
isn't the Serengeti.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.870
And we did see after a
little, while there's

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.740
a lioness in the tall grass.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.740
I thought, wow, this is
really going to be hard.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.040
You can't get out of the
vehicle because of the danger.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.466
So there's six of us
in a vehicle for days.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:21.090
And if this is what
we're going to see,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.400
I'm going to be thrown out
of the vehicle, I think,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.740
is what's going to happen.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.740
But as we drove
on that same day,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.090
we started to see little streaks
of green, little bits of water,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.092
a few acacia trees, and
then came over a rise

00:03:35.092 --> 00:03:36.550
and around a bend,
and this is what

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.490
it looked like with a GoPro
hanging out of our vehicle.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.960
360 degrees around us, virtually
all I could see were zebras.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.290
There was a big water hole there
that they were drinking at.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.820
I would say probably a
couple thousand animals

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.890
in our field of
view, and then up

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.166
on the horizon, a big troop
of elephants walking down.

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:56.040
This is home footage.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.539
I know this is a terrible thing
to do to your friends, which

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:59.730
is vacation movies.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.290
But these are all
shot by my family.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.970
So from that point
on, the Serengeti

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.400
have offered just
an unending canvas

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.540
of animals of all
shapes, sizes, and colors

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.459
from, sturdy little
warthogs to lounging hippos

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.060
and sleek impala and giraffes.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.140
What can I say?

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.050
I never got tired of
looking at giraffes.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.091
I don't know what it was.

00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:26.880
There's probably 20,000
in the Serengeti.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.830
I don't think I saw all
of them, but I saw a lot.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.190
I don't think I have to
tell you what this is.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.190
She shared about
half a day with us,

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.140
going up and down out of
her tree, eating a gazelle.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.010
And as I just looked across
this incredible landscape,

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.440
sort of a little uneasy
feeling crept across me.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.150
Because I'm a professional
biologist, but I realized

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.000
I didn't understand
what I was looking at.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.500
I've worked indoors all my
life at a different scale.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.502
And I know a few things
about how biology works.

00:05:00.502 --> 00:05:02.210
I know a few things
about how life works,

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.000
but again, generally at the
cellular and molecular scale.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.010
And as I got asked
questions by family members,

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.150
it started to get really
sort of embarrassing.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.620
Because dad, why, dot, dot,
dot-- and I couldn't answer.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.890
I've studied the making of the
animal kingdom for 30 years.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.220
I've worked on the genes
that build bodies, and create

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.890
stripes on animals, and
spots on butterflies,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.270
and things like this.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.830
So I know a lot about that
sort of invisible scale

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.000
of the world, but not anything,
really, about the larger

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.880
scale-- not until I
left the Serengeti

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.540
and thought I really need to
understand how this works.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.320
And I think especially
here at Google,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.110
the theme today
would be the numbers.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.850
What I was not prepared for-- I
was awestruck by the Serengeti.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.080
But look, I'd watch these
films as a kid and as an adult.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.810
I had read books, etc.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.850
But I was not prepared
for the numbers of animals

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.422
that were on the Serengeti.

00:05:59.422 --> 00:06:01.380
And I didn't understand
why, for example, there

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.770
were so many
wildebeest and so few

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.860
topi, which is about
the same sized creature.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.180
Now, what I do know is
that in biology, certainly

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.990
at the molecular scale
within animal bodies

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.110
and within our bodies,
everything is regulated.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.200
And what I mean
by that is there's

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.257
more than 20,000 substances
inside your body.

00:06:24.257 --> 00:06:26.590
And the amount of each of
those substances is regulated.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.440
Some things are
very, very abundant.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.460
Some things are
very, very scarce.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.500
So whether it's
a salt, or a fat,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.480
or a hormone, or an
enzyme-- all those things

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.780
are maintained in a
fairly narrow range

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.447
by processes within the body.

00:06:42.447 --> 00:06:44.280
And the same thing is
true of the cell types

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.280
in your body-- white cells,
red cells, kidney cells, liver

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.020
cells, etc.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.080
There's a particular
range of cell numbers,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.710
and those are
maintained as well.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.330
So everything is regulated.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.250
And this understanding,
for example,

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.790
of how these things
are regulated

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.990
has led to a
revolution in medicine.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.090
So the strategy for how this has
gone on for the last 50 or 60

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.560
years in molecular
biology-- the study of life

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.520
at the molecular
level-- has been really

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.900
to figure out the rules
of regulation in the body.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.000
And that's involved-- to use
a sports analogy-- identifying

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.850
the key players, which are
key molecules that regulate

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.720
a process, to understand
how they interact

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.684
with other things in
the body or control

00:07:28.684 --> 00:07:29.850
the amounts of other things.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.680
What governs their play?

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.700
And as I said, this has
led to a revolution.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.170
Because once you
know those players

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.870
and the rules of regulation,
then we can intervene.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.940
And that's what
medicine has been doing.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.120
And so to give you a couple
of examples-- what medicine

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.900
can do, for example, is restore
a missing player-- something

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.890
like insulin in the
case of diabetes,

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.280
or in the case of
cholesterol, regulation.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.987
If there's abnormally high
levels of cholesterol,

00:07:54.987 --> 00:07:57.320
to intervene in the regulation
of cholesterol synthesis.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.950
And that's what Lipitor
and other statins do,

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.950
which has transformed
cardiac medicine.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.722
So what I want to do today,
though, is ask the question,

00:08:06.722 --> 00:08:08.180
are there rules
just like the rules

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.240
that operate within our bodies?

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.320
Are there rules that
operate on a larger scale?

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.549
And that's really the
main theme of the book,

00:08:14.549 --> 00:08:16.340
is understanding these
rules of regulation.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.621
And of course, if
there weren't rules

00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:20.870
that operate on larger scales,
the talk would be over.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.420
And we'd be quickly
to the lunchroom.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.910
But yes, there are rules.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.740
I've called these
the Serengeti rules.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.198
But what I want
you to keep in mind

00:08:28.198 --> 00:08:30.380
is that these rules
operate all over the globe.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.910
You can see them
in operation there.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.659
And I'm going to use
sort of the storybook

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:36.846
animals of the Serengeti to
bring them to life for you.

00:08:36.846 --> 00:08:38.679
And then in the last
little part of my talk,

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.780
I want to talk about how we
can use these rules to preserve

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.740
or even cure some of the ailing
ecosystems around the world,

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.720
and hopefully, give you some
concrete examples of how

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.110
this knowledge is power.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.950
I want to start with a little
history of the Serengeti

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.420
that I think you might
find interesting.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.810
The Serengeti went through
various stages of protection

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.100
in the 20th century,
not really becoming

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.100
a full-fledged national
park until the 1950s.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.650
And really, tourism was
insignificant until well

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:09.590
after World War II.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.631
It's not the sort of thing
that people were into.

00:09:11.631 --> 00:09:15.220
So not much was known
about the place.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.082
And when biologists
showed up, they

00:09:17.082 --> 00:09:19.540
did sort of the obvious thing,
which is they looked around,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.470
and they said, how many
animals are actually here?

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.210
And the first biologist to
do that were a father and son

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.610
team from Germany named
Bernard and Michael Grzimek.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.690
And this is a clip
from a documentary film

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:34.960
they made in 1959.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.202
It will show you how they
counted all the animals

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:37.910
in the Serengeti.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.243
And that's Bernard on the
left and Michael on the right,

00:09:40.243 --> 00:09:43.454
with their very handsomely
decorated plane.

00:09:43.454 --> 00:09:45.370
And what they did is,
with two other spotters,

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.800
they would fly with open
doors, cross the Serengeti,

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.870
fly low and slow.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:56.160
And this in the days
before digital technology

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.810
is how-- this is also the
animation circa 1959-- there

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.020
you go, prior to George Lucas.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.421
And here we're going to get a
view of-- here they are flying.

00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:11.879
That's a lot of animals to be
counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:12.490
8, 9, 10.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.230
But that's what
they're doing, flying

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.430
back and forth in a grid.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.720
And you're seeing largely
wildebeest on the run here.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.470
But they're counting
all the large mammals

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.470
that they can see from
the air, big enough to be

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.110
able to be seen from the air.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:31.350
And they did this for a few
weeks' time in January of 1958.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.790
And we'll see a shot out
of the back of the plane

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:34.739
here in a second.

00:10:34.739 --> 00:10:36.530
All right, so what did
they actually count?

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:47.180
They counted 99,481 wildebeest--
not 482 and not 480.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.540
This is done with
Teutonic precision.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.560
57,000 zebra or so, 5,000
topi, 1,800 buffalo,

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.830
only 60 elephants.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.020
Because of the ivory trade
in the 19th and early 20th

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.760
centuries, elephants were still
pretty scarce in the Serengeti.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.750
366,000 large animals in all.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.017
Now, they were very
impressed with this number.

00:11:11.017 --> 00:11:13.100
And they were very impressed
with their technique.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.270
They felt that they missed no
more than 10,000 animals out

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.920
of that figure.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.770
But in a book they wrote, also
called "Serengeti Shall Not

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.280
Die," they expressed
their concern.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.290
They thought was there really
enough plains, and mountains,

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.990
and river valleys,
and bush areas

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.282
to maintain the last giant
herds still in existence?

00:11:37.675 --> 00:11:39.800
An answer to their question
would soon materialize.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.040
But it wasn't the answer that
they expected or probably

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.300
most feared.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.600
By the mid 1960s,
within a few years,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.190
there were changes taking
place in the Serengeti.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.190
And when this
young undergraduate

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:58.330
from Oxford arrived,
Tony Sinclair,

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.020
first came to the
Serengeti in 1965,

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.530
his intention was
to study birds.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:08.400
But he was assigned to one
of the first aerial surveys

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:14.040
to follow up on what the
Grzimeks had done in 1958.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.690
And in the course
of that survey,

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:20.290
it was realized that something
was going on with the buffalo--

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.630
that whereas in 1961,
about 16,000 buffalo had

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.530
been counted, there
are now 37,000 in 1965.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.480
That's a pretty big
jump in just four years.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.390
And so they asked Tony, who
wanted to come back and do

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.010
his PhD in the Serengeti.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.810
They said, would you
be happy studying

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:39.960
buffaloes instead of birds?

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.440
And he said, love to.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.520
So Sinclair came back.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.680
And over a span of
about a dozen years,

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.860
he did sort of this
first phase of work

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.540
that asked a few
general questions.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.590
And this is Tony.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.740
This is, I believe,
a sedated buffalo.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.140
Because he's not like
a buffalo whisperer.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.520
That's not a safe situation
unless that buffalo

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.947
is knocked out.

00:13:03.947 --> 00:13:05.280
Why were the buffalo increasing?

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.830
What explained the
great differences

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.495
the numbers of different kinds
of animals on the Serengeti?

00:13:12.495 --> 00:13:14.870
And really, the fundamental
thing he wanted to understand

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:20.030
was, why is the
Serengeti the way it is?

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.830
So he starts probing
this buffalo mystery.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.520
He continues to
take place in what

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.390
essentially became annual
surveys of the Serengeti

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.422
animals.

00:13:27.422 --> 00:13:29.630
And it's true that the
buffalo population is growing.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.770
In fact, it kept growing
into the almost nearly 60,000

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.180
by 1972.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.460
And so this was a mystery.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.680
Why were the buffalo
just blooming like this?

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.180
And so Tony started to
do some detective work.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.580
And you could think of the
same sort of hypotheses he did.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:50.170
Why would you have more animals
of some type on the Serengeti?

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.210
One first possibility
would be more food.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.641
Well, didn't seem
like it would be

00:13:55.641 --> 00:13:57.640
more food, because the
Serengeti is a big place.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.080
It seemed like the same
amount of grass was growing.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.525
It's a vast place.

00:14:01.525 --> 00:14:04.150
There was no sign that there was
more food in these later years

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.550
than in earlier years.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.520
What about perhaps
fewer predators?

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.960
Maybe fewer buffalo were
dying because maybe there

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.530
were fewer predators.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.780
Well, turns out, first
of all, Tony carefully

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.340
looked at what
buffaloes die from.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.580
It turns out they don't die
that often from predation.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.284
That's not the major
cause of mortality.

00:14:23.284 --> 00:14:25.075
In addition, not only
did the Serengeti not

00:14:25.075 --> 00:14:27.100
have fewer predators,
but those counts

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.767
revealed that there
are more predators.

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:30.350
There were more lions
in the Serengeti

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.080
as the years were going by.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.640
So we eliminated that.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.820
So how else could he
explain more buffaloes

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.720
if it's not more food and
it's not less predation?

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.980
Well, a third candidate
would be disease.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.590
Wild animals carry
a lot of diseases.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.740
It was known that buffalo had
a fair number of diseases.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.780
And one disease
particularly seemed

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.360
like an important
possibility to Tony.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.830
And it's a disease called
rinderpest or cattle plague.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:02.690
It arrived in East Africa
in the late 19th century.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.500
It hit cattle, so cattle
that are especially

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.620
being kept by the Maasai.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.780
It hit buffalo and wildebeest.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.710
So it hit both domestic
and wild animals.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:18.220
And it was thought at the
time that the wild animals

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:22.290
were the reservoir
for this nasty virus.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.770
The virus could
cause massive losses.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.540
So you could use lose
90%, 95% of your cattle.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:32.400
So this could be catastrophic
for any nomadic tribe.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.800
But in the early 1960s, Tony
knew that a vaccination program

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.492
had started in cattle.

00:15:37.492 --> 00:15:39.200
So that a good vaccine
had been developed

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.840
and a program came to vaccinate
the cattle all of these tribes

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.450
in Tanzania, for example.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.810
So could this be it?

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.720
Could the vaccination
program be doing

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.000
something that was allowing
the buffalo to resurge?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.140
Well, if you're
exposed to a virus,

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.590
I whether it's us
or buffalo, you'll

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:00.860
make antibodies to that virus.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.443
So the way to tell
whether something's

00:16:02.443 --> 00:16:04.700
been exposed to a virus
is to get a blood sample.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.350
And so Tony got lots
of blood samples

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.090
and then age-matched them
with various buffalo.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.850
And his first Eureka
moment was when

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:15.210
he realized that there was no
sign of buffalo being infected

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.910
past 1964-- that the rate
of infection had plummeted,

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.730
and the virus had disappeared
from the Buffalo population

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.150
the Serengeti by 1964.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.460
So certainly without
rinderpest around,

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.540
that could explain the
growing buffalo populations.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.690
So this was satisfying.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.930
But Tony also knew there
was one other species that

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:39.220
was affected by rinderpest,
and that was the wildebeest.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.610
So he started paying
attention to wildebeest.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.450
Now, he had been involved
in annual counts,

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.766
but now he was really
paying close attention.

00:16:45.766 --> 00:16:48.224
And so what was happening with
the wildebeest at this time?

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.400
Yeah, look at those numbers.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.910
So they had reached, by
1977, 1.4 million wildebeest.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:03.445
So they'd grown at least
five-fold in about 15 years.

00:17:03.445 --> 00:17:05.890
That certainly answered
the genics question

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.900
that was there enough
food and bush and plains

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.630
to support all these animals?

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.230
Yeah, there was enough for at
least a million more animals

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.030
than were there in 1960.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.030
So the wildebeest
were also booming.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.030
So Tony got blood
samples from wildebeest

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:24.839
and age-matched them, and
found the same pattern

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:28.910
with wildebeest as in buffalo--
that in fact, in wildebeest,

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.450
there was no virus
detectable after 1963.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.670
So the virus was disappearing
from the Serengeti.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:40.100
And the two affected species--
buffalo and wildebeest--

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.070
were booming.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.660
This also shattered the
notion that the wildlife

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.170
was the reservoir of the
virus, because the vaccination

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.730
program was only
taking place in cattle.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.230
So it was by vaccinating
domestic cattle,

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.070
it was providing the spillover
benefit to the wildlife.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.230
And the cattle
were not infecting

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.920
buffalo and wildebeest.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.340
So these numbers were booming.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.070
So what did this tell Tony?

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.870
Well, it wasn't just wildebeest
and buffalo that were booming.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.120
There were other changes
taking place in the Serengeti

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.880
that, by being there year after
year, a number of biologist

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.710
noticed and studied.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.430
Let me tell you a few
more observations.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.270
Let's see if we can
connect the dots.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:25.220
One is, fire is an annual
event in the Serengeti.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.800
But as they look year over year
at the amount of the park that

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.490
was burned, they saw
that no matter what

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.100
region-- north,
south, the plains,

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:39.310
whatever, over all, that less
area of the park was burned

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:44.140
and those fires were less
intense-- so fewer fires,

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.170
less intense.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.250
It was also observed that
there were more giraffes.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.440
This is just one
sector of the park.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:58.490
So giraffes were
increasing, and trees.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.310
Now, they could
tell early on there

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.780
were a lot more young trees
growing up in the 1970s.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.647
And by 1980 I'm
showing you a picture

00:19:05.647 --> 00:19:07.730
taken from the same vantage
point in the Serengeti

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.269
over several decades.

00:19:09.269 --> 00:19:11.810
And what it really shows is the
filling in of this landscape,

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.440
particularly with
mature trees that you

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.830
can see in recent years.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.230
But those are mature trees.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.280
You can see the saplings
growing much earlier.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:25.850
All right, so fewer fires,
more giraffes, more trees.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.400
How is this all connected?

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.670
Here is what Tony
was able to connect.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.110
So let's start back with the
eradication of that virus.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:37.800
That virus was somehow
suppressing wildebeest

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.650
and buffalo populations.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.430
So when the virus
was eradicated,

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.520
you got more wildebeest.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.750
What do wildebeest do?

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.370
They eat grass.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.560
So with more wildebeest, you
have less and shorter grass.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.100
In fact, they mow the grass down
from about 30 centimeters down

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.550
to about 10 through
their grazing.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.170
That shorter grass,
obviously, is

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:03.970
less fuel for fires when
there's less grass around.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.380
OK so fewer fires.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.600
Well, one major
effect of fire is

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.510
that fire, being
low to the ground,

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:10.770
is going to burn up saplings.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:15.554
And that's going to suppress
the growth of new trees.

00:20:15.554 --> 00:20:17.720
So that could explain why
you're getting more trees.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.600
And then these trees, and
especially acacia trees,

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.080
other food for the giraffes.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.890
So eliminating this virus
from the cattle population

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:32.120
set a whole chain of
reactions in motion

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.570
through the wildebeest,
through the grasslands,

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:40.560
through the fire cycle, to
the trees, to the giraffes.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:46.810
So if you asked Tony what makes
the Serengeti the way it is,

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.710
it's a million lawnmowers.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.720
It's a million
wildebeest chewing grass.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.880
That simple, mundane
act-- well of course,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.880
here it is during the big
migration when they're

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.270
making a 600 mile circuit
around the Serengeti,

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.640
actually mowing it down.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.590
And when they mow it
down, that short grass

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.350
provides habitat for butterflies
and things like that.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.730
The trees provide
cover for predators.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.180
They provide nesting
sites for birds.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:17.470
So this action of mowing
really sets the landscape

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.060
for lots of other species.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.560
So the wildebeest are central.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.470
They're the lifeblood
of the Serengeti.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:31.180
Now, I don't think this
is what you get from TV.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.580
I see a program, certainly
on the African plains,

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:38.500
it's not even a second before
you see a cat chasing an animal

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.460
and dragging it down.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.770
So I've not seen that
nice half-hour long shot

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:46.010
of just wildebeest
munching grass.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.560
It takes a little more
patience to get through that.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.540
And in fact, I have
to admit this--

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.190
I asked my family
to go out and give

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.515
these talks for
pictures that they

00:21:55.515 --> 00:21:56.640
had taken in the Serengeti.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.015
I said, I really
need wildebeest,

00:21:58.015 --> 00:22:00.780
because I didn't find
a lot in my own camera.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:05.790
Zebras, giraffes, lions,
cheetahs, leopards,

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.790
great birds, ostrich-- we
took all those pictures--

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.360
very few pictures of wildebeest,
because they're everywhere.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.480
So you ignore them.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.354
And they're kind of-- sorry,
they're kind of homely.

00:22:15.354 --> 00:22:17.270
So they just don't have
that sort of charisma.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:21.270
But they are the lifeblood
of the Serengeti.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.950
So biologists have
a name for something

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.900
that carries out such
an important role.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.890
And this brings me to
my first Serengeti Rule.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.090
You'll get a few of these today.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.870
And that is that
some animals are

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:39.132
more equal than others, to kind
of paraphrase George Orwell.

00:22:39.132 --> 00:22:40.590
There's a lot of
animals out there,

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.657
but some have a greater
impact on the diversity

00:22:42.657 --> 00:22:43.990
of the communities they live in.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.450
And the name for this is
called a keystone species.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:52.560
And this keystone idea came
from another zoologist working

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.770
somewhere else in the world.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.561
So this wasn't discovered
on the Serengeti.

00:22:55.561 --> 00:22:57.490
It was just recognized
on the Serengeti.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.730
And that biologist is named
Bob Paine in the University

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:01.340
of Washington.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.200
And he was studying
the intertidal zones

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.770
along the Pacific coast.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:11.990
And he found that this starfish,
this apex predator starfish,

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:15.380
was a keystone species in the
community along the intertidal.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.410
Because much like the
keystone in a Roman arch,

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.154
if you removed it-- which he
did-- the community collapses.

00:23:22.154 --> 00:23:24.320
It's a little frenetic
animation there on the right,

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.830
but the idea is
that some species

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:30.050
have a really disproportionate
effect on community diversity.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.570
And we call these keystones.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.290
Bob Paine also
coined another term

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.570
to describe this
sort of relationship,

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.460
this sort of cascading effect
of one species on others,

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.610
and a really strong
effect, indirect effect,

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:44.790
on other species.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.380
We describe creatures that
do sort of different jobs

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.620
in Nature, that occupy different
levels of the food chain,

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.000
as different trophic levels.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.510
And he describes this as
a trophic cascade, where

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:58.530
an animal at one level
is having effects

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:04.060
on both plants and animals at
other levels in the system.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.170
And that brings me to my
second Serengeti Rule.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.480
These trophic cascades
are not at all restricted

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.194
to the Serengeti.

00:24:09.194 --> 00:24:11.110
In fact, they were first
discovered elsewhere.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.650
And they were quite a
surprise, not the sort of thing

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.660
that ecologists expected,
that you had creatures that

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.920
had a very strong
effect on something,

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.160
but it was indirect, not
direct-- not a direct action.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.250
So some species have these
strong indirect effects

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.750
through trophic cascades.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.880
So I told you a bit about what's
going on in the Serengeti.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.670
At least one question
might've popped

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:45.210
into your mind, which is, all
right, so the wildebeest do

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.080
this lawn mowing.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.704
That sort of sets the stage for
all the other sorts of animals.

00:24:48.704 --> 00:24:49.750
They're a keystone.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.490
These cascades are operating.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.190
What regulates the wildebeest?

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:55.480
Do they just keep right
on growing past a million

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.154
and a half animals?

00:24:57.154 --> 00:24:59.070
No, because if they kept
growing at that rate,

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:01.069
essentially Africa would
be shoulder to shoulder

00:25:01.069 --> 00:25:03.000
with wildebeest right now.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.070
So no, that's not their fate.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.430
What happened was
they leveled off.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.730
They leveled off at about
a million wildebeest.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.600
So the 1.4 million was
actually the high-water mark,

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.000
and they've since come down.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.030
And why did this happen?

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:21.350
What regulates the wildebeest?

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:24.702
What maintains them at about
a million animals today?

00:25:24.702 --> 00:25:26.410
And I want to tell
you this, because this

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.580
is a really important general
principle about how many animal

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:34.780
populations are regulated, and
very important to conservation.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.120
So pay attention to the sort
of low end of the curve here.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.820
Here in the early years, once
the virus is disappearing,

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.260
they're growing at
the maximal rate.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:48.490
So I'm just going to come
right this-- happy thumb.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.350
They're growing
at a maximal rate.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.970
So that's virtually
up to the maximum

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.730
that it's capable
by reproduction.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.030
But you can imagine that
they could be regulated

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:58.840
in one of two major ways.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.090
They could be regulated
from the bottom up,

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:03.850
by the amount of food, or
really from the top down,

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.170
by the number of predators.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:07.525
So what's going on here?

00:26:07.525 --> 00:26:09.400
And before I tell you
exactly what's going on

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.200
with the wildebeest,
let me tell you

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.985
what's going on with other
animals in the Serengeti.

00:26:13.985 --> 00:26:16.110
And I'm going to show you
a graph that, for me, was

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:20.270
one of the most educational or
informative graphs I countered

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.800
in the scientific literature.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.560
It really gives me insight
of what lifestyles are like,

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.610
or life is like for
animals on the Serengeti.

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:32.330
And what this is is a plot
of the percent of the animals

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:36.337
that die by predation
against animal body size.

00:26:36.337 --> 00:26:37.670
So ponder this for a little bit.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.330
So animals could be regulated
by predation from the top down,

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.326
or by food from the bottom up.

00:26:42.326 --> 00:26:43.950
And if you look at
the smaller animals,

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:50.170
like the oribi and the impala
and the topi-- 100% predation.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.780
I mean, what do they tell
their youngsters growing up?

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:57.880
Some day, Junior, you're
going to be eaten alive.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.339
So that's the life of an oribi.

00:27:00.339 --> 00:27:02.630
But if you go to the other
end of this, with elephants,

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.960
and hippopotamus,
and rhinoceros,

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.390
you see virtually no predation--
no significant mortality

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:08.590
due to predation.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.600
So the large animals have
escaped, essentially,

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.400
the force of predation.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.840
The small animals have not.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.685
And they'll potentially
fully die by predation.

00:27:17.685 --> 00:27:19.560
And there's a little
bit in between here-- so

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.000
buffalo, maybe
about 20% predation,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.510
zebra a higher fraction.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.430
So there's really two
lifestyles on display

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.510
here-- either get big
and escape predators.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.650
But if you're that big,
you're, of course, really

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.670
heavily dependent upon
food, because you've

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.500
got to maintain that
big body weight.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.980
Or be small, but you're going to
have a high reproductive rate.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.802
You're going to
reproduce very often.

00:27:42.802 --> 00:27:44.260
Because if you
don't, the predators

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.150
are going to eat
you to extinction.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:49.367
In fact for oribi, at that
size, it's not just the cats.

00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:51.200
There's about 10 species
that prey on oribi.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.490
And that includes snakes and
large birds, for example.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.870
So they've got a lot of things
to worry about at that end.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:59.790
So where's the
wildebeest on this scale?

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.460
Well, it turns out that
the wildebeest are largely

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.029
food regulated.

00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:05.320
Let me tell you how this works.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.236
And it has to do with
thinking about these two

00:28:07.236 --> 00:28:09.470
different ends of the curve.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:12.390
When food per capita-- per
individual wildebeest--

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.200
is plentiful, growth is maximal.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.910
So down here, this
is a low density

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:19.340
of animals, and a
high growth rate.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.694
But once the numbers get larger,
the growth rate declines.

00:28:22.694 --> 00:28:23.860
Actually, it turns negative.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:27.292
The population starts to
shrink when food is limiting.

00:28:27.292 --> 00:28:28.250
And how does this work?

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:32.154
It works like a
feedback mechanism,

00:28:32.154 --> 00:28:33.820
according to the
density of the animals.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.840
As the density of the
wildebeest increases,

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.280
there is less food
per individual.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.830
So any kind of
stress, like drought,

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:43.010
will cause a reduction
in the population.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.410
But once there's been that
reduction in the population

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:48.230
in further seasons, there's
more food available per capita,

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:49.960
and the population rebounds.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.410
And that's what stabilizes
the population-- this sort

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:56.870
of feedback between
being limited by food,

00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:00.810
and being able to rebound
once food is plentiful,

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:05.902
or in fact Nature culling
when food is not so plentiful.

00:29:05.902 --> 00:29:07.110
And this is really important.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.193
This end of the curve is
really important for what

00:29:09.193 --> 00:29:12.100
I'll tell you about what goes
on in some other species.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.460
So this leads us to our third
Serengeti Rule there's only 27

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.070
of these, so I'm sure we're
going to make it by 1 o'clock.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:20.720
So the regulation
of some species

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.740
depends upon their density.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.570
So just ponder that
for a little bit.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.680
Now I told you
these three rules.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.150
And I've illustrated
them on the Serengeti.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.360
But the main point I want
you to take away today

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.100
is that every place
is the Serengeti.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.140
And I thought since
I'm out so close here,

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.820
what do I mean by that?

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.580
Most places have
keystone species.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.980
They have these trophic
cascades operating.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.450
And they have predators.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.310
They have herbivores, and they
have producers or plants--

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.150
green things that are the
bottom of the food chain

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:54.970
that feed the herbivores
that in turn provide

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:56.300
for the carnivores.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.220
And just to drive this
home for where I am,

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.630
I'll give you an
example-- a kelp forest.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:03.600
Monterey Bay is the Serengeti.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.510
And it has these three levels.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:10.540
And the big, fearsome predator
in the Monterey system

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.140
are sea otters.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.830
It's actually otters
preying on urchins

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.490
that make it possible for
the kelp forest to grow.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.350
When otters were
nearly exterminated

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.950
at the end of the last
century, kelp forest

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:23.430
disappeared across the Pacific.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:26.080
And just these urchin barrens--
carpets of sea urchins

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.970
were all that existed
up and down the Pacific

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.450
coast, all the way through
the Aleutian Islands.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.020
Took a while.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.666
This was a major
discovery by Jim Estes

00:30:33.666 --> 00:30:35.790
who's over at University
of California, Santa Cruz,

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.480
to understand that sea otters
are a keystone in that system.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.140
And it's the regulation
of urchin populations

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.710
by sea otters that allows
the kelp to flourish.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.330
The kelp in turn,
provides habitat

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.380
to all sorts of
creatures-- much greater

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.970
biodiversity when kelp
forest is present than when

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:51.580
it's not there.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.250
So everything is a Serengeti.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:56.670
And that's important
keep in mind

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:58.420
when we now think about
what are we doing?

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.480
How are we impacting habitats?

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.300
And what might we
be doing differently

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.770
in order to help habitats
be more productive?

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.440
So it's the same logic.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.960
It's the same
strategy as medicine--

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.720
that the health of
the ecosystem depends

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.420
on understanding the key
players, the key species that

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.380
regulate community
structure, understand

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.620
the rules of the
game, how they govern

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.214
the numbers of other creatures.

00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:23.880
And then we have to
consider what can we

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.340
do to either replace what's
missing, or fix broken links,

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.200
or not do things
that break links.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.020
So let me give you just a
couple examples of interventions

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.060
to sort of put these
Serengeti Rules to practice.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.990
So here's another Serengeti--
not what you'd think,

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.850
I imagine.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:44.000
A blade of rice is a Serengeti.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.010
I'll show you two members of
that habitat for a second.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.990
This is a plant hopper--
pretty small bug

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:54.567
that likes to actually
suck the fluid out of rice.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.620
So this is the system as you
can sort of think about it.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.744
And you can imagine that
when farmers see these plant

00:32:02.744 --> 00:32:05.160
hoppers, they can get pretty
nervous, because enough plant

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.340
hoppers can really
damage a crop.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.500
And so the practice
for managing this pest

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.990
has been, of course,
to apply pesticides.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:16.580
And after the Green Revolution
in the 1960s, with improved

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:25.040
rice strains, and rice
covers a huge part of Asia,

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.120
these problems
started to pop up.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.900
And so farmers started
using pesticides

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.640
year in and year out.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.090
And when they sprayed their
fields with pesticides,

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.990
they sometimes got a surprising
result, which was they

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:39.550
saw the plant hoppers
go up up to 800-fold.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:43.300
And they saw their rice
plants be demolished.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.390
How does this work?

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:47.980
Why would adding a pesticide
actually increase the number

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.720
of insects on your plants?

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.530
Well, first of all, after
years of using the pesticides,

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:57.769
the bugs have become resistant.

00:32:57.769 --> 00:33:00.310
The bugs would just shrug off
the pesticide pay no attention.

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.284
Why do they actually
increase in numbers?

00:33:02.284 --> 00:33:04.200
Again, took a little
while to figure this out.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.850
But the hoppers are exploding.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:11.790
And this is the visual effect
of what happens in the field.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.900
The hoppers are exploding
because actually, the pesticide

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.410
is taking something out of that
little miniature Serengeti.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.090
It's killing spiders.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:23.070
And spiders are one
of the natural enemies

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:26.940
of plant hoppers-- not
resistant to the pesticide.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.780
So that when
pesticide is applied,

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.640
the natural enemies
are killed off.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.770
The plant hoppers have
nothing to control them.

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:37.500
So pest management
practices, particularly

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.880
in places like Indonesia,
had to change radically

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.930
to not using massive
amounts of pesticide

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:47.020
but, for example, planting
other plants in and around rice

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.040
fields to give refuge
to natural predators.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.900
And giving those
predators a chance

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.940
to actually control
the bugs themselves.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:00.960
And that's still a practice
that's used widely today--

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.700
recognizing that having
natural enemies about

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:04.880
is really important.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.640
And that pesticides
are not, in this case,

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.900
is a panacea for the appearance
of these sorts of pests.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.219
So spiders are playing the
role here that big cats

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:16.989
play on the Serengeti.

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:19.730
I'll give you another example,
maybe a little more familiar,

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:23.090
which is Yellowstone
National Park.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:27.340
The observation that goes back
a ways that's really important

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:31.590
is that here's a grove of aspen,
a great symbol of the American

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.600
West.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.590
But some botanist
realized that there

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:36.164
was something strange
about the aspen

00:34:36.164 --> 00:34:38.580
populations in Yellowstone and
other parts of the American

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:42.710
West, in that most of
them were really old.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:47.110
There was very little fresh
aspen growth in about the seven

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:53.389
decades from the mid 1920s or
1930s to about the mid 1990s.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:56.650
There's what you'd expect to be
whole age classes of aspen that

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:57.720
were missing.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.215
So why would that be happening?

00:35:00.215 --> 00:35:01.590
Well, one of the
obvious culprits

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:04.520
would be the grazers in
the park like the elk.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:09.290
And you can see the
effect of grazing up

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.920
on the bark of trees.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.220
So why would the
elk be suppressing

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:18.300
the aspen so profoundly?

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.460
And one suspect would
be that there's nothing

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.400
controlling the elk.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.360
If elk are
controlling the aspen,

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.540
what's controlling the elk?

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:30.950
Well, we know that wolves were
exterminated from Yellowstone

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:34.320
in the mid 1920s,
so the possibility

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.520
was that maybe the
disappearance of those wolves

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.700
was having an effect on
the age structure of trees

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.370
and plants in Yellowstone.

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:44.380
Well, that was sort
of put to the test--

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:47.420
deliberately or not-- when
wolves were reintroduced

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.250
into Yellowstone in 1995.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.150
And now I can update
you 20 years later

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.950
on what's been observed now
that wolves have been put back.

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:57.390
So what could
possibly happen here

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:59.020
is that the wolves
could possibly

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.140
control the number of elk.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.910
And that might
influence vegetation

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:05.910
like aspen inside
of Yellowstone.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:08.700
That's exactly what was seen.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.920
So here's the wolf
populations, which vary

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.200
a little bit over the years.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:15.820
But elk have been pretty
much showing a steady decline

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:20.050
as they are consumed by wolves.

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:21.270
What goes on with the trees?

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.478
Well, you see a lot less
browsing in the upper right,

00:36:23.478 --> 00:36:26.551
and a lot greater aspen height.

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:28.175
But there are still
some more surprises

00:36:28.175 --> 00:36:30.339
than this in store
for the biologist.

00:36:30.339 --> 00:36:31.880
If you look at other
sorts of plants,

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.270
like willows that like to
grow along stream edges--

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:36.860
this is a picture from
the same vantage point

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.830
before wolves and after wolves.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:39.830
The willows are growing.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.140
Well, willow is
perfect beaver habitat.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:44.070
So the beavers come
into this area.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.650
They use the willows
to make dams.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.770
So whereas there was only
one beaver colony in all

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:50.790
of Yellowstone prior
to wolf reintroduction,

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.310
there is now up to 12.

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:54.500
So willow is rebounding.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.860
Cottonwood is rebounding.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.760
So there's been a
major effect, not just

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:03.930
on elk numbers, which are down
in Yellowstone by more than 50%

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.760
due to the presence of
wolves, but a big change

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.990
in the vegetation.

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:11.180
And that vegetation has a big
ripple effect on other species

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.430
in Yellowstone.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:15.790
So just restoring one species--
a keystone, this apex predator,

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:19.520
the wolf-- has had a dramatic
effect on Yellowstone.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.100
So the message I'd
like you to take

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:26.080
from that is that in
general-- and Yellowstone

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.700
shows this-- that
Nature is resilient.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.600
These populations can
come bounding back

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.060
if they're given the chance.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.110
Habitat, protection,
time-- populations

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:37.300
can rebound dramatically.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.400
Let me pull a few more familiar,
maybe some familiar species out

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.982
of history for you,
give you these numbers.

00:37:42.982 --> 00:37:44.690
And you'll know some
of these, certainly,

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:47.990
from the California coast.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:51.280
Here's a set of species
that had game protection

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.854
at different times once their
numbers were severely depleted.

00:37:53.854 --> 00:37:55.270
And here's where
they're at today.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:57.260
So look at the
northern elephant seal.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:02.530
It was down in the late 1800s
to as few as 20 individuals--

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:03.900
200,000 today.

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.530
Sea otter was down to as
few as 1,000 individuals

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:10.640
across the entire Pacific--
over 100,000 today.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.160
Northern Pacific humpback--
same sort of effect--

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.195
tenfold increase.

00:38:14.195 --> 00:38:18.570
Bald eagles since the
1960s-- 20-fold increase.

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:21.520
Gray wolf-- once re-introduced--
a lot more wolves now

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.600
in the whole greater
Yellowstone system.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.220
So given a chance, Nature
is quite resilient.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:30.670
Given that protection,
given habitat,

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.380
animal numbers can
come roaring back.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:34.930
Now, these are
individual species

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:37.350
that were granted
individual protections.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.870
What do we do in
the case of a place

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:44.090
where the whole habitat
has been deeply disturbed?

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:47.020
And I want to close
today with one story out

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:51.600
of a pretty special place
in the world-- special

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.630
because its history looked
so dire at one time.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.880
And it's in Mozambique
in southeastern Africa.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.870
Mozambique is a country about
double the area of California.

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.730
It has lots of natural areas.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:07.380
But it's had a
really rough history.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:11.980
So after its independence
from Portugal in 1975,

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.690
it went through a civil war.

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:17.230
And in the center of Mozambique,
really the geographic center,

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.440
is this park called Gorongosa.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.880
And Gorongosa was
a gem in the 1960s.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.710
It was a destination for
jet-setters like John Wayne

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:28.040
and all that going on safari,
and had big concentrations

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:32.980
of wildlife, like 500
lions and 15,000 buffalo

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.110
and a few thousand elephants,
a few thousand hippos, etc.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:39.680
So out let me take you
back to the early 1960s.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.190
I wish I had some of that
1960s music here for you.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:45.260
But just a little clip of--
I know these vehicles still

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.939
roam California, but they
don't roam Gorongosa anymore.

00:39:48.939 --> 00:39:50.480
So you see the lions
right out there.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.920
And people were going
to see these lions.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.503
And lions were the
symbol of Gorongosa

00:39:53.503 --> 00:39:54.850
and there were 100s of them.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:56.550
But then the civil
war broke out.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:59.530
And unfortunately, Gorongosa was
one of the main battlefields.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.860
It's where rebels
established a stronghold.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.400
There were lots of
conflicts in Gorongosa.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.360
And so many of the
large animals were

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.690
shot, either for
meat, for poaching,

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:14.160
or just as collateral
damage to the conflict.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.330
So let me show you
the numbers of animals

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.020
before and after the war.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.310
So before the war
is the blue bars.

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:25.560
You can see the buffalo
up there around 14,000.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.310
We're down here
to fewer than 100.

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:30.350
Elephants in the
thousands-- again,

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:33.290
small numbers, hippos
decimated, waterbuck decimated,

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:36.190
zebra almost cleared out.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:40.580
There were no detectable lions
in the park in the year 2000.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.820
So this, I think, is decimation.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:48.020
But that was the
way Gorongosa was

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.630
after the civil war, and the
way it would probably remain,

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.840
were it not for an American
philanthropist named

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.371
Greg Carr, who learned
about Mozambique,

00:40:55.371 --> 00:40:56.370
learned about Gorongosa.

00:40:59.892 --> 00:41:01.350
I wanted to show
you what Gorongosa

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:02.558
looked like at the time, too.

00:41:02.558 --> 00:41:04.060
And this was the
status of the park.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.790
All the buildings
were shot to pieces.

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:08.390
All the vehicles
were shot to pieces.

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:10.850
But in 2004, Greg
Carr came along

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:13.360
and signed an agreement, a
joint management agreement,

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.990
with the Mozambique
government to try to restore

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.990
Gorongosa National Park.

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:19.400
And the goal was
really twofold--

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:24.040
to restore the park as an
economic engine in the area,

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.740
and to do a lot of
human development

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.154
around the park in the
form of clinics, schools.

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:31.820
Because the infrastructure
of Mozambique

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.610
had really been
abandoned-- neglected

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.150
for more than 30 years.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:42.410
So Carr committed to a long-term
joint management project

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:45.710
with Mozambique.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.190
He's now about 12
years into this.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:49.700
I visited Gorongosa last summer.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.630
So if you'll forgive me, this
is not quite National Geographic

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:53.600
quality film.

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.100
I'll tell you what's
going on in Gorongosa now.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.490
I'm hanging out of a helicopter
with a handheld camera,

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:01.630
so give you some sense of
what this place is like.

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:03.310
So the major
feature of Gorongosa

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:07.080
is a huge lake at its
center called Lake Urema.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.460
It fills and floods
during the wet season.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.994
And then as that water shrinks,
and all the silt that's

00:42:11.994 --> 00:42:13.910
been carried down from
the mountains is there,

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:16.170
it creates this giant
salad bowl which

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.530
we're kind of tilting over.

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:20.196
And you can see some of the dots
and some of the animals running

00:42:20.196 --> 00:42:23.360
are largely water buck, out
feeding on this gigantic salad

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:23.950
bowl.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:27.070
And you see these little fingers
of waterways through there.

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:31.050
There's a pretty good number
of crocs in Gorongosa.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:33.000
But it's a very, very
different landscape

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.730
than the Serengeti, really
different relative numbers

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:38.010
of all sorts of different
kinds of species

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:39.530
that used to be there.

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:43.130
Now, this is what
you can see in 2015.

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:45.590
We're going to go out over
the water a little bit,

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:47.120
and give you a
little sense of else

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.002
is floating about Gorongosa.

00:42:50.002 --> 00:42:51.460
You might just pick
them out there,

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.270
but here is a nice little group.

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:56.670
You guys make out
what those are?

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:57.790
Hippos, right.

00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:59.250
You can find them
on Google image.

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.880
OK, just help me out.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.970
And it's a pretty
big pod of hippos.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:07.510
And we'll spin
around a little bit.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:09.593
And then we'll go a little
deeper into the forest.

00:43:09.593 --> 00:43:15.384
And I'll show you a little more
of the wildlife that's there.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:26.900
And here you go-- so just
this group of elephants.

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.020
You can tell there's
a lot of youngsters

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:33.200
in here-- so a lot of young
elephants in Gorongosa today.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.050
So how have the large
animal populations

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:37.500
changed in a dozen years?

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.200
Well, the baseline
was back in 2000,

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:44.340
when you combined all the
antelope, buffalo, hippos,

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:50.220
elephants, et cetera, fewer than
1,000 large animals combined.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:57.330
In the last survey 71,000--
little more than a decade.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:00.340
So a radical change,
a radical rebound--

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:03.470
and what was involved here was
a little bit of importation.

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:06.470
Carr brought in a
couple hundred buffalo,

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:08.190
brought in a few
elephants, a few hippos.

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:11.090
But largely, this is the
rebound of the populations that

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:13.730
were already there,
just by being protected

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:17.420
from any further exploitation.

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:21.560
So the success in Gorongosa has
prompted an even bolder vision.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.620
It's a big park.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.640
It's a vast place,
with lots and lots

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.350
of different kinds of habitats.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:28.190
But Mozambique is a vast place.

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.400
And they'd like to have an
even greater protected area.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.360
And so the vision for
Gorongosa is to expand it.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.520
This is the current boundaries
of the park shown here--

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.610
is to expand it about eightfold,
create a giant conservation

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:43.860
area that will be about the size
of the Serengeti Conservation

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:46.330
Area in Tanzania--
an area large enough

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:50.840
to hold perhaps 10,000
elephants and about 500 lines.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.150
And that endeavor
is now under way.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:57.140
As far as the
Serengeti itself, I

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:01.700
am happy to report that
after years of deliberation,

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:06.220
the only roads going through the
Serengeti for now are unpaved.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.880
And let's hope
they stay that way.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.520
Thanks for listening.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:14.834 --> 00:45:17.000
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you,
this was a fantastic talk--

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.540
such a positive note.

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:19.980
We're open for questions now.

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:20.815
Please just point.

00:45:20.815 --> 00:45:22.130
I'll bring the mic over.

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:35.190
So I suspect that small
amounts of hunting

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:37.900
don't really impact these
kinds of numbers very much,

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.259
but they do some.

00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:41.800
But I'm wondering
about the trade off

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:47.040
between hunter-paid money to
these parks versus hunting,

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.790
and what your
thoughts are on that.

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:51.350
SEAN B. CARROLL: Yeah, so it's
a common practice in Africa

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:52.910
that there are
hunting concessions,

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:54.880
as these big lands
were carved up.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.730
Some of these go
back many decades

00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:00.510
that certain areas are
leased to concessionaires

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:03.020
that run hunting operations.

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:06.180
That can be an important source
of currency for management

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.220
in those countries.

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:10.400
We all know the
pretty famous case

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.930
of Cecil the lion, which
was not a good story.

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:18.340
But in the vast Gorongosa area,
in the map I just showed you,

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:22.120
there are, in fact, a
couple hunting concessions.

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:25.620
So as long as you know
what's being taken,

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:29.190
and there's some
reliable census,

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:34.890
you can sort of figure out what
amount of take can be managed.

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:39.600
In things like waterbuck, you'd
have to kill a lot of waterbuck

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.066
to probably dent the system.

00:46:41.066 --> 00:46:42.940
When you think of top
predators, there's only

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:46.160
63 lions in Gorongosa today.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.210
So that's just way too
few relative to history.

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:52.920
There are no leopards in
Gorongosa in the main park.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.860
There are no hyena-- really
another important predator.

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:59.130
So certainly at
the moment, nobody

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:02.960
wants to see those
animals taken by hunting.

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:07.330
So it's just a part of, I
think, the practical reality--

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:08.850
that it's a source of revenue.

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:12.200
And revenue really matters
in these parts of the world.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.720
But by the same token, the
deer hunt in Wisconsin,

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:19.290
which I think we issue 600,000
permits for a nine-day season

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:22.000
in November, that pays for
virtually all the management

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.500
activities of all the other
wildlife in the state.

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.310
So I think that, again, if you
have good scientific management

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:34.470
of those game populations, then
a certain amount of hunting

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:36.640
may be manageable.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.100
In the Serengeti,
there's always wildebeest

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:45.490
being taken by the
native Tanzanians.

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:48.912
But as long as it doesn't exceed
maybe 20,000 or 30,000 animals

00:47:48.912 --> 00:47:50.120
a year, it won't make a dent.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.707
They'll actually be replenished.

00:47:51.707 --> 00:47:53.790
So there's a certain amount
of sustainable hunting

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:54.456
that's possible.

00:47:58.074 --> 00:47:59.990
AUDIENCE: Except for
your first example, which

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:02.810
is the biggest one, most
of the keystone species

00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:03.920
are actually predators.

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:04.230
SEAN B. CARROLL: Yes.

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:05.605
AUDIENCE: Are
there special rules

00:48:05.605 --> 00:48:08.484
about the non-predator
species being keystones?

00:48:08.484 --> 00:48:10.400
And it seems like it's
harder to restore them.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.440
It's more like an unusual
situation, possibly.

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.599
SEAN B. CARROLL: Yeah, I
think the non-predators

00:48:15.599 --> 00:48:17.890
become keystones when they're
especially kind of what's

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:19.200
called ecosystem engineers.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:23.200
So wildebeest, by mowing a
vast tract of the Serengeti,

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.570
have a big effect.

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:29.760
In the Himalayas, pica
are ecosystem engineers,

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.680
and they affect the
pattern of runoff.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:35.070
And they create these burrows
that other animals live in.

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:38.930
So you can be a keystone
without being a predator.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.430
But as it turns
out, these predators

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:44.870
that have these strong indirect
effects downstream of them--

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:46.990
only fairly recently we
started to appreciate

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:47.930
how important that is.

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:50.980
In fact, most ecologists thought
that the world was really

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:53.380
regulated from the
bottom up-- that plants

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:56.210
gathered sunlight and
converted it to food,

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:59.940
and that the whole system
flowed from the bottom up.

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:03.020
And maybe predators were--
if there was enough game

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:06.090
or enough prey around, that
they were sort of ornaments

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:08.420
on the tree, not really
imagining that predators

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:13.430
were driving the structure
of these systems, as starfish

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:18.180
do on the coast, or sea otters
do, or as other predators do,

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:21.850
like spiders do on plants.

00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:27.172
I still think we're
still getting our heads

00:49:27.172 --> 00:49:29.380
around the importance of
apex predators in the world.

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.920
There's still a
lot of primary work

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:33.960
in the scientific
literature calling attention

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.900
that these apex predators
also are generally

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:39.560
disproportionately exploited,
at a much higher rate

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.460
than other sorts of populations.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:45.350
In the ocean, it's the big apex
predators like cod and tuna

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:46.830
that we like to eat.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:49.540
And if we overfished
those, those

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:53.640
have huge cascading effects
down the line in the oceans.

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.290
So yeah, a lot are
apex predators.

00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:59.200
And I think the
general mindset is

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:02.560
we've got to be a lot more
alert to what we're doing

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.770
to apex predator populations.

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:08.780
The history of this--
wolves, lions, coyotes,

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:11.770
things like this-- is we didn't
like them around-- humans

00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:12.910
so we killed them.

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:16.120
And in the ocean
today, the predator

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:19.810
that's disappearing most rapidly
are sharks, from both finning

00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:21.230
and from bycatch.

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:24.620
And there are people
who, of course,

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:25.830
care a lot about sharks.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:29.080
But we don't have the same
kind of emotional reaction

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.710
to sharks that we have
to manatees, or tigers,

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:33.100
or leopards, or
things like that.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:37.670
So we've got to be aware of
the role of apex predators.

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:39.860
I mean, look-- I
mean, sea otters--

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.520
this blew ecologists'
minds-- to think

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:46.280
that essentially the whole
coastal ecosystem depended

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.840
upon these furry little
predators eating those urchins.

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:54.043
Just turned people's
thinking upside down.

00:50:54.043 --> 00:50:55.293
MALE SPEAKER: Other questions?

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.510
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering,
do you generally

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:08.820
find that you have one keystone
species in an ecosystem?

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.855
Or are there sometimes
none or sometimes many?

00:51:10.855 --> 00:51:12.230
SEAN B. CARROLL:
Sometimes none--

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:15.990
so jobs seem to be sort
of parceled out a lot more

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:19.320
broadly-- sometimes multiple.

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.470
We're land dwellers,
so first, we

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:25.460
tend to study
terrestrial systems

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.030
with a certain amount of bias.

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:28.599
But out in the
ocean, it's kind of

00:51:28.599 --> 00:51:30.390
hard to decide where
all the keystones are.

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:32.300
Because it's a fish
eat fish world.

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:35.480
You have really vast
webs of fish feeding

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.500
on other sorts of fish.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.020
So we know that apex
predators are important.

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:43.090
But because almost everything
in the ocean's a predator--

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.050
every fish in the
ocean is a predator--

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:47.094
that you just have
really complex webs.

00:51:47.094 --> 00:51:49.010
And there's no way to
sort of clearly pick out

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:53.270
and say, well, this
is a keystone that's

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:55.390
in a clean line
connected to just two

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:58.090
or three other sorts of things.

00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:00.370
So there's lots of cascades
running in the ocean,

00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:02.862
but not such clearly
delineated keystones.

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.260
MALE SPEAKER: All right, thank
you so much for the fantastic

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:08.920
talks.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:10.253
SEAN B. CARROLL: Thanks, Google.

00:52:10.253 --> 00:52:13.430
Now enjoy your
tuna and cod lunch.

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.930
Thanks.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:16.096
MALE SPEAKER: Would you be
staying for a few minutes

00:52:16.096 --> 00:52:18.040
to sign any books?
