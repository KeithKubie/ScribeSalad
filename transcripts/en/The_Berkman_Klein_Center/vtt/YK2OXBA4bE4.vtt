00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.390
 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.250
This is the third and
last segment of a lecture

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.090
on the rights of distribution,
public performance, and display.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.240
In this segment, I'll
examine statutory exceptions

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.020
to and limitations upon copyright
owners' rights of public performance

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.420
and display.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.650
For this purpose, we'll be returning
once again to the map of copyright law.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.080
The first thing to notice
is that the exceptions

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.330
are embodied in a long, itemized list.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.600
The general strategy
underlying this list

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.500
contrasts very sharply with the strategy
underlying the more famous fair use

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.340
doctrine, which we'll be
considering next week.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.150
The basic idea underlying
fair use, as you'll see,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.750
is that we use general, open-ended
standards to confer upon courts

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.730
a great deal of discretion
to decide on an ad hoc basis

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.020
whether a particular, unauthorized
activity by a defendant

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.170
should be excused as fair.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.230
By contrast, the list of exceptions
to the public performance right

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.190
are, or at least appear
to be, quite precise.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.990
As we'll see, this approach resembles
more closely the European style

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.470
of exceptions and limitations than
it does the US fair use approach.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.340
So let's run down the list.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.290
One of the more straightforward
exceptions is section 110(1).

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.440
That provision permits in a classroom
a public performance or display

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.080
that would otherwise violates
Section 106(4) or 106(5) as

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.075
long as it's done live.

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:51.790
And as long as the copy of the work
in question was prepared lawfully.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.940
This means that when I
present audiovisual works

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.480
in the course of outlining case studies
in my classroom, I'm on safe ground.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.720
So as long as the material I
show was prepared lawfully.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.910
A closely related provision is
110(2), also known as the Teach Act,

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.716
which deals with distance learning.

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:16.340
It's a very good idea to how a
statutory provision that creates

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.430
a safe harbor for distance learning.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.380
Unfortunately, in practice
this particular provision

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.450
is almost completely ineffective.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.930
The first thing you notice about 110(2)
is that it's extremely complicated,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.900
contrasting sharply with
the simplicity of 110(1).

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.980
The portions that I
have marked with italics

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.640
impose upon a defendant
who seeks to invoke

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.700
this provision many quite
detailed obligations.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.560
Most importantly, 110(2) is only
applicable to formal instruction

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.280
of enrolled students.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.600
That's it's inapplicable to the
copies of these recorded lectures

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.290
that I make available to the public.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.120
It's also limited to
streaming of materials.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.900
If a teacher wishes to
invoke this provision,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.540
he cannot make copies of any of those
materials available for downloading,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.570
nor can he stream copyrighted materials
in a way that enables students to copy

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.900
them.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.230
Again, this restriction
renders the provision

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.980
useless for the kind of instruction
I'm trying to do in this course.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.710
Next, the provision is
limited to materials

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.690
that are not designed
for distance education.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.010
In other words, the
copyrighted works at issue

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.700
have to have been designed
for some other purpose

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.400
and then adapted to distance education.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.810
A teacher must accompany those materials
with instructions about copyright law.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.780
This may not be a problem
in this course, which

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.200
happens to be about copyright law.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.140
But it's a burden with
respect to most other courses.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.910
Finally, the teacher must adopt
technologies to prevent the recipients

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.330
from saving the materials to
which they are given access.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.560
These restrictions, when
you add them all up,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.380
are sufficiently burdensome that very
few distance learning enterprises

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.430
rely on 110(2).

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.870
To the extent that its purpose was
to facilitate distance education,

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.190
it's widely considered
to have been a failure.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.730
Now, it likely occurs to you to
ask how then does Fisher get away

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.459
with including some copyrighted
materials in his recorded lectures?

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.250
The answer is that some are licensed.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.610
But for the most part, I rely
on the fair use doctrine.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.737
Next week, you'll be in a position to
judge whether my invocation of fair use

00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:30.320
is persuasive.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.110
 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.280
Section 110(3) is much
simpler than 110(2).

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.240
It deals with public
performances of religious works

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.040
in the course of services.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.660
It's not obvious that this
exception advances social welfare.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.890
Putting aside the constraints imposed
by the clauses in the US Constitution

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.900
pertaining to the establishment
and free exercise of religion,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.600
and just doing the provisioning from
a policy angle, the result of 110(3)

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.290
is to make it a lot easier for churches
and other religious establishments

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.940
to operate.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.260
But it also means that the creators
of religious materials, specifically

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.050
non-dramatic, literary musical works,
don't get paid as much insofar as often

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.810
the principal value of their
creations is through performances.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.120
Perhaps the premise is
that religious composers

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.290
are motivated by
non-monetary incentives.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.170
And thus we don't need to compensate
them in order to stimulate their work?

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.670
Not clear.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.190
 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.520
Section 110(4) is the
so-called nonprofit exception.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.330
This one is often neglected.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.540
But it's actually very important.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.560
As you can see from the map,
it privileges live performances

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.170
of a non-dramatic
literary or musical work

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.830
without any purpose of direct or
indirect commercial advantage.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.020
Restaurant waiters,
for example, sometimes

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.660
sing Happy Birthday to patrons.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.200
That's not copyright
infringement as long

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.030
as there's no direct or
indirect commercial advantage.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.410
If the restaurant or the waiters
charge the friends of the birthday boy

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.770
or girl, they would not be
shielded by this provision.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.920
But as long as there's no independent
charge for the performance,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.450
they're probably on safe ground.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.250
Some years ago there
was a big controversy

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.940
that implicated this
particular provision.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.280
ASCAP, as you now know, is one of the
organizations in the United States

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.940
that issues blanket licenses,
blanket performance licenses,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.780
to many organizations allowing them
to publicly perform musical works.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.900
Foolishly, ASCAP apparently
decided to seek license fees

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.180
from the Girl Scouts in return for
permitting the Scouts to sing songs

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.360
around their campfires.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.520
This was a public relations
disaster for ASCAP.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.330
The Wall Street Journal wrote
a scathing article about it.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.690
And in the end, ASCAP backed down
and now grants the Girl Scouts

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.270
public performance
rights for a nominal fee.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.020
How did ASCAP get itself in this
position in the first place?

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.730
In particular, doesn't
110(4) permit the Scouts

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.022
to perform the songs
without getting a license?

00:07:10.022 --> 00:07:11.510
It's not entirely clear.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.570
But the answer seems to
be the Girl Scout camps

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:21.420
that the ASCAP threatened with liability
were charging for access to them.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.030
That made 110(4) inapplicable.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.630
 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.650
Now, we get to two related exceptions--
the so-called home-style exception

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:37.340
and the FMLA, which is an abbreviation
for Fairness in Music Licensing Act.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.490
The home-style exception
embodied in Section 110(5)(B) is,

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.190
as its informal name suggests, a
privilege for publicly performing

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.240
copyrighted works using the kind of
apparatus that you would ordinarily

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.190
find in a home.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.470
That's a little vague.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.050
And it's changing as technology evolves.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.740
But the rough idea is that if
the gizmo you used perform a work

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.150
is the kind of tuner plus
speakers that you would ordinarily

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.700
have in your living room, then it's OK.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.040
The standard is vague
and not often litigated.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.780
But there it is.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.980
As I trust you see,
this exception operates

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.330
to shield some of the
performances we were worried

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.590
about in the previous
segment of this lecture.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.770
Unfortunately, it's not broad enough
to shield stores and restaurants who

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.470
want to play music to
entertain their customers,

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.450
but need to deploy
apparatuses bigger than you

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.190
would find in an ordinary home.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.789
So organizations representing
restaurants and stores sought

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:44.690
and obtained 110(5)(B) commonly known
as the Fairness in Music Licensing Act.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.450
This one is extremely complex.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.390
You can read the
details at your leisure.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.150
The operators of bars,
restaurants, and retailers

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.890
when deciding how big an operation
to set up and how to outfit it,

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.410
pay lot of attention
to the details here.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.720
If they're able to stay under
these statutory ceilings,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.140
they can escape altogether an obligation
to pay copyright owners, particularly

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.740
ASCAP, any licensing fees.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.520
An alarm bell should be going off now.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.720
You'll recall, I hope, that
the Berne Convention requires

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.310
member countries to grant
certain substantive rights

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:25.310
and limits their ability to carve
exceptions out those rights.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.480
The TRIPS Agreement, discussed
in lecture number one,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.370
incorporates and extends
those requirements

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.560
and creates a mechanism for
punishing WTO countries that

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.860
fail to abide by them.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.930
May the US without running
afoul of those agreements

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.910
carve out of the performance
right an exception this broad?

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.620
The European Union thought no and
brought a dispute resolution proceeding

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.970
against the US concerning
the FMLA and won.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:01.090
In other words, the US, in this respect,
was deemed to be in violation of TRIPS.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.410
So did the US Congress
amended the statute?

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.440
Surprisingly no.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:11.560
Instead, the US responded by submitting
this dispute to binding arbitration

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.820
which resulted in a monetary judgment
the result was that the United

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.290
States has to pay the EU a fee and
continues to do so, over a million

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:25.600
a year, to compensate for the injuries
that EU copyright owners incur

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.860
because of this exemption.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.759
 

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:32.550
The last of the exceptions we're
going to deal with in this lecture

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:37.170
concerns not public performances,
but public displays.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.230
This exemption is contained
not in section 110, which

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:45.910
is occupied us until this
point, but in section 109.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:50.700
As we can see here, 109(C) provides
notwithstanding the provisions

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.620
of section 106(5).

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.520
That's the public display right.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.090
The owner of a particular copy
lawfully made under this title

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:02.090
to display that work
publicly is not violated

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:07.340
if he shows the two viewers present at
the place where the copy is located.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.450
The upshot is that you
can hang a painting

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.680
on the wall of your living room.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.740
And you can host a wedding reception
or a garden tour in your house,

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.460
enabling lots of strangers
to see the painting

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:21.390
without infringing the
painter's copyright.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.700
As you can see, this
is a major exception

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.220
and helps to relieve the otherwise
quite surprising reach of 106(5).

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.010
 

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.650
For the past several minutes, we have
been examining types of performances

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.420
that the law excuses outright.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.400
In other words, we've been studying
statutory provisions that give people

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.660
an unqualified privilege to engage
in particular sorts of performances

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.500
and displays without permission and
without paying the copyright owners

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.900
anything.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.330
We turn finally to a
set of provisions that

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.270
permit people to engage in
particular sorts of performances

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:02.380
without permission, but require them
to pay the copyright owner's fees

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.520
that are set in some
way by the government.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.860
As you know now, such provisions
are known as compulsory licenses.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.310
From the standpoint of
the copyright owners,

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.990
these provisions are not great because
they deprive the owners of the capacity

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.980
to control uses of their works and,
typically, though not invariably,

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.550
force them to accept license fees
that are lower than the copyright

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.620
owners given their
druthers would demand.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.950
But from the standpoint of
the owners, such provisions

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.950
are much better than the
exceptions we've just

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:39.830
finished surveying because the
owners are at least paid something.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:44.000
There are five main compulsory
licenses listed on your chart.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.740
These provisions give
qualified privileges

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:51.580
to public broadcasting
organizations, some types of webcasts

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.070
engaged in digital audio
transmissions, re-transmissions

00:12:55.070 --> 00:13:00.040
by cable systems and
satellites, and jukeboxes.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.750
The ways in which the
compulsory fees are set

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:07.530
are complex and vary considerably
across these provisions.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:11.180
Businesses that depend on these
compulsory licenses for revenue

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.880
or freedom to operate, of course,
pay a great deal of attention

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.190
to the details of the regimes.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.850
But I will not do so here.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.270
Instead, I will concentrate,
during my remaining minutes,

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:27.710
on the general, normative question
posed by all such compulsory licenses.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:32.600
What might justify using this technique?

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.290
The question is difficult and important
because you can readily see reasons

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.360
why governments should
not use this technique.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.310
As I mentioned, it
deprives owners of control.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:47.540
They must acquiesce in uses of
their works that they might hate.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:51.550
You will recall from lecture number
two that scholars like Rob Merges

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:56.570
sharply criticize compulsory
licenses on this basis.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.990
In addition, the processes by
which most of the compulsory rates

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:06.230
are set and collected are
expensive and cumbersome.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.190
The advocates of compulsory
licenses bear the burden

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.990
of establishing that
despite these drawbacks,

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.210
compulsory licenses make sense.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.870
How might they do so?

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:22.350
Defenders of compulsory licenses
commonly make four arguments.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:26.350
I'll describe them, note the principal
rebuttals to these arguments,

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.060
and let you weigh the competing claims.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.090
The first argument is
the compulsory licenses

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:36.490
facilitate socially beneficial uses of
copyrighted materials that otherwise

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:40.300
would be frustrated by
high transaction costs.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:46.030
It would be prohibitively costly, so the
argument goes, for jukebox operators,

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.780
say, to negotiate licenses with
the owners of the copyrights in all

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.490
the songs and sound recordings
they want to perform.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.896
The result is that were it
not for compulsory licenses,

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.020
we would have no jukeboxes.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.780
 

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.680
The retort is that transaction costs
are not as high as the story suggests.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.060
And information technology
is causing them to decline.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.180
So, it is said, compulsory
licenses are outmoded.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.410
 

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:19.060
The second argument is that
inequality in the bargaining

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.050
power of the copyright
owners, on one hand,

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.610
and these particular types
of users on the other,

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.080
would enable the owners
in an uncontrolled market

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.690
to extract excessive
license fees from the users.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.820
Excessive either in the sense of
being exploitative and unfair,

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.480
or in the sense of being much
higher than is necessary to motivate

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:46.080
the owners' creativity and,
thus, socially wasteful.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.560
Skeptics suggest that the beneficiaries
of most of these compulsory licenses

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.825
are far from being powerless.

00:15:51.825 --> 00:15:54.550
 

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:59.090
The third argument is that the ratio
of socially beneficial incentives

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:03.260
to corresponding social
losses is higher with respect

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:08.270
to compulsory licenses than with
respect to freely-negotiated licenses.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.750
We touched on this argument
briefly in lecture number four.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.580
Here's a brief review.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.150
Copyright law, seen through
the eyes of an economist,

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.330
is a device that shields an
innovator from competition

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.470
in sales of copies of his creation.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.560
At least if there are no close
substitutes for his innovation,

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.190
this shield enables the innovator to
set the price for access to those copies

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:35.510
well above the marginal
cost of producing them.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.170
The resultant monopoly
profits, represented

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:42.120
by the blue zone in this now
familiar simplified graph,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.920
provide an incentive for innovators
to produce their creations

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.120
in the first instance.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.770
An unfortunate side
effect of the strategy

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.370
is that some potential
consumers are priced out

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.720
of the market for
copies of the creation,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.220
giving rise to a welfare loss
represented by the red zone.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.620
That's regrettable.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.940
But we accept those
social costs in order

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.790
to offer creators
sufficiently large carrots

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:10.660
to induce them to make
things we need or enjoy.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:15.020
If administered sensibly,
compulsory licenses, it is argued,

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.790
enable us to improve on the system.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.260
Compulsory licenses
force copyright owners

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.450
to accept fees lower than
they would otherwise demand.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.930
That, of course, reduces their profits.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:31.270
But the loss is partially
offset by an increase in output.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.200
The result is that the
blue zone in this picture

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.360
is smaller than the blue
zone in the preceding picture

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.840
but not by an enormous amount.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.190
Conversely, as you can readily see
when the images are juxtaposed,

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.620
the imposition of a
compulsory license sharply

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.500
reduces the concomitant
dead-weight loss.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.190
The ratio between incentives and losses
associated with uncontrolled licensing

00:17:55.190 --> 00:18:00.510
markets on the left is lower than the
ratio between incentives and losses

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:05.520
associated with controlled
markets on the right.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.110
Opponents contend that the
administrative costs associated

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:12.980
with the system on the right will
exceed the cost savings it enables.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.590
 

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.750
The last of the four
arguments is the simplest.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.840
Compulsory licenses are
sometimes necessary, it is said,

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.050
to enable socially-beneficial
activities to flourish.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:29.590
This is a hard argument to make
with respect cable re-transmissions,

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:34.270
but perhaps easier with respect
to public broadcasting systems.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.480
The argument can be expressed
in the language of economics.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.280
Public broadcasting has
strong positive externalities

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.870
that the stations are unable to capture.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:48.910
So we need to reduce its
costs if it is to survive.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:53.520
Or the same argument can be
expressed in more moral terms.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.390
Public broadcasting helps
educate the citizenry,

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:00.680
generating a more informed,
responsible, and tolerant electorate.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:07.410
For that reason, we should and do
place a thumb on its side of the scale.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.340
You decide who's right.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.268
Next week, we'll take up fair use.

00:19:12.268 --> 00:19:12.768
