00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.930
Graph x is less than 4.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.350
So let's draw ourselves
a number line over here.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.755
So let me draw a number line.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:20.220
I'll start here at 0,
so 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.350
And we could go below 0.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.360
We'd have negative 1, negative
2, negative 3, negative 4.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.590
I could keep going.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.950
Now, we want to graph all of
the x's that are less than 4,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.370
but we're not including 4.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.250
It's not less than
or equal to 4.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.950
It's just less than 4.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.750
And to show that we're not
going to include 4, what we're

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.890
going to do is we're going
to draw a circle around 4.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.400
So this shows us that
we're not including 4.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.125
If we were including 4, I
would make that a solid dot.

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:52.960
And to show that we're going to
do all the values less than 4,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.060
we want to shade
in the number line

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.045
below 4, going down
from 4, just like that.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.050
And then we can just shade
in the arrow just like that.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.657
So this right here is all
of the values less than 4.

00:01:09.657 --> 00:01:10.740
And you could test it out.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.080
Take any value
where there's blue.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.510
So there's blue over
here, negative 2.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.830
Negative 2 is
definitely less than 4.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.670
If you take this value
right here, this 2,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.526
it's definitely less than 4.

00:01:24.526 --> 00:01:27.720
4 is not included because
4 is not less than 4.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.720
It's equal to 4.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.200
5 is not included because
5 is not less than 4.
