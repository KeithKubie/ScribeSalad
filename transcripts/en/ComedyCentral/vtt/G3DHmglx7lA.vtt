00:00:01.934 --> 00:00:03.403
(buzzing)

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:05.004 line:0%
- I'm James Davis back
with another Swagasaurus.

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:06.539 line:0%
Do you guys know what a thot is?

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:08.241 line:0%
Well I'm not talking about
those ideas in your head.

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:09.375 line:0%
A thot is a hoe.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:11.544 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
The word thot is
actually an acronym for

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.845 line:0%
that hoe over there.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.747 line:0%
A thot is someone who's
hoeing so much out here

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:16.783 align:start size:88% position:13%
in the streets that even
if your face to face

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:18.284 align:start size:94% position:6%
with this individual,
someone across the street

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:20.853
or driving by is calling
them that hoe over there.

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:22.788
Moving forward, if you're
hanging with the cool kids

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:24.624
or you want to sound cool
in front of your coworkers

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.893 align:start size:84% position:16%
use the word thot
to describe somebody

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:29.262
who everybody knows
is getting around.

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:31.530
Now if you're describing
multiple hoes over there

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.900
then you would use
the term thotties.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.468 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't know who the
original thot was

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:37.937
maybe Marilyn Monroe, I'm
sure some of the Kennedys

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.405
were calling her a thot.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.374 align:start size:97% position:3%
Maybe it's Will Chamberlin,
the NBA Hall of Famer

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.243
who once scored 100
points in the game

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:46.412 align:start size:97% position:3%
and also claimed to have
slept with over 20,000 women.

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:47.646
20,000?

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:49.248
He was a trailblazer
in the thot community.

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:51.750
He was getting it in,
he was getting it in.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.452
There's even a famous
family full of thots

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:54.920
that we keep up with.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.289
If you see what I'm saying.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.224 align:start size:84% position:16%
At the end of the
day, respect yourself.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.426
You don't want to end up
in a game of thot potato.

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:02.428
You don't want someone like
me calling you a thot pocket.

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:03.596
It happens.

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:05.297 align:start size:88% position:13%
So ladies and gentlemen
keep it together.

00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:08.902
Wrap it and tap it and
hold back the beast.
