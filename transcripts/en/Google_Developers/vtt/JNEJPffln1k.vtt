00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:11.050
Hi folks, this is Jeff Posnick
from the YouTube developer

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.130
relations team.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.900
And I'm coming at you
with another episode

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.840
of YouTube Developers Live.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.580
We're going to continue our
series of shows focusing

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.180
on the ways developers can move
from version 2 of our data API,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.760
to the newer version 3.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.126
And today's topic
covers something

00:00:28.126 --> 00:00:30.000
that's a little less
technical, but certainly

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.189
important for developers
to understand.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.570
And that's how quota works
in version 3 of the data API.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.130
So anybody who's had a
history using YouTube APIs

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.430
knows that understanding how
quota works is quite important.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.420
It is possible to run
into quota issues.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.530
If you're too aggressive
with the types of API

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.940
calls that you're making.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.510
And there are some
changes in how

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420
quotas are handled in
version 3 that we're

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.110
going to cover shortly.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.720
So the best overview of what's
new with quota in version 3,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.560
is that there's a
lot more visibility

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.440
as to what's actually going on.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.040
The quota in
version 2 of the API

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.810
was a little bit more opaque.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.520
We didn't have any exact
numbers attached to operations.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.630
We didn't tell you-- you've
reached 50% of your quota usage

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.200
on this given day.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.500
You just kept making calls
until they stopped working.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.720
And you got a quota error.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.310
And best practice,
at that point,

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.980
was to pause a little bit and
then try to make calls again.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.860
But in version 3, we have
a lot more information

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.350
that we're sharing
with developers.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.450
And hopefully that can
help you plan ahead.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.110
And make sure that you're making
intelligent choices about how

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.660
you're using the quota
that you do have.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.160
So, the first thing
to keep in mind,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.880
is that there is a global
bucket of quota that

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.780
gets assigned to each developer
registration in the API

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.370
console.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.995
Everybody needs to
register before they

00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:56.390
can use version 3 of the API.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.710
And everybody gets 50
million quota units.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.860
If you played around
with the data API

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.660
back when it first
launched, you might

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.520
have seen a lower limit
of 5 million quota units.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.430
We bumped that up to 50 million
quota units a little while ago.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.700
And that is something
we definitely

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.700
anticipate should be enough
quota for the vast majority

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.440
of uses out there.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.210
So the way those
quota units work,

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.960
is that there's
really a global pool.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.390
And every time your
application makes an API call,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.060
some quota gets
deducted from that pool.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.320
If you get down
to zero, then you

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.190
run out of quota for the day.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.850
There is also some
shorter term quota limits

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.070
that are in place to
protect a rogue instance

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.850
of your application from going
completely out of control

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.167
and draining all your quota.

00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:45.750
And that's actually
something that you

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.790
have a little more control of.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.920
Setting what you want
those per-IP or per user

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.460
limits to be.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.730
So, let's take a deep
dive into the tools

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.540
we have for understanding
the quota usage.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.420
And managing those
quotas and per-IP limits.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.594
And I'm gonna pull up a
screen share right now.

00:03:04.594 --> 00:03:06.010
And you can see
what I have opened

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.150
here is this page,
that we have a link

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.000
to from our documentation.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.150
From
developers.google.com/YouTube.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.330
You'll find it in the
left hand nav over here,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.690
under data API version 3
tools and quota explorer.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.620
And this gives you
insight as to how many

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.520
quota units each of the
different version 3 operations

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.730
consume.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.950
And just a basic rule
of thumb, operations

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.200
that are read only time
especially searches

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.470
tend to take very
few quota units.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.410
And operations that involve some
sort of writing, or uploading,

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.190
or deleting things tend
to take more quota units.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.940
So if I go over here.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.110
And say, I'd like
to do a search.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.160
And the only thing that you
can do with a search is a list.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.450
And you're saying you want
to get this snippet back.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.050
That's going to end up
costing you two quota units.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.590
So you can do 25 million
of those a day basically.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.190
The reason that there is this
column over here for parts,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.870
is that we do charge a little
bit more for additional parts

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.170
that you request.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.840
This comes, not so
much for searches,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.229
but if you're doing a
videos list, for instance.

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:15.770
And you say that
you want to get back

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.269
both the snippet and
the content details.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.740
That bumps it up from
three quota units

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.079
to five quota units.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.260
And the idea being, we have
to retrieve a little bit

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.350
more information
on the back end.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.460
So it's going to cost
a little bit more

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.330
for you to make that call.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.920
Still though, that
particular operation

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.726
cost five quota units.

00:04:35.726 --> 00:04:38.350
You can make 10 million of those
per day from your application,

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.300
basically.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.310
Let's try a couple of other
things, like write operations.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.130
If we're going to go
over here and say,

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.830
we don't want to do a playlists,
insert, and specify this.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.730
You'll see that this
is 53 quota units

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.680
for doing a playlist insert.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.130
So a little bit
of a higher cost.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.390
Because this is a write
operation application,

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.510
it can't do quite
as many of them.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.700
And again, still,
we think the quota

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.320
that we give people by
default is quite generous.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.490
And, finally, the
operation that ends up

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.160
taking the most quota currently
in the API is a video upload.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.890
And again, to specify
this part over

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.360
here-- maybe we'll put
in status or something

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.010
too-- that bumps it up to
1600-a-quota that that takes.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.750
So that still lets you
do quite a few uploads

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.220
from your application per day.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.720
I think something around 30,000.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.230
So that's not a small
amount, by any means.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.570
Even though this
operation does cost more

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.632
from a raw quota
cost perspective.

00:05:45.632 --> 00:05:47.340
We still think it
should be enough to get

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.920
you going for most of your uses.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.994
And I wanted to jump,
now, to some tools

00:05:52.994 --> 00:05:54.410
that you could use
to actually see

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.610
how much quota your
application that is already

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.490
live out there is consuming.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.950
And help you intelligently
plan for what's going on.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.930
And this is done via the
Google Developers console.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.120
So I'm over here.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.220
And it's a sample
application that I have--

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.100
accessviacloud.google.com/console.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.060
And I've gone over here
to the APIs section,

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.610
under APIs and auth.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.040
And I've chosen the Data API v3.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.770
And you'll see here,
this actually gives you

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.640
quick access to
the API Explorer,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.430
that we've talked about before.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.030
But, what I wanted
to do from over here,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.710
is click on the Reports button.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.210
And this is going to take me,
actually, to a different page.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.310
Which is a little bit more
of our older interface

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.930
for interacting with
the API's console.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.050
But this is the
interface that shows you

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.040
how much quota your
application's actually

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.595
consumed on a historical basis.

00:06:51.595 --> 00:06:54.540
Actually, let me rephrase
that-- it shows you

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.290
how many operations
your application made.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.317
So this is a raw
number of API calls.

00:06:59.317 --> 00:07:01.858
And, probably, it is a little
small on the screen right here.

00:07:01.858 --> 00:07:05.450
But you can see it's a nice
little chart for data API

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.880
v3 usage.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.050
So this doesn't directly
map, in this chart,

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.280
to the actual quota consumed.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.180
In order to do that, you kind of
have to dig down a little bit.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.370
And take a look at the
methods that your application

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.830
has been calling.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.110
And you see over
here that there's

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.910
been 2.3 million
search list operations.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.260
Some playlist items
list operations.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.580
And so on and so forth.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.020
And it gives you a good idea
as to what you're actually

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.980
doing from your application.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.437
If you have just written
some simple script

00:07:38.437 --> 00:07:40.020
and you've deployed
it to your server,

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.478
and you're the only
one running it,

00:07:41.478 --> 00:07:43.590
this probably isn't
as interesting

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.970
as if you've written
an application

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.570
you've released
on some app store.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.740
And you really are interested
in seeing how much usage it's

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.610
getting for all the different
API methods from all the users

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.140
out there.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.740
So, hopefully that's useful
information for folks.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.370
There's also just one
extra tool that I'm not

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.150
going to go into too
much detail about.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.840
But it could be useful.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.090
This is Quotas, from
that same tab over here.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.106
And if you go to the
Set Per-User Limits,

00:08:12.106 --> 00:08:13.480
you will see you'll
have a chance

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.286
to change the quota that
each individual user

00:08:17.286 --> 00:08:18.875
of your application is granted.

00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:22.780
And you'll see over here,
for data API v3 for instance,

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.470
the default is two units
per second per user.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.140
So if you do have an application
that's deployed widely,

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.490
and you are concerned that
the default limit is not

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.039
large enough.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.280
Or you want to tighten
the default limit a bit.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.720
You have the ability
to adjust it over here.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.299
And make sure that no single
user of your application

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:47.480
can really deplete that global
quota pool all the way down

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.930
to zero.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.710
So hopefully this information
was useful for folks

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.600
out there getting started.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.826
With the v3 API, or whether
you've already been using it

00:08:57.826 --> 00:08:59.200
for a while, and
just didn't know

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.710
you can check in on the quota.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.020
And stay tuned for
more videos in series.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.290
And we hope it's helping folks
make the move from v2 to v3.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.940
This is Jeff Posnick from
the developer relations team

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.350
and have a great everybody.
