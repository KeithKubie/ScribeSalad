00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
- [Instructor] Let's take a look at

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:03.710
our GDP equation for an open economy.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.040
So GDP is equal to national income.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.980
And that's going to be
equal to consumption

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.520
plus investment, plus government spending.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.340
And since this is an open
economy, plus net exports.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.130
Now, the first thing I want to do

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.960
is let's solve for net exports.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.450
So I'm gonna subtract all of
this stuff from both sides.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.520
So I could get national
income minus consumption,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.330
minus government spending,
minus investment,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.830
is equal to the next exports.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.940
This is just a manipulation
of what we just saw.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.560
Now, what is national
income minus consumption,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.620
minus government spending?

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.510
Well, this right over
here is national savings.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.170
This is S.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.040
So another way we can think about it is

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.620
national savings minus investment

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.310
is equal to net exports.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.110
So let's use this to
think about capital flows.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.360
So first of all, let's just make sure

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.910
we know what a capital flow is.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.010
So let's think about a capital inflow.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.300
What does that mean?

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.180
That means that foreigners
are taking capital

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.180
and taking it into our country
to buy assets in our country.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.080
And then outflow, that
means that residents

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.000
of our country are taking
capital out of the country

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.580
and buying foreign assets.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.330
And so do you think our
savings minus our investment

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.313
is going to be a capital
inflow or a capital outflow?

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.310
Well, we've saved a bunch of stuff,

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.790
and we are spending some
of it on investment.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.950
And so what do we do with the rest of it?

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.030
Well, it's gonna have to
go outside of the country.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.070
Because if it was being
invested inside the country,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.650
it would be in this I right over here.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.650
And so this is a net
capital, capital outflow.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.857
And you'll sometimes see
this abbreviated NCO.

00:01:59.948 --> 00:02:00.980
And so that sets up the identity

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.430
that net capital outflows
are equal to net exports.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.570
Let me just right it again for emphasis.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.830
Net capital outflows are
equal to net exports.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.310
Now, why does this make sense?

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.810
Well, let's say net exports are positive.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.230
That means more foreigners
are buying our goods

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.240
than we are buying their goods.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.000
Now how are they going
to pay for those goods?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.470
Well, they're going to have
to pay for those goods,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.750
and we're not going to go into the details

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.630
of currency exchange and all of that,

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.480
but one way to think about
how they pay for those goods

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.010
is that they need to
sell their foreign assets

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.350
to folks in our country.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.010
So if it's folks in our country

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.990
who are buying foreign assets

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.660
so that the foreigners can buy our goods,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.610
that would be a net capital
outflow from our point of view.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.100
So hopefully that makes intuitive sense.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.220
Now, another way to think about this

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.220
is we could rearrange this equation

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.800
where if we subtract net
exports from both sides

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.170
and then add investment to both sides,

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.280
we could get national savings

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.280
minus net exports, minus net exports,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.170
is equal to investment.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.950
Now, if net exports is equal
to net capital outflows,

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.290
what would be the negative
of net exports be?

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.730
Well, this would be net capital inflows.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.300
So we could set up another equation.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.230
And these are all fairly
straightforward algebra,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.640
but they give us a little bit of intuition

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.360
of how to think about
these different levers.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.090
So we could say savings plus,
I'll write the word out,

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.720
net capital inflow

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.810
is equal to investment.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.260
Is equal to investment.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.053
And think about why this makes sense.

00:03:47.551 --> 00:03:49.260
If we have investment in our country,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.940
maybe we're building factories,
we're building roads,

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.690
where is the capital for
that investment coming?

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.100
It's either coming from domestic savings,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.200
national savings right over here,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.250
or it's coming from foreigners

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.910
bringing capital into our country

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.270
which can be used for investment.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.900
So I will leave you there.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.910
The big takeaway is is
we can just manipulate

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.850
the GDP equation for an open economy here

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.490
to get to this notion
that net capital outflows

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.400
are equal to net exports.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.210
Or that the negative of net exports,

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.640
which would be net imports,

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.650
is equal to net capital inflows.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.183
And hopefully this makes
some intuitive sense.
