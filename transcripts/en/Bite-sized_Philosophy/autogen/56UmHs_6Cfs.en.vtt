00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.409
okay all right what the hell address the

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419
okay all right what the hell address the
 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.329
okay all right what the hell address the
Jewish Question that's a hell of a thing

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339
Jewish Question that's a hell of a thing
 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.019
Jewish Question that's a hell of a thing
to ask

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029
to ask
 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.150
to ask
so that's Jaqueline turn you know I mean

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160
so that's Jaqueline turn you know I mean
 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.530
so that's Jaqueline turn you know I mean
really that's a hell of a thing to ask

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540
really that's a hell of a thing to ask
 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.140
really that's a hell of a thing to ask
but I will say something about it you

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150
but I will say something about it you
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.700
but I will say something about it you
know and I've thought about this a lot

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710
know and I've thought about this a lot
 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.970
know and I've thought about this a lot
so there is evidence that ask a nosy

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980
so there is evidence that ask a nosy
 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.680
so there is evidence that ask a nosy
Jews so those are Jews of European

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690
Jews so those are Jews of European
 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.870
Jews so those are Jews of European
heritage have IQs that are about 15

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
heritage have IQs that are about 15
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.980
heritage have IQs that are about 15
points higher than the population

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990
points higher than the population
 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.620
points higher than the population
average so that's a lot 15 points it's

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630
average so that's a lot 15 points it's
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.269
average so that's a lot 15 points it's
about the average difference between the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279
about the average difference between the
 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.589
about the average difference between the
typical high school student and the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599
typical high school student and the
 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.720
typical high school student and the
typical state college student it's a lot

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
typical state college student it's a lot
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.330
typical state college student it's a lot
and one of the things that means is so

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340
and one of the things that means is so
 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.130
and one of the things that means is so
imagine there's two distributions and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
imagine there's two distributions and
 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.660
imagine there's two distributions and
that they overlap and that the Jewish

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
that they overlap and that the Jewish
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.060
that they overlap and that the Jewish
one is is the the mean as one fifteen so

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070
one is is the the mean as one fifteen so
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100
one is is the the mean as one fifteen so
the whole distribution is shifted to the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
the whole distribution is shifted to the
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.110
the whole distribution is shifted to the
right what that means is if you go up

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
right what that means is if you go up
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.860
right what that means is if you go up
into the higher IQ strata one 31:45 way

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
into the higher IQ strata one 31:45 way
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.080
into the higher IQ strata one 31:45 way
the hell up there that Jewish people are

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
the hell up there that Jewish people are
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090
the hell up there that Jewish people are
overwhelmingly over-represented at the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
overwhelmingly over-represented at the
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.310
overwhelmingly over-represented at the
high end of the IQ distribution now the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320
high end of the IQ distribution now the
 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.020
high end of the IQ distribution now the
price they pay for that is some

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030
price they pay for that is some
 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.150
price they pay for that is some
increased propensity for neurological

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
increased propensity for neurological
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.130
increased propensity for neurological
diseases that seems to be associated in

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140
diseases that seems to be associated in
 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.380
diseases that seems to be associated in
some sense with that heightened IQ now

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
some sense with that heightened IQ now
 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.060
some sense with that heightened IQ now
you know the science on this isn't

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
you know the science on this isn't
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.370
you know the science on this isn't
settled but but it it's reasonably solid

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380
settled but but it it's reasonably solid
 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.320

you know given the standards of such

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330
you know given the standards of such
 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.770
you know given the standards of such
things

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
things
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.580
things
okay so Jews are gonna be

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590
okay so Jews are gonna be
 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.450
okay so Jews are gonna be
over-represented at the high end of

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
over-represented at the high end of
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.149
over-represented at the high end of
cognitively complex disciplines so then

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159
cognitively complex disciplines so then
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.280
cognitively complex disciplines so then
I would say and that's the case like

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290
I would say and that's the case like
 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.140
I would say and that's the case like
their way over-represented among like

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
their way over-represented among like
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.120
their way over-represented among like
outstanding scientists and among Nobel

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
outstanding scientists and among Nobel
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.760
outstanding scientists and among Nobel
Prize winners and and so forth and so

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
Prize winners and and so forth and so
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.920
Prize winners and and so forth and so
you know people look and they think well

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930
you know people look and they think well
 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.230
you know people look and they think well
why are there a disproportionate number

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
why are there a disproportionate number
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.030
why are there a disproportionate number
of Jewish people in positions of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
of Jewish people in positions of
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.410
of Jewish people in positions of
authority and they say well it must be a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
authority and they say well it must be a
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.740
authority and they say well it must be a
conspiracy you know it must be systemic

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
conspiracy you know it must be systemic
 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.840
conspiracy you know it must be systemic
in some sense it's like no it can be

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850
in some sense it's like no it can be
 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.179
in some sense it's like no it can be
simply accounted for by that relatively

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189
simply accounted for by that relatively
 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.090
simply accounted for by that relatively

criticism would be well don't the Jews

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
criticism would be well don't the Jews
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.990
criticism would be well don't the Jews
tend to lean left

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
tend to lean left
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.120
tend to lean left
well first you might say well you know

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
well first you might say well you know
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.450
well first you might say well you know
given what happened in Nazi Germany to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
given what happened in Nazi Germany to
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.010

the degree that that was right-wing as
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.420
the degree that that was right-wing as
we discussed earlier that's the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
we discussed earlier that's the
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.100
we discussed earlier that's the
nationalism and ethnocentrism it's

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
nationalism and ethnocentrism it's
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.770
nationalism and ethnocentrism it's
hardly surprising that they might you

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780
hardly surprising that they might you
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.600

tend to move towards the left but more

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220
tend to move towards the left but more
 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.479
tend to move towards the left but more
importantly than that IQ is associated

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489
importantly than that IQ is associated
 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.550

with trade openness and trade

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
with trade openness and trade
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.650
with trade openness and trade
openness is a strong predictor predictor

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660
openness is a strong predictor predictor
 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.100
openness is a strong predictor predictor
of political liberalism so and it's the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110
of political liberalism so and it's the
 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.479
of political liberalism so and it's the
strongest predictor of political

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489
strongest predictor of political
 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.140
strongest predictor of political
liberalism so you know it's very

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150
liberalism so you know it's very
 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.910
liberalism so you know it's very
difficult so that's what I have to say

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920
difficult so that's what I have to say
 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.350
difficult so that's what I have to say
about that it's like and the other thing

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360
about that it's like and the other thing
 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.930
about that it's like and the other thing
I would say is you know the fact that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940
I would say is you know the fact that
 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.750
I would say is you know the fact that
there's a population as sub population

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760
there's a population as sub population
 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.670
there's a population as sub population
of people who are much smarter than

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680
of people who are much smarter than
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.699

I've you got to get that straight on

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660
I've you got to get that straight on
 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.990
I've you got to get that straight on
average is actually of great benefit to

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000
average is actually of great benefit to

fewer geniuses fewer people with IQs of

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160
fewer geniuses fewer people with IQs of
 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.350
fewer geniuses fewer people with IQs of
145 or 160 that's and you know and it's

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360
145 or 160 that's and you know and it's
 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.110

I've addressed the Jewish Question it's

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890
I've addressed the Jewish Question it's
 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.979
I've addressed the Jewish Question it's
like it's a confusion between ethnicity

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989
like it's a confusion between ethnicity
 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.550
like it's a confusion between ethnicity
and and IQ as far as I'm concerned so

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560
and and IQ as far as I'm concerned so
 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.979
and and IQ as far as I'm concerned so
I'll probably get like painted six

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989
I'll probably get like painted six
 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.449
I'll probably get like painted six
different shades of black for that

different shades of black for that
 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.520
different shades of black for that
answer but it's I've thought about a

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530
answer but it's I've thought about a
 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.960
answer but it's I've thought about a
long time it's the best that I can

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970
long time it's the best that I can
