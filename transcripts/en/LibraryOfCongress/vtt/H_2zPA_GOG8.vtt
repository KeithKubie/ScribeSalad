&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.340
&gt;&gt; I'll just have
you guys first start

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.040
out by introducing yourselves
and the instruments you play.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez: Hi.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.000
My name is Noah Martinez,
and I play live --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.520
I play bajo quinto
and quinto huapangera;

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.330
and in the studio different
acoustic bass, guitarron,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.490
and tololoche as well.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.590
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: My
name is Leticia Gonzales,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.390
and I play violin, percussion
including a wood block

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.330
and a snare, and jarana, and I
also sing and sometimes I dance.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.630
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: My
name's Jordan Wax.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.700
I play the fiddle and
the piano accordion

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.300
and sometimes I play
the mandolin also

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.630
and button accordion.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.930
I think that's it.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.230
And I sing, yeah.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.530
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: I think
it will be good to first start

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.280
out by talking about the
history of Lone Pinon.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.580
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez: Yeah.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.880
I met Jordan and another
guy we used to play

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.420
with on a Sunday morning.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.580
There's a coffee shop in
Albuquerque called Zendo Coffee,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.070
and I was playing -- been
playing every Sunday there

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.520
with people who play
Son Jarocho music.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.200
And I just went in -- I was
there playing like normal

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.860
and these guys came
in, they fit the bill

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.410
of the coffee scene crowd,
handsome, hip young men.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.950
And I didn't think much of it

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.260
because people didn't pay
attention to the music so much.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.590
But then I saw them kind
of mouthing the words

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.890
and I thought, whoa,
that's crazy.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.190
So I took a break.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.630
I went outside.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.670
And when I came in, Jordan
was tuning his violin.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.810
And we played a few
songs, right.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.110
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: Yeah.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.410
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez: And these
guys were really cool,

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.230
so I just invited
them back to my place

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.410
and we drank apple spiced tea
with plum and played music

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.700
for hours, like four hours.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.750
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: Propelled
by the apple spiced tea.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.050
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez: Yeah.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.260
That clory and raven
[phonetic] special plum sauce.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.350
And then they had a gig on
every Wednesday in Santa Fe.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.650
And this was on a Sunday.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.950
And they're like, well,
we're playing Wednesday

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.250
if you want to come up.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.430
If you come up an hour early
and we'll rehearse some tunes.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.730
And it kind of never stopped

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.830
from there, it's
been that since.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.130
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Great.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.200
And how about -- I
don't know how to begin

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.720
with unpacking all the
rich, as I said before,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.690
traditions that you draw upon.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.060
But maybe just first talk

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.740
about what was the
inspiration of Lone Pinon?

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.030
What are your aims, so to speak?

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.510
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: Well, kind
of how I came to it --

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.410
I'm from Missouri
originally, and had a chance

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.640
to learn the fiddle from
older traditional fiddlers,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.640
square dance fiddlers
there and contest fiddlers.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.800
And I wanted -- I think that
was a cool chance to get

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.700
to experience that
way of interacting

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.190
and the intergenerational
thing and being involved

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.050
in a really regional tradition.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.980
And I think I have that motto
when I moved to New Mexico.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.140
And after a while I kind
of quit playing music

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.200
but I started really missing it,
and I wanted to have that kind

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.300
of relationship with
older organizations.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.360
And so that I think having
brought that helped me kind

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.400
of know what I was looking
for and that got me interested

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.790
in finding the older New
Mexico fiddle traditions

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.280
and working with those.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.740
So that was kind
of one inspiration.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.360
You guys probably have
other inspirations

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.430
that brought you
in this direction.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.280
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: Would
you like to go first?

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.580
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: Sure.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.350
So I learned music through
mariachi, which is kind

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.490
of a tradition that lays
over what we're playing now.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.190
It came after the string
band style and in a lot

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.330
of ways supplanted the string
band style in New Mexico.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.200
So then my family
is from New Mexico

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.010
and predates the mariachi
style, they have a lot

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.440
of identification with mariachi.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.020
So I started as a
mariachi player very young

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.130
and started playing
classical music.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.910
I played a lot of
classical music.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.490
And have always been
interested in folk traditions.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.330
And a few years ago,
before I met these guys

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.210
and joined Lone Pinon, I
was working a lot in sort

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.030
of the community choirs
and things like that.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.270
I played in a gamelan
orchestra and started wondering

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.930
where that was happening in New
Mexico, why it wasn't happening

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.560
in New Mexico, if it could
happen in New Mexico.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.590
And when I met --
I met Jordan first.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.830
When I met Jordan, he
and the other member

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.820
of the band were playing
and I was really excited

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.220
to see young people
playing the music.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.840
And then I met Noah later,
and was like super delighted

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.370
to hear all of what they had
going, the musical fusion.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.260
And I think that in addition
to loving the music because I'm

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.170
from there and to loving the
community aspects of knowing how

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.930
to dance a polka, dancing
a polka with my grandfather

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.420
and my father and my
mom and all my cousins,

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.720
you know, my whole life.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.310
To be able to generate the music
that those dances come from.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.400
And so I feel like
my participation

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.250
in the band was a fusion
of a lot of things.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.160
But in trying to reclaim some
of the community practices

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.200
that I had seen the last
vestiges of growing up

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.600
and was kind of wondering about.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.900
Yeah.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.640
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: I guess for
me I started playing music

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.270
when I was 12.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.760
And I grew up in kind
of a rough neighborhood.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.580
And so a lot of us kids
were kind of like getting

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.680
into trouble, starting to hang
around with the wrong crowds,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.610
and myself included a
little, just a little.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.310
But a friend of mine moved
back to the neighborhood

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.240
who was my best friend
from second grade.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.740
And he had started
playing guitar.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.530
So I kind of just jumped
on the wagon with him

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.180
and kind of kept it up.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.670
So when I was a teenager,
my late teen years,

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.990
my neighbors played old
style ranchera music,

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.260
just acoustic guitars,
some beers, friends,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.210
neighborhood style
in a ditch bank

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.580
under a conwood [phonetic] tree.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.550
And they let me kind
of come and hang out.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.840
So I always sort
of followed that.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.340
I love blues and the
traditional music.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.640
So there's another group

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.970
in Albuquerque called
Felix y los Gatos,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:35.060
who sort of do a fusion
of blues and polka styles,

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.540
and they're from generations
of traditional musicians.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.470
So I kind of got with them and
played with them for a few years

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.750
and really learned the
-- they're a blue-collar,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.280
hard-core band that just
plays gigs constantly.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.450
And then I wanted something
a little more refined,

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.440
so I've just been
chasing the traditions.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.660
So from them, you know,
which is what led me

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.990
to me meeting Jordan.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.360
Because I was just trying to
find the elders in the community

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.810
who played older
different styles of music.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.270
And now it's totally -- we're

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.660
on the path together
searching and forging forward.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.200
Because we're discovering
new music weekly,

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.710
things that we've never
heard before that --

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:23.040
so it's very alive right now in
that pursuit of the old ways.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.510
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: I'd love
to ask you about your process,

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.330
but first let's talk about
some of the traditions

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.630
that you are drawing upon.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.930
I don't know where
you want to begin,

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.240
but maybe where you've grown up.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.850
I know you grew up in Missouri.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.040
But nonetheless, New Mexico?

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.340
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: Yeah.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.920
We started with the old-school
northern New Mexico dance

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.290
repertoire, which is what
normally it's violin-based

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.590
and there's accordion,

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.900
violin and accordion
melodies for dances.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.130
There's different dances,
like the varsoviana we played.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.170
There's the cuna.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.710
There's the indita, the
chotiz, valse [inaudible] --

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.300
different valses,
polka of course.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.800
And each of those tunes
has komancha [phonetic].

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.990
Each of those dance rhythms
has a special genre of tunes

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.340
or just one particular
tune that goes with it.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.800
So we started out just trying to
learn those, and then that kind

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.100
of lead us into other things,

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.500
probably because
people would request it

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.490
when they saw we were
playing old music.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.630
They'd say, play
Margarita, Margarita or.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.930
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez:
Play [inaudible].

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.230
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: Yeah,
[inaudible].

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:32.670
And then from there
we started getting

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:39.130
into the huapango huasteco,
which is I think is some

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.950
of the first waltzes I was
learning in that period

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.010
of the New Mexican music,
have a little something to do

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.310
with the huapango music.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.000
You can tell there's
some connection.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.800
And that's the style that
comes from the Huasteca region,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.240
which is normally played
with a quinta huapanguera

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.540
and a jarana huasteca.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.760
Noah plays the quinta and
Leticia plays a jarana

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.370
and the violin in
the trio format.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:09.360
And we also learned some
from Ken and Jeanie --

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.290
Ken Keppeler and Jeanie McLerie,
some musicians in New Mexico

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.700
that have worked with
a lot of the elders.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.680
And they introduced us to hona
oda [phonetic] music from some

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.580
of the musicians they'd
worked with in Arizona.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.300
And so we incorporated --
we've been doing some of that.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.220
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez: Our friend
Scott Mathis gave us a bunch

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.300
of music from [inaudible].

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.220
In the early days I remember
we had our first road gig

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.240
and we were kind of a new band.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.770
And he gave us a stack of CDs.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.020
We were listening
to [inaudible].

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.510
And we were all amazed
in the van.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.080
We're like this --
we could do that.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.380
That gets us.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.680
That's our music right there.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.980
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: Yeah.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.330
You can hear, it's the
same instruments at play,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.040
doing much more complex things,
and we were really inspired.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.840
Like, oh, we can
do that like this.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.390
And that kind of
helped us understand,

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.950
and we can play the New
Mexican music like that too.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:04.900
We can open it up and make
it more engaging in that way.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.000
And it helped us
diversify the palates,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.010
because there aren't
a lot of examples

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.100
of the old New Mexico
music to have

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:18.160
like a real broad
representation of it.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.520
So we kind of borrowed them
from those other things too.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.820
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez: And also

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.890
when Jordan started learning
huapango music, he got in touch

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.160
with our friend Juan Rivera
out in Chicago, who is actually

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:35.630
from Michoacan -- but he
plays amazing huasteco violin.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.480
And he turned us onto a
lot of [inaudible] and kind

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.490
of the music from his land,
and that's inspired us greatly.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.260
And our instrumentation as well.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.350
You know, we don't use
typical instruments

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.850
for all the traditions, so
we kind of have adjusted --

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.240
or we don't have the
amount of members.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.710
So I think that kind
of has helped us.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.370
Where we say, okay, like we did
with Serafini Vara [phonetic],

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.500
where we go, this sounds
like something we can do,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.640
this is what we have, and we
sort of make -- we make it fit.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.130
So that's kind of nice.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.790
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: You
talk a lot about meeting

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.140
and learning from elders.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.660
How does that come about,
just from your families,

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.970
the communities you grew up in?

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:22.340
Or, what is the landscape
today or these past years

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.970
in New Mexico for
traditional music?

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.950
I know that you've noted
that it is diminishing a bit

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.240
or you're tracing this history.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.990
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez: Well, a guy
who we've worked with a lot,

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:39.440
our buddy Thomas Mize, we
met him at a farmers market,

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.000
and he just walked up to us and
asked us if he could record us.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.300
And we said, yeah, sure.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.210
And he pulled out his phone
and recorded us a bit.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.010
And then after a song,
he came and said, hey,

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.620
let me play your violin,
let me try this song out.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.490
And oh, yeah, try this,
and then he played a melody

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.790
and went yeah, this
is this tune.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.980
And it's just really
organic meeting people

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.040
like in life while
we're playing.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.670
And I think a lot of the
elders appreciate that.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.740
Where some people are on
social media and because

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.350
of the Internet and everything,
you can kind of reach

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.160
out to people and make contact.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.850
But we have met a few people
just in just playing music too.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.670
Jordan's studied a lot.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.400
He went in and studied
with Serafini Vara.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.700
Maybe you could talk
about that a little.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.000
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: Yeah.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.510
I tried to seek out people
to learn from and have

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.180
that connection with the music.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.740
In New Mexico, our friend
Thomas has helped us all a lot,

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.910
and he kind of grew up --

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:39.970
he was kind of the youngest
of his cohort of musicians.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.050
So he's one of the only
ones that are still playing.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.860
And there's another guy named
Mariano Romero [phonetic],

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.160
that he played with
as a violinist,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.340
but because of arthritis in
his shoulder he can't play.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.610
But he still -- he came
to our dance last time,

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.910
which was really cool.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.210
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez: And
he's got a Cadillac,

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.750
and he's got his name
on the license plate.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.240
It is awesome.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.980
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: And then we also
still have Antonia Apodaca,

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:08.990
who I think she's
94 now and she lives

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.520
in an assisted living
place in Albuquerque,

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.050
and still plays great.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.380
She gets tired sometimes
after a couple songs.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.620
But she plays wonderful.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.500
And I like to go
play guitar from her.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.860
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
And again though,

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.630
how did you find
out about all these?

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.380
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: I found out
about -- I'd heard about her.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.680
And she, you know, plays in
like at the Spanish market

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.090
and fiestas and stuff.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.390
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez:
She's a legend.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.690
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: She's kind of --

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.430
yeah, she's really well
known in New Mexico.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:41.490
And some friends of us --
of ours from Silver City,

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.380
Ken and Jeanie, who
are called Bayou Seco,

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.600
their group are really
accomplished

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.930
traditional musicians.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.480
They had spent a lot of time
with her and toured with her

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.090
and came to Washington,
DC with her

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.770
and really inspired
her to keep playing.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.570
And I had talked to
them and they said, oh,

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.150
you should just call her up
and go visit her one day.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.000
And I kind of hadn't done
it, I was too or something.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.230
But then one day I called her to
ask her a question or something,

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.040
and she was like, are
you coming up later?

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.340
What time will you be here?

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.010
And I was free that day
so I was like, okay,

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.310
I'll just come up now.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.950
So I drove to Las Vegas,

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.220
New Mexico where she
was living there,

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.910
and then just started
going every week

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:21.330
to visit her for a while.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.710
And now she's down
in Albuquerque.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.470
So that's how that happened.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.290
And then, you know, when I
got there -- she is older and,

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.920
you know, has trouble
finding people to play with

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.230
and she's really particular

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.810
about her backup
too and sensitive.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.930
She says like if someone
plays the wrong chord,

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.230
she gets a stomachache.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.360
So it works great
because she likes

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.660
to have someone to back her up.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.960
And then she'll practice
because she doesn't

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.260
like to play by herself.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.360
So that's how that happened.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.370
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
So you guys are young.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.700
How do the older
musicians and masters

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.040
of these traditions feel about?

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.370
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez: At first they
didn't really like us very much.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.630
They sort of scowled,
like who are these boys,

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.440
or who are these
children over here?

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.720
But then I think with
time, we just kept playing

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.160
and then you sort of earn their
respect just through repetition

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.200
and kind of like not going away.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.020
And then Antonia, someone
-- like she's a master.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.200
She accepted us pretty quickly.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.100
Some of the other people
like don't like us.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.840
But everyone is cool
with us now.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.340
I mean, in the beginning it was
odd, but everything's fine now.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.250
I mean, I feel like -- like
Ken and Jeanie, we just played

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.420
with them last week a string
shows, and we got to really bond

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.870
with them in a way
that's different.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.430
We've gone and learned
from them at the house

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.760
and spent lots of time.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.160
But playing next to
each other in real time,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.580
you just develop this sense

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.310
of relationship that's
totally different.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.950
And, you know, there's always
the super sensitive emotional

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.150
talk after the gig where our
hearts are all open still

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.830
for music, and I just had some
really kind words with Ken.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:58.060
And he was like, you know,
we love you guys and the fact

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.650
that you guys really care about
tradition and are doing it,

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.130
trying to keep this going.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.480
I think maybe that's a sentiment
that some of those people have

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.840
of us now after they
saw that, well,

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.970
maybe we're just not trying
to make a quick cash grab

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.270
with traditional music.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.750
It's like, well, we love
this, it's really our life.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.600
We're not doing it because
it's a trend, you know.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.450
So I think once you
get past that,

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.400
people seem to treat
you pretty with respect.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.700
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
Traditionally what are some

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.000
of the places and spaces

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.520
where one would hear
this music and dance?

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.060
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: So I
think there are a couple

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.360
of different layers.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.620
I also have a background in
folklorico, so I spent a lot

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.020
of time when I was younger

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.120
like at fiestas throughout
northern New Mexico,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.720
which are celebrations.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:50.380
They're like annual -- they
coincide kind of with harvest.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.940
But they have a longer history.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.190
They're religious and
social celebrations

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.890
that have survived
for quite a while.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.720
And they're in the middle of
kind of a transition right now,

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.130
so it's an interesting time
to think about the fiesta

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.720
in northern New Mexico.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:09.500
And each larger like city
area has different traditions

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.730
that they follow, but
essentially it's a reenactment

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.800
of the Spaniards
coming to New Mexico.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.750
So it's under a lot
of fire right now.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.310
And, as it should be kind,

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.050
it's kind of being
questioned and updated.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.590
But I heard a lot
of this music there

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:26.790
and I heard only
recordings played

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:30.470
for like a specific folk
dance group that tries

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.930
to keep doing the cuna
and the varsovienne

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.320
and these older dances,
the indita,

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.830
which comes to us from Spain.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:41.400
So I don't really remember,
I probably saw Thomas

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.370
when I was really small and
I probably saw him playing.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:49.880
But my primary source for
the these older recordings --

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.590
or older styles was through
recordings at fiestas.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:59.120
And so I think that that became
the case during my parents'

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.880
generation or like
from the '50s onward.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.500
And before that they were played
at like fandangoes or dances

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:11.440
that were done not only in like
each specific locality but even

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.930
in like specific neighborhoods.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.020
So like the east side of
Santa Fe where my dad is

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.320
from had a fandango, and
the west side of Santa Fe

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.680
where my mom is from
-- which is, you know,

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.960
15 minutes by car --
had its own fandango.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.090
So there were different --

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.710
you know, they danced
the styles differently

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:27.790
and they had different music.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.270
But that would've
been my grandparents'

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.570
or great-grandparents' time.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:37.520
So from kind of a living
fandango community dance

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.580
to a more stage sort of
representation of like,

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.350
this is what it means to
have new Mexican music

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.770
and New Mexican dance.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:49.440
But most of the styles
that we play have something

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.810
to do with dance as well.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.140
So they're not usually --

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.890
I was thinking that as we were
playing in the auditorium.

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.360
It's a little bit
special to be playing

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.460
for just a listening audience.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:04.350
You know, a lot of the
accordion snare bajo stuff,

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.900
you would just be
dancing at a square

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.430
or at somebody's celebration.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:14.690
So they're meant to be felt with
your body and with other people,

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:19.320
and there's a very lively
aspect to all of these dances.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.650
And too with I think the
sonplaneco, huapango,

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.830
there are specific dance
styles that go with them.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:30.080
So not so much in an
auditorium, very much outdoors,

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.370
very much for ritual
celebrations,

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.180
for planting celebrations,
harvest celebrations.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.480
&gt;&gt; Weddings.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.440
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: Yeah,
baptisms, weddings, matanzas.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.830
Moments when the community
comes together to celebrate

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.670
or to be in joy together.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:49.230
&gt;&gt; I think that's kind of part
of our experience and interests

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:54.130
in doing this kind of
music too is kind of --

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.350
because my understanding
is that --

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.740
and when electricity
came is basically

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.740
when people started then
amplifying instruments and,

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.080
you know, electric guitar came
in and then drum set could come

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.960
because they had
louder instruments.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.580
And about that time,
from the recordings

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.890
and from elders we've
been able to talk to,

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.680
it sounds like there's just a
brief period where they kept

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.680
up the fiddle tradition
and the old dances

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.020
with that electrified
instruments.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:25.170
But then it quickly, as that
new instruments got adapted,

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.460
all the old music went
out the window kind of

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.550
and adopted new music too
that was just simpler.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.170
You know, I mean, great
dancing but not any

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.750
of the other more
specific dances.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:40.790
And so I think like
what Leticia is saying,

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:44.670
like that chronologically is
kind of how that played out,

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.430
that it went from being,
you know, an active part

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:48.900
of these celebrations to more

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.410
like something everybody
remembered and responded to

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:53.870
and wanted to see the dancing,

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:58.950
but that wasn't being
recreated, renewed.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.250
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: Yeah.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.480
It's kind of a specialized
practice

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.570
to see these folk dances done.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.810
So, you know, people
go specifically

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.410
to this group once a week
to learn these dances.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:13.160
And part of our -- we've started
hosting bailas [phonetic]

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.010
in the last six months
or so, with the hope

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.710
that people can come and have of
an interaction with these dances

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:24.110
in a less like institutionalized
way.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:27.340
That, you know, you don't
have to even really be able

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.260
to keep time, you
can participate

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.220
as a member of [inaudible].

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.650
Which, you know, I think
probably is true to how

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:38.320
that was practice in
just a community setting.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.380
So in that way too,
to try and ground some

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:46.230
of our own experiences with
the music and the experiences

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.380
of those people who are getting
to hear our music and to save it

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:56.170
from becoming too specialized
or not for like the people.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.600
&gt;&gt; The public.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.900
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: Yeah.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.200
&gt;&gt; Which is --

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.500
those associations
have done a great job

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.730
of keeping those
traditions alive.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:08.440
And I think now with our
generation, I think it's sort

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.120
of our duty -- we've taken on
the duty to sort of take those

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.840
and say, okay, now let's take
all the fancy stuff off of that

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.940
and we can learn and do it in
kind of the old way where --

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.460
like we did a dance with
Bayou Seco recently.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.920
And it was amazing, you just
you don't get those moments.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.180
I mean, even if we were
to do a show all together

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.240
on a huge stage in
front of everybody,

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.610
that would be awesome.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:38.210
But to get to play one
dance tune for 15 minutes

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:39.730
where we're watching
the crowd and then it's

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.730
like it's totally --
it's just amazing.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:46.010
And to see the people and
the interaction and the kids

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:49.070
and the older people
and it's like, wow,

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.860
it's really a true
sense of community.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.750
And I think that's what
kind of the purposes is

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.010
of that, of those situations.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:58.960
Like Leticia was
saying where it's

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.740
like each community had their
own dance, well, I mean,

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.620
part of that played into that
because they wouldn't mix

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.340
so much, because it's like,
well, we can do something

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.110
with our people over here on
this side of town, have fun.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.600
You know what I mean?

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.900
Everyone's going to be there.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.200
It's great.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.270
The dance is sort of secondary
to the social get together .

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.980
So yeah, we're sort
of in the middle

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.330
of bringing that back around.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.880
&gt;&gt; And that's how
we approach a lot

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.350
of the music too is
figuring out, well,

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.580
this is how it worked before,

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.870
and obviously it's
not working anymore.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:33.930
But we have all the
pieces and we're, you know,

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.000
we understand somewhat
what life is like now.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.510
And we're as qualified as
anybody to try to figure

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:46.080
out what it might take for it
to get some new life again.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.400
And you know, not just
in a sense of performance

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.860
or recordings, but in the
sense of the community

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.350
and for actually -- you
know, for the tradition

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.610
to have life and be renewed.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:59.910
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: Yeah.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:03.470
I think as Noah was saying,
these kind of institutions

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:06.690
or organizations have done
a good job of preserving.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:10.820
So there's a lot of New Mexican
culture that has been preserved.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:16.350
You know, we work with archives,
the One Beat IL Archive

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:20.550
and the John Donald Rob Archive
at the University of New Mexico.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:24.320
And we an amazing amount
of source recordings.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.290
So we might not have
those elders anymore,

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:27.590
but we have their recordings,

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.730
and we also have
video of dances.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:34.170
We have costumes that have
been, you know, preserved.

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:38.620
But the idea of preservation
I hope is to be revitalizing

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:39.920
and to be re-introduced.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.560
And so, you know, New Mexico
being such an interesting

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.340
and complicated place,
and in a lot

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.530
of ways remembering what it was

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:54.140
like to be itself
before electricity.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.920
I have stories of my dad,
you know, not ever getting

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.690
to use a shower until high
school, which was in the '60s .

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:02.810
They had no running water and
they had no electricity, yeah,

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:07.650
in the house that I live
in now, until the '60s.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.000
Which is an important thing for
everybody to just take a minute

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.620
and think like, wow,
a generation ago,

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.150
in parts of our country,
there was no running water

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.500
and people lived
and they made things

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.890
and they had traditions
and culture.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:24.650
&gt;&gt; Beautiful lives too.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:26.650
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: You
know, that in addition

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.320
to preserving it, that we
try and find a way to marry

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.710
that to what's, you know,
our particular challenges

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:37.080
in this time right now.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.900
Growing isolation.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:46.320
I mean, I see a lot of -- a lot
of my elders I knew kind of like

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.770
at a remove, you know.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.120
We were no longer able
to care for them at home

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.750
and to give them good lives
at home in their older years.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:59.890
And so trying to not
only preserve the dances

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:04.330
and preserve the music but to
preserve the sense of, well,

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:05.690
you know, I see you at dances.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.600
I've danced with you.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.100
I know what it's like
to dance with you.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.400
I've prepared food for you.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.700
You've prepared food for me.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.710
And to remember what it's
like to be human together

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:17.800
in a community within the
wider sort of global idea

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.320
of the world in which we live.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:25.070
So for me, I think
that that's a big piece

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.680
of what this music is about.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.660
That it is, we're
musicians, so we do the music.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.670
We're artists, so
we focus on the art.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.640
But if I was, you
know, a social worker,

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.650
I would be doing similar
hopefully initiatives to try

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:44.160
and bring these values and
the ability to be human

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.880
with each other to
individuals and hopefully also

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.370
to a larger community level.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:51.670
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
You remind me --

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:56.340
you wrote about the many
traditions that you draw upon,

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.880
that they represent
radicalism, creativity,

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.160
and cross-cultural solidarity.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.730
Can you talk a little
bit more about that?

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.830
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez: I
actually don't know what any

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.860
of those words mean.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.740
No, I'm just kidding.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.150
Yeah, I think that's it.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.100
I think to be radical is

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.660
to be different then what
society wants to be, right.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.760
Like so for us it's the main --

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.130
like Leticia was saying about
that connection you have

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:26.900
with an elder, and you
see each other as like,

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.610
we're all in a circle, right.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:30.790
So a lot of times
you're in that circle

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:32.470
and the older people
are looking down on you

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:35.170
because you're just the
young kid, then we grow.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:39.350
And then we -- a lot of
times elders get forgotten

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:43.460
that there was a whole life that
was lived and all these lessons.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.340
So we sort of look at
them in a down way.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.360
But when you get to that point
where we're looking eye to eye,

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.660
that's really the awesome part.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:54.140
But it takes you a little bit to
-- it takes a while to get that.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.440
And that idea is radical.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.500
I think it's -- you know,
it's like, well, look at us.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.690
We're obviously young people.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:04.160
We shouldn't necessarily
want to be hanging

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.460
out with older people more

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.270
than our own age
generation, but we do.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.800
So I feel like that's
the solidarity of that.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.670
And really that -- and
with music, it's sort of --

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:16.340
once you're old enough
to kind of play in bars,

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.980
you're like all the same age,
depending on where you are

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.280
and the music you love.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.640
So we can be we're, you know,
young people in our 20s and 30s,

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.370
but we're -- I see -- I
look at Ken and Jeanie,

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:30.820
who are into their
later years of life,

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.410
and it's like, we're the same.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.920
It's just they're a little
further down the road

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.220
or something, you know.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.520
I don't know, what
do you think, Jordan?

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.040
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: I was thinking

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:45.870
about the radicalism
from older musicians.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.170
I think about like --

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:51.390
and getting to work with older
fiddle players in Missouri

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:57.730
and Mexican musicians and
musicians in New Mexico,

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.750
there's a lot of ideas that
we just have as a society

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.970
about what the musicians
are, what they're doing,

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.920
what the traditions
are, what cultures are.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.680
And music's a wonderful
thing because the people

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.330
who are practicing it
often in a really deep way

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:16.480
and a committed -- you know,
the level of like lifetimes

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.670
of commitment and generations of
commitment, they don't have --

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.170
they don't share
any of those ideas

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:22.600
about what the divisions are

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.470
and what the purpose
of it is oftentimes.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:28.000
And so I feel like there's --

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.540
I've had a chance to see where
there's society is saying, well,

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:32.840
this is who the musicians are

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.440
and this what they represent,
this is what they do.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.750
And the musicians are
like, no, we're not that.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.440
We have our own story.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.090
And I think also, that ties

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.910
into that cross-cultural
level for me.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.600
I'm not New Mexican.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.100
And I think a lot of people --

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.880
you know, that's a
really interesting element

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.170
and experience of the band,
because a lot of people,

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.280
you know, will reject
that at first.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.240
They'll say, well, you know,

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.130
this guy's an outsider
singing this music,

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:01.660
then it must be bad, you know.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.140
But then there are people who
actually listen and they say,

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.930
oh, that's our music, that's
it, you guys are doing it well.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.110
And I think working with
musicians and coming

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:17.650
from that experience where I've
had a chance to work with people

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:20.980
of lots of different
cultural backgrounds,

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:24.670
that maybe that brings
it out even more.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.800
But people are always telling
me, oh, this, you know --

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.450
there's always been
this connection.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.740
Or, you know, these musicians
from the Midwest came

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.440
and they shared this,
and you can hear

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.740
that in the older recordings.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.470
And then, you know, working
with Seta Feni [phonetic]

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:38.770
and Mita Konda [phonetic],
saying, oh,

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.410
this musician came from here.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.570
And this Texan musician who we
always listen to, he said, oh,

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.560
he was actually from
mitwakon [phonetic].

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:50.750
And there's been a lot of
exchange always going on.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:55.730
But I think as things
move forward and we --

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.580
I don't know, it seems like
sometimes there's a tendency

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.450
to reduce the diversity
of the traditions and come

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:02.910
up with a simpler
and simpler idea.

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:07.710
And that gets reduced out and
people come up with one story,

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.280
that this is the people who
play this music, and this is --

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.070
and it just represents
this, you know,

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:15.490
a simpler form of identity.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:21.260
And I think that the
example the older musicians

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.580
and how they express something

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.660
so much more complex helps
me a lot in dealing with that

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:30.820
and realizing, oh, actually
being complex and being diverse

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:35.020
and telling people, yeah,
you might have an idea

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.860
of how it's supposed
to be, but here we are

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.780
and we're obviously
something different.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:43.060
It takes a little bit of a
radical or rebellious attitude

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:47.730
to I think to be able to believe
in ourselves and say like, yeah,

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:51.370
it is a little different than
people might be expecting,

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:55.270
but this is the best we can
do to maintain the continuity

00:31:55.270 --> 00:32:00.080
and express that and renew
the tradition in the context

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.460
of our lives and be authentic.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:04.760
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: Yeah.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:10.290
I think that creative pursuits
allow us to extrapolate

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:13.410
from an individual
to a larger idea.

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.970
And so as Jordan is saying
and as Noah has said,

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:20.820
like we're kind of
bridging I think a point

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.140
between what [inaudible],
who can put on one identity,

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.550
which is New Mexican, and
can put on another identity,

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:32.340
which is American, and
another identity which is

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.240
like college educated,
and, you know,

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.620
all of these different
forms of our identity,

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.400
that I'm using each of
these identities also

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:47.600
to further complicate
and sort of --

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.260
yeah, complicate
what's coming to me

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.800
from my background
or from my history.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.920
And so in this way
I believe that music

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.790
and art are really
radical pursuits,

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:05.230
because all of our histories
are similarly bridged

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:06.530
by an individual.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:09.940
And so we have a story
of our living together

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:13.490
as different groups of people
and as we identify differently,

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.750
either based on -- you know,
my mom being from the west side

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:19.070
and my dad from the east side,
though they're both Hispanic.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:22.070
Or, you know, we're from New
Mexico and they're from Texas,

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.400
though we both love ranchera.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:27.420
Or, I'm from New Mexico
and you're from Mexico,

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.530
but we're connected through
this string band style

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.210
which New Mexican
musicians can play I guess,

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.240
because we're doing that.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.820
But there's not really a hard
or fast line about like, well,

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.090
Jordan's from Missouri, so
he can't possibly know how

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:43.390
to play New Mexican music.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:45.190
Like Jordan knows how to
play New Mexican music.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.100
Or Noah's from Albuquerque,

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.890
so he can't possibly know
how to play blues music.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.830
Like Jordan's from -- I mean,
sorry, Noah is from Albuquerque

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.530
and absolutely is
a blues musician.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:57.630
And so it's easy when we're
looking at a whole group

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:00.570
of people to simplify
these things,

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:05.430
and it's much more difficult to
look at a whole group of people

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.260
and to see individuals.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:12.100
And that's the spirit that I
think I find in this group,

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.910
is that, you know,
certainly we're very concerned

00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:19.040
about the tradition and we're
very concerned about speaking

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.450
with elders and we're
very concerned

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:22.010
with doing everything
in the right way.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:28.130
But we're also members of our
generation in 2018 in America,

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:31.550
which also means we've been
exposed to the Internet.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:33.550
We've had to use the
Internet a lot for research.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:36.820
You know, I know what it's like
to hear music from East Asia,

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.250
which neither of my
parents had ever known.

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:44.790
And so even though we might
be sort of consciously --

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:46.400
we have these conscious
touchstones

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:51.120
which are northern New Mexico
fiddle tradition, you know,

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.660
Texas fiddle tradition,
and accordion tradition

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.830
and conjunto tradition
and muthican [phonetic].

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:01.250
Like I also play based

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:06.080
like I have extensive
African percussion training.

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.380
And that comes into play.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.680
You know, it's changed
the way that I hear.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.770
And so I'm hearing as a
person whose also learned

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:18.320
to hear differently based on
what I've been exposed to.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.710
And as, you know,
members of this world,

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:25.150
which is tending toward
that way, tending toward

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:28.950
like blurring of lines,
it's important for me too

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:31.500
to say like, that's
part of the radicalism.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.660
That I can be a person who
has studied West African music

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:38.980
and knows a very tiny, tiny,
tiny bit about what that's like.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:42.900
And can say that I'm both,

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.180
and I'm also playing this
New Mexican tradition.

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.990
And so that's some of what
people are hearing too.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:51.670
Though, as Jordan says, maybe,
you know, like at first glance,

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:55.050
it's easy to think,
oh, it's just this.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:56.350
&gt;&gt; And I think it's --

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.200
from experiencing
with the elders too,

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.850
I think they were
always like that.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:02.150
And they just had
different lives.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:05.860
And, you know, in 1920 in rural
New Mexico, you're exposed

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.430
to a much different
palette of things.

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:12.970
And the musicians in Missouri
who, you know, they were exposed

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:15.920
to swing music and bluegrass
music and country music

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.480
and jazz and classical music.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.870
And the best examples,

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:24.800
the masters of that
tradition, took from everything.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.410
And we can look back and say,
oh, they're this one thing,

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:29.370
but they actually were --

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:33.560
their process was very creative
all along and very diverse.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.860
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez: Yeah.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.250
And I think we can continue that
now I think with like thinking

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.440
of like touching back on what
Jordan and Leticia were saying,

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.500
yeah, we're not your
conventional New Mexican band.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:49.230
And like I look at me,
like this is where I love

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.970
to be musically,
with these guys.

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:54.940
And it's always new and we're
moving forward constantly

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.940
and there's always the look down
the road is so invigorating,

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.280
I want to go really far.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.790
Where I haven't had
that in the past.

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:05.630
And so when people look at us,

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:07.620
especially before
Leticia joined --

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:10.180
we had another guy
who was an Anglo guy.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:14.860
And people in my community would
kind of judge us and be like,

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.870
oh, you're playing with those
gringos over there, huh.

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:18.960
Well, that's not real music.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.420
And you're like, well, it kind
of is, because if I was waiting

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.290
around for a bunch of Chicanos
to play in a band with,

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:28.370
I'd be at home right
now, you know,

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:31.290
waiting to get off my shitty job
so we could go play at the VFW.

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.820
And that's as far
as it would go.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.440
And we'd practice once
a week and that's it.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:40.650
But because you have to take
those things away from it

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:44.680
and be like, well, because I am
a musician and I've always --

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.550
I just see the musician
as the musician.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:52.250
I don't care about race, age,
color, sexuality, anything.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:54.580
It's just you're a
musician, you're awesome.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.880
You have this.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.180
You study music.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.480
You love it.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.780
So we have that with each other.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.080
So it really doesn't matter.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.250
Even if we decided
tomorrow, like we don't want

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:06.080
to play this music
anymore, let's, you know,

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.270
let's do a different traditional
style that we're going

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:10.690
to get into, I think we'd
still have the same result

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:13.270
as a passion for the music,
because we love music.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:16.700
At the end of the day,
musicianship doesn't know any

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.150
of those prejudices, it's just
who you are and what you love.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:21.140
And I think this group's a
perfect example where it's

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.300
like Jordan's -- you
know, we all three

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.860
as individuals have very
different lives and come

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.350
from different places.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:30.790
And we don't always come
together in the easiest way

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:32.930
because of that like, you know.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.900
Because like Leticia, she grew
up one way, I grew up one way,

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.200
Jordan grew up one way.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.100
But at the end of the day,
it's those differences

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.990
that we're forced to
settle that help us grow.

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:44.330
I know it helps me grow and
all of us, and we're all

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:45.630
in this thing together.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:49.330
And if that's not more of an
example of just what growth is

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:52.780
and unity and -- like being here
in the nation's capital is like,

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.510
wow, this is the -- and hearing
all the different languages.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:59.120
And it's like we're doing
exactly what we should be doing

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:06.140
and not thinking small-mindedly
and drawing circles

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.440
around what our picture
should be.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.430
You know, it's totally free and
open, and I think that helps us.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:11.730
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: Yeah.

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:14.180
I think having the
external goal, you know --

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.820
and it's tangible, you know.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.240
You pick up your instrument and
like we have to find some way

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.580
to be on the same page enough
to play this at the same tempo,

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:27.160
at the same rate, in the same
key, you know, hitting the verse

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.900
and then the chorus
at the same time.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.990
Like that -- I don't think
that it's possible to ask

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:37.890
that we always grow or we always
like understand another person.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:42.080
I mean, I think in the best
case scenario that happens.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.750
But, you know, like
to be able to be

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:46.400
with each other in
our differences.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.150
I think having music in a
creative pursuit in a way,

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.710
you know, like it's
a flexible thing.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:55.430
You can say like, okay,
well, this is not working.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:58.940
It's not working for us to play
this section two times here.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.230
Because it's creative,
literally we can decide, well,

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.530
we're only going to do it once.

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.010
And that feels better for us.

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:08.160
Like we've been struggling with
gusteaus [phonetic] recently.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.470
And for months and
months, it was like,

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:13.010
why is this gusteaus
not coming together?

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:14.400
Why is this not working,
you know?

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.850
Like we're listening to
the source recording,

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.440
we're doing what they're doing.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.380
Are we going too fast?

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.680
Are we going too slow?

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.980
We tried it a million
different ways

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.080
and then we finally decided, for
whatever reason, it just needed

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.390
to be a little bit shorter.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:28.110
And so, like, there's
that freedom and there's

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:32.300
that flexibility in order to,
like, to spend the time asking,

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.180
well, what's not
working, you know?

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.060
So whatever our backgrounds are,
you know, like, I had one idea

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.360
about why it wasn't working

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.660
and I'm sure these
guys had other ideas

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.890
about why it wasn't working.

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:47.420
That it matters but
it's secondary to, like,

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.720
we want to play this tune.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.240
We love this tune and we love
this tradition and we just have

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.390
to kind of keep going
long enough

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:57.200
and to take enough pressures
away to understand that, like,

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.350
actually what the
music wants is this.

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:01.620
&gt;&gt; And if we can just
find a way to communicate

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.270
with each other that's
healthy for everyone,

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.510
we don't lose this beautiful
thing that we want --

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:08.130
all of us want so badly.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:09.900
So that's been great.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:14.570
That's really a lot of -- good.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:18.710
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: I must
say, you've touched upon

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:20.770
so many questions I
wanted to ask, thank you.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.070
&gt;&gt; We're good at just going.

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.250
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
Yeah, it's a breeze.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:27.440
But I'm going to back up
a little bit, if I may.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:32.160
But you remind me of what
you, Leticia, said on stage

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.710
about polka -- I the think
the song was The Woman

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.010
Through Warsaw.

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.310
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: Oh yeah.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:39.610
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And
how, you know, the grabbing

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:40.910
of these traditions
and also the migration

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:42.440
of cultural knowledge, people.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.740
Could you talk a little bit

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.470
about why polka is
in New Mexico?

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:47.770
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: Yeah.

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:49.750
So that tune actually
is a varsoviana,

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.360
which is not quite
a polka, so polka --

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.820
they're similar though, right?

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:57.020
So they're -- they're both
coming from Western Europe.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:02.260
And so the polka tradition
overlays another tradition,

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:03.950
a lot of which we've lost.

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:07.960
So we have some dances that
are still danced in New Mexico

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.190
that are kind of more
directly from Spain,

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:15.260
one being the inditas, which
came over to Mexico and then

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.530
up the trail to New Mexico.

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:23.100
And so, inside of that, because
these are community dances

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.790
and because you can dance
them within certain rules

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:30.260
and regulations with
people -- other people --

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:34.160
so like, women and men dance
together, women dance with,

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.090
you know, their father
or their husband

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:37.870
or their brothers
or just changing.

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:42.830
Then when the American
colonies started moving west

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:45.940
and when soldiers were coming
-- before the soldiers,

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.460
there were other
Americans coming.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:52.980
And those Americans brought
trumpets and they brought a lot

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.880
of different instruments
and they brought the polka.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.860
And the New Mexicans,
for some reason,

00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.160
probably because they were used

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:02.730
to community dances,
loved the polka.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:04.030
So they grabbed onto the polka

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:07.270
and with the polka came the
varsovienne, which is a dance,

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:09.950
like, I don't know what
it's like in Warsaw.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.240
It's probably not even
danced in Warsaw anymore.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.840
Maybe it's not from Warsaw, it's
just about a woman from Warsaw.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:20.040
That traveled all the way
from, you know, central Europe

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:23.670
through western Europe across
the ocean to the eastern part

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.330
of the United States,
and then over the trails,

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:28.740
you know, to New Mexico.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.540
And New Mexicans loved it.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.290
They were, like, we get this.

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:35.680
This makes sense to us, the
varsovienne, let's do it.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.800
I don't listen to
a lot of pop music

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.310
so I can't find a pop,
like, parallel but.

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:42.610
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
The Macarena?

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:44.030
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales:
Yeah, like the Macarena.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.910
It's like the Macarena
of, like, the 1800s.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:51.130
And it survived, probably
because it's so specific

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:53.300
and then also because
of the adaptations

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.800
that Jordan was mentioning
earlier, right?

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.840
Like we went from
fiddles to accordions

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.140
and then fiddle and accordion.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:03.050
And then, you know, as
you could amplify things,

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:05.280
as dances were getting bigger,
as there were more people,

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.940
as our community
spaces were changing,

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.140
we started amplifying things.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.450
And that turned into what
it's turned into now.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:15.540
So like the polka, I see
a big, like, I don't know

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.500
that it is necessarily
related but the polka

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:20.570
and in the ranchera, which
is generally played amplified

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.350
and with guitars and stuff,
which is what my parents grew

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.620
up dancing, like, well, you
can dance the same dance

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:26.920
to a polka and to a ranchera.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:31.580
I don't know if that answers
your question, I think it does.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:32.880
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Absolutely!

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.180
That's very true.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.040
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez: Also, when
Jordan was doing research

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.920
in Mexico this past December,

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.550
he found out from Don
Serafinivara [phonetic]

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:44.520
that a lot of those tunes
are related to other songs

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.240
because he sent me a
version of a varsovienne

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.210
that Serafin [phonetic] does and
that they come from [inaudible]

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:52.490
and it's even deeper than that.

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:56.710
So somewhere when that --
along that line when it stopped

00:44:56.710 --> 00:45:00.560
in Mexico it grew there
and a seed was planted

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.860
and then it came up -- zip.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.410
But that tree's still
been growing so.

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:06.440
&gt;&gt; Jordan Wax: And that was
interesting to see too, like,

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.570
a lot of the style in
New Mexico, the waltzes,

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:14.150
like a waltz we played today
at the concert that comes

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:19.220
from [inaudible], and he learned
it from his uncle, [inaudible].

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.520
But in muchican [phonetic],

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.720
I heard some musicians
playing ritual funeral music,

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.340
and it was that exact tune,

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.820
with an extra third
section thrown in.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.700
So I was like -- it was amazing.

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.880
And I was asking some of the
musicians, and they said, yeah,

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:39.600
I think that a lot of the really
old repertoire from Europe

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.130
that came over, these
waltzes, then were adopted.

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:44.870
And they're called minuetes
[phonetic], and muchican use

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:48.910
for funerals and
religious observances.

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:52.540
But then in New Mexico, they
were adapted into social music.

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.130
And that could be part
of why, or who knows why.

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:57.040
But that's one -- you
definitely hear it

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.250
and it's the same
tune, you know.

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:01.470
&gt;&gt; I was thinking
of another one,

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:02.770
but I lost my train of thought.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.070
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
Well, since we're here

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:07.050
at the American Folklife
Center, which houses one

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:09.960
of the largest cultural
archives in the world,

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.090
would you talk a little bit more
about your archival research

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:15.690
or the work you do
with archives?

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:19.330
You mentioned the
University of New Mexico.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:20.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah. GD, John
Rob [phonetic] --

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:24.110
which is crazy for me because
as a kid growing up, we were --

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:25.480
my grandpa's a farmer.

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.400
And we -- where I live
on the Rio Grande Valley

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.820
and North Valley of Albuquerque,

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.330
at one time there was just
fields and fields and fields.

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:36.530
We grew alfalfa and lots of
hay, different types of hay.

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.340
And now they're all
mansions mostly.

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.650
But as a child, we grew

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:41.950
up in those fields
working and working.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:43.250
So I always remember
talking about,

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:46.780
we're going to do
the John Rob field.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.470
Well, this was this John Donald
Rob, his home, his estate.

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:50.790
We farmed that --
I've been farming

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:52.330
that field my entire life.

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:55.000
And so when Jordan introduced me
to the collection, I was like,

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.070
John Donald Rob, this is --
something is ringing a bell,

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:00.030
I don't know why, but I didn't
-- they weren't together.

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.910
And then I was talking
with his daughter,

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:06.770
who now runs his estate at
his house, and she was talking

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:09.450
about her father and
being an archiver

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:10.900
of musicians, and
it all clicked.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.490
And you're like, wow, what
a crazy connection that is

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:17.130
that you're so close
in the realm of, yeah,

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:18.430
you're literally working --

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:21.710
you're doing fieldwork and now
here I am studying the field

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:24.040
recordings of this
guy that he made.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.800
So it's a good connection
for me.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.300
And then the Juan B
Ryell [phonetic] stuff.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.180
And a lot of -- Ken and
Jeanie did a lot of --

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:31.710
from Bayou Seco did
a lot of cataloging.

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:34.620
We found a recording
recently on a trip

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.720
down there that blew our minds.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.340
And it's New Mexican musicians
playing pasodovas [phonetic],

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.090
which we haven't heard
ever in this region.

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:44.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we thought
that it didn't exist.

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:45.570
&gt;&gt; So yeah.

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:48.840
I mean, the other -- what
are some of the other?

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:51.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, those two,
the one [inaudible]

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.230
and the John Donald Rob
were both available online.

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:56.540
So we've had a chance
to get a lot from that.

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.690
But then a lot has also been
from just personal relationships

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:03.510
of people who have had, oh,
this tape that they put on CD.

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:06.090
Our friend Thomas
really helped with that.

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:07.390
And he had a lot of recordings

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:11.690
of his uncle Antonio Reverra
[phonetic] and the bands

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:15.620
that he played with in
Santa Fe and some musicians

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:16.920
around peko [phonetic].

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.630
So kind of other
musicians have really --

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:22.720
older musicians have helped a
lot and saying, oh, here's this.

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:27.550
And just like last -- I guess
in the spring, that Jason

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:32.250
and Cordelia -- are some
older musicians and dancers.

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:35.070
And I had gone by their
house or something.

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:36.880
And they said, oh, look,
and they had this CD --

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:40.040
record, LP, of [inaudible]
from peko that I'd never heard.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:43.230
And that's where we got some of
the tunes we did today as well.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:47.860
&gt;&gt; So another one was we did
posobolo [phonetic] off the CD.

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:54.000
Our friend David Garcia up
in Espanola, he gave us a CD

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.770
that just said San Antonio
Trio, and it was bajo,

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:00.530
violin, and electric bass.

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:02.300
And we had no information
other than that,

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.010
but we just studied
that record forever.

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:07.180
And we made some contacts
with some people in Texas

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:10.220
who provided us with
information eventually.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.520
We now know what that is.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.330
But a lot of it's like
that, just stuff by chance.

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:18.430
And [inaudible], another guy
in New Mexico, who'd done --

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:22.760
he wrote a book and put a CD
collection of music out of tunes

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.770
and the people who played
them back in those days.

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:27.860
But YouTube a lot.

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.160
You know, I mean.

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.460
&gt;&gt; For Mexican stuff.

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:31.760
&gt;&gt; For Mexican stuff.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.620
Oh, yeah, mostly musicians
I guess has been our main

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:39.940
inspiration of sources of music.

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.990
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: You also
sing in different languages.

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:47.530
Can you talk about the
many different languages,

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:51.600
your repertoires
that you represent?

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We have a couple
songs in nywat [phonetic],

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:55.380
which is the language from
the Wastaka [phonetic].

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:59.970
So a lot of the ritual
music there which a lot

00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:01.360
of it is kanarios
[phonetic] style.

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:07.300
And a lot of them have lyrics --
not many, but there are several

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.600
that have lyrics in nywat.

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:12.060
And so when I was down
there, I had some lessons

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.610
and was working on
learning that.

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:19.880
And then also some of the
music we played today I learned

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.180
from [inaudible].

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:23.460
And he's from Eutupia
[phonetic] Michoacan.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.530
And their family speaks
porepicha [phonetic].

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:27.780
And so he helped me
with some of that.

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:31.940
And that's a beautiful
repertoire of porepicha music

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:34.470
that includes sonjos
alajenos [phonetic],

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:36.850
which are dance tunes
that are instrumental,

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:39.150
and them piedecuas
[phonetic], which are love songs

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:43.160
that are sung in porepicha
and sometimes Spanish.

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:45.880
And sometimes they're adapted

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.880
into fast-paced sones
[phonetic],

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:50.890
so you can sing with
those as well.

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:54.720
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales:
We're lucky to have lyrics

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.080
in nywat and porepicha.

00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:00.820
Because a lot of those
songs have been adapted

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:02.120
to Spanish, right.

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.160
So it's more common to
find -- I don't know.

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:07.900
I can't say that's true
for the porepicha music.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.690
But huapangos, it's
much more common

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:14.480
to hear a huapango in Spanish.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.660
So when we do have nywat
lyrics, it's pretty.

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:22.620
And I mean, there are certainly
bands that are doing that.

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.860
But at least in the
United States,

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:28.040
until I started diving
deeper into this music,

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.400
I didn't hear very many.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:32.990
&gt;&gt; And it's cool they
do it in New Mexico

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:35.500
because they actually
were a lot of --

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.800
the [inaudible] people
who came up

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.390
and like built a
lot of Santa Fe.

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:42.600
And I don't know how many
generations that lasted.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.270
But I mean, there's no
continuity of that now.

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:49.230
But it's cool to get to sing
in that language in a place

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:50.530
where it was once spoken.

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:54.860
&gt;&gt; We've also met some people
who are native language speakers

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.690
in Albuquerque that -- you know,
we would've never been able

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:01.290
to make those connections
without the repertoire.

00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:05.180
And we met a family,
the Garcia family.

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.480
Remember those guys?

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.080
&gt;&gt; And they invited us back to a
party at their house and played.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.380
It was a birthday party.

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.680
It was amazing.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.980
Remember that?

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:14.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.580
&gt;&gt; It was so incredible.

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:16.880
&gt;&gt; The kinsonero [phonetic].

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.180
&gt;&gt; The kinsonero, yeah,
it was a kinsonero.

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.480
And yeah, just language --

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.780
having that language and the
fact that Jordan's been able

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.090
to research that, opened us --

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:24.580
it invites you into
more people's lives

00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:27.610
and just gives a
more connections

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:30.050
with those folks there.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:31.560
Really cool.

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:33.890
&gt;&gt; And it's cool too
I think because --

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:36.450
like we were talking
about, the radicalism

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:40.150
of representing a more
complex cultural picture

00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:42.380
when people are expecting
something.

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:45.740
I think in New Mexico,
we're guilty of having

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.310
like an oversimplified
picture a lot of times.

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:52.190
Like the cowboys and
Indians and the Mexicans.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:55.290
Which is not a very
useful model anymore.

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:59.130
But it still kind of persists
in the psyche or the culture.

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:03.130
And I think when people see this
band that is playing, you know,

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:07.570
Spanish music and they bring
all these associations with it,

00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:10.110
and then they hear another,
an indigenous language,

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:12.610
that obviously is very
intimately connected

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:13.910
with the music.

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:19.530
It's fun to do that because I
think it instantly switches the

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:22.130
way people are watching
us and their expectations

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:23.430
and what they were thinking.

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:25.890
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: Yeah, it
definitely complicates things.

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:28.780
And I wanted to say
a little bit --

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.610
I've used archives especially --

00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:35.430
I grew up hearing a
lot of religious songs.

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:37.780
So a lot of my musical
background

00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:40.150
with elders was in church.

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:41.980
So Catholicism is
very predominant

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:43.640
in Hispanic communities
in New Mexico.

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.300
And I grew up very Catholic.

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:49.840
And I started using -- like
my favorite way to look

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.600
at archives is not only
to hear these recordings

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:58.520
but to see the different like
variations in lyrical content,

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.210
depending on where
that's being sung

00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:02.610
or where it's being practiced.

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:08.250
And so in addition to music
being a social thing, it also --

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:11.970
I think one of the most
beautiful traditions

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:13.680
in New Mexican music is
the elobo [phonetic],

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.500
which is the song prayer.

00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:20.350
And so everybody has a different
way of singing the same elobo.

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:23.350
And these lyrics are
really an amazing way to key

00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:27.640
into different symbolic or
like psychological aspects

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:30.190
of the New Mexican --
greater New Mexican --

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:33.710
you know, the Catholic culture
in New Mexico, which survives

00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:37.530
to this day, you know, in
sort of a different way.

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:40.730
And so I think, as Jordan
is saying, you know,

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:42.370
I think our cultures,
they kind of --

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:46.390
they get very like
very firm and fixed.

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:49.570
And then sometimes if you're
lucky, you're in a project

00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:51.000
that gets to go back
in there and kind

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.300
of excise different things.

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.050
And we're like, wait,
this is what ended

00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:55.630
up being fixed this way,
and this is what ended

00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:57.150
up being fixed this
way, but they each come

00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:58.450
from different places.

00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:01.980
And the archives are a
really amazing way to kind

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:04.640
of find those different pieces.

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.240
It's like doing cultural
surgery kind of I think.

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a
great way to put it.

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And they kind
of preserve diversity

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:16.540
that didn't survive to our day
for us to get to experience.

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:19.890
You can look back and say like,
wow, look at this broad spectrum

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:22.190
of how this one tune
was being played.

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:24.680
And so I don't have to --

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.870
you know, I can learn
it from this one --

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:29.970
this version that one
particular fiddler played.

00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:31.870
But my understanding doesn't
have to be limited to that

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:33.210
because I can hear all
these different ways,

00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.490
incorporate different elements.

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:40.340
And I think that helps
create a lot of space

00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:43.190
and breathing and
new life in it.

00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:49.130
Because yeah, I think with
just the pieces of continuity

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:50.460
that we have -- I mean,
it works together.

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:52.720
And I think we didn't
know living musicians

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.370
who we could work
with personally,

00:55:54.370 --> 00:55:56.940
the archives wouldn't be
worth very much to us,

00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.260
or wouldn't be very useful.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.120
But having those
two things together

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:04.100
to understand the
musicians and their examples

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:07.930
and how they play, and then
these different examples of,

00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:10.260
you know, just recordings
in moments in time,

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:12.180
I think those things
can work together.

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.190
&gt;&gt; Noah Martinez: Yeah, and I
think, like Jordan was saying,

00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:17.990
you have such a spectrum
to learn from.

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:20.720
It helps us because there's --

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.360
not anymore I don't feel
like we have it just

00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:23.870
because we stopped
caring about it.

00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:26.630
But in the beginning there was
such a pressure to do it right,

00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:28.790
because we're these young,

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:32.760
nontypical-looking people
doing this traditional music

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.450
who aren't exactly
from the tradition.

00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:37.420
Like I'm from New Mexico,
hard-core New Mexican,

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:38.830
but I'm from Albuquerque.

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:41.070
So when you go anywhere
north of there,

00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:42.670
they're like, oh,
he's a city boy.

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:44.040
This guy doesn't know anything.

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.510
Go back over there.

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:47.060
And the same with all of us.

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:49.130
We're not -- we're
not from small,

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:52.360
northern New Mexican towns where
we know everybody and we walk in

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.660
and everyone knows us.

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.740
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: It wasn't
directly transmitted to us too,

00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:57.240
like I didn't have
a dad who was like,

00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:01.090
here's the whole New Mexican
fiddle tradition -- go.

00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:04.320
&gt;&gt; And it gives us
that space to say,

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:08.270
here are all these different
people who've done this who are

00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:10.390
to us bona fide musicians.

00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:11.910
It's like, well we're
in there too, you know?

00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:14.970
We bring all of what we do too.

00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:17.930
One of our favorite guitar
players, Augustine Chavez,

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:21.970
he does all this amazing
licks and kind of swingy runs

00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:25.800
because he was probably an
elite guitar player at his time,

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.510
learning from everything
that he could.

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:30.900
So that helps -- it helps give
us a breadth of not just --

00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.200
here's this one recording.

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:35.150
If you don't play this polka
with a boom-chick, boom-chick

00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:37.470
and do this run exactly and
do an upstroke, you're wrong.

00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:40.040
It's kind of like,
well, it gives us space

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:47.120
and helps us have our own spot
to stand and be who we are.

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:50.710
&gt;&gt; And also in like all the
different styles we play,

00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:53.660
it's cool to be able to
look back at these --

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:56.090
you know, a lot of the
archives come from --

00:57:56.090 --> 00:57:58.320
like they start around 1950.

00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:02.690
And it's cool to say like,
we're exposed to all this

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:04.990
because of YouTube and
because we can travel.

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:08.510
You know, you can buy a ticket
for 200 bucks to Mexico City.

00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:11.860
And then you look back in
the 1950s, these musicians,

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:13.560
they also were doing
some huapangos

00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:16.250
and they were also
doing woletos [phonetic]

00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:17.670
and [inaudible] and
the same things.

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:23.170
And realizing, oh, the
different strands of cultures

00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:26.030
that are intersecting and
interweaving in our lives today

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:30.140
that it feels so novel and
it feels like it's happening

00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:32.970
in a novel way, but those same
things have been combining

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:37.380
for a long, long time and
just a different style

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:39.930
and different timescale
and different, you know,

00:58:39.930 --> 00:58:41.720
level of technology and stuff.

00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:43.960
But a lot of the same things.

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.760
I know that feels good to --
I don't know, reinforces that.

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:51.260
I think maybe something
that disempowers continuity

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:55.450
and traditions is people feeling
like, oh, I'm not that anymore.

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:59.220
I'm too different, so I
can't really participate

00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.510
or be involved in that.

00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:02.810
&gt;&gt; Modernism.

00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:04.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's like I'm
modern and that's not.

00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:06.510
Those people are all
kind of other to me now.

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:10.920
But I think being able to see
that and really relate to that

00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:15.440
and realize like, oh, no,
actually we are the same

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:18.230
as them, we're just
our generation

00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:21.220
of the same people
that keep, you know.

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:23.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And for
us on that end now,

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:25.450
we are a hard-core folk band.

00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:28.450
Like we -- today for
us doing sound check

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:29.750
with the microphones was

00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:31.760
like the most anxiety
I've ever had in a gig.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.050
Because we don't use microphones
-- we use one microphone,

00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:35.350
you stand in front of it.

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:36.650
Here you go.

00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:37.950
Here's your ham and
cheese sandwich,

00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:39.250
move along down the line.

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:40.550
And today was like gourmet.

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:42.700
We're like all these
things and positioning.

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.920
And that's pretty
difficult for us.

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:49.250
But we just got booked
recently to play a festival

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:51.300
up in Talce [phonetic],
New Mexico.

00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:57.320
And every group are electric
music computers, all this --

00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:59.050
and we're on the
same bill as them.

00:59:59.050 --> 01:00:03.870
So we're so extreme of being
a traditional folk band,

01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:06.630
that we're now cool with
the electronic kids.

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:08.250
It's crazy.

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:11.820
When I saw that flyer, I was
like, wow, that is so unique.

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:15.770
So maybe there's more
of that turn is coming.

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:17.070
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Well,

01:00:17.070 --> 01:00:20.080
you're on your way
to Brooklyn soon.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We're excited.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:23.980
So yeah, it's just
kind of those --

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:25.280
it's those moments
where you go, whoa.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.330
And then, you know, you
think we're going to be doing

01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:28.630
that electronic music festival,

01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:32.000
it's going to be
totally different for us.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.510
And then we just had this great
week of music with Bayou Seco,

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:38.520
who learned from all the
elders and are just --

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.960
those two worlds
are so far apart.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.180
And Lone Pinon's right
in the middle, you know.

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.480
So we're pretty lucky, man.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.780
It's kind of cool.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:48.080
It's pretty nice.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:53.510
&gt;&gt; As far as just on the other
side of that, how people --

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:55.470
our generation don't
necessarily want

01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:58.800
to associate themselves
with the old ways.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:02.860
Because everything is growing
so rapidly and we're all trying

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:04.780
to keep up and move forward.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:09.040
So it's nice when you move
forward by just standing still.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.340
It's pretty good.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.640
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: So do
you feel like you're a bit

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.400
of a counterpoint these days?

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.700
&gt;&gt; Maybe.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.140
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
Pushing back against.

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.870
&gt;&gt; I don't think maybe
people view us that way.

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:21.420
I don't feel like that's
like an objective for us.

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:24.210
Or maybe it's just something
that sort of happens naturally

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:25.680
and we don't recognize it.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:27.480
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Right, like
the radicalism you were talking

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.790
about just by the nature
of playing what you play?

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:31.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:33.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think that's kind of.

01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:35.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Go ahead.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.740
&gt;&gt; No.

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:39.500
&gt;&gt; I was thinking -- hearing
you say that made me think,

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:44.220
a lot of the reason
why the tradition

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:49.250
in New Mexico started
being silenced, you know,

01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:54.200
it wasn't anybody's mistake,
it wasn't people didn't care.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.460
But it was like the
whole structure

01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:02.960
of how we live together and the
economy and our society changed,

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.200
and the way people
were doing music

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.420
and this music no longer fit.

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:08.720
And so it just.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.020
&gt;&gt; Went away.

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.320
&gt;&gt; It juts went away.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.690
And so for us to say, no,
we're going to do that now,

01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:16.720
it is like against the stream.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.750
&gt;&gt; Like the pants are too small

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:21.410
but we're going to
make them fit.

01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:22.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [inaudible].

01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:24.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we got to
stretch them out.

01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:26.190
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Just
going back a little bit.

01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:30.510
You know, you've ben meeting
with so many master musicians,

01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:33.990
become friends, this community
that you're also helping

01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:37.040
to reconnect or strengthen.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.180
Do you record anyone at all?

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.910
Are you secret folklorists?

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:42.210
&gt;&gt; I do, yeah.

01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:43.890
&gt;&gt; I have a digital recorder.

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:47.710
And yeah, when I was visiting
saraphine [phonetic], I would --

01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:50.360
every time he just
loved [inaudible].

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:56.520
And he was an Encyclopedia of
many generations of stories.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.480
And I would always
just put that on.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:59.780
And I'd send them back.

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:01.130
And I've got hours and hours

01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:03.520
of him just talking
and telling stories.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.660
And that was amazing.

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.350
Because, you know,
like one thing

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:08.950
that really impressed
me was we were talking

01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:12.580
about this fiddler
[inaudible] from San Antonio.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.540
And he was -- [inaudible]
re-released some

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.840
of his recordings.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.980
And like on the description on
the back of it, they said, oh,

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:21.980
he's this rural fiddler
from south Texas

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:26.950
and people liked his music
because it was so rustic.

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:35.850
And then I was talking to --
and that he lived in San Antonio

01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:37.630
and they lost track
of him or something.

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:40.850
And this fiddler [inaudible]
was like, [inaudible].

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:44.300
Yeah, we hung out all
the time in Mexico City

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.600
when he was an old man.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.180
Yeah, he moved back
to Mexico City.

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:50.450
And I was working as a musician
there and I would always go

01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:52.030
to his house and hang out.

01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:54.770
And it was this whole
piece of the history

01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:57.360
that wasn't known in America.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.680
And he was actually, no, he
wasn't a rural Texas fiddler

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.520
at all, he was from Quiwila
[phonetic], and he played

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.820
in the symphony down here.

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:08.980
And yeah, he played a really
sophisticated style of music.

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:12.300
And it's cool, like that
really made an impression.

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:16.380
He was like, whoa, what was
printed on the back of the CD.

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.680
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Was wrong.

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:18.980
&gt;&gt; Was wrong.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.120
And like the musician told me.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.850
&gt;&gt; I love Jordan's
-- hearing Jordan.

01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:25.120
He was gone and I was at home.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.830
I had a little newborn at home
that I was taking care of.

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:29.720
And so when those
messages would come in,

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.410
they were like a saving grace
to me of musical knowledge.

01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:36.960
And for us, you know, we've
done gigs and sat and been

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.480
on the ride home and like
just talked about, well,

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.010
how do you think
that this happened?

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:44.400
And why did this -- why is there
a [inaudible] in south Texas?

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.700
And I remember one of
the interviews was --

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:49.410
or one of the clips Jordan sent
me was him asking Saraphine.

01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:51.640
He's like, oh, I knew the
guy that took the first one

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.580
over there, in San Antonio.

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:54.880
Yeah, [inaudible] all the time.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.180
I knew him.

01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:57.480
We're like, oh my goodness.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.220
To have that source of all
the knowledge and everything.

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:01.680
And now, well, we
have it a little

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.220
so we can share the
stories about.

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:07.630
Yeah, that's pretty
nice to have.

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:10.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I think
it's inspired me.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:14.910
Just like now that -- I started
doing that with musicians

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:16.210
and the older musicians.

01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:19.130
And as time's gone on,
now I've lost those people

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:20.430
and they've passed on,

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:21.810
and having those
recordings is so amazing.

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:24.580
And so now I record
not just musicians,

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.110
I record all kinds of people.

01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:27.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I better
watch what I say

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:29.370
in the tour card
because I've always.

01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:30.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:32.510
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
There are codes of ethics.

01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:35.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't have to
follow any of them in my life.

01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:37.530
It's just like at
family gatherings

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:38.940
and stuff, I'll just put it on.

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.240
&gt;&gt; You never know.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.680
&gt;&gt; It's like -- yeah,
music's just like anything,

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:45.620
that moment will never repeat
of having those people together

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:48.380
and that they were all in
that phase of their life.

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:51.430
And I have recordings of my
grandma singing in a way that --

01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:53.180
she'll still thing but
not like she used to.

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:55.100
And so I have those recordings.

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:58.430
And that it means a lot to me.

01:05:58.430 --> 01:06:01.590
So yeah, I'm a secret
folklorist.

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:03.440
Probably unethical.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.800
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales:
It's not secret anymore.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.380
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
Welcome to YouTube.

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:09.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.680
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
This has been wonderful.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.980
Thank you so much.

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:16.390
I guess my last question would
be, what's next for Lone Pinon?

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:17.690
&gt;&gt; Lunch. I'm just kidding.

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:19.930
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales:
We already had lunch.

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:21.230
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:22.530
Second lunch.

01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:24.590
I don't know, just try -- I
guess for me it's like just try

01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:26.640
and keep it -- try and keep all
the wheels turning, you know.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:30.780
Life catches up with us outside
of music, and it makes it hard.

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:33.960
You know, just to be
honest, it's difficult

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.780
to keep going with everything.

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.030
So for us, it's just -- for me,

01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:43.110
it's like just keeping it
alive is the next thing.

01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:45.600
And then after everything will
come, we'll follow from there.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.020
&gt;&gt; Leticia Gonzales: We
do have a couple projects

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.320
that we're working on.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.690
So we've recorded an
album called [inaudible],

01:06:51.690 --> 01:06:54.760
which should be released --

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.760
I don't know if we
decided it was going

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.200
to be this fall or
in the spring.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.500
But upcoming.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.800
And then we're working --

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:04.180
we've gotten a grant from the
John Donald Rob Foundation

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:07.100
to record specifically
New Mexican tunes.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:10.270
So we're also going to hopefully
get into the studio and record

01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:13.030
with some of the elders.

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:14.330
Those as well.

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:16.840
Because the other
albums have, you know,

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.170
been kind of a collection
of all of the traditions,

01:07:19.170 --> 01:07:21.480
and we don't have anything
that's just the New

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:22.780
Mexican style.

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:27.950
So that's some more archival
work that'll be upcoming.

01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:29.500
&gt; Yeah, that'll be a lot of fun.

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's going to be great

01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:32.990
to have the opportunity
to do that.

01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:35.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And just trying to --

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.660
like we got that
little that grant,

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.960
which will partially help.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.260
We don't have enough
for the rest,

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:43.600
so if anyone's watching this
and would like to [inaudible].

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.300
But yeah, I mean, that is
kind of the situation a lot.

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:53.300
Like Noah said, it's
tricky to keep it going.

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:56.970
And we've been doing
it full-time,

01:07:56.970 --> 01:07:58.350
which is a real challenge.

01:07:58.350 --> 01:08:00.370
And, you know, trying
to figure out --

01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:03.270
a lot of what we've been
doing is trying to figure

01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:05.620
out what's the -- like
what's the economic role

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:09.470
for a band doing this kind of
traditional music in New Mexico.

01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:15.130
And also, thinking that if
we can create that space,

01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:18.190
then it creates space not just
for us but for other musicians

01:08:18.190 --> 01:08:19.640
to be involved in the tradition.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:24.680
Because if no one can -- you
know, if no one can afford

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.370
to play this kind of
music, no one will.

01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:30.690
And I think the hard work
we do hopefully will --

01:08:30.690 --> 01:08:32.820
I know that's one thought
I've had, is that it could,

01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:36.750
you know, create a space.

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:38.900
You know, like part of the
way the music went away was

01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:41.920
because the economic
aspect of it was cut off.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.220
&gt;&gt; Didn't allow it.

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, didn't allow it.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.820
And the way it fit
before didn't and trying

01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:47.120
to find new ways to make it fit.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.930
And so that is a tricky
element of what we do.

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:54.260
I'm not like militantly
attached to, you know,

01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:57.950
all being full-time
and making that work.

01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:00.860
But we do have to find a way
to make it work in our lives.

01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:03.420
And it can be challenging
in our region.

01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:06.480
Because, you know, there's
some good playing opportunities

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.150
and then we have to play in
a lot of bars and cantinos.

01:09:10.150 --> 01:09:13.380
That, you know, after years
and years of doing that,

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.950
starting to say, well, maybe we
really don't want to do that.

01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:20.350
And if we don't do that, how do
we keep up the band, you know?

01:09:20.350 --> 01:09:22.310
&gt;&gt; And even just logistically,
we all three of us live

01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:26.160
in different towns, you know,
within an hour of each other.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.080
So it's like, you know, it
would be great to be, you know,

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.970
chummy 21-year-olds and
we all share a house

01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:35.050
for $10 a month wherever
we can live.

01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:37.600
But it's difficult, you
know, having a life,

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.990
trying to build a life that is
able to support music and try

01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:43.230
and build music that's able
to support your life as well.

01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:44.530
I think finding the balance

01:09:44.530 --> 01:09:47.620
in there is kind of
a priority for us.

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:48.920
But we've done a pretty good.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.710
I mean, even like I think
from the first days,

01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:54.910
it was like we still kind
of have that taste of like,

01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:57.840
this is awesome and let's
just as long as this lasts,

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.590
we're going to give it
our all and enjoy it

01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:01.140
and get as far as we can.

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:02.440
And I still feel that.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.620
Kind of like I still
feel those butterflies

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:08.060
like when we played today
that I felt when we first met,

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.710
you know, and like when
Leticia first came on with us,

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:13.150
and just the power that
we all have together.

01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:16.880
And it's like, okay, we
can make this work I think,

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.700
just keep it going, you know.

01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:22.060
That's the hard part,
keeping it going.

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:23.360
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: All right.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:28.500
Is there anything else
you'd like to add?

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:29.800
[inaudible].

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.100
All right, thank you so much.

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:32.400
[ Applause ]

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.530
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
