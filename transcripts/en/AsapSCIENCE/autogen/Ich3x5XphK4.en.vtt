00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.280
 Penis circumcision is practiced for thousands of years 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.800
 often within cultural and religious traditions 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.420
 But give it to you that you are circumcised or uncircumcised, 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.400
 affects health improvement, what it is like to feel or to have sex? 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.820
 Circumcision is a medical procedure that removes penis skinheads, 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.280
 exposing the glans of the penis. 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.700
 Although the exact origins and intentions are still being discussed, 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.600
 at a time when it became commonplace in the English-speaking world (19th century) 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.540
 Trimming has actually been done to reduce sexual pleasure 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.160
 and for masturbating, 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.600
 which was believed to cause many mental and physical illnesses. 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.120
 But the medical benefits of circumcision came into question in the late sixties 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.780
 when the research community was opposed to it, 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.080
 arguing that there is no clear medical benefit 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.760
 and that the risk of higher blood loss, infection, or death was high. 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.700
 This resulted in the fall of circumcised men. 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:02.520
 In the United States, the hunting hospitalization rate fell from 64.5% in 1979 to 58.3% in 2010, 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.240
 but the world estimates that only about 33% of men are circumcised. 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.460
 However, some modern research has shown that it can reduce the risk of developing penile cancer 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.660
 and infections such as syphilis, gonorrhea and herpes. 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.120
 It can also reduce the risk of HIV by up to 60%. 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.380
 The research conducted in Uganda involving heterosexual couples, one of whom was HIV positive 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.240
 has shown that none of the circumcised men have been infected with HIV for 30 months, 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.360
 while 40 out of 137 men who did not circumcise HIV. 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.520
 This proof applies to the entire sub-Saharan Africa, but it is not clearly demonstrated in developed countries 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.580
 or among homosexual men for which more research is needed. 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.540
 For women, the circumcised sexual partner most likely has a reduced risk of HPV, 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.600
 which reduces their risk of developing cervical cancer. 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.680
 So how does circumcision protect you from STI? (sexually transmitted diseases) 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.680
 The research conducted by Dr. Price and his team at the University of Northern Arizona 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.900
 showed that one year after the circumcision of adult men ended with 81% less bacteria on and around their penis. 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.060
 Dr. Price explained that in unbound men, the skin may be susceptible to infections 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.280
 because excessive amounts of bacteria can prevent specialized skin cells, known as Langerhans cells, 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.080
 from stimulating the immune system. 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.060
 However, with good hygiene, these risks can be minimized. 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.980
 The benefits of circumcision begin to decrease when you study sexual pleasure. 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.060
 Studies have shown that removal of the skin reduces the penis sensitivity 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.080
 The skin is inerved with specialized nerve that can detect light touch, 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.420
 like nerve on your fingers and lips. 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.740
 The most sensitive part of the penis is between the transition region 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.460
 between the outer and inner part of the foreskin 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.540
 which is a region that is exposed when the skin retreats back during sexual activity. 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.360
 Research has shown that even the most sensitive part of the circumcised penis 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.700
 is not sensitive to skin. 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.840
 But this reduced sensitivity to circumcision could allow men to "last longer" during sex. 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.680
 One study documented 47 men who had premature ejaculation. 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.140
 In the research before and after the circumcision, it was found that the time of ejaculation 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.440
 nearly tenfold after the circumcision, and the satisfaction of the partner was also high. 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.420
 When it comes to visual inclination for the circumcised or uncircumcised penises, 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.420
 It is largely based on experience and bias. 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.180
 The Canadian Pediatric Association claims that due to the low risk of infection in North America, 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.720
 mandatory circumcision is not justified. 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.280
 However, in parts of the world where sexually transmitted diseases are present, the benefits of circumcision can overcome the risk. 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.460
 At the end of the day, if you live in a developed country and keep up to hygiene 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.120
 then there is no big difference between the two.
