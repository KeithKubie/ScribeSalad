00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.075 line:0%
I am in the jungle.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.578 line:0%
And I have absolutely no
experience in South America.

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:12.745
I've never set foot there.

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:15.347
<i> So, I went in the
 Amazon to look at</i>

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:18.117
<i> a specific community
 in Bolivia.</i>

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:19.318
<i> And more specifically</i>

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:21.287 line:0%
<i> in a settlement
 called Anachere.</i>

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:22.722 line:0%
<i> We went to
 look at the Tsimané.</i>

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:25.825 line:0%
<i> And the Tsimané, they
 are about 2,500 people</i>

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.327 line:0%
<i> living in the Amazon.</i>

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:31.731
We went up river for about
two days in dug-out canoes.

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:35.768
<i>After, you know, two-three days
flights, buses, cars, whatever.</i>

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:37.403
<i> We follow the
 Maniqui River right here</i>

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.305
<i> which is a tributary
 of the Amazon.</i>

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:41.440
<i> And eventually after
 two days we got here.</i>

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.345
<i> This is the Nate family
 welcoming us with SpongeBob.</i>

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.979
<i> - You see SpongeBob?</i>
- ( audience laughter )

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:50.283
<i> They live in small
 family settlements.</i>

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:51.784
<i> They will have one
 settlement here.</i>

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:54.153
<i> And then you need to walk for
 15-20 minutes, half-an-hour</i>

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:57.123
<i>through the jungle, up the river
 to reach another settlement.</i>

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.125
<i> And you know it's
 very dense jungle.</i>

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.960
<i> They usually live in
 these bamboo houses</i>

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.729
<i> with palm leaf roofs.</i>

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:05.531
They used to be fulltime
hunter-gatherer,

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:07.867
only relying on hunting
and gathering.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:11.237
Now, about 200 years ago
missionaries came there

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:14.206
and introduced them to
cultivation, to agriculture.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.909
<i> And so they grow a lot
 of plantain and banana</i>

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.344
<i> a bit of rice as well.</i>

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:21.814
<i> And corn, which is originally
 from that part of the world.</i>

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:24.584
<i> And they do
 "slash and burn" agriculture.</i>

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:27.553
<i> They burn, they grow right
 next to their settlement.</i>

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:29.122
<i> Also there is a
 lot of plantain.</i>

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.956
<i> They eat so much plantain,
 it's very dangerous</i>

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:32.358
because, you know, you're like,

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.726
"I'm going to skid
on that, you know,

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:36.028
these banana skins and
stuff everywhere."

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:38.631
- ( audience laughter )
- And they take the plantain

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.800
and they throw it
directly in the fire.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.069
Or they leave the skin on
or they shave it

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.203
there's all kinds of things.

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:46.940
Let's go for a little
drive down the river.

00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:10.196
( speaking in Tsimané )

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:16.202
( sound of motor boat )

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:22.675
( insects buzzing )

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:27.747
( speaking in Tsimané )

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:34.487
( girl laughs )

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.756
Matthieu:<i> And so, the family
 gathers around,</i>

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:37.957
<i> often, the fireplace
 like this.</i>

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:39.391
<i> This is the kitchen,
 this is it.</i>

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:41.193
<i> You know, just an open space.</i>

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:42.662
<i> The youngsters will be around</i>

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:45.198
<i> and often the older men
 they are going out hunting.</i>

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:47.400
And everybody hopes for
some meat to come back.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:49.635
<i> But I am sitting there
 and I see the two girls</i>

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:51.136
<i> like standing up and
 they're just leaving.</i>

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:52.672
<i> I am like, "Whoa, where are
 they are going?" You know.</i>

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.473
<i> I need to know anything
 what's going on.</i>

00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:57.509
I don't know, they're just
going into the jungle.

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:58.644
I'm like, "dude,
but there's

00:02:58.644 --> 00:02:59.812
like snakes and
all this stuff."

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:01.046
Yeah, but that is their home.

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:03.716
This is, for them, like going
around the block here.

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:07.386
And so they go out in the
jungle and they start foraging.

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:08.788
<i> They're just, you
 know, sitting there</i>

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:10.189
<i> and they just get up
 at some point from camp</i>

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.290
<i> and just start walking
 in the jungle</i>

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.059
<i> "let's go and find
 something to bite on."</i>

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:18.764
<i> And found this palm tree and
 started to eat palm fruit</i>

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:20.500
<i> which is full of good stuff.</i>

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.702
And I looked around, I saw
these nice red berries.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.136
I'm like,
"oh, this looks good."

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:25.471
They're like,
"you eat that, you're dead."

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:26.606
- I'm like okay.
- ( audience laughter )

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:29.675
So they know, I don't know.

00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:32.578
They are incredibly intimate,
this really impressed me.

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:35.948
To see especially youngsters
go out like this.

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:37.217
It's really beautiful.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.385
<i> They often
 go with dogs.</i>

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.487
<i> They have a lot of--
 a few dogs</i>

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.488
<i> lying around that
 they use for hunting.</i>

00:03:43.488 --> 00:03:45.024
<i>And there's a lot of rodents or</i>

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:47.726
<i> you know, various animals
 that live underground.</i>

00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:48.794
<i> So they hunt it.</i>

00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:51.196
<i> When the dogs find something,
 they go with the machete</i>

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:52.698
<i> to try to clear out
 the opening</i>

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:54.734
<i> to help the dog and
 find the animal.</i>

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:57.904
<i> My room was in the
 far right there.</i>

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.173
<i> I'll show you because
 it's such a nice spot.</i>

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.611
<i> So, this is it,
 this is my bedroom.</i>

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:06.646
( audience laughter )

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:08.647
<i> Cool stuff, there's a minibar.
 Let me show you.</i>

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:11.083
( audience laughter )

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:12.785
Matthieu:<i> Oh!</i>
( laughter )

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:14.586
<i> Computer inside.</i>

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:15.988
<i> I was miserable in Bolivia.</i>

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:18.391
I was really miserable.

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:21.294
There's so many mosquitoes,
it is incredibly hot.

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:24.030
I''m more like a, you know,
yak high-altitude type

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.298
- than monkey-jungle thing.
- ( audience laughter )

00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:28.701
<i> So, next day we go
 down the river.</i>

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:31.671
<i> We want to go to next camp and
 you know, what happened is...</i>

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:34.207
<i> This is the real
 evolution of diet</i>

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:37.042
<i> when you start feeding
 your camera with rice.</i>

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:38.477
( audience laughter )

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:40.546
I fell, I fell in the river

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:45.317
my camera went fully
into the river, and...

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:47.019
I had a back-up,
thanks God for the back-ups,

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:48.454
so I could still shoot.

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:51.457
But it survived, so I put that
in a zip lock with rice.

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.325
So, if it ever happens
you all know the trick

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:54.860
with phone and stuff,
and it worked.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.463
A week later, ten days later,
I switched it on, it worked.

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:59.598
<i> You know we ended
 up going up river.</i>

00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:02.634
<i> I have changed my camera,
 another camera, thanks God.</i>

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:04.470
<i> And we walked into
 this beautiful scene</i>

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.871
<i> where this old
 man, the older man</i>

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:07.840
<i> we saw him before
 in his plantations</i>

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.208
<i> standing there same
 again, I went back.</i>

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.644
<i> I love to go back to the same
 spot because he is at ease.</i>

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:13.245
<i> You know he is washing,
 he was stark naked</i>

00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:14.947
<i> but you know, he's
 seen me before</i>

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:16.782
<i> talked to him before,
 he just lets me there.</i>

00:05:16.782 --> 00:05:19.218
<i> And all this butterfly
 flying around.</i>

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:22.588
<i> You can see the body of one
 of the oldest men I met there</i>

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:24.824
<i> and who has been
 hunter-gatherer all his life.</i>

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.225
<i> That would give
 this kind of body.</i>

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:30.429
He is over 70,
still very active,
still physical because

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:33.399
yeah, he has to walk every
day to feed himself.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:34.834
You know, his kids
will help him.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.168
But they go hunting.

00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:38.704
<i> And so I went hunting,
 next day with his son.</i>

00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:40.473
<i>They brought back food, finally.</i>

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:42.041
<i> They brought this
 armadillo that</i>

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:43.876
<i> they cut up in
 pieces and...</i>

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:46.679
<i> It tastes very much like
 chicken, like anything.</i>

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:48.080
<i> They boil the meat.</i>

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.216
<i>They also had this coati, which
 is a bit similar to badger.</i>

00:05:51.216 --> 00:05:53.719
<i> They singe it in the
 fire straight in.</i>

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:56.689
Protein is very
important, protein.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.125
This is the only way
for them to get it.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:01.360
They don't get
animals every day.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.129
Yeah, if they get that once
a week, they'll be happy.

00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:05.897
<i> And then
 they do the gutting,</i>

00:06:05.897 --> 00:06:07.500
<i> often the kids do the gutting.</i>

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.568
<i> The guys come back
 from a long day</i>

00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:10.969
<i> some time the whole
 day in the jungle.</i>

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.471
They are exhausted, they
arrive back to camp

00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:13.539
they bring the food.

00:06:14.473 --> 00:06:16.241
They sit down, the
women prepare fire

00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:17.909
and then the kids
are given the task

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:19.745
to go and prepare the animal.

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:22.548
Everywhere, mostly
everywhere I went

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:24.683
it's often the kids
who do that task.

00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:27.320
And so the pieces
of meat are taken,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.789
<i> there is plantain that
 is shaven and boiled,</i>

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.156
<i> a bit of salt in there.</i>

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:32.624
<i> And they have this
 kind of porridge.</i>

00:06:32.624 --> 00:06:35.527
<i> Quite tasty result
 in that plate there.</i>

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:39.598
<i> So, stomach full, you
 know, feeling quite content</i>

00:06:39.598 --> 00:06:41.500
<i> I returned and I knew
 I was quite happy.</i>

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.536
<i> I knew what my next
 destination was.</i>
