characters were going to go even though

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869
characters were going to go even though
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:25.760
characters were going to go even though
they weren't really going to go

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770
they weren't really going to go
 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.590

they eventually go which is what we've
 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.960
they eventually go which is what we've
already seen and I just basically

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970
