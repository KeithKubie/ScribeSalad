Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Do you watch sports? I watch football. That's it. Yup. Do you worry about brain damage? Uh, well yeah cause it's gonna ruin the NFL. Do you look at it differently? We away? Do you look at it differently than you did like before that concussion movie? Uh, well I played high school football. I've, I've got hit so hard that I've seen stars and that kind of stuff. But I think that can happen. I don't look at it differently. To answer your question. No, no. I think that it, it, you know, they might change the helmets and they've tried that over the years. Do you remember it? Like it was just leather helmets. There was less concussions because you would not lead with your head. Exactly. Now you have a weapon on your head and people have used this such and so I would love, you know how they do throwback uniforms?

Speaker 1:          00:47          Let's see. I mean, let's go throw back equipment. Let's put the helmet back on. Tick that tick tat stupid face mask off. You really should. But you'd have to change so much. You have to change so much in the way people, there's so many different factors. The way that practice where they set up plays. Yeah, we would have to be a new game. I don't think it's going to happen. I think the perception of the helmet being safer, fuck the game up. I really think it did well, but you know, all right. I used to think that a bare knuckle boxing I like, they should have bare knuckles in the UFC. But then I've been watching this bare knuckle boxing stuff and people get caught up so bad. Now I'm thinking, you know what? It's better to have padded and uncles. It's better. Yeah, it's better for the fighters that helps.

Speaker 1:          01:28          The leather helmets were padded. They just weren't like a hard shell. And the Shell is what made it, uh, you know, used it as a weapon. So that's literally the only way you're going to be able to stop some of this brain damage. And you're still not going to stop at all. There's still colliding into each other. They say these guys are getting brain damage from getting hit in the chest. Yeah, they're getting hit in the chest and the head snapped back and the brain swashing around inside their skull. Well, they're, they're changing. I think, um, maybe like a younger, like little league now it's like you can't do tackle football until a certain age. So now that everyone's, you know, it's all flag football til a certain age. I think that that'll probably happen. And Yeah. And then, uh, the practices will be different where we only do pads once a week.

Speaker 1:          02:13          Save it for the real game will be amazing if the ever came up with something that definitively fixed it, like some stem cell treatment or something like that, that regenerate brain tissue and bring you back to your normal state. Right. If they do that, then we don't have to worry about it anymore. Right. But until that man, oh, that's gotta be around the corner, that's close. I think that's a very complex question of how to regenerate neural tissue, brain tissue, how to get rid of all those abscesses and all those things you see in those people's brains. And FCT, they developed these like holes in their brain. Yeah. It's serious shit. Yeah. It's, um, while that sport though, did you play football or no? No, no. I wrestled in high school. I was a little man. It wasn't that I wrestled 134 pounds. [inaudible] been a run of bad fucked up fuck out of here.

Speaker 1:          03:01          There was another dude show. The fastest guys are small and just, you know, it was that facet runner. I was a fast kicking and punching and stuff, but I wasn't really that faster runner been doing a lot of running. But um, when I was, uh, in high school when I was wrestling, they were trying to tell me to like the coach, coach Murphy who is also the wrestling coach, he was also the football coach and he's like, oh, come on, you're a sick fuck. You should, you should play football. Yeah. And I was like, dude, that guy plays football. We are this heavyweight. His name is Bobby Baker, who's 300 pounds. He was enormous. You're so big. I was like, he's not squashing me the fuck out of here. The hardest I've ever been hit was by a little dead and practice. Um, probably like five, seven, and he just, he was a, a db and it was a practice.

Speaker 1:          03:45          I was like third string running back and they're like, I was just running up the gut and I was falling into the end zone. Right. It was over. And this case, he had a run start like 20 yard head start. And it was like he came up from out of the ground and went, wow. Didn't lock me back up. Whoa. And that's the hardest I've ever been here. It was by a little guy. So you know, think about you momentum pito yeah, torpedo. Yeah. With a hard helmet. That's what he led with that helmet. But you know how fast I go, really good athlete can run and just think of all that mass behind them and just cock crash. Yeah. Yeah. That's the way those guys get hit and the amount of force behind them getting hit. It's probably unlike anything in sports other than a car accident. Right. Other than like the white car. Yeah.
