This is how Easter eggs are made.
And don't walk. Or bike.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.660
It's episode 32 of IMG!

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.510
Best haircut... ever.
And creepy t-shirt Abraham Lincoln.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.839
But hunting is awesome.
Oh.

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:23.500
Lishoffs rules. He made the Simpson's alphabet,
a superhero alphabet and curser bullies.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.359
An equally rare talent is found in Jeff Blazer.
He's the guy who photoshopped the famous

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.829
Orange Frog. He also made a geographical Pac-Man
and proved that Jim Henson was the puppet.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.690
Europe is naughty. And here's yet another false
motion illusion. Your brain can't figure it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.570
out, so as you look around it warps and stretches.
I suggest going fullscreen.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.570
Chicks love cats. Chicks love cats. Cats
love dogs. Dogs love everything. And cats

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.980
love butt gymnastics. You know, like the balance
beam. Balance beer.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.400
This isn't a joke. This is the last thing
you will see before you die. Can you find

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.259
the cat?

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.319
But we should move on to girls in costume,
tied up. Can you save them?

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.729
Reddit had fun last week with police from
awesome cities like the Flippin police, the

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.070
Climax police, and the infamous Sandwich police.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.540
Princess Peach. Grrrrrocery shop yellow, green,
black, red.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.619
Deviant artist Meirou created real-life Disney
princessess. Here's Ariel and Flounder.

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.439
Don't look, hey, wait a second.
Let me just turn on the light... line.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.120
But I prefer my lamps soft and gooey and
flowey. And my common objects huge. You might

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.710
need gloves this big to touch whatever these
kids are looking at.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.880
Maybe they're watching Facebook.com/Vsaucegaming,
where you guys have submitted 5,428 images

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.090
as of the very moment I'm saying this.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.650
Casey showed us extreme kissing, dance mode,
and Marshall dyed an egg in honor of Vsauce.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.470
Trude matured things up with this actual last
name and Carl asked us to cover up the top

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.230
half of this equation.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.880
And now it's time to watch LÜT on our other
channel, Vsauce2. It's a different channel

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.650
with different types of stuff, so be sure
you're subscribed, click right here to watch LÜT.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.030
And as always,

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.290
thanks for watching.
