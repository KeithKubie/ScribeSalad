00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.650
This is a map of the United States.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.200
Right now,
I live in California which is over here.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.939
But when I was growing up,
I lived somewhere here in Vermont.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.400
And notice that Vermont is right
next to the border of Canada.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.840
And as a kid,
I'd go up to Canada pretty often.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.950
And when I did,
something interesting would happen.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.560
The speed limit signs
would change from this,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.300
which means 65 miles per hour, to this.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.525
And my question is, what explains
this change in speed limit?

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:30.990
Do they just drive faster in Canada?

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.940
Do they measure distance differently?

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.300
Or do they measure time differently?
