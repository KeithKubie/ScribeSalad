00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:02.836
- [Instructor] Growing up
we all have impressions of

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:06.947
the Middle Ages, we read about
knights in shining armor,

00:00:06.947 --> 00:00:10.481
castles with moats and
towers, but when were

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:11.814
the Middle Ages?

00:00:13.043 --> 00:00:15.585
The simple answer, the
Middle Ages in Europe

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:20.384
are the roughly 1000 years
from the fall of the Roman

00:00:20.384 --> 00:00:24.516
Empire and to be particular
the fall of the Western Roman

00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:27.507
Empire, the Eastern Roman
Empire continues on for most

00:00:27.507 --> 00:00:31.855
of the Middle Ages, but
it starts in roughly 476

00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:35.124
and it continues on for
1000 years as we get

00:00:35.124 --> 00:00:37.874
into the 14th and 15th centuries.

00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:42.385
And it's really the time
period that connects the world

00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:46.468
of Rome, Europe during
antiquity and it connects it

00:00:46.468 --> 00:00:50.635
to the Europe that begins
to emerge in the 14th, 15th,

00:00:52.308 --> 00:00:54.448
and 16th centuries.

00:00:54.448 --> 00:00:56.770
The Europe of the Age of
Exploration, the Europe

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.962
of the Renaissance.

00:00:58.962 --> 00:01:00.706
Now what we're going to do
in this video is we're going

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:03.394
to look at maps of the
various time periods

00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:05.266
of the Middle Ages.

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:09.123
The Middle Ages are broadly
divided into three major

00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:12.242
sections, the early Middle
Ages, from the fall of

00:01:12.242 --> 00:01:16.086
the Western Roman Empire
to about the year 1000.

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:19.166
The high Middle Ages,
which was a high point

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.743
for the Middle Ages in Europe
which goes from about what

00:01:21.743 --> 00:01:25.282
the year 1000 to the year
1300, and then the late

00:01:25.282 --> 00:01:30.181
Middle Ages, which gets us
to the 15th century and it's

00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:34.348
considered not that pleasant
of a time to live in Europe.

00:01:35.268 --> 00:01:38.717
So let's just start with
what Europe looked like right

00:01:38.717 --> 00:01:42.688
after the fall of the
Western Roman Empire.

00:01:42.688 --> 00:01:46.131
So as you can see here, this
map is referring to the time

00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:50.298
period between 476 when Odoacer
takes over Rome and 493.

00:01:55.702 --> 00:01:59.115
And you can see the Eastern
Roman Empire is still here

00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:02.123
but the Western Roman
Empire is now fragmented

00:02:02.123 --> 00:02:06.070
amongst many Germanic kingdoms,
you have the Visigoths,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.237
you have the Franks, you
have the Kingdom of Odoacer.

00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:15.579
With the fall of Rome we
are entering into the early

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:16.579
Middle Ages.

00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:20.141
Now the Eastern Roman Empire
which considers itself

00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:23.437
the Roman Empire its
capital at Constantinople

00:02:23.437 --> 00:02:26.652
under Justinian has a
little bit of a last horah

00:02:26.652 --> 00:02:31.032
and is able to recapture the
Italian peninsula so it's

00:02:31.032 --> 00:02:34.294
able to recapture some of the
territory that was formally

00:02:34.294 --> 00:02:37.513
part of the Western Roman
Empire, some of the territory

00:02:37.513 --> 00:02:39.524
in North Africa that you
don't see on this map.

00:02:39.524 --> 00:02:42.964
But for the most part Western
Europe stays under the control

00:02:42.964 --> 00:02:45.381
of various Germanic kingdoms.

00:02:46.965 --> 00:02:51.132
So here we have fast forwarded
to the year 814 which would

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.122
be right around here on our timeline.

00:02:56.896 --> 00:03:00.321
And you can see a major event
has occurred either on the map

00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:02.260
or on this timeline.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.893
You have Charlemagne king
of the Franks crowned Holy

00:03:05.893 --> 00:03:07.380
Roman Emperor.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.281
On the map, you can see
Charlemagne's empire right over here

00:03:11.281 --> 00:03:14.672
he has conquered Northern
Italy, much of what we consider

00:03:14.672 --> 00:03:17.861
modern day France, much of
what we consider modern day

00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:22.356
Germany, Switzerland, the
Netherlands, and Belgium.

00:03:22.356 --> 00:03:25.700
Charlemagne is really one
of the defining figures of

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.081
the Middle Ages and especially
the early Middle Ages.

00:03:28.081 --> 00:03:32.104
As you can see, he's able to
unify much of Western Europe.

00:03:32.104 --> 00:03:36.271
A lot of our ideas about kings
and castles and knights begin

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.227
to emerge around the time of Charlemagne.

00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:46.436
This notion of being a Holy
Roman Emperor because he's able

00:03:46.436 --> 00:03:49.636
to provide protection to the Pope.

00:03:49.636 --> 00:03:52.821
The Pope says hey I'm going
to say that you are continuing

00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:55.654
on the legacy of the Roman Empire.

00:03:56.514 --> 00:03:59.044
Now as we'll see and we cover
in much more detail in other

00:03:59.044 --> 00:04:02.535
videos, the title of Holy
Roman Emperor or Emperor

00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:06.659
of the Romans, does not
continue on with Charlemagne's

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.826
descendants, but when you get
to 962, Otto who is a German

00:04:12.148 --> 00:04:15.700
king is crowned Holy Roman
Emperor again and you continue

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.867
to have Holy Roman Emperors
all the way until 1806.

00:04:21.173 --> 00:04:24.745
Now another major feature
of the early Middle Ages

00:04:24.745 --> 00:04:28.963
and you can see it on this
map, is that Islam in the 7th

00:04:28.963 --> 00:04:32.063
and 8th centuries comes out
of Arabia and is able to

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:35.636
conquer much of the Middle
East, Persia, North Africa,

00:04:35.636 --> 00:04:39.397
which you don't see on this
map, and much of what we

00:04:39.397 --> 00:04:43.569
consider today to be modern
day Spain and you can see it,

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.851
do you see the Caliphate
or Cordova right over here.

00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:51.365
You see the Abbassids here in
the east who also controlled

00:04:51.365 --> 00:04:52.671
much of North Africa.

00:04:52.671 --> 00:04:56.588
Now let's fast forward
to the high Middle Ages.

00:04:58.546 --> 00:05:02.713
So here we are in the year
1135 on our timeline that would

00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:09.222
be right about, let's see this
is 1100, that would be 1150

00:05:09.222 --> 00:05:12.222
1135 would put us right around here.

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.994
And you could already see
some interesting things on

00:05:16.994 --> 00:05:20.802
this map, the Holy Roman
Empire under Charlemagne is now

00:05:20.802 --> 00:05:24.969
fragmented, the Western third
is now the Kingdom of France,

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:30.483
the Eastern 2/3 are still
considered the Roman Germanic

00:05:30.483 --> 00:05:33.150
Empire or the Holy Roman Empire.

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:38.212
And even though it looks
fairly unified in this map,

00:05:38.212 --> 00:05:41.013
over different periods of
time it's really a bunch of

00:05:41.013 --> 00:05:45.076
fragmented Germanic kingdoms
nominally under this Holy

00:05:45.076 --> 00:05:48.376
Roman Empire sometimes it's
a little bit more unified

00:05:48.376 --> 00:05:51.376
under a stronger Holy Roman Emperor.

00:05:52.288 --> 00:05:55.349
Now the other things that you
see and we saw it on the last

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:59.760
map is that the Byzantine
Empire is continuing to lose

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.004
territory and you can see the
Muslim empires in this case

00:06:03.004 --> 00:06:07.171
it's the Seljuk Turks are able
to take even more territory.

00:06:08.716 --> 00:06:11.294
Now one of the things that has
happened by the time we look

00:06:11.294 --> 00:06:13.661
at this map and it's not
clear by looking on the map

00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:18.254
is that you have in 1054 the
Great Schism between the Latin

00:06:18.254 --> 00:06:22.421
Church centered at Rome and
the Eastern Greeks Church

00:06:23.263 --> 00:06:25.934
centered at Constantinople
and we have a whole series

00:06:25.934 --> 00:06:30.527
of videos on that and all of
the factors that led to it.

00:06:30.527 --> 00:06:33.864
But as we get to the time of
this map one of the things

00:06:33.864 --> 00:06:36.800
that the high Middle
Ages is most known for,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.028
the Great Schism or the East-West
Schism is one of the them,

00:06:40.028 --> 00:06:42.571
the Schism between what
eventually becomes the Roman

00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:45.934
Catholic Church and the Eastern
Orthodox Church, but what

00:06:45.934 --> 00:06:50.652
the high Middle Ages are also
known for are the Crusades.

00:06:50.652 --> 00:06:53.645
As already mentioned you see
how the Seljuk Turks are able

00:06:53.645 --> 00:06:57.083
to take much of Anatolia,
much of the peninsula from

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.278
the Byzantine Empire.

00:06:59.278 --> 00:07:03.119
And the West decides to send
what will eventually be called

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:07.036
Crusaders to help regain
land from the Muslims.

00:07:08.797 --> 00:07:13.406
And so that's where you see
the Crusades beginning in 1096

00:07:13.406 --> 00:07:16.877
at the very end of the 11th century.

00:07:16.877 --> 00:07:20.684
You can see the multiple
crusades that occur over roughly

00:07:20.684 --> 00:07:22.267
the next 200 years.

00:07:24.413 --> 00:07:27.258
And the Crusaders were
trying to reclaim land from

00:07:27.258 --> 00:07:29.904
the Muslims and especially
the Holy Land, much of which

00:07:29.904 --> 00:07:33.118
is below the map where you
can't quite see it over here.

00:07:33.118 --> 00:07:36.510
But it turns out that when
they are able to reclaim some

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.925
of that land they don't give
it back to the Byzantines

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:42.142
they set up what are known as
Crusader Kingdoms and you can

00:07:42.142 --> 00:07:45.565
see some of them right over
here in this bluish color.

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:48.841
So once again you had this
East-West Schism and the Crusades

00:07:48.841 --> 00:07:53.008
are further expanding the
division between east and west.

00:07:54.204 --> 00:07:57.406
And that really becomes
significant in 1204 when

00:07:57.406 --> 00:08:01.600
the Crusaders themselves
sack Constantinople,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.675
take Constantinople from the
Byzantines, so that's in some

00:08:05.675 --> 00:08:07.626
ways the point of no return.

00:08:07.626 --> 00:08:10.923
The Byzantines are eventually
able to take Constantinople

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:14.313
back but this is really
the beginning of the end

00:08:14.313 --> 00:08:17.192
for the Byzantine Empire.

00:08:17.192 --> 00:08:20.315
Now even though the high
Middle Ages are known for this

00:08:20.315 --> 00:08:24.156
tension between east and west
The Great Schism, even though

00:08:24.156 --> 00:08:27.405
it's known for the Crusades,
most of which were fairly

00:08:27.405 --> 00:08:31.711
unsuccessful despite being
very very very bloody

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:34.476
for the Crusaders, the high
Middle Ages were considered

00:08:34.476 --> 00:08:37.404
a high point for the Middle Ages.

00:08:37.404 --> 00:08:40.749
Farming technology coupled
with better weather actually

00:08:40.749 --> 00:08:43.789
significantly increased
agricultural productivity

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.436
at this time.

00:08:45.436 --> 00:08:49.533
But then roughly in the year
1300, historians consider

00:08:49.533 --> 00:08:53.116
ourselves moving into
the late Middle Ages.

00:08:54.843 --> 00:08:58.125
So you can see here in this
map by the late Middle Ages,

00:08:58.125 --> 00:09:01.275
Europe is starting to resemble
the Europe that we know

00:09:01.275 --> 00:09:04.364
in later periods once we
get into the Renaissance

00:09:04.364 --> 00:09:06.825
and the Age of Exploration.

00:09:06.825 --> 00:09:09.829
By this point, much of the
Iberian Peninsula has been

00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:13.849
reclaimed from Muslim rule
although you still have

00:09:13.849 --> 00:09:15.766
Muslim rule in Granada.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.268
Most of the Byzantine Empire
has now been taken over

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:24.413
by the Ottomans, save
Constantinople, Constantinople

00:09:24.413 --> 00:09:26.496
eventually falls in 1453.

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:30.588
This map right over here is
roughly what Europe looked like

00:09:30.588 --> 00:09:32.444
in the 14th century.

00:09:32.444 --> 00:09:36.611
So this period right over here,
Constantinople falls in 1453

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:40.889
ending the Byzantine Empire formally.

00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:45.242
And what the late Middle Ages
is most known for is being

00:09:45.242 --> 00:09:48.586
not that pleasant of a
time to live in Europe.

00:09:48.586 --> 00:09:52.753
In 1347, you have the Black
Death, which by some estimates

00:09:53.596 --> 00:09:57.763
kills 50 million people in
Europe, which is roughly 60%

00:09:58.941 --> 00:10:02.133
of the population at the time.

00:10:02.133 --> 00:10:05.421
It's also a time of famine,
the weather cycles get worse

00:10:05.421 --> 00:10:07.821
and even before the Black
Death you have a significant

00:10:07.821 --> 00:10:10.796
famine occurring in the 14th century.

00:10:10.796 --> 00:10:15.161
You can see right over
here between 1337 and 1453

00:10:15.161 --> 00:10:19.198
you have the Hundred Years'
War between France and England

00:10:19.198 --> 00:10:23.436
which lasts over 100 years,
once again not a pleasant time

00:10:23.436 --> 00:10:26.639
to live in especially Western Europe.

00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:29.518
But as we get into the end
of the 15th and especially

00:10:29.518 --> 00:10:32.472
into the 16th century,
historians consider that to be

00:10:32.472 --> 00:10:35.293
the end of the Middle Ages
and we start getting into

00:10:35.293 --> 00:10:39.247
the Age of Exploration and
the Renaissance which we will

00:10:39.247 --> 00:10:41.330
discuss in future videos.
