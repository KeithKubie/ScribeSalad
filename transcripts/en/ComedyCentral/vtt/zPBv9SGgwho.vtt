00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:03.136
This is what's weird is--most
people think Frankenstein

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.370 line:92%
is the Monster.

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:06.506 line:92%
<i> No!</i>

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:11.544 line:92%
It's not the Monster.

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:15.681
<i> It's the--Victor Frankenstein
 is the creator</i>

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:17.984 line:92%
<i> of Frankenstein.</i>

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.886 line:92%
<i> I mean--you know.</i>

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.921
<i> - What was the Monster called?
 - Oh, yeah.</i>

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:23.990 line:92%
<i> - Taco.</i>

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.192
<i> Which is interesting.
 - Yeah.</i>

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:27.860 line:92%
- [laughs]

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:31.697
- So Victor Frankenstein
looked down at his creation

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.202
<i> and the Monster looked up at
 him and said,</i>

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:39.872 line:92%
<i> "Master? Creator?"</i>

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:43.376
And Frankenstein
thought to himself,

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.114
<i> "He has white eyes
 and black lips</i>

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:53.319
<i> "and yellow skin and arteries
 bursting out of his skin.</i>

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:57.423
<i> This is not the person I
 thought I would be creating!"</i>

00:00:57.456 --> 00:01:00.460 line:92%
<i> And he ran out of the room.</i>

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.596
<i> Run, run, run, run, run.
 Run!</i>

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.331 line:92%
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:09.068
<i> And he hid in his bedroom
 and he thought to himself,</i>

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:12.572
<i> "This is terrible,
 what I've done.</i>

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:15.007 line:92%
<i> Oh, what do I do?"</i>

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.277
He laid down
and went to sleep

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.513 line:92%
and when he woke up,

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:24.450
<i> the Monster
 was staring right down</i>

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:27.653 line:92%
<i> on his filthy [bleep] face!</i>

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:29.222 line:92%
<i> - [spluttering laugh]</i>

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.830
<i> - And so Frawnken-steen said--
 - Frawnken-steen?</i>

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:40.066
<i> - Frankenstein.
 Did I say that?</i>

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.701
<i> - Yeah.</i>
- Okay,

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.503 line:92%
that's how scary it is.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.806
You don't want to say it
the same twice.

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:48.808 line:92%
So what I'm trying to say is,

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:53.479
<i> Victor Frankenstein
 freaked out so bad.</i>

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:56.716 line:92%
<i> "No, please no! Please!</i>

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.686
<i> I want nothing
 to do with you!"</i>

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:02.388 line:92%
<i> And the Monster goes,</i>

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:05.992
<i> "Listen to this,
 'cause this is scary.</i>

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:09.996
<i> "You need to create
 a companion for me</i>

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:15.234 line:92%
<i> or I will kill your lover."</i>

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:16.636 line:92%
<i> [burps]</i>

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.705 line:92%
[laughter]

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.910
<i> Dr. Frankenstein made
 the bride,</i>

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:27.480
<i> but then all of a sudden had
 second feelings</i>

00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:29.182 line:92%
<i> about this because...</i>

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.350 line:92%
<i> What if she became a freak?</i>

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:35.054
<i> Oh, what would he do?
 How much guilt would he feel?</i>

00:02:35.087 --> 00:02:39.659
<i> So he destroyed
 Frankenstein's bride</i>

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:42.628 line:92%
<i> and just [bleep] off!</i>

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:44.197 line:92%
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.434
<i> But sure enough, Frankenstein
 rushed into the bedroom</i>

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:52.338
<i> and said, "What the [bleep]
 is going on?"</i>

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:57.109
<i> The Monster killed
 the fianc√©e--</i>

00:02:57.142 --> 00:02:59.345 line:92%
<i> Oh, uh, wife.</i>

00:02:59.378 --> 00:03:04.217 line:92%
<i> And there she was, dead!</i>

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.285 line:92%
<i> And the Monster said,</i>

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:12.091
<i> "You have destroyed
 my love life</i>

00:03:12.124 --> 00:03:16.128
<i> because you destroyed
 my sex bot!"</i>

00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:19.966
You know, like, in that day,
it would've been a sex bot.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:23.402
- Like a real doll.
- Yeah, like a ba--

00:03:23.435 --> 00:03:26.138 line:92%
ba--a doll.

00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:27.974 line:92%
<i> And he ran out of the room</i>

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:31.544
<i> and was never
 to be seen again.</i>

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:33.646 line:92%
<i> Until later.</i>

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:35.514 line:92%
[laughter]

00:03:35.547 --> 00:03:39.752
And that is the story
up to now.

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:44.290
<i> So Mary said,
 "How did I do?</i>

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:49.929
<i> "I believe that I have done
 quite a scary story,</i>

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:51.530 line:92%
<i> have I not?"</i>

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:55.268
<i> Lord Byron and Shelley,
 after the story,</i>

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.571
were silent,
and then all of a sudden

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:01.440
<i> everybody was, like,
 oh, my God</i>

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:05.111
<i> I'm pissing out of my balls!
 This is so amazing.</i>

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:10.116
And Mary looked at them
and said, "Really?

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:12.451 line:92%
<i> Are you cereal?</i>

00:04:12.484 --> 00:04:16.022 line:92%
<i> [chuckling]</i>

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:19.091 line:92%
<i> And Percy said to Mary,</i>

00:04:19.124 --> 00:04:25.231
<i> "You have got to write
 this down and sell it!"</i>

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:30.202
<i> And she goes,
 What? What?</i>

00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:32.672 line:92%
<i> What?</i>

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.874 line:92%
<i> What?</i>

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:37.376 line:92%
<i> What?</i>

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.645 line:92%
What?

00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:41.681 line:92%
What?

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:44.350 line:92%
<i> What?</i>

00:04:44.383 --> 00:04:46.419 line:92%
<i> What?</i>

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:49.355 line:92%
<i> What?</i>

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:51.390 line:92%
<i> [grunt]</i>

00:04:51.423 --> 00:04:53.426 line:92%
<i> [spits]</i>

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:56.296 line:92%
[laughter]

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:58.965 line:92%
<i> - Oh, my God.</i>
