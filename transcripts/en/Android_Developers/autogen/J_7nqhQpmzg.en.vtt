observing them you see ok they do do
 

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.329 align:start position:0%
observing them you see ok they do do

00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339 align:start position:0%

00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:42.860 align:start position:0%
that but they also do this other thing

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:42.870 align:start position:0%
or they do this thing in a slightly
 

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.660 align:start position:0%
or they do this thing in a slightly
different<00:09:43.140><c> way</c><00:09:43.470><c> than</c><00:09:43.740><c> I</c><00:09:43.829><c> thought</c><00:09:44.100><c> they</c><00:09:44.640><c> would</c>

really<00:10:08.330><c> kind</c><00:10:08.600><c> of</c><00:10:08.690><c> the</c><00:10:08.750><c> second-order</c><00:10:09.380><c> question</c>

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:09.890 align:start position:0%
really kind of the second-order question
 

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
really kind of the second-order question
is<00:10:10.160><c> well</c><00:10:10.610><c> how</c><00:10:10.910><c> did</c><00:10:11.090><c> that</c><00:10:11.120><c> work</c><00:10:11.390><c> out</c><00:10:11.650><c> when</c>

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:12.650 align:start position:0%
is well how did that work out when
 

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
is well how did that work out when
people<00:10:12.800><c> did</c><00:10:13.100><c> that</c><00:10:13.250><c> so</c><00:10:14.240><c> a</c><00:10:14.570><c> little</c><00:10:15.080><c> bit</c><00:10:15.290><c> of</c><00:10:15.410><c> that</c>

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:15.530 align:start position:0%
people did that so a little bit of that
 

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.530 align:start position:0%
people did that so a little bit of that
is<00:10:15.680><c> like</c><00:10:15.800><c> competitive</c><00:10:16.160><c> evaluation</c><00:10:17.000><c> looking</c>

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:17.540 align:start position:0%
is like competitive evaluation looking
 

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
is like competitive evaluation looking
at<00:10:17.630><c> other</c><00:10:17.750><c> applications</c><00:10:18.470><c> that</c><00:10:18.680><c> make</c><00:10:18.920><c> sense</c><00:10:19.130><c> so</c>

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:19.370 align:start position:0%
at other applications that make sense so
 

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.150 align:start position:0%
at other applications that make sense so
is<00:10:20.360><c> this</c><00:10:20.600><c> like</c><00:10:20.660><c> testing</c><00:10:21.530><c> a</c><00:10:21.590><c> competitor's</c>

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
is this like testing a competitor's
 

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.650 align:start position:0%
is this like testing a competitor's
product<00:10:22.460><c> before</c><00:10:22.850><c> actually</c><00:10:23.390><c> building</c><00:10:23.630><c> your</c>

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:23.660 align:start position:0%
product before actually building your
 

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.860 align:start position:0%
product before actually building your
own<00:10:23.920><c> yeah</c><00:10:24.920><c> I</c><00:10:25.460><c> think</c><00:10:25.580><c> a</c><00:10:25.910><c> lot</c><00:10:26.090><c> of</c><00:10:26.240><c> us</c><00:10:26.360><c> do</c><00:10:26.660><c> that</c>

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:26.870 align:start position:0%
own yeah I think a lot of us do that
 

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.630 align:start position:0%
own yeah I think a lot of us do that
already<00:10:27.440><c> and</c><00:10:27.860><c> people</c><00:10:28.040><c> that</c><00:10:28.280><c> are</c><00:10:28.370><c> really</c>

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
already and people that are really
 

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
already and people that are really

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:30.290 align:start position:0%
involved with technology we just kind of
 

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.500 align:start position:0%
involved with technology we just kind of
do<00:10:30.410><c> this</c><00:10:30.560><c> casually</c><00:10:31.160><c> as</c><00:10:31.370><c> a</c><00:10:31.400><c> user</c><00:10:31.700><c> I</c><00:10:31.940><c> mean</c><00:10:32.120><c> we</c><00:10:32.240><c> use</c>

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:32.510 align:start position:0%
do this casually as a user I mean we use
 

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.330 align:start position:0%
do this casually as a user I mean we use
lots<00:10:33.140><c> of</c><00:10:33.290><c> different</c><00:10:33.620><c> products</c><00:10:33.950><c> and</c><00:10:34.160><c> there's</c><00:10:34.280><c> a</c>

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:34.340 align:start position:0%

day-to-day behavior and we're thinking
 

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.170 align:start position:0%
day-to-day behavior and we're thinking
about<00:10:38.420><c> an</c><00:10:38.630><c> area</c><00:10:39.040><c> sometimes</c><00:10:40.040><c> it's</c><00:10:40.400><c> because</c>

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:41.180 align:start position:0%
about an area sometimes it's because
 

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.150 align:start position:0%
about an area sometimes it's because
we've<00:10:41.360><c> used</c><00:10:41.390><c> something</c><00:10:41.870><c> similar</c><00:10:42.260><c> and</c><00:10:42.530><c> or</c>

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
we've used something similar and or
 

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.830 align:start position:0%
we've used something similar and or
maybe<00:10:43.490><c> it's</c><00:10:43.670><c> news</c><00:10:43.850><c> we</c><00:10:44.210><c> do</c><00:10:44.360><c> something</c><00:10:44.690><c> that</c>

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
maybe it's news we do something that
 

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
maybe it's news we do something that
isn't<00:10:44.990><c> satisfying</c><00:10:45.710><c> for</c><00:10:46.040><c> us</c><00:10:46.160><c> and</c><00:10:46.310><c> we</c><00:10:46.370><c> know</c><00:10:46.490><c> we</c>

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:46.610 align:start position:0%
isn't satisfying for us and we know we
 

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.100 align:start position:0%
isn't satisfying for us and we know we

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:48.110 align:start position:0%
think we can do something interesting or
 

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.770 align:start position:0%
think we can do something interesting or

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:50.780 align:start position:0%

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:52.850 align:start position:0%
just kind of taking that natural
 

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
just kind of taking that natural

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:56.030 align:start position:0%
little bit more rigorous that makes
 

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.350 align:start position:0%
little bit more rigorous that makes

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
sense
 

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.390 align:start position:0%

so<00:10:56.780><c> now</c><00:10:56.900><c> after</c><00:10:57.530><c> you've</c><00:10:57.620><c> gotten</c><00:10:57.800><c> started</c><00:10:58.100><c> and</c>

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
so now after you've gotten started and
 

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
so now after you've gotten started and
you've<00:10:58.730><c> chosen</c><00:10:59.030><c> a</c><00:10:59.270><c> direction</c><00:10:59.750><c> or</c>

00:10:59.920 --> 00:10:59.930 align:start position:0%
you've chosen a direction or
 

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.500 align:start position:0%
you've chosen a direction or

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:02.510 align:start position:0%
interactively doing development how does
 

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.750 align:start position:0%
interactively doing development how does

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
research come into play at that point
 

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.730 align:start position:0%
research come into play at that point
well<00:11:04.760><c> I</c><00:11:04.790><c> think</c><00:11:05.090><c> research</c><00:11:05.660><c> is</c><00:11:05.990><c> best</c><00:11:06.530><c> served</c>

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:06.740 align:start position:0%
well I think research is best served
 

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.340 align:start position:0%
well I think research is best served
when<00:11:06.950><c> it's</c><00:11:07.130><c> just</c><00:11:07.430><c> as</c><00:11:07.580><c> iterative</c><00:11:08.120><c> as</c><00:11:08.420><c> the</c><00:11:09.110><c> rest</c>

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:09.350 align:start position:0%

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:13.460 align:start position:0%

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:14.060 align:start position:0%
as you can
 

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.930 align:start position:0%
as you can
you<00:11:14.720><c> should</c><00:11:14.900><c> get</c><00:11:15.050><c> users</c><00:11:15.920><c> to</c><00:11:16.220><c> play</c><00:11:16.370><c> with</c><00:11:16.640><c> some</c>

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:16.940 align:start position:0%
you should get users to play with some

you should get users to play with some
