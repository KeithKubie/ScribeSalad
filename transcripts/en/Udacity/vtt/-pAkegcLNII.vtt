00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We need to go from this angular error to an error in circumference,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which means we have to do what's called propagate this error through our calculation.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let me remind you what the equation we used was.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It was that the circumference was equal to 360 over the angle we were talking about before,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which we called alpha, times d,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
where d was the distance from Syene to Alexandria.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This alpha isn't exactly the same as this alpha over here,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but it turns out that an error here results in a corresponding error here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The question is how do we figure out how a change in alpha changes our circumference?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There's many ways to do this. Some involve some calculus.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But a really simple way to do it is just to calculate our extreme cases.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And what do I mean by that?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Before, the alpha we used in this calculation was equal to 7.2 degrees.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Due to this new error, this new angular error,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
we don't necessarily trust this number.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We know it's about right, but it could be off by plus or minus--

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and this is the symbol for plus or minus--1.4 degrees.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So that tells us I know that alpha is near 7.2, but I'm not sure exactly where it is.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's within 1.4 degrees.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So the smallest alpha could be--I'll say alpha min--would be 7.2 - 1.4,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which would be 5.8 degrees.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Alpha max would be 7.2 + 1.4, which would be 8.6 degrees.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That's our range of possibilities for alpha,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and that's going to correspond to a range of possibilities for the circumference.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
In fact, let's use alpha min and use alpha max to calculate the circumference again.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I want you to enter in 2 new calculations for the circumference,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and I want you to use the d we know from before, which is 5000 stadia--

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that's the distance between Syene and Alexandria--

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and remember the stadium is 185 meters,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and I want you to use alpha min to calculate a circumference

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and use alpha max to calculate a circumference.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And enter those numbers here.

00:02:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Remember we want to keep our answers in kilometers.
