00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.735
<i> So I put it out there</i>

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:05.505
<i> that I wanted to roast
 a big city police department</i>

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:08.441
<i> and the only one to step up
 and say yes</i>

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:12.045
<i> was the home of America's
 very first police force,</i>

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.746
<i> Bah-ston,</i>

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.449 line:0%
<i> a city that I've loved
 since going to college there,</i>

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.251 line:0%
<i> but on the morning I arrived,</i>

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:22.222 line:0%
<i> an officer was shot
and tensions were running high.</i>

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:28.294 line:0%
- You know, this individual
just shot one of our officers

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:31.097 line:0%
and the officers were able
to tackle him

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.765 line:0%
and not use deadly force.

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:35.201
- I don't know the details
of what happened in Dorchester

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.236
but cop gets shot,
they could have--

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:38.404
they could have killed the guy.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:40.073 align:start position:0%
His partner could have
killed the guy.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.607 align:end position:100% line:0%
- You know, the officers
ran him down and tackled him

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.810 align:end position:100% line:0%
when they could have used
deadly force.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:46.412 size:88% position:56% line:0%
I like to say, uh, you know,

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.114
we're a compassionate department

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:49.482 size:88% position:56%
and we care about human life

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:51.384 align:end position:100%
and I think the public
realizes that.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:53.653 align:start position:0%
- Boston used to have
a bad reputation.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:57.256 align:end position:100%
- Well, when I came on the job
we had 160 homicides.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.958 align:start size:63% position:38%
We had 38 this year.

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:02.829 align:end position:100%
Chicago had 500,
Baltimore had 344,

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.932
so the stricter gun laws and
the community work we're doing

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.700
is really making a difference.

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:08.935
- Why would you let me come in

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.670 align:start position:0%
and roast
the Boston Police Department?

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:13.840 align:end position:100%
- Well, I would because,
you know,

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:17.076 align:end position:100%
I want to break the stereotype
out there that,

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.578 align:end position:100%
you know,
we're the bad guys.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.012 align:start position:0%
- Right.

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:21.914 align:end position:100%
- I want people to see
that what's playing out

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:23.182 align:start size:53% position:47%
across the nation

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:24.717 align:end position:100%
isn't what
the Boston Police are.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.986
We don't mind
you making fun of us,

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:30.356
because I want the public
to know we're real people.

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:32.058
[sniffs]
- You got a nose for crime.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:33.059 align:start position:0%
- I know.

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:34.060 align:start size:69% position:31%
- And ears for it too.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:35.394
[laughter]

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:36.829
<i> Now that the brass
 was on board,</i>

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:38.331
<i> I was revved up and ready</i>

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:39.999
<i> to address the rank and file</i>

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:41.801
<i> during an afternoon roll call</i>

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:46.038
<i> and give 'em a few laughs
 before they hit the streets.</i>

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:48.274
<i> [whistling melody]</i>

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:50.676 align:start size:72% position:28%
How are you, everybody?

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.812
I'll make this quick
'cause I know most of you

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:55.581
are double-parked.

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:57.416
Thank you for letting me
come here.

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:58.518
This is really cool.

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.019
I've never performed in front

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:03.990
of an entire roomful
of YouTube celebrities before.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.558
This'll be so much better
if you guys just came

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:07.760
into the middle
of the [bleep] room.

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:09.495
All right, fine.

00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:12.265
You guys also have a rich
criminal history in this town.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.367
You had the Boston Tea Party
here,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.369
Whitey Bulger was from here,

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:19.071
Tom Brady's from here.

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:20.106
[police grumble]

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.507
Oh, come on, that one

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.877
really let the air
out of the room, huh?

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.279
And let's be real,

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.747
if Whitey Bulger's name
had been Blackie Bulger

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.685
they would have caught him
a lot quicker.

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:34.320
Jesus Christ.

00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:35.988
There's obviously a problem

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:37.757
between the cops
and the community

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.825
across the country right now
and that's what I'm here,

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:41.093
because that really bothers me,

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:42.528
and it really bothers me

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:45.364
when some people say
that all cops are racist.

00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:47.233
Of course that's not true.

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:51.604
Most of you are just dicks
to everybody.

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:52.939
All right.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:55.241
[chuckles]

00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:57.710
All right, well...

00:02:57.743 --> 00:02:58.711
Thanks for coming.

00:02:58.744 --> 00:02:59.712
All right.

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:00.813
Thanks you guys.

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:03.449
<i> Holy shit, that sucked.</i>

00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:06.052
<i> Hasn't there been enough
 bombing in Boston?</i>

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.888
<i> Well, it turns out that right
 before I got to town,</i>

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:11.224
<i> the policemen's union
 found a picture of me</i>

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:13.125 line:0%
<i> at that Black Lives Matter
 rally</i>

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:15.761 line:0%
<i>and profiled me as a cop-hater.</i>

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:19.265
<i> They even posted a bulletin
 in all the precincts</i>

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:21.901
<i> and sent an email
 to every cop in town</i>

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:24.704
<i> telling them
 to stay away from me.</i>

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:27.039
<i> With no cameras allowed,
 I spent hours</i>

00:03:27.072 --> 00:03:31.444
<i> negotiating my comedy special
 out of a hostage situation.</i>

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:34.477
<i> When I promised to come back
 at a later date</i>
