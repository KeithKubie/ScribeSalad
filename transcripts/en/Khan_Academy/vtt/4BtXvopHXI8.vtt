00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.545
Let's multiply 4 times 2,012.

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:05.420
Actually, let's make it
a little bit simpler.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.600
Let's multiply 4 times
201 just to simplify

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.800
things a little bit.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.240
So 4 times 201.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.060
So as we've seen
in previous videos,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.910
I like to write the
larger number on top.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.280
This is just one of
many ways of tackling

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.590
a calculation like this.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.822
I'll write the 201.

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:23.530
And then I'll write
the 4 right below it,

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.620
and I'll write it right
below the ones place.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.564
And so I have 201 times 4.

00:00:28.564 --> 00:00:30.730
Now, just like we did when
we were multiplying a one

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.590
digit times a two digit, we do
essentially the same process.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.870
We first multiply 4 times the 1.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.920
Well, 4 times 1 we
know is equal to 4.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.310
So we put a 4 right over
there in the ones place.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.660
Then we can multiply
our 4 times the digit

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.500
that we have in the tens place.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.430
In this case, we have
a 0 in the tens place.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.230
So 4 times 0, well,
that's just 0.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.320
4 times 0 is 0.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.130
We put the 0 in the tens
place right over here.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.320
And then last, we have 4
times this 2 right over here.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.130
And so 4 times 2 is equal to 8.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.320
And we put the 8
right over here.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.090
And we get our answer-- 804.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.674
Now, why did this work?

00:01:16.674 --> 00:01:18.090
Well, remember,
when we multiplied

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.010
4 times 1, that was
literally just 4.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.910
And we've got that
4 right over here.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.010
When we multiply 4
times 0, that's 0 tens.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.370
So we've got 0 tens
right over here.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.230
And when we multiplied 4 times
2, this was actually a 200.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.590
It's in the hundreds place.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.890
So 4 times 200 is 800.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.845
So what we're essentially
doing by writing it

00:01:36.845 --> 00:01:39.560
in the right place is
we're saying, 4 times 201,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.060
that's the same thing
as 4 times 200, which

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.700
is 800, plus 4
times 0 tens, which

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.010
is 0 tens, plus 4
times 1, which is 4.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.600
So 800 plus 0 plus 4 is 804.
