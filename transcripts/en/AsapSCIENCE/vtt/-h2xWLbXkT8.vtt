00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.100
From feet and urine to bondage and other inanimate objects like leather,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.800
people have all sorts of interesting sexual desires and fetishes.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.600
But is being aroused by non-living objects or non-genital body parts normal?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.800
Within the brain what you find sexy is a combination of cognitive, emotional and physical processes.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.100
Of course the private aspect of sexual behavior has made studying fetishes challenging.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.200
To get around this,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.200
one study used online Yahoo groups to estimate the relative frequency of atypical sexual preferences.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.300
Looking at 5000 online users,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.500
researchers discovered that the greatest number of fetishes were not just of body parts

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.600
but of objects associated with body parts like shoes or headphones.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.700
Popular groups included bodily fluids and body size

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.400
but the most popular group was by far the feet and toes.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.800
This is because there's actually a Neurological basis for foot fetishes.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.200
If we investigate this visual map showing which areas and proportions of the brain are dedicated to processing sensory functions,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.500
we see that feet, toes and genitals

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.600
are all physically right beside each other in the brain.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.700
One study was able to highlight this link between

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.400
sexual desires and brain regions with the man who experienced epileptic seizures as well as a fetish for safety pins.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.200
After getting a partial temporal lobectomy or removing part of his brain,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.900
both his seizures and sexual fixation on safety pins stopped.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.400
Sexual fantasies likely developed during early experiences as this is when there is more synapse formation and neurogenesis in your brain.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.000
Sexual imprinting is the process in which we and other animals

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.100
learn the characteristics of desirable mates at a young age,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.200
often influenced by those who raised us.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.509
one study found that adopted daughters end up choosing husbands with a significant resemblance to facial traits of their adoptive fathers.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.400
Women who report having a more supportive emotional relationship with their fathers

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.500
were also more likely to choose mates with similar features to their dads than those who had negative relationships with their fathers.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.800
But with fetishes this sexual imprinting can be with objects as well.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.020
A study using two groups of sexually naive lab rats had one group wear a small Velcro jacket during their first sexual experience

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.100
while the other group, the control wore nothing.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.100
When sexually mature, the control group displayed a normal copulation behavior whether wearing the jacket or not

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.700
whereas the jacket group were unable to achieve sexual arousal without their jackets.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.200
This same study has been done with other objects and had similar results.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.400
This could explain why a person with a leather fetish may have difficulty getting off without leather.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.400
A separate study on rats had one group of male rat pups lie on bedding scented with lemon

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.080
and the other group lie on unscented beds.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.612
For their first sexual experience,

00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:32.000
they had the option of two sexually receptive females

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.989
one scented with lemon and one without.

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.500
The control group mated with either female at a normal frequency

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.400
while the lemon laying group preferred lemon scented females.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:49.199
But these specific desires or preferences could be blocked by a naloxone which blocks endorphins or the feel-good neurotransmitters from binding to the opioid receptors in the brain,

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:54.500
thus blocking the sexual reward that is attributed with the velcro jacket or the smell of lemons.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.460
While we know a lot about rat fetishes, there isn't much research on rare sexual preference in humans

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.399
and in the past they were often listed as mental disorders.

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:07.170
But while your specific sexual desires and fetishes may be unique to you and your experience,

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.800
modern science does show that having one in the first place is a normal part of being human.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.800
And if it isn't harming you or someone else, they can exist as part of a healthy sex life.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.200
