00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.620
If there’s two things I know about the universe
it’s that it’s big and there’s a lot

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.620
of it.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.390
So much in fact, that we didn’t know where
half of it was until recently.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.349
Now before you get your hopes up, I’m not
talking about dark matter or dark energy,

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.680
which combined make up over 95% of the universe.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.510
I know you’re all as antsy as I am to find
out what dark matter and dark energy really

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.760
are, but that mystery remains unsolved.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.740
No I’m talking about plain old baryonic
matter like you and me and everything we know.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.890
The stuff that makes up less than 5% of the
universe.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.390
Turns out we couldn’t even track half of
THAT stuff down.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.370
That’s not to say we didn’t have a pretty
good idea of where it was.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.290
See the matter we could account for was where
you’d expect it to be, bundled up in two

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.900
trillion galaxies each with an average of
hundreds of billions of stars across the observable

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.900
universe.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.930
In between those galaxies we think are filaments
of dark matter, linking them together in a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.610
mind-breakingly huge cosmic web.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.829
We suspected the gravity of that dark matter
also attracted regular matter too, which had

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.540
been turned into plasma after ultraviolet
radiation from early stars separated atoms

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.540
from their electrons.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.219
This plasma is what’s known as the WHIM,
or Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium.

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.890
For a long time the problem was we couldn’t
see the WHIM, it was just too hard to detect.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.920
Until two separate teams found it using the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.100
When photons pass through a plasma, they get
shifted to a slightly higher energy level.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.759
The effect is very tiny though, so the teams
took data from hundreds of thousands to a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.899
million pairs of galaxies they figured would
be connected by the WHIM and stacked them

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.990
up until the effect was noticeable.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.929
Just like that, they found half the baryonic
matter in the universe, and more evidence

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.299
of a dark matter web.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.170
So 5% down, 95% to go.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.069
We’re getting closer, guys!

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.889

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:51.030
We keep coming up with new ways to look for
dark matter, like with black holes and gravitational

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.030
waves!

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.200
Check out the deets here.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.200
By the way when we say baryonic matter, technically
electrons don’t count because they’re

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.409
leptons, but astronomers lump them in with
protons and neutrons to make things simpler.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.509
Thanks for watching Seeker!
