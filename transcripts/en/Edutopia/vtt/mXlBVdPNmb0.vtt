00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:10.436
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good morning,
students and staff,

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:12.616
we're ready for another
great day of learning at--

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:14.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like most urban
districts, Louisville,

00:00:14.926 --> 00:00:19.426
Kentucky's schools have faced
myriad challenges, from high numbers

00:00:19.426 --> 00:00:21.826
of children on free
and reduced lunch,

00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:25.456
to escalating fights
and rising suspensions.

00:00:25.456 --> 00:00:28.166
&gt;&gt;Alicia: There were a
lot of factors that played

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.816
into the scores being low.

00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:34.676
There was not a caring, learning
environment that allowed teachers

00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:37.636
to teach and students to learn.

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:40.886
&gt;&gt;Paul: We had a whole lot of
bullying going on around here,

00:00:40.886 --> 00:00:43.956
kids getting scared
to come to school,

00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:46.866
people be hitting people,
more violent stuff.

00:00:47.326 --> 00:00:50.226
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, we've been
discussing bullying all week long.

00:00:50.376 --> 00:00:54.286
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In two thousand eight, a
comprehensive initiative called CARE

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:57.706
for Kids was adopted
by dozens of elementary

00:00:57.706 --> 00:00:59.836
and middle schools
in Jefferson County.

00:01:00.636 --> 00:01:04.736
It featured a laser beam focus
on social emotional skills,

00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:08.136
spearheaded by Superintendent
Shelly Berman.

00:01:08.406 --> 00:01:12.036
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: There's a pretty complex
puzzle that we have to put together

00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:16.276
to have a successful school,
but a foundational element

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:20.016
of that puzzle is the culture
and climate of that school.

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.816
And when students feel safe...

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:25.476
&gt;&gt;Alicia: Hello, sweet girl,
you have a good day, okay?

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:29.306
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: When they feel that that
culture and climate supports them,

00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:32.706
when they feel cared about, not
only by the adults in the school,

00:01:33.286 --> 00:01:36.826
but by other students in the
school, they can do their best.

00:01:36.976 --> 00:01:40.296
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And that does sound good,
"My teacher teaches terrifically."

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.976
I like that alliteration too.

00:01:42.786 --> 00:01:47.866
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Let's talk about what
respectful group work in science,

00:01:48.616 --> 00:01:53.616
what does it look like, what does
it sound like and what does it feel

00:01:53.616 --> 00:01:55.906
like when we do those things?

00:01:56.036 --> 00:01:59.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In every classroom,
teachers help students decide

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:02.296
on detailed class norms for behavior.

00:02:02.576 --> 00:02:04.116
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This is the
list I got from you.

00:02:04.576 --> 00:02:09.056
We're happy, we're proud,
and what does it sound like?

00:02:09.816 --> 00:02:10.476
&gt;&gt;Level one.

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:11.696
&gt;&gt;Very good job.

00:02:11.956 --> 00:02:13.176
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're working
together, Germaine.

00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:14.746
&gt;&gt;Help them if they need help.

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:16.086
&gt;&gt;Help them if they need home.

00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:18.346
&gt;&gt;Alicia: Less instructional
time is lost

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:22.776
because we're teaching the skills
up front and so that when it is time

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:26.166
for academics, we're learning
and we're not stopping

00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:28.746
at various times to
address conflicts.

00:02:28.746 --> 00:02:32.406
And it's teaching the students how
to have ownership and have voice.

00:02:32.696 --> 00:02:39.556
&gt;&gt;Keirsi: I think level zero
in the hallway is a good rule,

00:02:40.186 --> 00:02:45.696
because if we were talking and
it's this little thing on the top,

00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:50.266
and echoes come out of it.

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:54.576
And classes might be up
there learning something

00:02:54.766 --> 00:02:56.986
and we can disturb them easily.

00:02:58.456 --> 00:03:01.516
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Look at the name on
your piece of paper and think

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:04.796
of something nice to
say about that person.

00:03:05.656 --> 00:03:06.276
&gt;&gt;Good morning, Storm.

00:03:06.276 --> 00:03:07.166
&gt;&gt;Good morning, Deirdre.

00:03:07.536 --> 00:03:08.246
&gt;&gt;I like your humor.

00:03:08.606 --> 00:03:13.136
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: It isn't touchy feely
stuff, it's core social skills

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:18.936
that gives students the experience
and the knowledge and talent

00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:20.726
to work effectively with others.

00:03:21.206 --> 00:03:22.236
&gt;&gt;Thanks for always being nice.

00:03:23.626 --> 00:03:24.766
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: This is serious work.

00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:27.586
It's serious work to
create a sense of community.

00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:31.116
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How did it feel to say
something nice about someone else?

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:33.666
&gt;&gt;Student: It felt good, because I
actually gotta say something positive

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:34.326
about somebody.

00:03:35.896 --> 00:03:37.396
&gt;&gt;Student: Yours was a
fight, right, fighting?

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:38.306
You all had a fight?

00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:38.626
&gt;&gt;Physical.

00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:39.506
&gt;&gt;Yeah, physical.

00:03:39.846 --> 00:03:41.806
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: Developmental
discipline is looking

00:03:41.896 --> 00:03:43.946
for appropriate consequences.

00:03:44.396 --> 00:03:47.156
For example, a student
pushes another student,

00:03:47.156 --> 00:03:50.156
or takes something away
from another student.

00:03:50.706 --> 00:03:53.676
You might say, "Well, let's
give that student a detention

00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:55.086
so they have to stay after school."

00:03:55.286 --> 00:03:57.426
But that isn't an appropriate
consequence,

00:03:57.496 --> 00:03:58.746
that isn't a direct consequence.

00:03:58.746 --> 00:04:00.956
A student doesn't necessarily
learn anything from that.

00:04:01.336 --> 00:04:04.306
The appropriate consequence
may be to write an apology

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:06.456
or to directly apologize
to that student,

00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:09.766
and it's also teaching them
conflict resolution skills.

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:11.876
&gt;&gt;Student: Do you think you
can show better judgment

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:12.906
than what you did in the gym?

00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:15.836
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Now look, look
what you've got here.

00:04:15.946 --> 00:04:17.416
You already got a good
start right there.

00:04:17.796 --> 00:04:22.356
&gt;&gt;Bill: We reduced our placements
of in school suspensions in half.

00:04:22.506 --> 00:04:25.786
We have increased our
attendance, our pupil attendance,

00:04:25.876 --> 00:04:29.976
every single pupil month as
compared to the previous year,

00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:35.156
so created an environment, I think,
of less problems in the classroom

00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:36.736
and in the school in
terms of behavior,

00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:39.976
and a sense of students
wanting to be at school.

00:04:40.456 --> 00:04:45.806
&gt;&gt;Alicia: Our academic index overall,
reading, math, every content area,

00:04:45.806 --> 00:04:47.736
we were at a fifty-three.

00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:52.746
We're now at an eighty-two and our
math score is up to a ninety-four.

00:04:52.746 --> 00:04:56.546
&gt;&gt;Joanna: Tell Jasmine what
you think is special about her.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.296
&gt;&gt;I like when you share with me.

00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:00.096
&gt;&gt;Thank you-- Carolyn.

00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:04.066
&gt;&gt;Joanna: The whole morning meeting
not only sets a really good tone

00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:07.126
for the students, but
it sets a tone for me.

00:05:07.126 --> 00:05:09.526
&gt;&gt;Thanks for filling my bucket.

00:05:09.526 --> 00:05:11.736
&gt;&gt;Joanna: How did they fill
your bucket today, Jasmine?

00:05:12.596 --> 00:05:14.506
&gt;&gt;Because they was real nice to me.

00:05:14.816 --> 00:05:17.046
&gt;&gt;Joanna: They're excited,
they want to be here.

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:20.506
I've had parents say, "My
daughter's sick today,

00:05:20.506 --> 00:05:22.956
but she cried 'cause she really
wanted to come to school.

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:24.126
You know, what are you all doing?"

00:05:24.126 --> 00:05:26.206
&gt;&gt;Richard: Now stay in
line, don't run, don't run.

00:05:26.346 --> 00:05:29.846
&gt;&gt;I like this program and I see
this program that's been implemented

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:34.616
and it works, because I was
here and I seen it for myself.

00:05:34.886 --> 00:05:37.306
&gt;&gt;See you tomorrow, okay, buddy?

00:05:37.306 --> 00:05:40.246
&gt;&gt;At the end of the day, those
kids getting on those buses,

00:05:41.806 --> 00:05:47.906
with a smile on their
face, my job is done.

00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:51.556
I can safely go home
and say, "You know what,

00:05:52.266 --> 00:05:54.486
when they came this
morning, they had smiles

00:05:54.486 --> 00:05:56.776
and when they left they had smiles."

00:05:57.206 --> 00:05:59.436
Our job is done, because of CARE.

00:05:59.766 --> 00:06:03.956
&gt;&gt;Your mom's outside, your
mom's right there Madison.

00:06:04.046 --> 00:06:05.566
