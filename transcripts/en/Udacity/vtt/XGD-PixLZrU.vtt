00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.220
Throughout this lesson,

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.020
we covered both paid and free customer
acquisition channels in order to help

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.180
you determine what's right for your
company at your stage in development.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.730
&gt;&gt; Remember to take a moment
to think about where your

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.130
touch points are with your customers.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.660
Where do they hang out in real life and
in their online life?

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.710
You want to make sure
to meet them there.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.670
&gt;&gt; And don't forget, you don't
have to chose just one channel.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.380
You can combine multiple channels and
keep learning on the go.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.440
As long as you make sure to
track your performance and

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.430
keep doing only the things that
show positive impact on your goals.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.840
Which is exactly what we're
going to be covering next lesson.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.770
Tracking and measurement.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.810
So, we'll see you there.
