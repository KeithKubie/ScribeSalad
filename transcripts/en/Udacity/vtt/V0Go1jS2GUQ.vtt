00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.469
Sometimes even after
a fraction is reduced,

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.030
it might need to be
reduced even further.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.100
For example, I might see that sixteen
and twenty have a common factor of two.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.760
If I reduce sixteen over twenty
using two as the common factor,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.710
what fraction will I get?

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.590
