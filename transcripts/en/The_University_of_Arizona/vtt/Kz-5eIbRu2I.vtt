00:00:01.413 --> 00:00:05.660
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.860
Bernstein Mass is quite
the unusual piece of music.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.980
And there's everything in it.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.050
There's a rock band.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.870
There's an organ.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.550
There's an orchestra.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.320
There's a boys choir.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.850
I mean, you name it, the whole
shebang is in Bernstein Mass.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.240
The dancers at UA School
of Dance are phenomenal.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.030
They are so strong
and so diverse

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.220
in all genres between
ballet, modern, and jazz.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.940
They are so excited to be
performing in Centennial Hall.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.870
Such an amazing venue
to be performing in.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.770
Five, six, seven.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.370
The director of the
ballet is James Clouser,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.560
and he has come
up with a concept

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.900
about JFK, the life of JFK.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.480
He brought in lots of
characters from the '60s

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.540
to join in with the JFK story.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.020
And it's about a nun that
never spoke, never said a word.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.820
And all of the sudden,
through ecstasy of prayer,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.390
she's found this
person inside of her.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.330
The whole concept between
Bernstein Mass and then also

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.350
the JFK ballet is really about
finding faith and believing

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.320
in something.
