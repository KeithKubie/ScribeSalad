00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So as my last exercise for you, I want you to program the standard deviation.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I won't say much other than you might want to use the function "sqrt"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that returns the square root of its argument.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So here's the coding environment.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm actually importing the function sqrt for you from the math library.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Otherwise it doesn't work.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Data structure. Mean.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Our compact version of variance,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and I want you to program standard deviation

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
so that when you hit "stddev" for data2,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you get 7.9103 and so on for the data set I'm giving you.

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So just enter the right thing at standard deviation.
