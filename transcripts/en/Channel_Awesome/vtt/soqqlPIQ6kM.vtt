Malcolm: My God, I didn't think you needed to travel to another dimension to prove your love of Christmas!

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.980
NC: Well, this is said to be the dimension 
that loves Christmas the most,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.780
and I have to let my love for this 
holiday DESTROY THEM ALL!

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.800
Nobody loves Christmas more than me...

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.280
to death!

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.780

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.260
NC: The last of the Christmassians!

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.240
Malcolm: It has to be.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.980
Tamara: There's only one way to defeat it.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.560
NC: Let's deck some ass.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.580
Tamara: My God, it's the Christmassian Queen!

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.320
Malcolm: My God, it's doubled in size!

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.820
NC: My God...

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.560
I thought this was gonna be a challenge!

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.560
[roar]

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.380
Tamara: My God, she's gonna breathe presents on us!

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.600
NC: AGH!

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.660
Yuletide chainsaws.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.400
Clever girl.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.200

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.360
Malcolm: Oh!

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.520
Tamara: She's spitting gift-wrapped bullets at us!

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.280
You ingenious bitch, it's just what I wanted!

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.600
Malcolm: How did she manage to get bows so small?

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.040
[roar]

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.640
Tamara: Oh, no, she's gonna finish us off with a holiday flamethrower!

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100
Malcolm: Just like on my Amazon wishlist.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.960

JINGLE BELLS!

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.780
JINGLE ALL THE WAY!

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.620
I think we should stop trying to top ourselves
every year with the Christmas greetings.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.880
Getting a little out of hand.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.180
Malcolm: Mm-hmm.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.800
NC: I think that thing was pregnant...

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.660
so we get to live with that.

["The Review Must Go On" plays]

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.940
NC: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.580
Well, as many of you know, I've reviewed what I consider the worst Christmas special ever,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.900
"The Christmas Tree".

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.200
With its lack of effort, caring, 
and complete disinterest in everything Christmas,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.600
it was by far the worst Christmas special
I had ever seen.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.300
But the internet said, "Hold my beer",
and apparently found a Christmas special even worse.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.240
That is supposed to be
"Rapsittie Street Kids: Believe in Santa".

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.200
♪ ["We Wish You a Merry Christmas" instrumental] ♪

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.600
Getting a reputation as the "Foodfight" of Christmas specials,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.780
this CD abomination aired once in 2002
and then never aired again.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.380
Yeah. 2002.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.060
To give you an idea,
the show "Reboot" came out in 1994,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.100
and every week had this quality to it.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.380
This is eight years later and aired ONCE.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.780
They look more like the "Reboot" characters' SEX DOLLS than anything from an evolved art form!

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.380
But, big deal. Shitty low-budget project 
makes shitty low-budget shit.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.640
Well, the voice cast is anything but low-budget.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.500
It includes Luke Skywalker, Mark Hamill,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.140
Princess Ariel, Jodi Benson,

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.720
Princess Belle, Paige O'Hara,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.600
Azula, Grey DeLisle,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.440
Black Power Ranger, Walter Jones,

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.220
MADtv's Debra Wilson,

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.340
and even Bart Simpson, Nancy Cartwright,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.360
who also has a producing credit on it!

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.840
A goddamn PRODUCING credit!

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.180
Did...
Did everyone forget this guy accepts a lot of blame?!

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.460
How did this happen?

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.320
How did this make it to air?

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.100
How did they get all these people involved?!

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.220
Well, surely there must be something that...

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.800
There must just be something!

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.200
Anything! God!

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.240
Am I wrong, or did I have my soul
horrendously sucked out of me?

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.680
NC's Soul: Later.
NC: Miss you.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.600
This is "Rapsittie Street Kids: Believe in Santa".

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.720
Oh, look, South Park's animation somehow managed to get cheaper.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.180
Yeah, music by "I'm totally Danny Elfman, everybody!
I'm totally Danny Elfman!"

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.440
Thus, we see one of our main characters walking home.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.080
Ricky:
♪ It was the week before Christmas that I'm talking ♪

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.580
♪ I spent the day shopping with my Grandma, walking ♪

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.080
NC: Now, don't be alarmed by the red that you're seeing...

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.660
it's just your eyes bleeding from watching the animation.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.660
Fear not, you don't get used to it.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.820
This render that didn't quite make it to the recycling bin is named Ricky.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.740
He's just dropping some "mad hits"
on his way home from school.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.120
Ricky: ♪ I've been a good boy through the year,

♪ Get ready, Santa Claus'll start deckin' the halls with gifts ♪

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.360
NC: And yes, eager viewer I know is dying to ask...

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.900
he does rap ALL throughout the entire special.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.480
Ricky: ♪ It's for Nicole, the honey

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.980

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.940
NC: Oh, trust me, there's no "forgivin"' in any of this!

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.100
Hey, look, he leaves no footprints in the snow.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.920
Well, THAT'S a detail I'm surprised they left out!

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.860
After snapping his neck from looking up,

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.980
[neck cracking]

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.720
he gets the smile of a serial killer
looking at all the toys in the store.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.940
Ricky: One, two, three, and no more.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.280
NC: Aww, he was looking down at the animation budget.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
Actually, it's higher than I expected.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.300
He eventually goes home to look at his teddy bear.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.300
His mom gave this bear 'cause of love,
so he'll give this bear 'cause of love.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.360
I have no idea what that means,
but that is LITERALLY the dialogue.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.260
Ricky: Mama, you gave me this bear 'cause of love.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.220
So I'll give this bear...'Cause of love.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.080
NC: Don't worry, though. The visuals explain it better.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.080
Well, THAT cleared everything up!

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.040
The next day, he goes to school...

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.840
...a school that misspelled the word "excellence."

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.840
Isn't that a freakin' metaphor?

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.420
You can't spell excellence, you can't achieve excellence!

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.000
Nah, too easy.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.700
Inside the school, I guess...

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.880
this is going on.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.700
Nicole: And mommy schedules me for my own hair lady...

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.020

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.300
Smithy!

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.480
Smithy: Hey, Nicole, duck! I mean, dinosaur! [laughs]

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.100
NC: Anyone else getting the feeling this was a student's final project for an "Intro to 3D Animation" class?

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.900
One that had a great big F on it?!

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.760
Smithy: I was just giving it some extra fluff!

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.080
I guess the pressure to bug ya is just too much for me to resist!

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.360
NC: You know, the animation's so bad, I'm seriously debating whether or not that's supposed to be a scarf or his lips.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.820
Zeke: Come on, Ricky's gonna decorate the tree!

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.500
Todd: Let's just see what Ricky Rhymemaster can do!

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.220
Haha!

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.300
NC: It's actually impressive how much that voice doesn't match.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.760
I think it actually took effort to get that wrong.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.440
Maybe the only effort put into any of this.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.140
Todd: Aw, come on, Smithy!

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.440
Didn't your mommy teach you to share?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.000
NC: I mean, make no mistake,
everybody in this special should sound like...

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.200
[distorted robot voice]
"WE ARE NINTENDO."

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.880
"YOU CANNOT BEAT US."

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.720
But that still seemed particularly off.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.900
Ricky: ♪ I'm a decorating master, no one is faster ♪

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.680

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.020
NC: Hmm, those rhymes ARE pretty revolutionary.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.860
However, have you thought about considering...

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.280
"♪ I'm a butt-ugly taint made in Microsoft Paint ♪

Just rapping from the heart.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.840
They go to their homeroom, taught by a malfunctioning Hall of Presidents animatronic.

PLEASE!

NC: "We can't! They don't know how to animate that yet!"

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.860
Oh, I'm not kidding...they never do sit down.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.900
Time passes, and they're already standing before recess.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.900
It really was too hard to animate them sitting down!

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:34.700
Except the creepy, random adult who seems to be sitting there stone cold the whole time.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.440
He just likes to watch.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.400

Oh, I take it back...
Sitting down isn't the hardest thing to animate...

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.540
It's circles!

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.140
GODDAMN CIRCLES, THE FIRST THING YOU LEARN TO ANIMATE IN CGI CLASS!

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.220
But look at 'em!

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.920
They look like flat cutouts!

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.860
And even the flat cutouts don't have the shape of a full circle!

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.080
Smithy: No one can catch the Smith-man!

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.220

Zeke: Whoa, this reeks.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.420
I want waves, not ice!

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.640
Surfing stinks on ice.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.100
NC: That sad moment you realize
they could've made a superior movie

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.580
by just playing The Sims and talking over it.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.580
I think the Deluxe Edition would've come out about now.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.060
But one of the boys named Smithy
is really attached to his sandwich!

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.600
That equals development now!

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.260
Todd: Mmm!

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.100
Smithy: NO!!!

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.520
You go back where you belong!

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.560
Todd: I SAID GET OFF!

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.560
NC: Okay, if you focus any longer on that sandwich,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.800
we're gonna start making phallic connections.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.740
You already are, aren't you?!

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.320
Todd: Mmm!

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.960
NC: GOD, THIS SPECIAL'S BAD!

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.220
Female Student: Ms. Parmington,
get him away from me!

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.860
Zeke: [mocking the girl] "Get him away from me!"

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.560
Ms. Parmington: That means he likes you.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.740
NC: Ah, it's the same school Al Franken went to.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.380
Principal: This is such a great time of year,
Ms. Parmington!

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.860
Lenee: Hello, sir.
I hope you have a really, really happy holiday.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.280
Principal: Why, thank you, Lenee.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.820
NC: [robot voice] "MORGAN FREEMAN BOT
DESTROY YOU ALL WITH LASER ARMS"

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.080
"Oh, I mean, uh...HAPPY HOLIDAYS"

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:29.260
Ms. Parmington: I know that my family is just going to spoil me rotten to the core.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.860
Principal: I...uh...

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.020
Ms. Parmington: As it's been another wonderful year in the Parmington Household.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.000
Principal: Uh yes, ma'am...

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.460
Students: Merry Christmas!

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.580
Ms. Parmington: OK, children!
I wish you all a wonderful holiday!

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.540
Now please clean up your area before you leave!

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.920
NC: And don't forget to blink!

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.380
Please try to blink at least once over the holidays!

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.240
Ms. Parmington: Yeah yeah yeah...

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.100
NC: Ah jeez, the maxi pads have taken flight again...

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.020
Women problems... am I right, ladies?

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.100
Ms. Parmington: I guess those skills come later.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.180
NC: Ah, now it's time to play what pops up very frequently in this special:

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.060
"Drunk Face or Kill Face?"

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.360
Tamara: Drunk face! It's a drunk face!
Malcolm: Kill face! Kill face! Kill face!

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.740
[arguing]

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.480
NC: I'm gonna say... drunk face!

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.340
[ding]

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.820
Yeah! Got it right!

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.240
Tamara: Speaking of which...

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.840
Why haven't we started on ours?

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.620
NC: Yeah... that's a really valid point.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.460
So [sigh] 13 minutes into this 40-minute special, and you notice something missing?

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.500
It starts with P and it's "plot".

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.300
There is no plot.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.820
Nothing seems to be going on aside from us trying to figure out if this was a troll movie or a mob front.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.900
I'd strangely have respect if it was both.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.860
Finally, the poorly-rendered wheels of storytelling are in motion as Ricky gives Nicole his teddy bear.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.360
Ricky: Merry Christmas, Nicole!

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.180
Nicole: Have you lost your mind?!

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.380
Are you purposely trying to embarrass me?

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.520
I can't even exchange this nasty, old thing!

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.960
NC: (as Nicole) "Which is why I'm still holding on to it."

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.760
Anti-sentimental purposes!

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.040
Ricky: You might be smart with books,
but you sure are stupid!

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.460
I give you a real gift and you don't get it!

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.500
NC: You know, I'm not gonna lie,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.860
I really thought Parappa the Rapper's origin story
would be more interesting than this.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.100
Smithy: Hey, brat!
Who do you think you are?

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.660
Treating people the way you do?

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.180
Critic: Perhaps we should discuss this more on the ruins of Peach's Castle from Mario 64.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.580
Lenee: [laughs]

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.400
This is so great!

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.620
I know you like this stuff, Nicole.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.620
NC: Is there any particular reason that girl's hair looks like Chewbacca's butt cheeks?

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.940
Is this all just another Life Day tradition
I'm gonna wish I didn't know about?

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.980
Lenee: What do you think Santa will bring you this year?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.740
Nicole: [laughs]

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.300
You still believe in Santa Claus?

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.140
[laughs again]

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.240
NC: [robot girl voice] "We will eat human brains after turning your skin into binary code."

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.600
Nicole: [still laughing]

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.280
Santa Claus...

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.880
NC: Nicole talks with her mother about what a good kid she's been all year.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.280
Nicole: You know I'm the bestest kid in the world, mommy.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.940
Nicole's Mom: I know you are...
and I'm the luckiest mom in the world.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.840
NC: (as Nicole's mom) So lucky, I'll just dematerialize in the next shot.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.060
Hey if she's been raptured, there's still hope it could still happen to the rest of the cast.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.000
Nicole: ♪ Look at me ♪

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.260
NC: Oh, yeah, we're almost halfway through the special.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.260
Makes sense to have our first song...

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.480
I know Ricky's "technically" rapping, but that's in the context of the story.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.680
It's something he did for fun they acknowledged he was doing it.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.440
This is an actual full-blown musical number.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.240
In that...it fully blows to witness any of it!

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.880
Nicole: ♪ Look and you'll see
The best kid in the world ♪

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.600
NC: I'm so glad her parents got that wallpaper from freedownloadabletextures.org.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.480
It's so hideous even the snow tried backing away from it.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.040
Yeah...that just happened.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.600

NC: I hope you're enjoying this "amazing" choreography, because there's over FOUR minutes of it left!

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.600
That's how long this song is.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.120
If you're ever sick of "Let It Go", just 
remember you could be listening to

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.560
mashed potato heads from Rapsittie Street Kids.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.960
A special where only ONE KID RAPS!

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:30.780
Oh, and all his raps combined still equal
HALF the time of this one song!

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.840
Nicole: ♪ Look at me ♪

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.440
NC: I really don't want to look at you.
Our eyes have bled enough.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.520
In fact, I think we all need a break to 
look at something more pleasant.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.720
Something that's gonna hurt our eyes a little less.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.440
So if you excuse me, I'm gonna go look at the sun!

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.080
Ohhhhh... that feels better.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.920
Doug: Here we go...Stardust presents two of the three funniest reactions to

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.040
[sigh] Rapsittie Street Kids: Believe in Santa.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.000
AdorkableRachel:
WHAT THE FUCK, Nostalgia Critic?!

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.580
Why did you encourage me to watch this special?

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:34.220
I mean... I thought that The Christmas Tree was bad, but THIS?! This is just INSANE!

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.640
The animation? HORRIBLE! The story? HORRIBLE!

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:42.120
The voice acting... actually kind of okay...
and you know why?

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.540
Because it's got some voice acting LEGENDS in it! Are you kidding me?

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:50.540
I mean like Jodi Benson, Nancy Cartwright, Paige O'Hara...Mark HAMILL?

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.760
What the FUCK!

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.220
Doug: You suck!

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.940
That's not true. I love you,
but I'm sure you suck at something. We all do.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.220
For example, I suck at making a GIF.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.860
I know that should be, like, the easiest thing for an internet person to do, but I never figured out how to do it.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:24.200
But thankfully, whatever you suck at, there's probably a class for it on SkillShare.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:30.360

You wanna learn how to write comedy? You can.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.900
Or, if you're an idiot like me and you want to do something simple like make a GIF,

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.340
they even have a class for that.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:44.080

NC: So pincushion Irma is upset about there being no Santa Claus

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.100
and decides to ask when her dad
is getting back with the tree.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.260
Lenee: When's Daddy coming home?

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:34.640
Lenee's Mom: Soon... right after he picks up the Christmas tree. Come on...it's Christmas!

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.940
NC: Who the hell buys a tree Christmas DAY?

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:42.400
I guess I shouldn't complain. They did finally master the incredible art of sitting down.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.340
Though... maybe not...
I think they just melted into the ground a little bit.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.360
Yeah...knowing this special that seems very probable.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.980
Ricky goes to mail some letters,
when one of them to Santa falls out,

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.300
which confesses how much the bear he
gave to Nicole meant to him.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.340
Nicole sees it and starts to read:

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:02.220
Nicole: [reading] Even Nicole gave him a special bear that Mommy...

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.880
[shocked] Oh no, Ricky!

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.720
NC: Umm, Did Ricky's pencil not render enough to keep all the letters on that paper?

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.600
I'm beginning to think this was directed by one of the rings from Superman 64!

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.720
Meanwhile, Ricky
talks with his great-grandmother...

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.820
[unintelligible gibberish]

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.560
I'm sorry, could you say that again?

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.520
[unintelligible gibberish]

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.920
...we'll come back to that.
Why don't we move on to the next sentence?

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.800
[more unintelligible gibberish]

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.360
"Every time a minute of this plays,
a Pixar animator kills himself."

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.800
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON!?

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:52.880
Am I really seeing this? Every time she talks, it's like hearing a dolphin read from the Necronomicon.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.720
This can't be real!

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.520
[more unintelligible gibberish]

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.120
Papa Klump: Somebody better call an exorcist!

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.840
NC: Oh, wait, I got it! It's backwards speech!
If you take the audio and reverse it...

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.080
...you can hear what she's actually saying!
Go ahead...let's try it!

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.080
NC: (as Grandma) I'm recording this dialogue at the Pentagon where they're holding Jesus.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.800
He's still alive, and he has plans...
plans the government doesn't want you to know about!

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:20.960
The answers are in the Christmas special. It's filled with clues. That's why none of it makes any goddamn sense.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:25.080
Re-watch the special to find the truth!
RE-WATCH THE SPECIAL TO FIND THE TRUTH!

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.360
NC: Oh my God!

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.640
Nah...it's not worth it.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.720
So Nicole looks in the dumpster
for the bear she threw out.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.800
Tug: The poor little princess has turned into a garbage man!

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.000
[boys laughing]

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.200
NC: (as Tug) "Did you like our attempt 
at a threesome there?"

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.560
[boys laughing]

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.560
NC: They don't find it, but Smithy hears that the cleaning man keeps some of his garbage in the basement.

The funniest part is after the end credits.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:10.780
Where they actually advertise that the Rapsittie Street Kids WILL BE BACK!

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.780
Yeah! They're as popular as Superman

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.420
so they had to advertise their next adventure in the credits just like his movies.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.020
"A Bunny's Tale", huh?

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:23.900
Well, seeing how this came out in 2002 and there's STILL NO FOLLOW-UP to it,

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.940
I'm just assuming they're working REALLY HARD on it.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.460

it's hideous to look at.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.440
But is it worse than "The Christmas Tree"?

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.800
Well, it's like comparing Nickelback with Creed.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.480
They're both the worst, but one's just gonna annoy you more than the other.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.640
Personally the fact that it looks like more money went into the production of "The Christmas Tree",

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.400
which by God I never though I would say that,

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.220
seems a little bit more insulting in how bad it is.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:07.620
Christmas Tree is more memorably bad, where this one I feel like I could forget pretty quickly.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.740
It's that boring.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:13.880
