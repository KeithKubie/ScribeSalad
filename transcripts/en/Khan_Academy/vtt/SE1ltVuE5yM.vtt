00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.620
Let's say that we have
some particle that's

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.390
moving along the number line.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.270
So let me draw a number
line right over here.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.150
So that's our number
line right over there.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.660
And let's say it starts
right over here at 0.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.160
And then as time passes,
this little point

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.190
is going to move around.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.210
Maybe it moves to the right,
slows down, speeds up.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.410
Maybe it moves to the left,
slows down, speeds up.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.260
It might do all sorts of things.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.890
And to describe this motion, its
position as a function of time,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.930
we have a function s of t.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.830
This particle's position as a
function of time we're given

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.820
is t to the third power
minus 6t t squared plus 9t.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.130
And we're going to restrict
the domain to positive time.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.200
So we're going to
assume that time

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.350
is greater than or equal to 0.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.360
Now the question that we want
to answer in this video is,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.150
when is this
particle speeding up?

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.520
So when are we speeding up?

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.230
And I think that bears
a little clarification.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.780
What does it mean to speed up?

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.260
Well, there's two scenarios.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.280
If the particle
is already moving

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.614
in the rightward
direction-- and the way

00:01:14.614 --> 00:01:16.905
we would know it's moving in
the rightward direction is

00:01:16.905 --> 00:01:20.480
if its velocity
is greater than 0.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.800
If it's moving in the
rightward direction

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.060
and it's also accelerating
in the rightward direction--

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.100
so if its acceleration is
also greater than 0-- then

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.300
this is a situation
where we are speeding up.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.640
Now another scenario where
we would be speeding up

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.060
is if we're moving in
the leftward direction.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.089
In that case, our velocity
is going to be negative.

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:42.630
So if our velocity
is negative and we

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.590
want to go faster in
the negative direction,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.622
then our acceleration
should also be negative.

00:01:47.622 --> 00:01:50.080
That would make our velocity
getting more and more and more

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.580
negative with time.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.740
So then our acceleration
needs to also be negative

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.930
if we still want
to be speeding up.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.560
If you have any other
combination here,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.350
if your velocity is negative but
your acceleration is positive,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.600
that means that your velocity
is becoming less negative,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.893
or you would be slowing
down the leftward direction.

00:02:10.893 --> 00:02:12.726
And vice versa, if your
velocity is positive

00:02:12.726 --> 00:02:14.550
and your acceleration
is negative,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.250
that means you're
going to the right

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.100
but you are slowing down
in the rightward direction.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.970
So let's think about
these two scenarios.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.890
And since velocity
matters here so much,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.950
we just have to remind ourselves
that the velocity-- remember,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.450
a derivative is just the
rate of change with respect

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.110
to a variable.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.750
So if you have your position
function, the derivative

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.930
of position with
respect to time,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.770
this is really just what is the
instantaneous rate of change

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.710
of position with
respect to time?

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.420
Well, what is the change of
position with respect to time?

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.090
Well that is just going to be
equal to our velocity function.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.300
That's going to be equal to
our velocity function, v of t.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.400
Or we could write s prime
of t, which could be also

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.770
written this way, as ds dt,
is equal to our velocity

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.520
as a function of time.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.490
So let's take the
derivative of this.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.310
Our velocity as a
function of time

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:17.840
is going to be equal to 3t
squared minus 12t plus 9.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.740
So let's see if we can
graph this velocity

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.450
function to start
making sense of it.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.700
When is the velocity positive?

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.540
When is it negative?

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.530
And what's the acceleration
doing in those intervals?

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.672
And so to help me graph it,
we could say the v-intercept,

00:03:32.672 --> 00:03:35.270
or the vertical
intercept, when v of 0

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.510
is going to be equal to 9.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.037
So that'll help us graph it.

00:03:38.037 --> 00:03:39.870
That's where we intersect
the vertical axis.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.900
But also, let's plot--
let's figure out

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.840
where it intersects the t-axis.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.970
So let's set this equal to 0.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.145
So 3t squared minus 12t
plus 9 is equal to 0.

00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:52.650
Let's see.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.060
To simplify this, I can
divide both sides by 3.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.570
And I get t squared minus
4t plus 3 is equal to 0.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.410
Now this is very factorable.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.801
This is t.

00:04:03.801 --> 00:04:04.300
Let's see.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.580
What two numbers, when
you take a product, get 3,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.330
and when you add them,
you get negative 4?

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.940
Well, that's going to be
t minus 3 times t minus 1

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.190
is equal to 0.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.520
How can this expression
be equal to 0?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.794
Well if either of these are
equal to 0, if either t minus 3

00:04:18.794 --> 00:04:22.150
is 0 or t minus 1 is 0,
it's going to be equal to 0.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.560
So t could be equal to 3,
or t could be equal to 1.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.820
If t is 3 or t is 1, either
of these are equal to 0,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.440
or this entire expression up
here is going to be equal to 0.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.409
And since our coefficient on
the t squared term is positive,

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.700
we know this is going to be
an upward opening parabola.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.200
So let's see if we can plot
velocity as a function of time.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.870
So that is my velocity axis.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.375
This right over here
is my time axis.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.500
And let's say this
is 1 times 1 second,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.194
or I'm assuming this is
in seconds-- 2, 3, 4.

00:05:05.194 --> 00:05:07.360
Actually, let me spread
them apart a little bit more

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.525
just because 1 and 3 are
significant-- 1, 2, and 3.

00:05:13.525 --> 00:05:14.900
And they're not
going to be-- I'm

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.070
going to squash to the
vertical scale a little bit.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.420
But this right over here, let's
say that is 9, a velocity of 9.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.980
And so when t equals
0, our velocity is 9.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.574
When t equals 1, then our
velocity is going to be 0.

00:05:30.574 --> 00:05:31.740
We get that right over here.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.630
3 minus 12 plus 9, that's 0.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.219
And when t is equal to 3
our velocity is 0 again.

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:40.260
Our vertex is going to be
right in between those,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.310
when t is equal to 2-- right
in between these two 0's.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.120
And we could figure out what
that velocity is if we like.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.514
It's going to be 3 times
4 minus 12 times 2 plus 9.

00:05:55.514 --> 00:05:56.180
So what is that?

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.770
That's 12 minus 24 plus 9.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.550
So that is negative 12 plus 9.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.785
So that's going to be
equal to negative 3.

00:06:05.785 --> 00:06:09.040
Did I do that-- 12,
yep, negative 3.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.630
So you're going to be--
negative 3 might be-- that's 9,

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.010
so that's positive.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.900
So it might be
something like this.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.120
So the graph of our velocity
as a function of time

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.235
is going to look
something like this.

00:06:21.235 --> 00:06:23.780
And we only care
about positive time.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.410
It's going to look
something like this.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.280
So let's think.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.120
Remember, this is velocity.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.060
This is our velocity
as a function of time.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.880
Now let's think about when
is the velocity less than 0

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.010
and the acceleration
is less than 0?

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.450
So let's think about this
case right over here?

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.080
When is this the case?

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.420
Both of them are going
to be less than 0.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.590
Well, velocity is
the less than 0

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:55.800
over this entire interval,
this entire magenta interval.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.240
But the acceleration isn't
less than 0 that entire time.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.080
Remember, the acceleration is
the rate of change of velocity.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.350
We can write here
that acceleration

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.820
as a function of time, this
is equal to the rate which

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.920
velocity changes
with respect to time.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.670
Or we could write,
acceleration is

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.430
equal to v prime of t,
which is the same thing

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.840
as the second derivative of
position with respect to time.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.770
And so the acceleration,
you could really

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.330
think of the slope of the
tangent line of the velocity

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.190
function.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.210
And so over here, the place
where this is downward

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.960
sloping, where this
has a negative slope,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.900
and the curve itself
is below the t-axis,

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.790
that's only over this
interval right over here.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:51.899
Between this 0 right
over here and the vertex,

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:53.440
we get to this point
right over here.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.130
And then our slope flattens out.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.780
So this interval
right over here is

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.320
t is going to be
greater than 1, and it

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.450
is going to be less than 2.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.515
That meets these constraints.

00:08:07.515 --> 00:08:09.640
Now let's think about where
our velocity is greater

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.010
than 0 and our acceleration
is greater than 0.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.690
Well our velocity is
greater than 0 over here.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.330
But notice, our acceleration,
the slope here is negative.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.620
We're downward sloping,
so that doesn't apply.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.070
Here our velocity
is greater than 0,

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.520
and the slope of the velocity,
the rate of change of velocity,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.350
the acceleration, is
also greater than 0.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.240
So that's this interval
right over here,

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.299
where we're speeding up in
the rightward direction.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:43.220
So that interval is
t is greater than 3.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.920
So when are we speeding up?

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.300
We're speeding up between
the first and second seconds,

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:55.856
and then we're speeding
up after the third second.
