00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.560
KYLE EWING: I mean, who
doesn't love a good story?

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.980
They're fun to tell.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.914
They're fun to hear.

00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:15.330
I think if we learned anything
over the last couple hours,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.970
we learned that storytelling's
really empowering.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.682
It connects us to other people.

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:22.890
It helps us relate to one
another on a level that you

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.290
might not see at first glance.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.080
At a company like Google,
a data-driven company,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.880
storytelling really helps us
bring some meaning to numbers.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.320
It helps us actually add some
texture, some color to the work

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.560
that we do, and really give
meaning to all of those numbers

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.220
that we make sure we have
at the end of a program

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.100
or at the end of an event.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.230
As a director in
people operations,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.890
I lead a 300-person global team.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.750
We've spent the
better part of a year

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.620
now really encouraging folks to
use the power of storytelling

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.840
to connect not only to
the work that they're

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.930
doing as individuals
or as an organization,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.840
but to connect to each other,
and to really help others

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.970
see the impact of their
work through these stories.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.920
If you take a step
back and you think

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.890
about the impact you're
having on somebody's life,

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.200
you take the time to
compile that story,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.480
and then you actually
share that story,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.660
it's going to help bring others
into the work that you're doing

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.482
and ultimately, make for
a much larger impact.

00:01:21.482 --> 00:01:23.190
But I'm want to go a
little bit of a step

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.700
further because
for me personally,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.770
I've found, through this
journey of storytelling,

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.370
that it's actually opened
a lot of doors for me.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.400
And I'll explain a
little more about that.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.890
I think last year was a tough
one for a lot of people.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.200
And I know on my
team, there were

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.870
folks that were really
grappling with the impact

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.930
of some senseless tragedies
happening in the world.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.410
And some folks on my team
started sharing their stories

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.450
with me, and just
started sharing with me

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.380
what it felt like to be black,
to be gay, to be scared,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.000
to be angry, to be sad.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.950
And it got me really
thinking a lot

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.280
about inclusion, what it
meant to be an ally, what

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.780
it meant to be a leader.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.120
As the leader in
any organization,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.520
you have one job, people.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.630
Your people.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.850
To make them the most
successful they can be.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.350
To make them feel heard.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.430
To make them feel seen.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.420
To make them feel included.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.920
So I took a few days and I
attended the Black Googler

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.200
Network trip in Washington DC.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.750
I was one of two white
Googlers on the trip.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.240
We spent three
days, 150 people--

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.120
community service, small
business consulting

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.520
on AdWords and other
Google products,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.790
door-to-door voter registration,
some CS education work.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.890
The trip was incredible.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.310
The experience blew me away.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.460
And it changed me.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.730
It showed me the
power of community.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.300
I was surprised to hear how much
my attendance and my support

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.340
meant to a lot of my
colleagues as well.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.150
And when I think about
that specific moment

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.870
and kind of what even led to
the trip, it was kind of scary.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.920
It was a little daunting.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.570
And there were times it
was really uncomfortable.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.260
But I'm so glad that I said
yes to that opportunity.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.610
And it has opened quite
a few doors for me.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.360
It connected me to
this amazing community

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.820
that I hadn't had a chance
to really be a part of

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.210
or get to know prior.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.640
It led me to accept an
invitation I was so honored

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.420
to receive, which was to be the
executive sponsor of the San

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.950
Francisco chapter of the
Black Googler Network.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.000
And it also led me recently
to accept a new role, where

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.400
I'm actually helping
Google really lead

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.750
the way in being the most
inclusive culture that there

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.550
is.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.330
And to think that
none of that would

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.730
have happened if a
few brave souls hadn't

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.920
shared their stories with me.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.310
So what I want you all to take
away from the last two hours

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.220
is that people want
to hear your story.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.320
And I hope that now you've
got the tools to really

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.200
be able to think about your
story, develop your story,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.860
share your story, say yes, and,
use, design, build on ideas,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.320
and always be there--

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.820
take good care of yourself and
take good care of each other.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.170
