BRYAN JARR: And I'm
Bryan Jarr.

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:28.350
I'm co-author on the book.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.780
And this, who should we
name this, the salmon?

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.805
It's a real star.

00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:32.490

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.570
This is awesome.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.690
You guys have a great campus.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.010
And we're really happy
to be here.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.660
BRYAN JARR: We're going to throw
the fish to get started.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.890
Just to let you know, I'm not
a professional fish thrower.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.850
He is.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.330
So check it out.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.060
I could mess up.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.870
It could be funny, like
the blooper reel.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.120
Ready?

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.630

Do the old twister.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.010
BRYAN JARR: OK, twister.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.950

00:01:07.155 --> 00:01:08.300

ANDERS MILLER: [SLOW MOTION]

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.310
Back Jack, back Jack, heyah.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.860
BRYAN JARR: OK, now we
need some volunteers

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.520
who want to do that.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.100
ANDERS MILLER: Is there anybody
who's bucket list

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.390

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.555
BRYAN JARR: We've got some
people out here.

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:32.230

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.930
Yeah, come on up.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.870
You can wipe your hands when
you're done and everything.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.200
BRYAN JARR: Come over
here first.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.950
ANDERS MILLER: We've
got towels.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.520
BRYAN JARR: You're athletic.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.430
ANDERS MILLER: We thought
of everything.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.160
BRYAN JARR: No, you're
over here.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.050
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah, you
guys go over there.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.560
Bryan's going to be the coach.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.920
BRYAN JARR: You're--
stand here.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.780
ANDERS MILLER: And I'll
be throwing, since

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.490
I do it for a living.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.240
BRYAN JARR: All the
way over here.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.300
All the way over there.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.310
OK, do not cross this line.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.040
ARTUR: OK.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.690
BRYAN JARR: If you cross the
line, I hit you like that,

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.060
with the fish, with the GoPro.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.500
OK?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.320
ARTUR: OK.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.650
BRYAN JARR: Ready?

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.660
So this is going to come--

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.302
It's coming the other
way, right?

00:01:57.302 --> 00:01:58.370
It's going to come at you.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.630
Here.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.620
Shoop.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.730
OK, you want to bend your
legs like this.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.930
You play video games?

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.490
ARTUR: Yeah.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.280
BRYAN JARR: Come on,
there you go.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.610
You can admit it.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.880
ANDERS MILLER: Bam, grab
it like you're

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.680
playing video games.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.380
BRYAN JARR: Keep your
thumbs up above.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.660
ANDERS MILLER: An intense
video battle.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.570
BRYAN JARR: Or like
catching a baby.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.210
ARTUR: OK.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.020
BRYAN JARR: If someone threw a
baby, you'd catch the baby,

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.560
wouldn't you?

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.090
ARTUR: Yeah, I would.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.910
BRYAN JARR: You wouldn't
let a baby drop.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.090
ARTUR: No.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.950
BRYAN JARR: OK, Sam the
salmon's a baby.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.020
ANDERS MILLER: Don't
hurt the baby.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.110
BRYAN JARR: Keep
it, keep loose.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.610
Come on, loose, loose.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.396
ANDERS MILLER: You guys help me
out too, with the call and

00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:24.250

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.190
BRYAN JARR: Loose video

00:02:25.897 --> 00:02:26.700
You guys respond.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.940
I'm going to call out TT.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.920
That's a test toss or
a tourist toss.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.600
All right?

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.640

BRYAN JARR: Nice, I like it.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.610
ANDERS MILLER: --there's
some wipes over there.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.410
Clean yourself up.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.300
We're going to send you
out like we found you.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.160
BRYAN JARR: Who's next?

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.810
Yeah.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.470
Oh, you've got the coat on.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.300
ANDERS MILLER: Guys, the
response was a little week.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.170
BRYAN JARR: Well done.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.036
ANDERS MILLER: We're going
to do better this time.

00:02:55.036 --> 00:02:55.200
Yeah?

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.610
OK.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.715
BRYAN JARR: Fish juice, that
doesn't sound good

00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:57.420
at all, does it?

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.470
Fish juice, don't get fish
juice on you, OK?

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.850
Got it?

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.360
Remember, these are going
to kind of come above.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.195
When you catch, don't be
afraid to squeeze.

00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:07.650
ANDERS MILLER: She's ready.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.380

You did good.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.760

A little fish stuff on you.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.930
ANDERS MILLER: That's what
the jacket's for.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.150
There's wipes over there,
if you'd like, dear.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.955
All right.

How you doing, Mike?

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.290
Do you want the little

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.825
That's a nice shirt.

00:03:34.825 --> 00:03:36.450

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.465

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.170
Bend the legs.

CLIFF: They're Blue
Barracudas.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.390
BRYAN JARR: Blue Barracudas.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.570
CLIFF: So you want
me to stand here?

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.040
BRYAN JARR: So you want
Sam the salmon.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.400
I don't-- wait.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.340
Get your foot that way, Cliff.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.280
Get your foot that way.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.620
CLIFF: OK.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.190
BRYAN JARR: And get the
sticker off too.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.160
Cliff, what's going on?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.800
ANDERS MILLER: TT for Cliff.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.670
ALL: TT for Cliff.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.870
Heyah.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.130
BOTH: Yay!

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.820
ANDERS MILLER: Here, throw
it back, Cliff.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.285
BRYAN JARR: Heyah.

00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:51.696
ANDERS MILLER: All
right, good job.

00:04:51.696 --> 00:04:53.320
BRYAN JARR: Anyone else?

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.190
Last chance.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.900
OK.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.610
ANDERS MILLER: Good
job, everybody.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.560
So--

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.010
thank you.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.050
How many of you guys have
been to Seattle before?

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.480
So you--

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.120
I'm sure you all went
to the fish market.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.620
BRYAN JARR: Everyone
who-- perfect.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.940
ANDERS MILLER: So we're the
guys that throw the fish.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.300
Clearly, you know that now.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.310
And we're also known for having
a good time at work.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.080
But it wasn't always
like that.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.810
We--

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.660
back in the '80s, actually, our
company was in big time

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.540
financial issues.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.420
We were almost bankrupt.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.420
And we got approached
by a business

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.440
consultant, Jim Bergquist.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.960
And he said, let me get you
guys out of the hole.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.010
Give me two grand a month.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.390
I'm going to get you guys
out of the hole.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.826
And Johnny, at the time,
he couldn't even

00:05:30.826 --> 00:05:31.570
make his car payment.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.180
He's like, how the heck
am I going to give

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.960
you two grand a month?

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.520
So he agreed to bring Jim on,
on a two-month trial.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.190
See if he could turn the
business around.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.920
And so we brought Jim on.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.070
I wasn't there at the time.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.100
I've been there 13 years.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.740
This was in the '80s.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.110
Jim's still with us now.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.910
By Jim's whole thing was about
human beings and their power

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.500
to create things, their
power of creativity.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.500
So what he brought into Pike
Place Fish was the

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.770
culture we have now.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.880
Some of you've probably
seen our fish video.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.250
Anybody seen the video,
the 17 minute

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.190
corporate training tape?

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.650
It's all over the world,
but whatever.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.870
He brought that into
the company.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.970
And he made us start to realize
that we actually had a

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.140
say in how our experience
goes, every life.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.910
We get a [INAUDIBLE]
say in the matter.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.480
So what we did is we came
up with a game that was

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.310
inspiring to us.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.160
And he said, well, what's
inspiring to you guys?

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.920
What--

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.890
because back then everybody
was fighting at work.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.490
Guys were crying.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.570
Even Johnny, the owner, was
making people cry regularly.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.310
So he came, said, all right,
we'll, let's create a game

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.450
that's worth playing so then
that inspires you.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.550
And so we came up with
world famous.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.850
And it's kind of--

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.210
some guys laughed at the time.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.570
It's kind of funny.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.960
How are you going to
be world famous?

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.700
You guys are just a little
fish market in Seattle?

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.840
And one of the guys said,
well, put it on

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.750
the side of the box.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.330
And they said, well, you can't
just put it on the box.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.120
They're going to laugh at you.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.310
You guys are just this tiny
little fish market.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.540
But made that bold statement,
put it on the boxes, did a

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.240
little more brainstorming about
what does it look like

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.680
to be world famous.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.070
And to us it's not like a
Hollywood, up on the big

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.990
screen, and things like that.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:12.090
World famous is like making a
difference for people, world

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.590
famous customer service.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.860
If you're being world
famous, you're going

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:16.730
to love your workers.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.260
You're going to love all the
people that come down.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.190
And that kind of just
started to catch on.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.470
And the next thing we
know, the Goodwill

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.110
Games came to town.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.390
And all of a sudden, they
wanted to film.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.440
And all this media started
showing up.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.120
Spike Lee came down, wanted
to film a commercial.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.090
And the whole thing just kind
of started spiraling out of

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.260
control, but in a good way.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.830
And we're going, oh my god,
maybe we really do have the

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.270
power to create things.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.160
So here we are now.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.200
We created a cookbook.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.450
It's just-- we really believe
that whatever we set our

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.310
sights on, we have the
power to create it.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.360
BRYAN JARR: Yeah, and so the
cookbook really came about

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.020
over a decade ago.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.360
They really had an idea
to create a cookbook.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.200
And it first came about was
the second most popular

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:03.920
question they get.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.253
The first most popular question
is, are you guys the

00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:07.630
ones that throw the salmon?

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.760
Are you guys the ones
that throw the fish?

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.790
Second one is, how
do I cook this?

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.690
How do I cook that?

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.590
I even witnessed a one time
where there were three ladies

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.450
visiting, and they bought a
whole side of a halibut.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.920
They spent $300 on a
side of Halibut.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.570
And then as they were weighing
it, they were

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.090
like, how do cook that?

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.240
They had no clue.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.680
And so they all-- everyone has
their little go-to recipes

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.730
that they would share.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.920
But we really wanted to
capsulate it in one place.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.080
Also, back in early 2011, Pike
Place Fish was one of the

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.610
first fish markets in the
country to go 100%

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.280
sustainable.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.020
And so we really wanted to
show, OK, we can use the

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.140
cookbook as a vehicle to show
people that it's easy to cook

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.950
seafood, it's easy to
handle seafood.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.480
These are approachable
recipes.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.790
These aren't restaurant
designed out recipes.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.290
And you can do it in a way
that's sustainable, good for

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.550
the oceans, and then
good for the world.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.770
And so we're here.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.420
We have a great one, the
Peruvian rockfish ceviche,

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.940
that we're making today.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.920
It's awesome.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.650
And so we're going
to be with Jason.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.860
He was kind enough
to have us here.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.400
And don't worry if your mango
doesn't look like that when

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.710
you cut it.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.160
Ours would not, but
his is awesome.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.870
So we're here to make it.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:14.450
ANDERS MILLER: That's done
by a pro, right there.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.080
BRYAN JARR: Yeah.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.330
Ready.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:16.910
JASON: You guys read to go?

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:17.610
BRYAN JARR: Yeah, we're ready.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.140
JASON: Awesome.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.660
So we have some nice local
California rockfish.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.030
We did talk about
sustainability

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.760
a few minutes ago.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.270
Really important, Google
green seafood.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.070
We really have a focus on that
out here at Google and making

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.940
sure that we're using things
that are sustainable.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.825
And we'll talk a little
bit more about

00:09:33.825 --> 00:09:34.530
that later, I think.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.480
But sustainability means
different things

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.730
to different people.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.270
It's one of those kind
of catch words

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.070
out there these days.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.140
And kind of focus on what
that means later.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.650
So the beginning of
the recipe is--

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.260
I'm just going to make this all
together, and then I'll

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.030
show you the steps after
we get you guys a

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.990
little bit of food.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.070
So I have the mango
right there.

00:09:54.339 --> 00:09:57.360
It's Fresno chili pepper.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.270
I'll leave a little bit out,
just so we can taste it later

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.970
and see how the spice
is on it.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.550
One thing to always be mindful
of, when you're doing

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.910
something like this, is
everything doesn't necessarily

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:06.480
need to go in.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.620
It says at the recipe at the
beginning, everyone's taste

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.970
are a little bit different.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.410
And you have room to play at
the end, if you save some.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.970
If I put all at the beginning,
I can't take the heat out.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.380
So this gives me an opportunity
to be able to

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.230
adjust the seasoning at
the end a little bit.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.230
This gets a little
bit of salt.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.530
And the goal here is we don't
want a bunch of extra liquid

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:27.780
in our ceviche at the end.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.780
So by getting some salt in here
right now, we're going to

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.820
let this sit while I
do the rest of it.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.990
And then some of the water is
going to come out of these

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.930
vegetables and fruits that's
in here, so our ceviche

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.450
doesn't get too watered
down at the end.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.640
BRYAN JARR: Yeah, if you make
all of your ceviche first,

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.220
it's really good.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.670
But then that water is
just going to water

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.830
down all the flavors.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.620
And so you've had a ceviche
before where you start coming

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.445
through and it's just
all this water.

00:10:45.445 --> 00:10:49.890
But when you put in acid and
peppers and fish, all that

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.800
water starts draining out.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.280
So we want to separate that.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.220
JASON: Awesome.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.660
OK, so down here we
have the rockfish.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.260
Came in this morning.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.610
I diced it into half
inch cubes.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.060
And we want to do this in
a non-reactive bowl.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.920
And that means not
a metal bowl.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.450
The fish can react, and
we can get some off

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:08.910
flavors from that.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.250
BRYAN JARR: You'll get that
tinny, metal taste that gets

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.120
on the fish if it reacts.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.360
And rockfish, sustainable
rockfish is really good.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.890
Snapper, bass, you can
do it with halibut.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:19.620
You can do it.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.580
There's all kinds of other
seafood that you can use.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.910
ANDERS MILLER: It's a great
kind of fish all around.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.580
Rockfish is like--

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.730
I will take nice Pacific
rockfish

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.430
over a piece of lobster.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.250
It's that good to me.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.040
JASON: Yeah, I agree with you.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.635
ANDERS MILLER: And it's
inexpensive too.

00:11:31.635 --> 00:11:33.400
So that's one thing we
try to focus on too.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.510
We've got a whole section that
kind of breaks down.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.040
A lot of people are
scared of seafood.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.460
They think it's expensive.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.430
They think it's going to spoil
two seconds after you get home

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.410
or if you drive home in
the car for an hour.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.150
So rockfish, really
inexpensive and

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.905
a really good fish.

00:11:46.905 --> 00:11:48.670
BRYAN JARR: And ceviche's
really great too.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.440
A lot of people are like, I
don't know how to cook fish.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.190
They're scared.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:52.310
You're not cooking the fish.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.030
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah---

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.630
BRYAN JARR: It's raw.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.278
ANDERS MILLER: --you know how to
chop stuff up and throw it

00:11:54.278 --> 00:11:54.700
in a bowl, right?

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.340
BRYAN JARR: There we go.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.040
That's all you need
to know how to do.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.955
ANDERS MILLER: You've got it.

00:11:56.955 --> 00:11:59.070
JASON: OK, so once the rockfish
is in here, I have

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.180
some lime zest.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.150
I'm just going to put half the
lime zest in each one.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.100
BRYAN JARR: That smells
good-- zesty.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.930
JASON: A little bit
of olive oil.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.150
And we have some fish
sauce here.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.580
And if you've never worked with
fish sauce before, go

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.720
easy the first time and learn
what your flavor profile is

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.620
for using fish sauce.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.690
I personally love fish sauce,
but it's not for everyone.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.970
So once again, I'm going to save
a little bit of this for

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.520
the end, so I can do
an adjustment.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.745
Because if we get too
much fish sauce in--

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:26.720
ANDERS MILLER: There's
no turning back.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.610
JASON: No turning back.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.770
BRYAN JARR: I know fish sauce
is one of those ingredients,

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.090
when you first smell it you're
going to be like, whoa, that's

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.850
real fishy smelling.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.610
It's not where you're
like, oh, that looks

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.120
great or tastes great.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.950
But as it adds into things, it
just-- the flavors that come

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.060
out of it are amazing.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:48.720
I was telling Jason, you know
the umami, the sixth sense for

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.260
your tasting?

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.780
Like sour, sweet, and then
there's umami, which is like

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.210
savory, earthy.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.830
Two of the things that are
highest on the umami scale are

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.430
Parmesan cheese, Reggiano
Parmesan and fish sauce.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.070
Parmesan's like $30 a pound.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.040
Fish sauce is a bottle
for $1.79.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.655
So use fish sauce.

00:13:05.655 --> 00:13:06.950
JASON: And then the
last thing we have

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:08.070
here is the lime juice.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.290
And this is actually what's
going to cook our fish.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.290
The acidity in the lime
juice is going to do

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:13.430
the cooking for us.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.360
So this isn't something we'd
want to make much more than a

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.840
half an hour before we were
going to serve it.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.620
And as you saw, I did all
this prep this morning.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.430
So this can all be
kept separate.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.630
You could do most of this a day
ahead, do the fish the day

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.950
of, and then just add
your lime juice in

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:29.490
right at the end.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.410
Once again, I'm going to save
a little bit of it, so I can

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.420
adjust my seasoning
near the end.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.210
ANDERS MILLER: Question?

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.450
AUDIENCE: What's the
white sauce for?

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.760
JASON: That's coconut milk.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.750
Thank you for--

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.470
so the coconut--

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.900
the key to this whole thing is
we're looking for a balance of

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.420
our flavors.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.200
So we have the fish sauce,
which is umami.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.370
We have the lime juice,
which is our acidity.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.200
We have the peppers,
which are heat.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.880
We have the mango,
which is sweet.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.490
Coconut milk's a little
bit sweet.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.610
So we're looking
for a balance.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.810
It's not really follow the
recipe, look at their-- they

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.680
tested it out, but everyone has
a different flavor profile

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.620
for what they like.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.970
So make it so you like it.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:07.990
ANDERS MILLER: And
there's different

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.070
styles of ceviche too.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.650
This is a Peruvian South
American version.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:12.655
Really nice.

00:14:12.655 --> 00:14:14.680
JASON: So we'll just give this
a little bit of a stir.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.900
BRYAN JARR: And this, for us,
is a perfect summer dish.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.030
ANDERS MILLER: So all
of us up here in

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.895
Seattle, that's August.

00:14:20.895 --> 00:14:22.720
BRYAN JARR: Yeah,
or today would

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.030
be our summer, basically.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.750
It's Seattle summer right
now, so that's why

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.340
we're doing it today.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.460
ANDERS MILLER: That's why I
wanted to wear my sunglasses

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.310
during the demo.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.160
JASON: Sorry.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.520
ANDERS MILLER: That
looks good.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.280
JASON: So just get this
all nice and mixed up.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.810
And then we will go back to our
other ingredients that we

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.140
mixed a few minutes ago.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.296
And we'll get that in here.

00:14:43.296 --> 00:14:44.658
ANDERS MILLER: Beautiful.

00:14:44.658 --> 00:14:46.020
BRYAN JARR: Do you want me
to grab that for you?

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.830
JASON: Yeah, why don't you
grab that for me, Bryan.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.390
OK, and then what we're going
to do is we're going--

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.640
I'm just going to
use my hands.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.440
We're going to lift from the
top, because we wanted to keep

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.170
whatever liquid came
off of here, at the

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.590
bottom of this bowl.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:01.420
And once again, just
get this in here.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.970
As you can see, there's probably
twice as much fish,

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.700
maybe a little bit more,
to the garnish here.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.870
If you want to save yourself a
little bit of money, obviously

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.480
put more of this in
than the fish.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.660
And then we're just going to
finish mixing this together.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.720
And then we're going
to taste it.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.640
And then that's only way we're
going to know what we need to

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.156
do to take it to
the next step.

00:15:21.156 --> 00:15:23.330
BRYAN JARR: And when you're
mixing this, like Jason's

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.930
doing, you kind of want to mix
it and fold it together.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.590
You don't want to--

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.290
don't go like that, because
you're not wanting to break

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:30.015
apart the fish.

00:15:30.015 --> 00:15:32.735
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah,
handle like baby.

00:15:32.735 --> 00:15:32.990
Remember?

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.133
BRYAN JARR: Handle like
baby, like you're

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:34.360
stepping on a baby.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.366
ANDERS MILLER: It's the same
when you're throwing them or

00:15:35.366 --> 00:15:38.210
when you're mixing them up.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:42.530
JASON: OK so now we're at the
point where the only way we're

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.570
going to know how things
are is by tasting it.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:47.810
And I really encourage this.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.580
When you're cooking at home,
you should be tasting your

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.010
food as you go, all the time.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.760
I talk to my cooks about this.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.130
The only way you know
how something

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.840
tastes is to taste it.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.080
So if you're having a dinner
party, and you're putting the

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.350
food down on the table, and
you're hoping your guests are

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.110
going to like it, best if
you'd tried it first.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.940
Then you're going to know.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.395
BRYAN JARR: And you can get
the guests involved.

00:16:05.395 --> 00:16:06.240
ANDERS MILLER: I always
do that at home,

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.060
get the guests involved.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.862
Like hey, taste this.

00:16:08.862 --> 00:16:09.470
Let me know.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:10.360
Is it good?

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.396
More salt, more something?

00:16:12.396 --> 00:16:13.960
JASON: I like a little
more salt in mine.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.910
ANDERS MILLER: It could use
a little more salt.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:15.040
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.575
ANDERS MILLER: I could use more
heat, personally, but

00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:18.110
that's just me, personal
preference.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.905
BRYAN JARR: Go down
the store--

00:16:18.905 --> 00:16:20.645
JASON: And if it burns you
guys a little bit--

00:16:20.645 --> 00:16:21.040
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.126
BRYAN JARR: --get a
serrano in there.

00:16:22.126 --> 00:16:23.526
JASON: --blame him.

00:16:23.526 --> 00:16:26.110
JASON: Yeah, and we were talking
right before, pick the

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.440
pepper you like.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.910
This would be great, depending
on the level of heat you like,

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.650
this would be great
with any pepper.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.620
I think this would be great with
a habanero, because it

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.650
has that really floral.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.200
But you'd have to watch
the heat, because

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.510
one habanero is like--

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:37.980
BRYAN JARR: Indian
ghost chili.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:38.810
JASON: --all this
Fresno pepper.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:39.395
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:39.395 --> 00:16:41.170
ANDERS MILLER: Make sure you
know what you're getting into.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:41.460
JASON: Just going to get
a little more acidity.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.030
ANDERS MILLER: I grew some
peppers, and I thought--

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.810
I was under the impression
that they were

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.170
less hot than a jalapeno.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:46.950
BRYAN JARR: Huh-uh.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:48.900
ANDERS MILLER: I ate one whole
pepper right off the vine.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.710
I ate it in two bites,
and it was like--

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:52.680
it was so bad.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.270
It was 20 minutes of torture.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.080
Don't do that.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.070
JASON: And when you're
growing your own

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.350
peppers, a lot of it--

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.150
the heat depends on the
soil they come from.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:04.230
So the peppers that we grow here
are similar peppers that

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.770
they took over to
Basque country.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.020
But the soil isn't the same.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.480
So the heat's different.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.910
It's like a Vidalia onion
versus a regular onion.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.970
The Vidalia onion's
grown in Georgia.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.000
There's not a lot of
sulfur in the soil.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.589
So the onion doesn't pick up a
lot of that, and we have a

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:20.380
sweet onion.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.400
Peppers are the same way.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.260
It's where you grow something,
where the fish--

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:24.770
ANDERS MILLER: Where
it comes from.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.440
JASON: --swims in the ocean--

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.829
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah, temperature
of the water--

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:27.440
JASON: --where the grapes
come from in your wine--

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.070
ANDERS MILLER: How deep they're

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:28.190
caught, all that stuff.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.000
JASON: --all of that.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.735
It's really where it comes from
makes a big difference.

00:17:30.735 --> 00:17:31.547
BRYAN JARR: So you have
hot soil is where

00:17:31.547 --> 00:17:31.810
we're going with it.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:32.730
JASON: Yes, you've
got spicy soil.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.460
ANDERS MILLER: And it's a
little bit at a time.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.080
Because like the fish sauce, if
you throw too much pepper

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.130
in there, you're done.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.270
You can't really take it out.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.830
BRYAN JARR: You want herbs?

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:40.990
ANDERS MILLER: You could, but
it would be pretty tedious.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.120
JASON: I'm just going to throw a
little of that on top, right

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:43.880
as we start putting this out.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.180
And then I'll do the--

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.425
ANDERS MILLER: Cool, where's
our little cups?

00:17:46.425 --> 00:17:47.960
JASON: Show you guys a little
bit of the steps I took

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.693
earlier today, after
we're done this.

00:17:49.693 --> 00:17:50.695
ANDERS MILLER: You
guys want to eat?

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:50.970
Yeah?

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:51.140
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.300
JASON: Then the last little bit
of garnish that's going to

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.520
go on top is I just made some
popcorn this morning, made a

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.200
little cayenne salt on here.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.790
So we're just going to garnish
the top of this with that.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.150
BRYAN JARR: So this just gives
a cool presentation and it

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.930
gives it texture.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:05.910
So this is going to
be kind of soft.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.790
And then that gives that
crunch on everything.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.790
ANDERS MILLER: Cool.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:11.500
BRYAN JARR: Damn.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:15.276
JASON: OK, so I'm just going to
move this back so you guys

00:18:15.276 --> 00:18:18.775
can start plating, dish it up.

00:18:18.775 --> 00:18:19.310
There you go.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:20.160
BRYAN JARR: There you go.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.990
She's going to--

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.910
JASON: So the last-- a little
bit of garnish is we have some

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.680
cilantro here.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.730
Just going to strip the leaves
off the cilantro.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.400
Nice thing about cilantro is
that you can eat just about

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.480
the whole plant.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.340
Depending on what nationality
you're cooking from, they use

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.550
all the way from the roots
all the way up

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.110
through all the stems.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.670
And the last little bit of
garnish is some Thai basil,

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.380
which is just basil, but it
has a little more of that

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.220
anise flavor in it that
regular basil doesn't.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.190
So I'm just going to do a cut
that's called the chiffonade.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.260
Just means "to ribbon"
in French.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.930
See how I make that claw with
my hand, to keep my fingers

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:03.920
away from the blade.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.820
The blade's always touching the
flat part of my finger.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.460
That way I don't worry
about cutting myself

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.710
too badly, too often.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.970
There's a little--

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.420
there's your herbs
for the top.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.870
OK, so just to show you guys a
little bit of the tools that I

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.330
used to make this today.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.270
Microplane, does everyone have
one of these at their house?

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.940
These are really cool,
inexpensive.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.700
And they're great for all
kinds of things, grating

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.030
cheese, zesting citrus.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.330
You do have to replace them
every once in a while.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:35.110
They do get dull.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.410
And you'll sit there, and you'll
be rubbing it over

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.050
something, and you're wondering

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.960
why it's not working.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.020
A steel.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.580
Very important to always
make sure you're

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.370
steeling your knife.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.810
I had 10 pounds of fish
here this morning.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.010
I probably steeled might knife
3 times, 4 times, just when I

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.750
was cutting the fish.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.940
Makes your life so
much easier.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.600
The blade dulls very quickly.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.860
So to have a steel--

00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:01.560
the way you use it, 90 degrees,
45 degrees 20

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.930
degrees, always away
from yourself.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.220
OK?

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.470
Spoon, peeler.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.020
So we have the mango.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:16.560
The way I do a mango is
not like you see in--

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.230
I don't do the little thing
where you flip it inside out

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.560
or anything.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.330
You can't get these
nice little cuts.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.970
So I just take the top and
bottom off, peel it.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.960
This is the pull peeler.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.160
I prefer the much more than
the kind your grandmother

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.260
probably had.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:35.600
I don't know.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.850
I don't know how old
anybody is anymore.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.150
I'm at a certain age
where I just--

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.740
could've been yesterday or
could've been 20 years ago.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.450
So the mango has a--

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.850
the seed for the mango comes
right through the middle.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.320
And it's kind of bulbus
a little bit.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.790
So you're going to look right
along the top here.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.380
And you'll be able to
see where it starts.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.610
And you start just
about the middle.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.780
And you kind of wait to see
where your knife bites.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.920
And then as you cut, you turn
your knife a little bit out

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.960
and then come back around.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.530
And you get one side.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.310
You flip it around.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:05.130
You do the same thing.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.050
You kind of want to feel
that pit the whole time

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.100
you're doing it.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.310
And then you can get just this
little strip off of here.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.730
This is delicious to snack on.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:18.070
And then just going to take the
mango, and I'm going to

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:24.935
cut it like this and
then like this.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.360
Turn it, very similar to
how you'd cut an onion.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.610
And then we just come through
here, keeping the tip of the

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:36.965
knife on the board.

00:21:36.965 --> 00:21:39.460
If you guys see how I'm holding
the knife in my hand,

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.020
I don't have it like this.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.120
It's not back here.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.020
You grab the blade between your
finger and your thumb,

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:45.810
right here.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:47.590
You wrap the rest of your
hand around the blade.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.180
This really gives you a lot
of control over the knife.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.450
Think of it like a hammer.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.500
If I hold it all the way back
here, I might be able to whack

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.910
that nail, but I'm probably
going to get my

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:56.310
thumb in the process.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.710
So the more you have control
over the blade--

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:02.100
So that's my mango.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.050
Do the same with
the rest of it.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.120
Lime, when you're using the
microplane, all you really

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.810
want to do is you want
to grab just the

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.930
outer peel of the citrus.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.140
The pith, the white part
right below is bitter.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.010
So we only go across
the mango--

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.940
whatever we're doing one time.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.030
And you can see how I'm taking
off the dark green, but it's

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.850
still kind of looks light
green under there.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.870
I'm not going to sit here
and go like this, see

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:27.980
how deep I can get.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.190
We don't want to do that.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.810
Just once over the outside.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:33.620
Tap it out.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.045
ANDERS MILLER: Don't cut me.

00:22:35.045 --> 00:22:36.300
JASON: I'm not going to.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.464
ANDERS MILLER: OK.

00:22:39.464 --> 00:22:41.520
JASON: English cucumber,
we used an

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.390
English cucumber today.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.390
It has a lot less the seeds
in the center of it.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:45.630
It's a lot easier
to work with.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.290
If you have a regular cucumber,
it could be all the

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.020
same thing.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.110
Once again, I peeled
it, cut it in half.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:56.720
Had a spoon, scooped
out the seeds.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.950
Same thing when I'm cutting
this, is I'm going to cut this

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:04.260
into one, two equal sizes.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.540
Then I line them up.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.770
This-- a cucumber's a great
thing to practice on--

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.680
or something like this--
because it's long.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.525
It's easy to work with.

00:23:11.525 --> 00:23:12.730
They're not too expensive.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.230
You can really work on
your knife skills.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.310
So the first thing is, I grab
the food and I roll my fingers

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.900
up into what we call a claw.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.820
So the blade is-- as you can
see, the blade a knife is

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.160
always going to be along
my fingers like this.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:28.490
So I don't actually move the
knife, I move my fingers.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.050
And the thumb kind
of goes behind.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.720
We always make sure
we tuck the thumb.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.200
And the thumb is what kind of
holds on to the food so that I

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.140
can drag my fingers
toward my thumb.

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:43.150
That's that.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.570
And then we have a chili
pepper right here.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:48.380
I would suggest--

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.040
I'm not going to do a right now,
but having some gloves at

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.050
your house.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.500
Very great for if
you're working

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.730
with any kind of peppers.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.400
These things are hot
on the inside.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.380
They get on your hands and then
you can touch sensitive

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.360
parts of your body.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.310
BRYAN JARR: Yeah, we just did
a video shoot and they did

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:03.720
have paper towels or anything.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.000
And I was cutting serranos
for different recipe.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.250
And then, I did not--
it was not good.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:09.970
JASON: Right.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:10.840
BRYAN JARR: My nose
is basically

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.870
draining on the camera.

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.240
JASON: And the eyes are the
least of your worries when it

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.530
comes to that.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:21.220
So I just pulled the seeds out
and then just the same thing.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:26.120
It's the same technique, just
used on different parts of the

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.860
different fruits, vegetables.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.750
I stack it back up so I can
just come right through.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:36.370
OK, so that's basically how we
did all the little steps up to

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.780
where we got when we threw
it all into the

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:38.940
bucket for you guys.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:39.820
So, how's it taste so far?

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:40.830
AUDIENCE: Amazing.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:41.210
JASON: Is it good?

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:44.770
JASON: Yeah these are all--

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.880
BRYAN JARR: OK, who
doesn't have one?

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.080
JASON: OK, over there.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.490
The popcorn?

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:53.430
I made it in a 40
quart stock pot.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.120
So I had a stock pot that was
about this big around and

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.310
about this tall.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.620
And I just put some oil
into it, threw the

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.440
popcorn, turn up on high.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.230
Put a sheet pan over the top
of it and popped it.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:05.880
I don't have a popcorn
popper my house.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.760
If I need popcorn, I pull
out a pan with a

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.200
lid and I make popcorn.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.220
Yeah, it's really, really
easy to make.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.010
You don't have to have a fancy
machine to make your popcorn.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:16.570
Anyone have any questions
about the

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:17.360
cooking portion of it?

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:17.790
Yeah?

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.080
AUDIENCE: Why the
coconut milk?

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.820
JASON: The coconut milk
is just I love coconut

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:22.910
milk, so why not?

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.540
But it's part of the balance
we talked about.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:26.640
We have the spicy.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.020
We have the acidity.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.430
We have the sweet.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.810
And coconut milk is a little bit
sweet, but it also carries

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.980
the flavors all the
way through.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.230
It's kind of a base note almost
to our dish that we can

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.060
build on top of.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:44.410
A lot of ceviche you get is very
acidic, because the acid

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.770
is in there to cook the fish.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:48.230
In this one, it's more
about a balance.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.040
It's more about achieving
that balance of flavors.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.940
And the coconut milk really
helps with that.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.400
And then on top of it,
it's delicious.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.980
ANDERS MILLER: So does anyone
have any questions?

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.600
BRYAN JARR: Any questions?

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.220
ANDERS MILLER: We're
just hanging out.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.950
AUDIENCE: Um, do you guys
permanently smell like fish

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:04.472
and get complaints from your
significant others to bathe?

00:26:04.472 --> 00:26:06.490
ANDERS MILLER: I pretty much
smell like ish a lot.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:09.060
I mean, my hands, it's hard to
get the smell off my hands.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.860
It takes a vacation
with the ocean

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.620
involved for several days.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:14.130
But as far--

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.520
I mean, my significant other, I
met her at the fish market.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.480
So she kind of knew what
she was getting into.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.950
So it's not too bad.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.650
Plus the smell, we say that's
the sweet smell of success.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.700
Everything I do, every vacation
I go on, everything's

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:26.720
paid for by that smell.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.450
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say you love it.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:29.030
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah,
you learn to--

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:29.910
[SNIFFS]--

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.570
you learn to love it.

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.040
BRYAN JARR: After the cookbook,
we're going to come

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.966
out with a cologne line.

00:26:34.966 --> 00:26:35.780
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah,
great idea.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.380
BRYAN JARR: It's going
to be amazing.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.020
ANDERS MILLER: It's
funny though.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.120
People actually send us a
little sample products.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.180
And everyone's got these little
gimmicks of things that

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.760
are supposed to get fish
smell of your hands.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.830
And I haven't really found
anything besides like going in

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:47.980
the ocean for several days.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.093
Which just kind of
does it all.

00:26:50.093 --> 00:26:51.430
Yeah, anybody else?

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.840
AUDIENCE: I had a question for
the three of you as far as--

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.730
so we have awesome copies
of your cookbook now.

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:00.560
But my main question when it
comes to using cookbooks is,

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.730
if you just want to make
something out of the cookbook,

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.290
but you're not in the mood for
anything specific, what is

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.560
your recommendation
on where to start?

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.370
How do you just kind of--

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.760
other than just going through
the entire book and finding

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.430
something at random, do you
start off with the main

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:16.400
component to the dish?

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.010
Do you start off with
how it's cooked?

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.390
What is your preferred
approach?

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.700
BRYAN JARR: I would
do component.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.330
Or actually, if you're just
like, I just want to try

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.520
something kind of--

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.810
towards the back, there's
thing called the basics.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:33.110
And it has lots of the Pike
Place seafood seasonings

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.250
broken down.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:38.040
Which a lot of times, you'll
have those in your pantry.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.460
Some of the sauces.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.000
And then, I mean the great
thing about really good

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.790
seafood is if you bake it for
just a little bit, or saute it

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.650
for just a little bit, or grill
it for just a little

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:51.050
bit, and don't overcook it--

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:54.280
number one thing people do
is overcook their fish.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:54.940
Don't overcook it.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.770
Remember, you go to sushi
restaurant, you eat it raw.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:58.800
So don't overcook it.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.890
And then use one
the marinades.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:01.090
Use one of sauces.

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:03.530
And that's a real basic way to
get started instead saying

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.950
like, oh I'm going to do the
clams with bread crumbs and

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:09.280
lemon zest and I've got to
get all those parts.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.910
And then you can kind of move
into, you're planning a dinner

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.700
party and you're like, oh I
really want to prep for this.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.830
But if you're just home,
go to one of those.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:17.600
Usually it's just a
few basic things.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.410
Gives great flavor.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:18.890
AUDIENCE: True, thank you.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.210
ANDERS MILLER: And creating a
relationship with somebody is

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:23.060
a good way to do it too that
we talk about in there.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.030
Like how do you get good fish?

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.070
How do you know if you're really
buying what you think

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.150
you're buying?

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.170
If it's mislabeled
or wherever.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:32.480
There's been issues with
that recently.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.630
But just go find a fishmonger or
go to the grocery store and

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.750
start creating a relationship
with somebody.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.000
And get to the point where you
could trust them them.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.690
And go to them for
recommendations.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.070
Because like Brian said, wwe've
got all these rubs and

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:48.040
all these different recipes in
the back that are a basic

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.040
sauce or seasoning that will
go on all types of seafood.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.690
So you build that relationship
and then if

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.100
you're not feeling inspired--

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.930
I have people that come
to me every day,

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:57.970
like, man what's fresh?

00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.390
What should I cook right now?

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.100
And then by the time they
leave, they're inspired.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.300
And they'll grab a couple lemons
and use one of the rubs

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.100
in the back of the book.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.180
And you're good to go.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.955
AUDIENCE: Great, thank you.

00:29:09.955 --> 00:29:10.840
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.620
Thanks for coming.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:12.180
BOTH: Thank you.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.740
AUDIENCE: I have
two questions.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.780
First one is, are
you guys hiring?

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.510
And second question is, what are
the job requirements to be

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:22.620
called official Pike
Place fish guys or

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.600
gals, for that matter.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.510
BRYAN JARR: Fish wife.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.070
We learned the real--

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:28.720
ANDERS MILLER: A female
fishmonger is

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.420
called a fish wife.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.210
BRYAN JARR: Fish wife.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:30.540
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.970
ANDERS MILLER: I always thought
it was someone who was

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:34.860
married to a fishmonger,
but that's not it.

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:35.360
We--

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.410
I say we're always hiring.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:38.380
You never know, so
bring a resume.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.510
But no, we hire very
infrequently.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:45.200
Everybody that works there
sticks around for a long time.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.370
I've been there for 13
years, and I'm just

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:48.620
kind of in the middle.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.280
There's guys that are 25, 26--

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.215
BRYAN JARR: 26 years, 25, 19.

00:29:53.215 --> 00:29:54.000
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.995
BRYAN JARR: It's a career.

00:29:54.995 --> 00:29:56.820
ANDERS MILLER: Dickie, the
boss, he just retired.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.960
And he's been there
30 plus years.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.430
We were all sad when he left.

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.110
We're all crying in
the work meeting.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.390
Oh, Dickie's leaving.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.470
And then two days later somebody
called him and asked

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.510
him to work for them.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:07.670
He shows up back at
the fish farm.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:08.240
We're like, man.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:08.520
We're crying.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.160
BRYAN JARR: He totally worked
the going away party.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:10.810
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah, he did.

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:11.820
BRYAN JARR: I was at the
going away party too.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.100
I was like-- people
were crying.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.280
And then three days later
I'm down getting stuff.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.210
I was like, what are
you doing here?

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:19.130
He's like, oh, my wife doesn't
really-- she gets kind of--

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:20.840
she doesn't like me
home all the time.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.760
I was like, OK.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.110
So now he works like
three days a week.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.510
ANDERS MILLER: But the second
part of the question is we--

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.920
there's really no requirement.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.920
You've got to show up on time.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.850
We literally will take a resume
and we'll call the

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:33.690
first person that answers
the phone.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.240
They come down, and they--
basically, they're trying out

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:36.930
for the job.

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:39.210
It's kind of like they have
to make the team.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:40.830
We're a really tight
knit team.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:43.990
Our whole thing is all about
teamwork and making a

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.480
difference.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.380
Like how can I make a difference
for that person

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.770
over there, whether it be your
co-workers, everybody that

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:51.380
walks by the fish market,
whether they're

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.960
buying fish or not.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.530
So can you work on a team?

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.670
Can you commit to something
that's bigger than yourself?

00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:59.300
Because you're going to
wake up at 5:00 AM.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.370
It's going to be cold
and wet out.

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:03.110
And you can go, well,
this sucks.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:04.870
Or you can go, OK,
I'm committed.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.280
I said it, and go make
a difference anyway.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.100
So we're kind of looking for
people that are willing to try

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:14.370
things a new way and just go
have it be about the people.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.240
BRYAN JARR: And you can't go
on vacation in December.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:17.960
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:18.660
BRYAN JARR: I would say that.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:19.440
AUDIENCE: December?

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.820
BRYAN JARR: No December
vacations.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:21.460
They're slammed.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:21.970
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.050
BRYAN JARR: Everyone
works every day

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:26.020
for going up to Christmas.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:26.780
It's crazy there.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.370
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah, so if
you've got a Christmas holiday

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.540
you normally go on, and you
want to work at the fish

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.342
market, we're probably not
going to hire you.

00:31:32.342 --> 00:31:33.284
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:33.284 --> 00:31:33.755
All right.

00:31:33.755 --> 00:31:34.226
Thanks.

00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:34.940
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:35.240
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.970
So I was born and raised
in Seattle.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:40.500
So I grew up catching the plush
fish and doing all that

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.000
stuff with you guys.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.530
So thanks for always
being there.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:43.620
I just had a couple questions.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.460
One, what is that fish that's
the chomping fish?

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:47.460
BRYAN JARR: The monkfish.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.390
ANDERS MILLER: The monkfish.

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:49.290
BRYAN JARR: The scary
monkfish.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I remember it
scaring it when I was little

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.185
and then just laughing
at the kids now.

00:31:53.185 --> 00:31:53.880
I'm like, suckers.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.890
BRYAN JARR: And it's crazy now,
because when they went--

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:00.060
when Pike Place fish went 100%
sustainable, monkfish is not a

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.460
sustainable caught fish.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.590
So they had to get rid of it.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.240
And the monkfish was gone.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:04.670
And--

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:07.160
ANDERS MILLER: That became
the most asked question.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.550
BRYAN JARR: Yeah.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.110
ANDERS MILLER: Instead of where
do they throw the fish

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:11.720
or how do I cook that, now it's,
where's the monkfish?

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.940
BRYAN JARR: Yeah.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:13.910
And so they had a--

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:16.100
what is a company that
does things for

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.730
film and the aquarium.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:21.170
And they built a $2,000
realistic looking fake

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:24.010
monkfish that now is permanently
at the market.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:24.920
It's crazy.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.510
ANDERS MILLER: It's
better too--

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:26.040
BRYAN JARR: It looks
exactly like it.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:26.690
ANDERS MILLER: Because
it's got--

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:27.170
the teeth are fake.

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.940
And those old monkfish,
they actually had

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.130
real teeth on them.

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.180
And sometimes you can't see
what's going on down there.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.680
You pull the string,
and someone's got

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.700
their finger in there.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.910
So we've had a couple injuries,
just nasty monkfish

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:40.040
teeth ripping your finger
open is bad.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.780
So we don't have to worry
about that ever again.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.760
AUDIENCE: And my second one
is, what is your secret to

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.410
your smoked salmon?

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.110
I've tried like nine recipes,
and there's

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:47.590
something about it.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.890
I used to work on Fifth and
Pine, so I'd always go down

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.570
there and get smoked salmon and
Beecher's mac and cheese.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:52.620
It was like the perfect lunch.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.380
BRYAN JARR: Nice, that's
a good one.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:54.660
That's a good little lunch.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.280
AUDIENCE: But what
is your secret.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.814
ANDERS MILLER: It's a secret.

00:32:57.814 --> 00:32:59.056
AUDIENCE: Damn it.

00:32:59.056 --> 00:33:00.110
ANDERS MILLER: It's
in the book.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.590
I'm just kidding.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:01.290
It's not in the book.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:02.440
No, it's a--

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.470
basically, it's just
a great recipe.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:05.800
we've been buying from
the same people.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.510
They smoke our salmon for us.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.460
And I'd say the most important
factors are we always use

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:11.960
Alder, which is really good.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.450
We don't make it too salty.

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:16.750
And we use big, fatty
awesome king salmon.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:17.830
We buy 18 up.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.100
That means they're
over 18 pounds.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.140
They're going to be nice
and fatty king salmon.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.320
And so if you start--

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.830
a lot of people don't want to
smoke good quality salmon.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:30.460
People will buy a chum or a
lower-grade salmon, because

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.970
they say, oh, well I'm just
going to smoke it.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:32.410
But we--

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.030
BRYAN JARR: And then it's going
to taste like that.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:35.720
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah, and then
that's why you get a lot of

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.940
dry, seems like it's been
smoked too long.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.590
We use big, fatty king salmon,
so they don't dry out.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.035
So if you start with an awesome
wild king salmon in

00:33:43.035 --> 00:33:44.770
the beginning, you're going
to end up with it.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.680
A lot of people smoke
farm-raised salmon too.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.998
So we don't carry any
farm-raised salmon.

00:33:49.998 --> 00:33:50.950
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:52.080
So I had a question
for you guys.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.980
So my boyfriend's from Maui,
born and raised.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.610
And he does not eat fish.

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:57.650
And my family has
a fish market.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.090
So I'm wondering if you guys
could suggest some type of

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:05.140
fish that's an easy kind of
little baby step for him

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.540
that's not super fishy.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.525
ANDERS MILLER: Something that
tastes kind of like Spam?

00:34:08.525 --> 00:34:09.409
AUDIENCE: That I--

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:10.690
exactly.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:10.810
He wants to eat--

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:12.259
BRYAN JARR: Slip it in
his Spam musubi.

00:34:12.259 --> 00:34:12.630
There you go.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.100
AUDIENCE: He wants to eat Loco
Moco all day, you know?

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:14.620
And I eat fish.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.500
ANDERS MILLER: Me too.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.139
AUDIENCE: I don't
eat meat, right?

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.510
So I was wondering if you guys
could suggest something with a

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:21.010
little bit of the island
flavors, that I can make and

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:22.684
kind of just trick
him one night.

00:34:22.684 --> 00:34:24.460
ANDERS MILLER: I think some--

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.050
man, start with some black
cod, butterfish.

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.890
You ever had the black cod?

00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:29.929
AUDIENCE: Possibly.

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:31.100
I eat any type of fish.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:31.630
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah,
it's so good.

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.780
It's like a-- it flakes
like salmon.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.570
It's white fish.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.330
It flakes like salmon, but
it's really buttery.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:38.120
It's almost like a
Chilean sea bass.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:38.659
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.460
ANDERS MILLER: Really nice and
rich like that, but it's

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.409
totally sustainable.

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:43.909
You can get it all up and
down the Pacific Coast.

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:47.260
And it lends really well
to sweet marinades.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.170
So that might be something.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:52.920
You could go start off with
teriyaki or do like a miso.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.760
We've got that brown--
the butter and miso--

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.200
BRYAN JARR: Oh, miso sake-- or
yeah, sake soy butter sauce.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:34:59.960
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.060
BRYAN JARR: Equal parts, and you
spread that on anything.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:02.752
AUDIENCE: He'll never
know, right?

00:35:02.752 --> 00:35:03.400
BRYAN JARR: Yeah.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:03.930
ANDERS MILLER: No.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.340
And then put it right on-- man,
put it right under the

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.250
broiler, until it's just
about crispy, like

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:08.090
it's about to burn.

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:08.560
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.430
ANDERS MILLER: That's another
good thing too.

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:12.880
If you don't cook a lot of fish,
you can cook black cod

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.850
and just cook it and cook it and
cook it, and you won't dry

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:16.300
it out, because it's got--
it's really healthy.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.780
It's got a lot of
omega-3 in it.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.110
So it's a good beginner fish.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:22.200
And it's also just-- it's
my favorite fish.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:22.620
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:22.950
I'll try.

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:23.441
BRYAN JARR: Albacore tuna's--

00:35:23.441 --> 00:35:23.750
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming too.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:24.860
BRYAN JARR: a good one, too.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.950
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.470
BRYAN JARR: It's sustainable
on the Pacific coast, just

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:31.980
because it's not as rich as your
ahi's and ones like that.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.270
You know what I mean?

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:34.280
It's lighter color.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.740
And so it just has that kind
of buttery, rich flavor.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:37.290
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.220
BRYAN JARR: Sake soy
butter though.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:38.760
AUDIENCE: I'll try that.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.870
BRYAN JARR: If he doesn't like
it with sake soy butter, then

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:42.370
you might want to
re-think him.

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:42.910
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:44.130
Now I [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:45.030
Thank you very much.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:47.210
ANDERS MILLER: You're welcome.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:50.210
AUDIENCE: Hey, just a question
on other parts of the fish.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:52.010
Because I know fillets
are what you use.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.795
So what do you suggest for
the parts that you

00:35:53.795 --> 00:35:54.770
usually throw out?

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:57.180
Because when I was once in
Singapore they were doing the

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.860
fish head curry, which is
really popular there.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.190
Is there anything adventurous
that we

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:02.990
could do with the fish?

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.770
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah.

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.250
BRYAN JARR: We hate now
that we're people.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:09.406
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah, we're
giving away secrets.

00:36:09.406 --> 00:36:13.480
BRYAN JARR: The collars are some
of the most incredible

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.850
part of fish.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.960
And a lot of times-- we'd always
say at the market,

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.980
someone's buying a $300 salmon,
and then the head's

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.330
chopped off, and then they
lose all the collar.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:26.990
And collar is broiled or sake
soy butter sauce or with a

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:29.060
little bit of sauce and they're
just cooked, all the

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.540
fat and oil is in that
collar area.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.440
And it just--

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.220
like he said, it doesn't
dry out.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.326
It's amazing.

00:36:35.326 --> 00:36:37.050
ANDERS MILLER: The heads
and the bones are

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:38.010
really good for stock.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:38.270
BRYAN JARR: Stocks.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.250
ANDERS MILLER: A lot
of oil in there.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:41.950
We sell salmon heads
too, for $1.00.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:43.600
Because a lot of people, they
buy a salmon and they don't

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.540
want the head.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.320
But then we have other customers
that come by, and

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.040
they're cleaning up on that.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:49.830
A guy just--

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.745
that head weighs two
pounds sometimes.

00:36:51.745 --> 00:36:52.540
You know what I mean?

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:56.640
So they come get a two-pound
head for $0.50.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.780
The bones are really good.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.490
A lot of the meat that's right
up next to the bone is great.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:03.340
Like on a salmon, after we filet
them, we'll take a spoon

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.770
and just go along the back.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:05.670
You get that good meat.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:09.440
You can make salmon
patties out of it.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:09.960
You could use it all.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.650
BRYAN JARR: You can use,
yeah, everything.

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:14.580
We've done even Dungeness
crab shells.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:18.030
And then you blend the shells
up to make crab stock, like

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:19.130
crab bisque.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:20.780
And then it's just a little
bit of crab meat in it.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.080
But people taste it
and they're like,

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.400
oh, that tastes amazing.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.130
And it's literally hard crab
shells keep blending through.

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:29.040
ANDERS MILLER: That's one thing
about being sustainable

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.266
and trying to educate people
about seafood in general is we

00:37:32.266 --> 00:37:34.650
want-- we found that a lot
of people are scared.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.150
And they don't really know how
to handle fish or they haven't

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.940
cooked a lot of it.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:42.420
So there's a big primer on how
to pick out fish at the store,

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.930
like what you should be looking
for, how to break it

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.410
all down and use all the
different parts of the fish.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:50.410
All those little tricks in there
so that it's not scary

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:51.230
to make fish.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.770
JASON: I have a little
follow up on that.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:52.860
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.940
JASON: So what would you say
if you didn't really trust

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.880
your fishmonger or you hadn't
built that relationship yet?

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.220
How would you go into a market
and be able to tell that

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.475
something that was
a fresh fish?

00:38:02.475 --> 00:38:05.350
ANDERS MILLER: Well,
right here, first.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.060
You go in there, it
shouldn't smell.

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:08.360
There should be--

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.660
it should smell like fish, but
it shouldn't smell fishy.

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:11.160
You know what I mean.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.790
It shouldn't smell--

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:13.870
you know when something
doesn't smell right.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.810
So I would say that would
be the first thing.

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:19.900
If you're looking at whole fish,
they shouldn't have a

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:20.960
bunch of scale loss.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:24.020
That means that it's been
handled a lot or

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.520
maybe thrown a lot.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.050
But yeah, so I would
look for that.

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:30.050
You can open it up.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:32.540
Make sure if there's any blood
line on it, like a--

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.430
we always leave the bloodline
on our yellow fin tuna, so

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:36.940
that you can tell whether
it's fresh or not.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.750
So I'd look for some
bloodline on there.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.220
It should be nice and bright.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.630
The gills should be bright.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.940
No blood in there should be
dark brown and nasty.

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:46.400
You know what I mean?

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.160
Just looks like it hasn't
been sitting around

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:48.435
for a little bit.

00:38:48.435 --> 00:38:49.520
BRYAN JARR: Eyes
nice and crisp.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.320
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.030
BRYAN JARR: But then, when
you're building a relationship

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:55.480
with the fishmonger, if they
can't answer simple questions

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.060
about where it came from, all
those types of things, then

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.260
skip ahead.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:38:59.950
Find someone else.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:00.062
ANDERS MILLER: Same
with a restaurant.

00:39:00.062 --> 00:39:00.190
Yeah.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.300
BRYAN JARR: Same with a
restaurant nowadays,

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.860
especially in an area like West
Coast or San Fransisco.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.540
If they can't tell you where
it came from, how it was

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.920
caught quickly, then go--

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.770
skip ahead.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:14.120
We actually-- even when we were
just in New York, we went

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:14.850
to a restaurant.

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:17.110
And we were going through
the menu, a sushi

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.560
place, and we're like--

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.240
it was a huge menu, and it just
got cut to about this big

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.265
for us, because all of the
choices were not sustainable.

00:39:24.265 --> 00:39:25.150
ANDERS MILLER: It was like
they were trying--

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.420
BRYAN JARR: I mean huge.

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.430
ANDERS MILLER: to be
not sustainable.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.720
It was crazy, where I was like,
man, I don't know even

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.870
know what we can order.

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.300
BRYAN JARR: That's our next
cookbook, how not to be

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:31.740
sustainable.

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.040
No, just kidding.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.370
ANDERS MILLER: But if that's
important to you too, the

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:37.110
sustainability thing, we
take it really serious.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.550
It's an important thing, if you
want to keep eating fish.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:40.890
So there's apps.

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:42.815
You can download an app
for your phone.

00:39:42.815 --> 00:39:45.475
And we were literally doing that
at the sushi joint the

00:39:45.475 --> 00:39:45.680
other night.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.320
We were, OK, nope, can't
do that one.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.300
And then it'll say, well, you
can do it if it's from this

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.140
location and not
that location.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.300
So you ask the waitress.

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.720
And if she doesn't know,
then you probably

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.810
shouldn't order it.

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:00.450
BRYAN JARR: Another one that
we always tell people--

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:02.070
it's an easy one to tell.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.680
So when Copper River salmon
season comes or some of these

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.270
ones that are marketed well
and known, if you go into

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:11.060
multiple places and it's all
about same price, and then you

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.400
go to one place and it's half
the price or like $10 a pound

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.290
cheaper, you're most likely
90% getting duped.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:20.780
They didn't get some special
one they got in

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.000
at a cheaper price.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.160
If they tell you that, they're
most likely lying.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.220
And so if you see big price--

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.900
like oh, they always have it at
this, but these people have

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.270
it at this cheap, they're
probably passing it off as

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:32.290
something else.

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.540
And that's one way to tell.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.360
AUDIENCE: So I think you did a
really great job talking about

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.930
what individual consumers can
do to make their seafood

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:41.510
choices more sustainable.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:43.910
How about on the national
policy front?

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:46.870
What are some of the huge issues
facing us right now?

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:49.130
And what are some solutions
for those?

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:51.630
BRYAN JARR: Overfishing
is a giant one.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.420
And then that's a--

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.730
overfishing--

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:59.070
especially, take an example
like tuna, right?

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:02.890
Tuna doesn't just hang out in
the United States or hang out

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:03.630
in one country.

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:05.210
It takes over the whole
Pacific Ocean.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:06.910
So it has these huge areas.

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.900
And it's gotten more and more
expensive as sushi's gotten

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.430
more popular around the world.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:14.570
And overfishing is going
to be a huge thing.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:18.160
And that has to be a policy
on a national scale and an

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.380
international scale.

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:22.770
Countries have to come to an
agreement on marine sanctuary

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:25.530
areas where you can't fish or
fishing seasons where they

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:26.600
limit them.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.720
Alaska is a really great place,
because it really

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.410
manages their fisheries, really
manages how many salmon

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:34.990
are caught, what the salmon runs
look like, what black cod

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:37.630
runs look like, when you can
do Alaska spot prawns, all

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:38.740
those different items.

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:42.560
But tuna, because it travels
so far, it's really hard to

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.710
track like, oh, we're doing
it great in the US.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:48.870
But then it goes down into
Southeast Asia, and then it--

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:52.920
fish boats are out and they're
taking a bunch of them.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.340
And that--

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.480
I think overfishing's going
to be a big one.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:02.240
Also, a big, big one on places,
and look out for, is

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.640
how do they farm certain
seafoods?

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.040
So salmon farming's gotten
bigger and bigger as salmon's

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.070
gotten bigger.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:12.230
But farmed salmon pollutes the
water, interbreeds with other

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:15.480
salmon and passes on disease.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.080
They pass on sea lice.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:22.330
Farmed shrimp and things like
that in Southeast Asia, they

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:24.150
are done in chemicals.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.956
They pollute waterways.

00:42:24.956 --> 00:42:25.945
JASON: It's the worst.

00:42:25.945 --> 00:42:26.700
BRYAN JARR: Yeah,
it's the worst.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.025
ANDERS MILLER: And they only--

00:42:28.025 --> 00:42:30.400
JASON: They just go and
they dig a pit.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.650
And they fill it
with seawater.

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:33.900
And they raise shrimp in it
until the water is too

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.840
disgusting for the shrimp to
live, and then they just move

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.690
20 feet down the beach and dig
another hole and start again.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.390
BRYAN JARR: If you ever go out
to a restaurant, and you're

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:42.490
like, oh, I think I got
sick because I ate

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:43.580
shellfish or seafood.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:44.970
I'm allergic to shellfish.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.365
It could be because it just came
from Southeast Asia, and

00:42:47.365 --> 00:42:49.280
it's how they produced it.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:49.840
ANDERS MILLER: It's
one of the--

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.410
BRYAN JARR: It's terrible.

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.110
ANDERS MILLER: --five dirtiest
foods in the world.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.460
And everything that comes into
America, about 2% of it

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:56.530
actually gets inspected.

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:59.510
So definitely just ask.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.130
If they're not labeling what
kind of shrimp it is on the

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.420
menu or what kind of salmon--

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.450
If you have some awesome salmon
in your restaurant,

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.085
you're going to want to tell
people about that, because

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:09.110
it's a selling point.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.830
If it just says salmon or it
just says shrimp in a dish, I

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:15.230
would ask, because most likely
it's naughty stuff.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:16.430
JASON: If it says,
all you can eat--

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:17.000
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.220
BRYAN JARR: All you can eat.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.050
JASON: --you can probably
guess that--

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:20.910
BRYAN JARR: Deep fried,
all you can eat.

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:22.710
JASON: --all you can eat,
they're probably not the most

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:23.810
sustainable product.

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:24.165
They're terrible.

00:43:24.165 --> 00:43:26.160
ANDERS MILLER: And don't
buy fish on sale.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.720
Go buy clothes on sale.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.940
Don't go looking for
fish on sale.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.070
BRYAN JARR: Yeah, but
there's a reason.

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:32.882
They're trying to
get rid of it.

00:43:32.882 --> 00:43:34.340
Another good one.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.390
ANDERS MILLER: Anybody else?

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:36.370
JASON: Just to touch
on Alaska.

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:38.000
They really-- it's like a
cooperative up there.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.850
So when all the fishing
boats go out,

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:40.840
they have their quotas.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.980
But it's not who gets back
first with everything.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.050
It's all more of a
big cooperative.

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:48.330
And that's how they really
manage that up there.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:51.290
BRYAN JARR: It's a billion and
billion-dollar industry.

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:52.790
And they want it
to keep going.

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:53.960
They don't want to
just go away.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.690
ANDERS MILLER: Well, even that
one's getting a little scary

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.520
too, because now they're
drilling for oil up there.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.390
They're--

00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.510
BRYAN JARR: Mining.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:02.220
ANDERS MILLER: --talking about
the pebble mine, which could

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:05.150
wipe out Bristol Bay sockeye,
which is the biggest sockeye

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:06.530
salmon run in the world.

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:08.620
That could be endangered.

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:09.370
So it's real important.

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:10.430
Those are important issues.

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:14.195
BRYAN JARR: So get
your sockeye now.

00:44:14.195 --> 00:44:17.220
JASON: I would just say, on the
end of that, the best way

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.690
for us, personally, is we
vote with our wallets

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.020
every single day.

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.800
And if everyone on the planet
was voting with their wallets

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:28.230
to eat sustainable seafood,
people wouldn't be farming

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:29.160
salmon here.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.180
And they wouldn't be digging up
beaches to raise shrimp in.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.100
Those things just wouldn't
happen, because there wouldn't

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:35.990
be a market for it.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:39.510
So I know you only seem like one
person, but it does make a

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.810
difference.

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:40.700
BRYAN JARR: And we always--

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.360
we talk about in the book too,
if you have a really good

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.195
piece of king salmon or sockeye
salmon, serve a

00:44:46.195 --> 00:44:48.130
four-ounce piece and then
have other things.

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:49.910
You don't need a farm-raised--
it's like, oh, I got

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.790
farm-raised at this much per
pound, and I want everyone to

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.440
have a 12-ounce piece
of salmon.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:55.400
You don't need that.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.020
A, the flavor's terrible.

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.875
And if you just had a four-ounce
piece, it's going

00:44:58.875 --> 00:45:00.370
to taste nicer.

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:03.870
And then we also talk about in
the book, or for seafood every

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:07.480
day, like clams, mussels,
those types of things.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.290
You put that in pasta.

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:09.875
That's easy and inexpensive.

00:45:09.875 --> 00:45:10.650
ANDERS MILLER: And
very sustainable.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:12.290
BRYAN JARR: And fully
sustainable.

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:13.860
ANDERS MILLER: Well, that's kind
of one of our hopes for

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:17.670
the book too is we have a
national listing from doing

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:20.010
our books and videos and our
corporate training and all

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:20.680
that kind of stuff.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:24.080
So we could have easily put
together a collection of

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.380
recipes, and it would sell,
because it has our logo on it.

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.520
But we actually want to educate
and let people know.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.110
Like Jason said, you
make a difference.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:35.080
Every time you make a decision
on what you buy, you make a

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:35.410
difference.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:38.490
So hopefully we can get to the
point where it's not more

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:40.180
expen-- it shouldn't be
more expensive to

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:41.145
do the right thing.

00:45:41.145 --> 00:45:43.290
It should be cheaper
to be sustainable.

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:46.845
So that's hopefully where
we're headed.

00:45:46.845 --> 00:45:48.200
BRYAN JARR: Should we
sign some books?

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.866
JASON: Yeah, you guys
ready for that?

00:45:49.866 --> 00:45:50.732
BRYAN JARR: Yeah.

00:45:50.732 --> 00:45:51.600
ANDERS MILLER: Yeah.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:51.700
I'm ready.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.692
BRYAN JARR: They have to get
back to work sooner or later.

00:45:53.692 --> 00:45:54.690
JASON: Maybe not?

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:55.355
BRYAN JARR: Or--

00:45:55.355 --> 00:45:57.140
JASON: You've only been out
here for a little while.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:00.140
BRYAN JARR: --beach
volleyball.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:00.740
Thank you.

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:01.340
JASON: Thank you, guys.

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:22.842
