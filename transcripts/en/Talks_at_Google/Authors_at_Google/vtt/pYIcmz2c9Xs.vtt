MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:06.620
I have the esteemed pleasure of
introducing our guest speaker

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.070
today.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.460
Dr. Jeffery A. Lieberman is
the Lawrence C. Cole Professor

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.850
and Chairman of Psychiatry
at the Columbia University

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.970
College of Physicians
and Surgeons,

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.930
Director of the New York
State Psychiatric Institute,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.790
and Psychiatrist in Chief
of New York Presbyterian

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.940
Hospital at the Columbia
University Medical Center.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.680
Formally the President of
the American Psychiatric

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.170
Association, in
2000 he was elected

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.570
to the National Academy of
Sciences Institute of Medicine.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.510
He lives with his
wife in New York City,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.752
and Rosemary is
here today as well.

00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:40.210
Without further
ado, Dr. Lieberman.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.490
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN:
Thank you, [INAUDIBLE],

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.340
and good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.430
Thank you for coming.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.410
A pleasure to be here.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.933
My first time visiting
the Google Campus.

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:59.270
And I'm here to give a talk, but
it's really to promote my book.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.540
And I give a lot of
lectures to all types

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.379
of professional or
scientific groups,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.350
and periodically to
lay audiences, as well.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.010
But this is really
the first time doing

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.230
sort of a book promotion talk.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.120
And in the course
of my career-- which

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.180
has been 30-plus years in
the field of psychiatry,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.570
and mostly sort of in
academic psychiatry--

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.580
I've written many articles--
hundreds of articles

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.235
for the scientific literature
and a bunch of books

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:41.340
for a professional audience, but
never for the general public.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.240
This was the first
one that I did.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.710
So first thing I'd like to
say is that the title of it,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.570
"Shrinks: The Untold Story of
Psychiatry," was not my idea.

00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:55.610
I'll tell you what
led me to write

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.359
the book in the first place.

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:58.900
When I first decided
that I was going

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.860
to do a book for
the general audience

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.080
and was developing
a proposal, my agent

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.280
got a publisher who was very
interested in this topic

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.350
and I went to see her.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.430
And I told her about the
book and she said, well,

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.650
what are you calling it?

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.787
And I said, well, I was
thinking of something--

00:02:15.787 --> 00:02:17.370
and I wanted to come
up with something

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.060
which was poetic and eloquent.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.700
I was thinking along
the lines of "Pariahs

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.890
in the Palace of Medicine"
or "Sojourn in the Scientific

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.950
Wilderness."

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.220
And she looks at me
and she says, mm-mm.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.336
That's not going to work.

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:33.960
And I said, what do
you Think She says,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.560
just give me a couple of days.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.500
So she took the proposal, or
what I had of it at the time,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.920
and she sort of shopped it
around in terms of the office

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.419
and calls me up and
says, I got your title.

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:47.210
I said, what is it?

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.750
She says, it's "Shrinks: The
Untold Story of Psychiatrists."

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.416
I said, shrinks?

00:02:50.416 --> 00:02:51.300
They can't use that.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.880
She says, why not?

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.580
I said, well, it's kind
of demeaning, isn't it?

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.280
She said, but that's what
everybody thinks about when

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.790
they think about psychiatry.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.920
It's the most common reference.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.480
So do you want to write a
book for your colleagues

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.370
or do you want to write a
book that a wider audience is

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.030
going to read?

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.680
Hence the title.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.160
The cover wasn't my
idea, either-- a couch.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.720
I wanted a brain with neural
circuits and all these things.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.090
So, shows you how knowledge is
not necessarily transferable

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.640
across disciplines.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.170
But the reason I wrote the
book was that-- I mean, I never

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.780
really had any aspirations
to write in this way,

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.120
to become TV doc or
write for the public.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.740
But over the course
of my career--

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.890
30-plus years, mostly doing
research in the neurobiology

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.610
and psychopharmacology of
more severe mental disorders--

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.820
schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, depression--

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.530
I became increasingly aware
and increasingly frustrated

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.820
by the fact that millions--
millions-- of people

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.280
suffer from mental illness,
experience their symptoms,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.450
and don't avail themselves of
treatment for the simple reason

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.200
that either they are not aware
of what it is, because it's not

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.090
like when you have a belly
ache or you're short of breath

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.810
or you have some kind of
dysfunction in your urination

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.950
or elimination process.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.570
They don't know,
or they're ashamed,

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.680
or they don't know how
to find competent care.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.340
And the analogy
would be, imagine

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.530
if the American population
was experiencing

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.350
various types of
infectious diseases--

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:48.520
pneumonia, tuberculosis,
malaria, polio, AIDS-- and many

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.240
of the people who were sick
weren't getting antibiotics,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.870
hadn't previously been
treated with vaccines,

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.890
and weren't offered, let's
say, protease inhibitors

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.930
or antiretrovirals because
there was suspicion

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.430
or ignorance out there.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.106
Now, Jenny McCarthy
would probably

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:07.480
say that's probably
a good thing,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.000
but I don't think many
people would agree with her.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.510
But that is the case
for mental illness.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.820
And so the question is
why is that the case.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.600
And a simple reason
is that it's stigma.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.610
So to put it very succinctly,
mental illnesses--

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.640
which I'll define for you in
a minute-- are nothing new.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.180
They're not like chronic
fatigue syndrome,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.638
they're not like
Ebola, they're not

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:41.184
like AIDS-- things that
are newly emergent.

00:05:41.184 --> 00:05:42.600
These are illnesses
that have been

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.080
present since the beginning
of recorded history,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.460
but they weren't
well understood.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.490
Historically, it was
thought to be related

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.450
to demon possession or
supernatural phenomena,

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.770
or curses of the gods
or something like that.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.030
And then in the
modern era-- beginning

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.010
in the late 18th,
early 19th centuries

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.290
when medical science
sort of began

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.800
to investigate the
pathologic bases of illness--

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.610
there really wasn't
much traction that

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.730
was able to be achieved
with mental disorders.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.990
So there was always this
sort of mystery around it,

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.830
lack of understanding based
on scientific progress,

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.830
and there were no
treatments to speak of.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.670
But all that changed, and
it changed very rapidly.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.650
And the inflection
point was really

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.680
after World War II in the 1950s.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:51.560
But even today, which is 65
years later, the attitudes

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.074
and the prejudices and
the ignorance associated

00:06:56.074 --> 00:06:58.240
historically with mental
illness-- and by extension,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.700
psychiatry-- continues.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:09.912
Whereas if you had a mental
illness prior to 1950s,

00:07:09.912 --> 00:07:11.370
there was nothing
that could really

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.810
be effective in treating you.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.044
You were either doomed
to endure your symptoms

00:07:15.044 --> 00:07:16.960
or, if they were really
bad and incapacitating

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.966
and you didn't have a family
that could support you,

00:07:19.966 --> 00:07:22.740
you likely would spend some
extended period of time,

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.890
if not your whole life,
in a mental institution.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.950
And that's because there just
wasn't anything available.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.210
But now, the biggest barrier
to treatment for people

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.580
is not the lack of know-how
and the lack of treatments.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.750
The biggest barrier
is simply the stigma.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.690
And in this way, mental illness
and psychiatry are unique.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.400
The best way to
illustrate that is

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.560
to tell you something you
probably already know,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.210
which is that there is
a very active, virulent

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.930
anti-psychiatry movement.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.910
Have you ever heard of an
anti-cardiology movement

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.680
or an anti-dermatology
movement, or

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.060
an anti-orthopedics movement?

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.180
There's an
anti-psychiatry movement,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.500
and it actually
began in the 1960s.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.200
So mental illness
and psychiatry has

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.100
been victimized in this way.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.899
To put it in a humorous
way, psychiatry

00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:22.690
is like the Rodney
Dangerfield of medicine.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.072
It doesn't get any respect.

00:08:25.072 --> 00:08:28.130
To put it in a more
sober way, it's

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.940
kind of the stepchild
of medicine.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.580
It's been a late bloomer,
just like a sibling who's

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:41.340
the slowest to develop, who's
the runt of the litter, who's

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.530
the butt of jokes and maybe not
picked first to be on the team

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.380
and has low expectations
associated with it.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.200
But in the long run
they end up being either

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.430
quite as accomplished and
capable as the other siblings,

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.866
or even surpass them
in some respects.

00:08:56.866 --> 00:08:58.740
And that's basically
the story of psychiatry.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.400
Now, you're listening to me
tell this and you're saying,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.400
oh, he's a psychiatrist.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.856
He's going to be sort
of tooting his own horn,

00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:05.730
blowing his own horn,
and being self-serving.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.700
But I have to tell you that I
don't think that's the case.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.587
When I speak publicly
there's a lot of hecklers,

00:09:13.587 --> 00:09:15.170
and there's a lot
of people who have--

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.710
I've just doing some radio
talk shows in San Francisco,

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:25.220
and you get a lot of really
nasty stuff that comes in.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.940
And I doubt if cardiologists or
orthopedists or pediatricians

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.810
would get this.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.300
People might disagree
or something.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:39.140
So there's really strong
feelings and emotions

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.670
associated with this.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.760
So let me just tell you first
what I mean by mental illness,

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.460
because there's a lot
of misconceptions.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.940
Misconceptions abound.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.230
Everybody's mentally
ill a little bit.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.120
Schizophrenia is having
a split personality,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.850
or holding two mutually
contradictory opinions

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.480
at the same time.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.390
Mental illness is really
kind of freedom of expression

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.990
and not succumbing to the
oppressive conventions

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:11.625
of the world.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.240
So, many misconceptions.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.430
What's the difference between a
psychiatrist and psychologist?

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.290
There's many, many
misconceptions,

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.890
which basically have to do
with a lack of understanding

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.290
and awareness.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:31.010
So for our purposes,
mental illness

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.330
is distinct from what
we'll call problems

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.900
of living in the worried well,
which everyone experiences

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.580
in the course of their life
because life is variable,

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.830
challenging, and
oftentimes tough.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:50.670
But the human organism
is built to endure this,

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:55.000
unless they sustain
some injury or illness.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.640
And the brain can get ill
just like every other organ

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.270
of the body.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.400
So for the purpose,
mental illness

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.810
are really defined
set of conditions

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:09.120
that are related
ostensibly to dysfunctions

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.920
of certain parts of the brain
that mediate functions relating

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:20.610
to cognition, perception,
emotion regulation, information

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:28.700
storage, and processing, and can
be defined in a systematic way

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:36.020
and follow a fairly uniform
or predictable course.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.360
So there's clear
boundaries, or definitions,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.901
of what they are,
and there are clear

00:11:39.901 --> 00:11:42.840
boundaries between
what's the variation

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.105
in human behavior and mental
states and what is an illness.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.119
Now, we're not talking
about the worried well.

00:11:53.119 --> 00:11:54.910
We're not talking about
problems of living.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.150
And if you want to
make a distinction

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.930
right off the bat
between psychiatrist

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.680
and the rest of the mental
health care providers--

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:05.510
be they psychologists, social
workers, lay therapists,

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:10.350
pastoral counselors, clergyman,
new age practitioners--

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.330
is that psychiatrists deal
with so-called illnesses

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.200
of the brain manifest through
the mind and behavior,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.760
and the others deal
with the aspects

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.090
that we face in the
course of our lives

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:29.800
that don't evolve or
develop into illnesses.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.590
My purpose in
writing the book was

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.270
that it became
increasingly apparent

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.980
that many people weren't
being treated who should be,

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.250
and there was no good
reason for that other

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.880
than stigma and prejudice.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.130
So I wanted to try
and put this out there

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.420
and set the record
straight about this.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.920
And it seemed that I
was in a good position

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.145
to be able to do
it, because I had

00:13:01.145 --> 00:13:03.830
had some success in terms
of my academic career

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.280
as a researcher.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:10.680
I had gained some prominence
in terms of the profession

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.730
by becoming president of
the American Psychiatric

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.937
Association, and I had 30
years of clinical experience

00:13:17.937 --> 00:13:18.520
on the ground.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.210
And by virtue of my research,
I was sort of at a position

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.390
that I could understand
exactly what was happening

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.140
at the cutting edge
of progress, knowing

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.745
where things were going to go.

00:13:27.745 --> 00:13:30.160
So I felt that I was in a
position to not just offer

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.720
opinion but to really synthesize
these different streams

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.345
of information.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.260
And then there was
also another factor

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.730
that I thought made
me really well-suited

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:47.350
to this kind of task, which
was that just by dint of when

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:51.600
my parents met and
decided to do procreate,

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.870
I was born in a time that
landed me in medical school

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.760
at the time that psychiatry was
going through this inflection

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.650
point.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:09.037
So remember, I told you
that in the 18th century

00:14:09.037 --> 00:14:10.870
there were not specialties
like we have now.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.770
Now we have like 40 different
sub specialties of medicine.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.770
18th century there were
physicians and surgeons,

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.040
there were midwives,
there were bone doctors.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.679
Neurology and psychiatry
differentiated as brain doctors

00:14:22.679 --> 00:14:24.220
in the beginning of
the 19th century.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:40.080
When the other fields, by
virtue of progress and research,

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.170
began to progress
and psychiatry didn't

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.250
after World War II
in the '50s, this

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.350
was the time when
really things begin

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:52.430
to move forward
scientifically speaking.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.030
And that was largely
because of the introduction

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.360
of psychotropic
drugs, which came

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.400
about through pure
serendipity as opposed

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.930
to hypothesis-driven research.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.980
But in any event,
this process which

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:11.260
began the '50s introducing
for the first time in history

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:16.810
treatments that actually worked
in form of medications that

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:21.620
could alleviate severe
illnesses-- not cure

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.780
them, but alleviate
the symptoms--

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.200
and then gained
momentum by virtue

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.630
of the advent of
neuroimaging with MRI

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.290
and PET scanning
technology, and then

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:40.780
the emergence of
molecular genetics,

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.405
and then the burgeoning
of neuroscience

00:15:44.405 --> 00:15:47.030
as a discipline, which took
all the basic neuroscience

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.120
approaches and focused
them on the brain.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.750
Psychiatry was sort
of catapulted forward.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.620
So here I was in medical
school in the 1970s, when

00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:01.130
all this really was converging
and moving the field forward

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:06.640
out of the kind of
intellectual wasteland

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.820
where it had been without
any real understanding,

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:16.300
and beyond what had been
the kind of domination

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.970
of psychiatry by
Freudian theory.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:24.430
And I'll come back
to Freud in a minute.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.000
So in medical
school, I was there

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.270
when this all began to happen.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:34.180
And in the course of
my three-decade career

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:38.570
I was able to see and
participate in the evolution

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:39.220
as it occurred.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.600
So it put me in a position to
not just describe a history

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.040
and not just punctuated with
clinical case histories,

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.505
but also to provide an
autobiographical prospective.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:59.590
Another thing that I thought
was really, I guess, fitting

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.540
was the fact that if
one were to look over

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:08.109
the 200-year trajectory
of psychiatry,

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.970
there has been, in its
effort to try and achieve

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.660
an understanding of the basis of
mental illness and development

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.000
of treatments, a kind
of an oscillation

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.660
between the biologic and the
metaphysical, or psychodynamic.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:31.690
So when psychiatry sort
of emerged, treatment

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.720
of mental illness
began to be taken

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.610
as a medical sort of
mandate, the notion

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.970
was simply providing
a supportive,

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.073
protective environment for
people with mental illness.

00:17:45.073 --> 00:17:48.120
And this was a
psychiatrist, a doctor

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:53.490
named Philippe Pinel, who really
created asylums and unlocked

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.170
the chains of people who
were in mental institutions.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.580
But then in the 19th century
when medicine overall

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:07.530
was beginning a
systematic investigation,

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.500
the process really
consisted mostly

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:14.540
of anatomic pathology--
cadavers, organs,

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:19.930
looking for the pathologic bases
for illness-- a focus on this.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.350
But this was a fruitless effort.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:26.080
And then entered Freud.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.610
And Freud came about in
the late 19th century

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.990
when psychiatry had not
been able to benefit

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:34.090
by the scientific
efforts, and he came up

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:39.590
with this brilliant theory,
this incredible tour de force.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.340
His invention of the
psychoanalytic theory

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.030
was the equivalent
intellectually

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.030
and scientifically speaking
of Einstein's theory

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:54.020
of relativity, or Copernicus
and Galileo's heliocentrism.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:19:00.360
He by dint of his intellectual
genius was able to do this.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.880
And that moved psychiatry
back into the psychodynamic,

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.260
metaphysical, because
there was no tangible bases

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.510
for the illnesses.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.830
The problem is that this
became something which

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:14.115
Freud made two mistakes with.

00:19:14.115 --> 00:19:16.460
One was that he forbid
scientific investigation

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.940
to verify it, so it
remained basically a theory

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.320
that you had to accept on faith.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.710
And then his disciples,
the neo-Freudians

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:31.210
began to expand it way
beyond the scope for which it

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:33.380
genuinely was valid
and could apply,

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.120
which was an understanding
of how the human mind evolves

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.920
over the life cycle
and how it functions.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:43.240
And Freud introduced seminal
concepts that still are valid

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.920
today and have really been
given new life in the context

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.310
of cognitive neuroscience.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.682
He introduced the concept of the
consciousness and unconscious.

00:19:51.682 --> 00:19:53.140
Before that,
everybody thought they

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.723
knew everything that
was in their mind

00:19:54.723 --> 00:19:56.670
and governed their behavior.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.170
He introduced the idea
of somebody evolving

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.115
over stages of development.

00:20:01.115 --> 00:20:03.960
He a little overemphasized
the sexual dimension of that,

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:09.640
but it was still an evolution
of stages across the life cycle.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.990
He introduced the concept
of components of the mind--

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.850
id, ego, super ego.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:19.370
He described defense mechanisms
as a way of which we somehow

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:23.620
cope with our conflicts
and emotional, distressing

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:28.150
feelings-- rationalization,
sublimation, denial,

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.520
projection.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.240
So he was a genius,
but he restricted

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.510
any type of experimentation,
any tampering with the method,

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:41.720
and it became a faith, a
dogma, that really constrained

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.200
all of psychiatry
up until the 1950s

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.950
with the real beginning of
the scientific revolution.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.114
So scientific
revolution-- and I just

00:20:54.114 --> 00:20:56.280
told you it stemmed from
psychopharmacology and then

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.010
imaging and genetics and
neuroscience-- kind of shifted

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.780
the pendulum back towards
the emphasis on the biologic.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:11.033
And there was a chairman
of psychiatry at Yale

00:21:11.033 --> 00:21:13.880
in the 1970s named
Morton Reiser,

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.020
and he ruefully
commented at the time.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.380
He said, for the last
50-some years psychiatry has

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.330
been brainless, and now
we're moving towards a state

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.350
where we're going
to be mindless.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.170
So there's been
this oscillation.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.800
And in terms of my
own sort of evolution,

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.410
the reason why I thought
it was somehow fitting

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.160
was because, being
a good Jewish son,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.840
I guess I was always sort
of feeling some pressure

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.030
to become a doctor, but not
necessarily a psychiatrist.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.954
But then when I went
to college and I

00:21:45.954 --> 00:21:48.120
started reading in my
introductory psychology course

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.980
Freud, I was really struck
by the power of his theory.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.505
In addition to being
a genius he was also

00:21:55.505 --> 00:21:57.530
a brilliant communicator.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:01.270
He wrote extremely well,
and when you read it,

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.630
it becomes just enthralling.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.400
But the same time,
I also was going

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:13.150
to school-- I'm dating
myself-- in the 1960s, which

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:18.670
was a time of a lot of cultural
unrest and experimentation,

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:19.660
and so forth and so on.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:25.770
So I did have some dabbling
in recreational drugs,

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:29.770
and I guess this is like the one
thing I might share in common

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:34.700
with Steven Jobs-- it certainly
isn't his financial success--

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:38.140
is that we both feel that
LSD was a very important sort

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.280
of experience to have.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.170
But in my case I
think it's a little

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.740
different than in Steven's case.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.850
In my case, the impact
that it had on me--

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.420
and this is after
I had read Freud

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:56.980
and I was really just completely
fascinated by his theory--

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.820
was how you could
take a tiny amount

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.910
of a pharmacologic substance--
50 micrograms or so--

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.960
and you could so profoundly
change your state of mind.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:12.420
And if this was the case,
then by some slight error

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.800
in an enzyme or a
cofactor or synthesis

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.150
of a neurotransmitter,
you could change

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:22.870
the way a person's mental
state was very powerfully.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:28.970
So this sort of exemplified
this kind of dichotomy,

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:33.530
which really is the essence of
psychiatry and mental illness,

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:40.420
which is on one hand clearly
reducible to neurobiology

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.820
but at the same time also
reflects the ephemeral

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.770
and the existential.

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:50.920
So I proceeded to
write the book.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.770
And the book-- which I
hope you take a look at,

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:57.870
because I write in a
turgid academic prose,

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.247
but my editor and the
person who helped me

00:24:01.247 --> 00:24:03.330
with the writing, [INAUDIBLE],
sort of beat me up.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:08.640
And I think we've made it really
an interesting and entertaining

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.590
book that flows.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:14.234
The book starts with a story,
and all the stories in the book

00:24:14.234 --> 00:24:15.650
are about patients
that I've seen.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:16.524
And they're all real.

00:24:16.524 --> 00:24:19.080
They're just anonymized.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.380
And it starts with a
story about I got visited

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.742
by a very famous person.

00:24:24.742 --> 00:24:26.700
Obviously they're anonymized
and I'm won't even

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.241
tell you the profession
they were in,

00:24:28.241 --> 00:24:29.450
but it's a household name.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:33.370
And his wife came to see me
about their daughter, who

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.560
was 20 years old.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.140
She had been at an
Ivy League school,

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.170
and she was having difficulty
and they had to pull her out.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.530
And her difficulty was
her grades slipped,

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:47.290
her behavior was
weird, and she really

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.390
wasn't functioning
in the typical way.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.060
And so they brought
her to see me.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.530
But this was like three years
after she had been dropped out

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.580
of school, and in the
interim they had had her

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:03.530
seen by a motivational coach, a
self-esteem therapist, sent her

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:07.520
to a wilderness camp, had her
seen by various new age people.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.930
And then one day
they were scared

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:15.150
by an incident that occurred.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.650
The daughter was
supposed to meet

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:22.126
her mother in Manhattan for
lunch, and she didn't show up.

00:25:22.126 --> 00:25:24.000
And it turns out she
had gotten on the subway

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.143
to go meet her mother, but some
sleazy guy kind of inveigled

00:25:29.143 --> 00:25:30.726
her in getting off
the subway with him

00:25:30.726 --> 00:25:32.327
and going back to his apartment.

00:25:32.327 --> 00:25:34.660
So the mother was freaking
out, and she tracked her down

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.451
via her cellphone and
she called the police

00:25:36.451 --> 00:25:39.900
and they rescued her.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.750
And when she told their
family doctor about this,

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.645
the doctor says, well,
for Christ's sake

00:25:44.645 --> 00:25:47.020
why don't you just take her
to see a real doctor finally?

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.050
So they did.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.430
They came, and we did
a thorough evaluation.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:54.580
And I told them, your
daughter is psychotic,

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.090
and I think the likelihood is
that she has schizophrenia.

00:26:00.857 --> 00:26:02.690
You don't want to give
that news to anybody,

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.730
but they certainly
didn't want to hear.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:09.640
But in any event, they
agreed to hospitalize her.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.590
She was hospitalized.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.660
She was treated.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.250
She got better.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.650
But they still
couldn't accept it.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:19.920
They took her to the
hospital, and after following

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.280
the aftercare treatment
that we had arranged for her

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.950
they took her out of
treatment, and she of course

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.650
relapsed fairly soon.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.290
The good news is
that ultimately,

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:38.490
through another means, was
treated, achieved remission

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.080
again, and ultimately was
able to resume her life,

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.280
get married, and pursue
her interest in art.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.200
But it shows you the degree to
which people will not accept,

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.530
acknowledge this.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:57.750
And I have numerous,
numerous stories about this.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.050
One that I'll refer to
that is not in the book

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.420
but is relevant to
contemporary times

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.460
is that you're probably
familiar with this case that's

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.350
going on in the news
now with Robert Durst.

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:12.100
So Robert Durst--
pretty bizarre guy,

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.720
the scion of a very
wealthy real estate family.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:22.520
And he allegedly killed at
least three people, if not more.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.470
But he's been weird
his whole life.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.550
He's 71.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.690
And then he agreed
to be a subject

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.960
of a biopic documentary.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.460
And not being aware of it,
he was wearing a live mic

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:37.890
when he went to the bathroom
at the end of the last episode,

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:43.090
and he basically confessed
talking to himself.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:47.450
Well, this is
speculation, but I think

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.530
that it's very likely
he was mentally ill

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:55.080
and probably suffered
from a psychotic illness,

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.850
and when he was talking he was
actually talking to voices.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:03.820
But he had gone 70 years without
ever being treated for this

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.060
or evaluated, probably in
part because he was rich

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.570
and considered eccentric.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.780
In this way, it's sort
of like John Du Pont, who

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:15.000
was the character in
"Foxcatcher" who also had

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.370
a similar pattern
of bizarre behavior,

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:20.750
undiagnosed schizophrenia,
and ended up

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:26.280
killing this Olympic athlete
that he had sponsored.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.430
So the book opens with an
explanation of how there still

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:34.150
is the sort of massive denial.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:36.810
Again referring to
Steven Jobs, Steve,

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:42.790
who believed in a lot of
holistic types of practices,

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.970
delayed his conventional
medical treatment in favor

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:50.440
of a holistic fashion, and
that not only didn't work,

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.620
it may have also
allowed for his illness

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:57.460
to progress to a point
that was uncurable.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:03.690
So these attitudes sort
of still prevail and limit

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:07.010
people in terms of
seeking treatment.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:10.420
But the other thing
that the book tries

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.620
to do in order to be
able to dispel the stigma

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.361
and persuade people
that there are

00:29:16.361 --> 00:29:18.402
effective treatments for
people of mental illness

00:29:18.402 --> 00:29:22.530
and that mental illness
is a bona fide set

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.800
of medical conditions
is that it tries

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.570
to fess up about the problems
that have occurred in the past

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:34.850
and why there is such skepticism
or suspicion or hostility

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:37.980
towards psychiatry.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:42.790
It's true psychiatry did
some good some bad things.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.880
We know about the
fact that first

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.180
of all, mental
institutions-- asylums--

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.150
weren't necessarily
the best places.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:53.080
But beyond that,
there were treatments

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.990
that were either
ineffective or in some cases

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:58.410
seeming in retrospect
to have been barbaric.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.570
The first Nobel
Prize that was ever

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.570
given for a treatment
for mental illness

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.890
or for anything
related to psychiatry

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.990
was given to an
Austrian psychiatrist

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.140
for malaria therapy.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.670
So malaria therapy was
injecting the blood

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:20.986
of people who had malaria
into mental patients.

00:30:20.986 --> 00:30:22.360
And the reason
that that was done

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.060
was that the
doctor-- and this was

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:31.630
circa 1920-- had observed that
when patients in his asylum

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:36.510
became febrile, their
symptoms seemed to improve.

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.620
And he thought that
fever must have

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.980
some kind of therapeutic
effect, so he

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.600
thought to induce fever
by injecting various types

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.810
of infectious agents.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.610
So first he started
with strep, and then

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:51.450
the tubercular bacilliaie.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:52.860
But then he tried malaria.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.880
Why malaria?

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.510
Because antibiotics
hadn't been developed yet.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.710
There was nothing
for tuberculosis,

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:00.540
but for malaria
there was quinine.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.880
So can infect him
with malaria and get

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.830
the therapeutic
benefit, if it had that,

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.850
for their mental problems,
but he could also

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:14.070
control their somatic
symptoms with quinine.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:15.500
And he got a Nobel
Prize for that.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.320
Well, it turned out
that he was right.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:22.480
But only partially, because
what that did-- the fever caused

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:27.080
by the malaria-- was
to kill spirochetes

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.724
in the brain of people
who had tertiary syphilis.

00:31:29.724 --> 00:31:31.390
Because mental
institutions at the time,

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.360
in addition to people with
schizophrenia and bipolar

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.800
disorder, had a
lot of people that

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.400
had syphilis that had
progressed to enter the brain

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.250
and produce the tertiary
stage and produce symptoms

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:44.170
which look like psychosis.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:48.300
And the next Nobel Prize
that was given for psychiatry

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.140
was to the Portuguese
neurologist Moniz

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:58.300
for developing the prefrontal
leucotomy-- lobotomies.

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:03.970
This sounds pretty gruesome,
and it is in retrospect.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:10.420
But in defense of our profession
and these people, at the time--

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:14.020
and this is sort of like
trying to avoid us being guilty

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.280
of presenteeism, your
looking at the past

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:21.260
through the lens of
2015-- the alternative

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:26.040
was the abysmal
conditions of the asylum

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:30.106
and a life of potentially
continuing symptoms.

00:32:30.106 --> 00:32:31.480
So this shows you
the desperation

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.290
that people were going to.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:36.020
But then Freud
again, although he

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:41.030
did have this brilliant
theory, his disciples

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.590
extended it and
over-applied it in ways

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:48.070
that added to the ignominy
of the profession.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:52.510
And this brings us to the point
where the neo-Freudians-- so

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:55.890
if anybody wants to know,
what is psychoanalytic theory

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.600
relevant to?

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.050
It's relevant to you and me and
everyone else that ostensibly

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:03.775
is free of a mental illness.

00:33:03.775 --> 00:33:06.010
It is relevant to
understanding how

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:10.220
our psychological makeup and
our identity and personality

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.820
developed.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.980
And psychoanalysis is useful
for people for self-exploration,

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:20.675
or for finding out how you can
avoid certain conflicts that

00:33:20.675 --> 00:33:23.050
may occur in your life--
whether it's you don't get along

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:26.700
with your boss or you have
no gratifying romantic

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.880
relationships or you're engaging
in self-defeating behavior,

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.190
so forth-- but it's not going
to do anything for somebody

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.160
who has schizophrenia.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.910
It's not going to do
anything for somebody

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:39.000
who has bipolar
disorder or depression

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.070
or obsessive compulsive
disorder or panic

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:45.400
disorder or an eating disorder
or an addiction or autism

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.930
or dementia.

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.190
But the neo-Freudians
tried to apply it

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:55.590
to this, and as a
result who gets blamed?

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:58.160
The mother.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.750
Frieda Fromm- Reichmann
who was the psychiatrist

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:06.320
in the well-known book "I Never
Promised You a Rose Garden"

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.440
coined the term
"schizophrenogenic mother,"

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.650
because mothers who
engage in some kind

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:16.010
of confusing, contradictory,
overly critical behavior

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.760
can induce this.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.110
When autism was finally
described in 1943

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:24.050
they coined the term
"refrigerator mother"

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.464
as the basis for autism.

00:34:26.464 --> 00:34:28.380
And then there is, of
course, the other things

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.250
such as penis envy and
the oedipal complex

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:32.780
and all of these things.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:37.600
So this sort of added
to the suspicion

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:43.710
and querulousness that
people had about psychiatry.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.009
So you had illnesses
that nothing could work,

00:34:46.009 --> 00:34:47.550
and then you had
doctors that came up

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:49.969
with these sort of fanciful
theories and treatments

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:54.050
that were either
ineffective or harmful.

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:59.880
And this created a legacy
which bore, or gave rise to,

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:07.300
the bad reputation and the
kind of notorious identity

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.860
of the profession.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:14.060
But then as I've said, in
the '50s it begin to change,

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.160
first serendipitously
and then as a result

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.340
of these developments
in the life

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.040
sciences and
biomedical research.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.550
And the change has been
extraordinary to the point

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:29.340
that now we have effective
treatments for most things.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.840
Now, people say that
psychiatry is still

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:38.930
kind of an indolent,
ineffective profession,

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:42.680
but that's just a
bogus criticism.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.910
It's just not true.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.340
If you look at conditions
in, let's say, neurology,

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:55.872
our sibling discipline, three of
the major diseases-- they treat

00:35:55.872 --> 00:35:57.580
Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease,

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.920
Huntington's
disease-- are diseases

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.860
that there's an extensive
knowledge of the neurobiology.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.390
With Huntington's we even
have the gene that causes it.

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:07.360
We've had it for
over two decades.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.200
There's no treatment for it.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.757
There's no effective treatment.

00:36:10.757 --> 00:36:13.340
There's not been an innovation
in the treatment of Parkinson's

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.290
disease since L-DOPA.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.450
Now, why is that?

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:21.830
So all this time
that psychiatry was

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:25.960
making these missteps and other
fields-- at least neurology--

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.690
was making progress--
but limited progress

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:35.540
with no treatments-- it wasn't
because they were slackers

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.340
or weren't smarter.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.965
It wasn't the dumbest
kids in the class

00:36:38.965 --> 00:36:41.890
were going into psychiatry.

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:48.480
The brain turns out to be a much
tougher organ to understand,

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.800
and the illnesses that affect
it much more complicated

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.780
to develop treatments for.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.380
If you look at
the brain compared

00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:00.905
to the heart, the lungs,
kidneys, there's no comparison.

00:37:00.905 --> 00:37:04.520
The brain's like a pump,
the kidneys are a filter,

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:13.090
your stomach is a tube with
porous holes for absorption.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:16.150
The brain has over
100 billion neurons.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:19.250
30 trillion connections.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.040
Each part of the brain
functions in a distinct way

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.320
from other parts of the brain.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.950
It's unfathomably complex.

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:32.510
And the human brain is the
most highly-evolved structure

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:36.390
in the entire universe
in terms of organisms,

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:39.580
and the functions of the
brain that psychiatry attends

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.390
to for mental illness are
the most highly involved

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:45.190
in the entire animal kingdom.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.474
So it's taken a long
time to really begin

00:37:47.474 --> 00:37:49.140
to get traction on
that, and a lot of it

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.880
had to do with the availability
of the adequate technology

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.860
to do so.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:38:00.320
So I guess just to
try and sum up, I

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.580
would say there are other
things that psychiatry

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.460
has done that have
also contributed

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:10.715
to the ignominy that mental
illness and psychiatry faces.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.950
The unfortunate inclusion
of homosexuality

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:21.000
as a mental disorder is one.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.150
Another was the lack
of inclusion of PTSD

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:31.220
until after Vietnam,
really, was another.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:36.810
But there's been a purposeful
and a scientifically-driven

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:40.120
effort to correct these.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:45.450
And the point this is that
whatever may have gone before,

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.120
which we can try and
understand and determine

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:54.370
how problematic it is or was,
that's not the reality now.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:58.410
But it's the attitudes
and the prejudices

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:02.980
that persist which cloud
the public's understanding

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.970
and deter people from
seeking treatment.

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:10.280
And so the thing that I
want people to take away

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.250
from this book and that I
would like you to understand

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:18.040
is that there's no
reason that people

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.500
who suffer from conditions
should continue to.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.650
It's simply a matter of
investing the time and money

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.750
that it takes to at least
have a consultation.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:31.666
And there are treatments
that are effective.

00:39:31.666 --> 00:39:34.040
And by treatments I'm not just
talking about medications.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.450
I'm talking about various
types of psychotherapies

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:40.270
or psychosocial
treatments, as well.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:43.612
But they're
scientifically-driven in terms

00:39:43.612 --> 00:39:45.570
of determining their
efficacy and their safety.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:52.510
So for you, for your
family, for your friends,

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:55.950
you should not be
inhibited by expressing

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:59.900
that you have nothing to
lose by at least exploring

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.860
whether there may be
a need for treatment.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.850
The other thing is
that since so much

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:08.550
of the way any health care
service can be provided

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:12.380
is influenced by public
awareness and government

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:19.100
policy, the media and the
government need to be moved.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.290
Left to their own
devices they're

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:22.730
not doing the right thing.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:29.380
The media misrepresents,
sensationalizes, distorts.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.450
And the government's policies
for biomedical research funding

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:37.980
and for providing health care
financing for mental health

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:42.030
care services, as opposed to
medical or surgical services,

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:45.329
is really not
consistent with what

00:40:45.329 --> 00:40:47.120
the needs of people
with mental illness are

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.160
and what the whole
epidemiology is.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:50.660
Just to give you
one last statistic,

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:54.620
The World Bank does a study
every several years measuring

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.740
the global burden of disease.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.540
And they quantify this in
the context of a metric

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:04.410
they call the Disability
Associated Life Year, or DALY.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:14.880
And if you look at youth 14 to
45, 4 of the top 10 conditions

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.740
are mental disorders.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.860
It's predicted that
by 2030 depression

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:24.420
will be the most expensive
condition in the world,

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:29.000
so there's good reason for the
government to pay attention

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
to this public health issue.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.120
And I think since left
to their own devices

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.200
they won't, to whatever
degree people who

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:43.160
have their awareness raised or
motivated, can help to do that.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:48.580
And again, this goes back to
why I wanted to write the book.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.130
When I tell people
about it I say,

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:54.350
well, it was sort of
a quixotic moment.

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:56.840
But we'll see if the
book gets any attention

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.400
and if it has any
impact on the world.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:03.454
So if we have some time, I'd be
happy to answer any questions.

00:42:03.454 --> 00:42:04.870
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned some parts

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:07.710
of the body that are relatively
easier to treat than the brain.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:10.100
So, knee surgery is
relatively straightforward,

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.980
hip surgery relatively
straightforward.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.660
And the physicians who do
those types of treatments

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:18.594
maybe don't take the same kind
of flack that psychiatrists do.

00:42:18.594 --> 00:42:21.010
I started to think about low
back pain as something that's

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:24.150
really common, just like
everybody has a mental illness,

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:26.710
everybody gets low back pain
at some point in their life.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:31.770
And often, people will go to
a holistic type of practice,

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:33.740
or they'll go do various
physical therapies,

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.500
chiropractor.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.760
But the extreme example would
be going to get back surgery,

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.760
kind of like the extreme
in psychology would be,

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.380
go see a psychiatrist.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.570
And I think part of
the rap with back pain

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:46.920
is they say back
surgery, fusions,

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.580
things like that are
quite ineffective-- maybe

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.890
30% chance of success,
and they often

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:55.310
can lead to problems
down the line.

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:58.190
Would you say that maybe part of
the perception with psychiatry

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:01.067
is you only hear about those
cases where it doesn't work,

00:43:01.067 --> 00:43:02.150
or when mistakes are made?

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:04.530
You don't hear the
success stories.

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:07.420
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN: I
think that's very true.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.930
First of all, people
don't want to disclose,

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:12.350
even if they've had
a good experience.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:14.690
They're more inclined
to lay blame.

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:19.320
So Katharine Graham, the former
publisher of The Washington

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.910
Post, had a several decade
long grudge against psychiatry.

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:23.580
Why?

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.890
Because her husband, who had
manic depressive illness,

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:28.220
was treated with psychoanalysis,
never given lithium,

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.390
and committed suicide.

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:32.230
That was a widely-known case.

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:35.610
But the success, such as the
famous person I told you about,

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:41.170
whose daughter was averted
from a lifelong disability--

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:43.695
if I call them and ask them,
would you talk at a benefit,

00:43:43.695 --> 00:43:47.400
or would you be a
public spokesperson, no.

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.030
Don't want to hear about that.

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:54.440
That gets to the
kind of stigma thing.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.640
Many patients won't use
their health insurance,

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.840
because they don't want
to be on the record.

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.520
Many patients-- and this
is particularly with

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.800
the VIP's-- they don't want to
come see me or see our doctors

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.192
in the hospital in the clinic.

00:44:07.192 --> 00:44:08.650
They want to go to
a private office

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:11.150
on Park Avenue or
Central Park West

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:15.070
so they don't have to walk into
something that's psychiatry.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:17.730
So this is a very
common phenomena.

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:18.796
It's changing.

00:44:18.796 --> 00:44:20.670
And it's actually better
in the United States

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:21.590
than any part of the world.

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:22.131
I mean, Asia?

00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:23.960
Forget it.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.624
But it's still
going very slowly.

00:44:27.624 --> 00:44:30.040
AUDIENCE: I wanted to press a
little bit on your assertion

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.500
that it's all about stigma--
that that's the principle

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.890
barrier-- because
it seems like access

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:37.950
is enormously challenging.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.610
If you look at the
prevalence of mental illness

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:42.890
amongst the homeless or
amongst prison populations,

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:44.770
it's way out of
proportion with where

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:49.620
it is in other aspects
of the population.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.980
Can you say that stigma is
stronger, say in the US,

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:57.142
than the access barriers and
just availability of treatment?

00:44:57.142 --> 00:44:59.100
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN: I
completely agree with you.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.090
Whether it's lack
of access or stigma,

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:06.210
they're both major
contributors to it.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.610
But the lack of
access problem is

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:17.430
that there's not sufficient
providers and services

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:20.450
to take care of everybody
or to take care of everybody

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:22.300
in an affordable way.

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:27.290
And as a result, people that
might be seeking treatment

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:30.150
may not have an easy
time finding it.

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:35.120
If they pursue it, though,
most people should be able to.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.600
The problem is-- and this is
a problem that contributes

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.380
to the homeless, as well as the
increasing numbers of people

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.670
with mental illness who are
in the criminal justice,

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:47.870
in the prison, system-- that
many people-- and this is

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:50.480
particularly for the
psychotic disorders,

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.620
or mood disorders
also-- who have

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:56.780
mental illnesses don't
think they're sick,

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:59.000
and they don't want treatment.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.530
And our society is built
on personal autonomy,

00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:04.510
individual liberty,
self-determination,

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:07.266
and we're very reluctant
to sort of impose something

00:46:07.266 --> 00:46:09.140
on somebody against
their will unless they're

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.010
overtly dangerous.

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:17.010
So there's many people who,
even if they had ready access,

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:19.510
wouldn't seek treatment,
and their families

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:23.180
can't find a way
to persuade or even

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.460
coerce them into
treatment, and doctors

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.584
can't impose it unilaterally.

00:46:28.584 --> 00:46:29.750
But you're absolutely right.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:31.790
And one of the other
things that I think

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:35.080
is really problematic with
our health financing has

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:39.020
led to a situation where
psychiatrists have the lowest

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:42.260
percentage of accepting
insurance as opposed

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:44.630
to paying out-of-pocket.

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:49.160
And that's because of the
inequity of the reimbursements.

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:52.490
Patrick Kennedy and Senator
Edward Kennedy's Mental Health

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:55.530
Parity Act has begun to
sort of address that.

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:57.900
But this has been
passed as legislation

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:01.050
and has not been enforced yet,
so the insurance companies are

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:03.830
still doing what they
can get away with.

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:05.990
AUDIENCE: Piggybacking
on access,

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:10.060
you mentioned-- it's been my
experience that psychologists

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.700
and psychiatrists have a
much lower rate of accepting

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:13.700
insurance.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:18.030
And you made the distinction
between psychologists

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:21.210
and psychiatrists and
counselors that psychiatrists

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:25.220
are primarily focused
on defined illnesses.

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:28.740
But it's been my
experience that there

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:33.090
are a lot of not just
psychologists but counselors

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:37.970
or whatever that try to treat
more severe mental illness--

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:41.190
maybe not schizophrenia,
but certainly depression

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:46.190
or bipolar disorder--
and that if I came in

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:49.411
with a twisted ankle
and I sought treatment.

00:47:49.411 --> 00:47:51.910
Pretty quickly I could figure
out, oh, you go to the doctor.

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:53.920
And the first doctor I
went to would probably

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.360
be able to help me.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:01.860
That is certainly not the case
as much with mental illness.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.880
So I guess my question is,
what are your thoughts on how

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.815
to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:05.815 --> 00:48:07.940
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN: That's
part of the confusion of,

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.580
OK, let's say you think
that you may have something

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:13.150
that needs to be taken care of.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:16.180
Who do I see, and how
do I know who to go to?

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.640
And then there's the
access and the cost issue.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.357
My rule of thumb is
that's psychiatrists

00:48:21.357 --> 00:48:22.440
don't need to do anything.

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.660
You don't necessarily
need to pay a psychiatrist

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:27.230
to see you once or twice
a week for 45 minutes

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:29.460
to talk about your
inability to form

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.760
good romantic relationships
or why you can't get along

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.820
with authority figures.

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.974
Good, competent
therapists can do that.

00:48:37.974 --> 00:48:40.140
But if you want to go to a
psychiatrist to make sure

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:43.090
there's nothing more serious
going on than just so

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:45.920
that, you can start
with a psychiatrist.

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.300
And what's evolving--
and this is

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:51.990
being driven by really economic
pressure, what insurance

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:58.720
benefits are willing to pay--
is that the psychiatrist

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.564
will make use of
physician extenders,

00:49:01.564 --> 00:49:03.230
just like if you twist
your ankle and yo

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.960
go to an orthopedist.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.751
They take an x-ray.

00:49:04.751 --> 00:49:05.560
Maybe you broke it.

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.120
They set a cast.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.880
But then they'll send
you a physical therapist.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.090
Psychiatrists can
see you, say, OK, I

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:16.330
don't think that you have
personality disorder.

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:18.580
I don't think you have
a mood disorder that

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.780
requires treatment, but I think
psychotherapy would be good.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.430
You can see me for it,
if he or she practices,

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:30.660
or I can ask you to see a social
worker or a psychologist that

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.850
would be perfectly
capable of seeing you.

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:35.720
There's going to be more
of this team-based approach

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:41.570
and this delegation of various
aspects of the treatment

00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:43.800
recommendations.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.220
The problem is this
is all coming so slow.

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.530
It's just not taken seriously.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:51.071
Part of it is our government is
dysfunctional, and part of it

00:49:51.071 --> 00:49:53.910
is because this hasn't risen to
a sufficient level of urgency.

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:56.710
Let me just give
you one example.

00:49:56.710 --> 00:50:00.070
It takes a lot to mobilize
a government in a country.

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:03.745
The one thing that did
it, amazingly, was AIDS.

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:09.387
When I was in training
in the late '70s

00:50:09.387 --> 00:50:11.470
we would see people coming
into the emergency room

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:15.660
with these horrible infections,
opportunistic infections.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.620
There was no clear cause for it.

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:20.540
There was no sort
of etiologic agent.

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:25.400
They had low blood counts
and these roaring infections.

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.570
But the gay community, the
entertainment community,

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:32.240
rose up, and they
lobbied out-of-the-box

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.630
for the government
to jump on this.

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.190
And they poured money.

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:40.840
It was like a Manhattan
Project for this condition.

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:44.110
And within six years they
had identified the virus.

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:47.930
So it went from AIDS-- Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome--

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:51.550
to HIV, Human
Immunodeficiency Virus.

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:54.050
And then within
another six years

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:58.990
they had protease inhibitors,
antiretroviral therapies--

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:02.300
and then the advent of
triple therapy, which

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:05.150
took a mysterious,
lethal disorder

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:08.160
and made it into a chronic
illness like hypertension

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.330
or diabetes that
could be managed.

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:15.600
So mental illness doesn't
have that kind of thing, OK?

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:18.570
So for depression, for
bipolar, for schizophrenia,

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:22.140
for anxiety disorders,
maybe you can't

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.610
mobilize that kind of thing.

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:28.240
But why haven't we
done this with PTSD?

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.910
I mean, if there's
one thing that you

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:32.800
think the country should
rally around-- particularly

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.230
since now more people die
by suicide in the military

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:41.740
than by enemy combatants, and
the frequency of PTSD injuries

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:46.900
is more than by any
type of somatic injury.

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:49.610
It's shameful.

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:54.450
So when I got into this
APA leadership thing

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:57.460
I spent two years in
Washington, and it

00:51:57.460 --> 00:52:01.940
is a very cynical
business, the business

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.430
of politics and government.

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:07.030
And it's tough to change.

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:10.690
But this is really
what it takes.

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:14.310
And this is-- again, alluding
to my quixotic effort

00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:18.850
to write this book-- a need to
try and really raise awareness,

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:20.640
speak out, try and
mobilize, because these

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.560
are tractable problems.

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:24.310
AUDIENCE: I'm trying
to better understand.

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:27.230
You made a distinction, I think,
between psychosis and neurosis,

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:30.140
although you didn't
identify it as such.

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.485
And you kind of say
psychiatry is about psychosis.

00:52:33.485 --> 00:52:35.360
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN: No,
no, no, not psychosis.

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.410
Mental illness.

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:38.840
Psychosis and neurosis
is a distinction

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.970
that really hearkens back
to the earlier nomenclature

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:43.520
in Freudian theory.

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.770
I was equating
neurosis in the sense

00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:49.750
with the kind of problems
of living that occur,

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:52.150
and mental illness
as a defined set

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:55.930
of conditions which
includes psychosis but isn't

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:58.410
exclusively psychosis.

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:02.880
AUDIENCE: And what distinguishes
PTSD from other form-- PTSD

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.340
is based on an experience--
not a childhood experience,

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:08.580
an adult experience-- that
shapes your interaction

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:09.800
with the environment.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:14.550
How is this different
than other experiences,

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:17.570
and why do you find
this is mental illness

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:21.880
and other things are just for
psychologists to take care of?

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.960
This is confusing to me.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.405
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN: Well, forget
about who takes care of them.

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:29.780
I would think
anybody who can get

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:31.680
them better should take care.

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.470
But why is PTSD an illness?

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:39.170
Well, somebody undergoes
some kind of experience.

00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:42.960
It's usually a single,
traumatic event,

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.190
but it can be a series
of traumatic events--

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:51.120
whether it's an earthquake, a
fire, a mugging, a firefight

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.980
in Afghanistan or
in IED explosion--

00:53:54.980 --> 00:54:01.080
and prior to that they were
ostensibly not ill, or healthy.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.700
And subsequent to
that they begin

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:11.040
to develop a variety of mental
aberrations and behaviors--

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:17.280
anxiety, hypervigilance,
sleeplessness, irritability,

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:20.280
inability to concentrate.

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:24.410
It sometimes leads them to
do things like abuse alcohol

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:27.670
or other medications,
to self-medicate, or get

00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:29.760
into violent altercations.

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:33.620
And this doesn't just go
away like you bump your knee

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:36.810
and after a few days
the pain subsides.

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:38.620
This persists.

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:42.900
So here you have environmental
or experiential event

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:48.120
which results in some enduring
pattern of mental distress

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.870
and behavioral dysfunction.

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:51.910
So what we call that an illness.

00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:54.750
As to who should
treat it, I think

00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:57.590
right now our
treatments are very

00:54:57.590 --> 00:54:59.780
limited in terms of what works.

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:04.440
And the problem there is that
sufficient attention-- I mean,

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:06.220
PTSD is not a new condition.

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:09.530
It's been around since
the history of warfare,

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:12.344
but we didn't take it
seriously until after Vietnam.

00:55:12.344 --> 00:55:13.760
But there wasn't
an all-out effort

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.430
to try and understand, what is
the pathophysiology of this?

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:19.170
How does an experience
affect the brain

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:22.729
so that you're
thereafter different?

00:55:22.729 --> 00:55:25.270
If it turns out that the best
way to treat somebody like that

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:29.300
is through horseback riding
or pet therapy or exercise

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:37.130
or meditation or psychotherapy
or aversion conditioning, fine.

00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:41.184
But if it turns out that it's
medication, that's fine too.

00:55:41.184 --> 00:55:43.350
We just have to understand
what it is that's needed.

00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:46.180
But I would consider
it an illness

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.866
beyond a shadow of doubt.

00:55:48.866 --> 00:55:50.490
AUDIENCE: I remember
a couple years ago

00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:53.080
we had a lot of
unfortunate incidents--

00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:56.230
tragedies-- in America
with school shootings.

00:55:56.230 --> 00:56:00.400
And I remember the most
poignant thing that

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.690
came for me for
that was a mother

00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:04.280
wrote an article
or story about how

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.880
she had three
children-- two of which

00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:11.100
were healthy, normal-- but one
was very violent and, I guess,

00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:13.100
obviously mentally
ill and would have

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:17.600
episodes that would go grab
a knife maybe in the kitchen.

00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:22.760
No crime yet, but she knew
and felt something was coming.

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:26.160
And law enforcement says to her,
he hasn't done anything yet.

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.470
We can't do anything for you.

00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:29.250
You can just send him
to the institution

00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:30.750
and see what happens.

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:33.020
Often I think parents
take the blame.

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:36.050
How could you not know your
kid was going to do this?

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:39.940
And she knows, but didn't
have an outlet or an option.

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:41.590
And it's tragic.

00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:44.900
Do you have any hope for
America, for the world,

00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:49.240
for how that can get better?

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:52.110
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN: So that was,
"I am Adam Lanza's Mother."

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:52.900
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:55.190
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN: This was
after the Newtown tragedy,

00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:57.290
where Adam Lanza
killed these kids.

00:56:57.290 --> 00:57:01.670
And his mother, I think, who was
in Idaho, wrote this article.

00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:06.150
So it really relates to how
do you deal with a situation

00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:10.220
where there's a family member
or friend whatever who's

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:14.620
sick, potentially violent,
doesn't want treatment,

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:19.630
and you can't force them
to receive treatment.

00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:23.760
And the majority of
these civilian massacres

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:26.830
that have occurred-- whether
it's when congressman Gabby

00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:30.265
Giffords was shot, whether
it was in rural Colorado,

00:57:30.265 --> 00:57:32.640
whether it was the Virginia
Tech shooting, whether it was

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:37.760
the Santa Barbara killing--
are not entirely-- sometimes

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.920
you have ideological
zealots, but these

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:44.210
are predominately individuals
with mental illness

00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:46.630
who are untreated.

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:49.760
So Robert Durst--
I'm suggesting he

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.410
may be like that, although he
didn't do a civilian massacre.

00:57:52.410 --> 00:57:54.400
He just killed one
people individually

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.160
over a period of time.

00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.990
I was doing a reading at
a bookstore last night,

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:01.710
and afterwards
when I was signing

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:05.952
books a woman came up to me
and told me she was Iranian.

00:58:05.952 --> 00:58:06.910
Lives in San Francisco.

00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:08.480
And says, I wonder
if you could help me.

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.605
I said, what's the problem?

00:58:09.605 --> 00:58:13.410
She says, I have a brother
who has schizophrenia.

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:15.100
He's in Iran.

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:19.040
And he killed my mother,
and he's now in prison.

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.000
Is there something I can do?

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.800
So you see this intrafamily
violence all the time.

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:29.140
These people don't know
what they're doing.

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:31.310
But there's no
means to treat them.

00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:34.730
When I was at University
of North Carolina

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:37.400
there was a law student
who in his first year

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:40.580
became psychotic, had a first
episode of schizophrenia.

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:41.675
And we hospitalized him.

00:58:41.675 --> 00:58:42.300
He was treated.

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:43.255
He got better.

00:58:43.255 --> 00:58:44.826
The symptom remission
was very high,

00:58:44.826 --> 00:58:46.700
particularly at the
beginning of the illness.

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:48.800
Went home for the summer.

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:49.800
Stopped his medication.

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.800
Came back to school.

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:54.100
Unfortunately the
law school and we

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:56.460
didn't sort of
identify and require

00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:59.710
him to resume treatment--
not that we could have,

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:01.870
at least not if he
didn't want it anyway.

00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:05.720
And three months
later he walks down

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:09.290
the main street of Chapel
Hill and he kills two people--

00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:11.200
two complete
strangers-- because he

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:15.650
was hallucinating about what
they were thinking and saying

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:17.660
about him.

00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:20.470
He was found not guilty
by reason of insanity,

00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:22.940
remanded to a state
mental hospital,

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:26.470
and I interviewed
him because he had

00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:28.475
wanted to write a book
about this experience.

00:59:28.475 --> 00:59:30.690
His name is Wendell Williamson.

00:59:30.690 --> 00:59:34.910
And he was completely
lucid, had complete insight

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:37.500
into what was happening.

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.200
He said, I had no idea.

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:44.290
The internal reality of my
delusions and hallucinations

00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:49.670
were as vivid as everything
that's in this room around us.

00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:53.015
But this is something
that goes beyond science,

00:59:53.015 --> 00:59:53.890
goes beyond medicine.

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:56.420
This is a social policy issue.

00:59:56.420 --> 01:00:02.760
And if I say this
in a large audience,

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:07.950
I get a lot of angry comments
and sometimes even hate mail.

01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:11.680
If you suggest the idea
of imposing treatment

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.540
on people when
they don't want it,

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:16.740
there's a strong
reaction to that.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:20.040
And it's because in the
past treatments were imposed

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:26.650
on people, either
unjustifiably or the treatments

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:28.530
were ineffective.

01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:30.000
But this is the dilemma.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.980
But I advocate
what I call sort of

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:34.920
maternalistic or
paternalistic medicine,

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.390
that if people are making
judgments that are not--

01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:39.400
I mean, if you're a
Christian Scientist

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.120
and you don't want treatment
for your cancer or your heart

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:46.052
disease and you want
to die, that's fine.

01:00:46.052 --> 01:00:47.760
But mental illness is
a little different.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.354
It's like if you
have tuberculosis

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:50.770
and you don't want
to get treated,

01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:53.050
and you're a contagion.

01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:55.260
Or AIDS.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:58.750
So there's some
social ramifications

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:02.030
to giving people-- to
emphasize elevating

01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:06.180
the rights of the individual
over the welfare of society,

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.850
and that's above my pay grade.

01:01:10.389 --> 01:01:11.430
Thank you for the answer.

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:13.829
And I think we're at time,
but there's books in the back.

01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:14.870
Thank you, Dr. Lieberman.

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:17.920
[APPLAUSE]
