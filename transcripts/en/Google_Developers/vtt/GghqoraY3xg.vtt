00:00:02.957 --> 00:00:04.040
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Hi there.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.380
This is Magnus Hyttsten
for The Developer Show.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.930
We're at the
TensorFlow Dev Summit.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.040
And next to me, I have Raz.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.540
You talked about something
new in TensorFlow, the TFMA,

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.350
TensorFlow Model Analysis.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.330
Can you tell me what that is?

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.940
RAZ MATHIAS: Well, it's a
new component that we just

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.590
launched yesterday.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.740
We've been using it
internally for a while.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.470
It allows us to
basically measure

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.810
the performance of our
models in a sliced fashion.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.080
And it runs over a
distributed infrastructure.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.110
So it's not just a
sample kind of thing.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.490
And it lets us take
a large population

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.640
and zoom in, dimension
by dimension,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.750
and really understand what the
failure modes of our models

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.250
are.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.670
I think that that's something
that we're starting to do.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.836
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So that
sounds like a lot of boxes,

00:00:56.836 --> 00:00:58.930
a lot of training episodes.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.971
Is that something I can use?

00:01:00.971 --> 00:01:01.970
RAZ MATHIAS: Absolutely.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.709
I'm glad you asked
that question.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.560
So if you go to the
GitHub, all you have to do

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.250
is Git clone, the TensorFlow
slash model dash analysis

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.720
repository.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.900
There's an example there
that I talked about today,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.670
where you can run end
to end from a data set

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.890
through TensorFlow
transform, through training,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.860
through serving,
evaluation, all locally.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.620
So you can play
with these things.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.120
You can experiment with them.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.030
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: And
this is part of the TFX,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.977
the TensorFlow extended
Framework, correct?

00:01:33.977 --> 00:01:35.060
RAZ MATHIAS: It is indeed.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.309
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So the
question is, how do developers

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:38.610
get involved in this?

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.730
RAZ MATHIAS: Well,
you go to GitHub.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.800
You go to the TensorFlow
repository slash model dash

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.870
analysis.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.880
You Git clone the
whole thing locally.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.780
You run the scripts.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.980
You follow the code lab.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.180
You modify things.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.750
You have fun.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.730
You give us feedback.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.855
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Excellent.

00:01:52.855 --> 00:01:56.630
So go out there, do some serious
model analysis with TFMA.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm Magnus Hyttsten
for The Developer Show.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.895
We're at the TensorFlow
Dev Summit here with Raz.

00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:04.822
