00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.490
Time travel to the past is basically impossible
without breaking some laws of physics and

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.789
acquiring plutonium from some Libyans.

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:10.160
But time travel to the future is easy, we’re
all doing it right now.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.990
So why does time go forward and not back?

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.390
The idea that time only flows in one direction
is called the Arrow of Time.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.580
But odd as it sounds, there’s nothing in
the equations that describes the laws of physics

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.460
that says it has to be this way.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.930
The equations CAN tell you what will happen
in the future or what took place in the past

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.040
based on what’s going on in the present,
but they don’t explicitly state that time

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.640
must go from past to present to future.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.270
The math works just as well going in either
direction.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.710
The one thing that seems to keep driving this
time bus to futuretown is the second law of

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.640
thermodynamics, which states that entropy
must always increase.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.989
Things must go from order to chaos; heat must
disperse from hot bodies to colder ones.

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.850
It’s this increase in entropy that keeps
the ordered past behind us and the increasingly

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.600
messy future ahead.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.929
But there seems to be a loophole in the second
law of thermodynamics, and scientists recently

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:07.520
exploited it to turn entropy on its ear.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.469
Apparently the law doesn’t apply to correlated
particles, which are like entangled particles

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:13.859
with less strong of a connection.

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:19.219
When researchers observed a hot hydrogen nucleus
that was next to a cooler carbon nucleus inside

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:25.590
a trichloromethane molecule, the nuclei behaved
as expected and heat flowed from the HOT hydrogen

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.930
to the COOL carbon.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.829
But when they tried the same thing with correlated
hydrogen and carbon nuclei, the opposite happened.

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:40.409
The hydrogen got even hotter while the carbon
chilled even more.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.740
The scientists went on to make the bold claim
that this experiment shows the reversal of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.439
the Arrow of Time, but even if that’s indeed
what’s happening it looks like it only applies

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.030
under very specific circumstances on an atomic
scale.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.810
So, not that I’m a physicist or anything,
but did you?

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.889
Does that mean time is suddenly running backwards
or is there something else at play here?

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:06.259
Needed is research more.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.129
I wouldn’t predict a future where broken
coffee mugs spontaneously reform or rooms

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.159
tidy themselves just yet.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.010

If you haven’t seen them all, check out
this video on how your perception of time

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.129
can alter if you speak another language.

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.959
In the distant future when the entropy is
at its maximum, there will be no arrow of

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.519
time because nothing will be able to change.

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.120
Thanks a lot for watching seeker!
