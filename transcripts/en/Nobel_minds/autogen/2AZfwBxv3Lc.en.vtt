physician and I was wondering if

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589
physician and I was wondering if
 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.650
physician and I was wondering if
Florence can revolutionize medicine in

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660
Florence can revolutionize medicine in
 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.110
Florence can revolutionize medicine in
terms of drug delivery systems by its

sports and I wonder if this can be used

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219
sports and I wonder if this can be used
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.720

to make lighter records

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730
to make lighter records
 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.980
to make lighter records
well c60 I think if it is used in the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990
well c60 I think if it is used in the
 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.890
well c60 I think if it is used in the
near future in medical applications

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
near future in medical applications
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.900

there will be two reasons and one will

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910
there will be two reasons and one will
 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.330
there will be two reasons and one will
be the fact that it is a very good free

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340
be the fact that it is a very good free
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.120
be the fact that it is a very good free
radical scavenger so in systems where

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130
radical scavenger so in systems where
 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.260
radical scavenger so in systems where
free radicals are not good for in the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270
free radicals are not good for in the

medical and the body I think it could be

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640
medical and the body I think it could be
 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.280
medical and the body I think it could be
useful there too to tie them up but the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
useful there too to tie them up but the
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.389
useful there too to tie them up but the
one that looks likely to be most

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399
one that looks likely to be most
 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.400
one that looks likely to be most
interesting it hasn't been really solved

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410
interesting it hasn't been really solved
 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.069
interesting it hasn't been really solved
will be the fact that c60 is a cage and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079
will be the fact that c60 is a cage and
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.069
will be the fact that c60 is a cage and
it can trap atoms inside physically

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079
it can trap atoms inside physically
 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.959
it can trap atoms inside physically
though they're in they're not chemically

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
though they're in they're not chemically
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.479
though they're in they're not chemically
but physically so if they're inside the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
but physically so if they're inside the
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.610
but physically so if they're inside the
cage then they're separated and save

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
cage then they're separated and save
 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.390
cage then they're separated and save
their toxic such as radioactive atoms

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
their toxic such as radioactive atoms
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.600
their toxic such as radioactive atoms
and elements which may be toxic chemical

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
and elements which may be toxic chemical
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.760
and elements which may be toxic chemical
in the body you could put them inside

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770
in the body you could put them inside
 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.160
in the body you could put them inside
the cage and they would put probably

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170
the cage and they would put probably
 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.120
the cage and they would put probably
hydroxyl groups around which would or

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130
hydroxyl groups around which would or
 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.070
hydroxyl groups around which would or
some groups to make sure that the c60

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080
some groups to make sure that the c60
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.260
some groups to make sure that the c60
wasn't toxic but and the atom on the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
wasn't toxic but and the atom on the
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.440
wasn't toxic but and the atom on the
inside could be probably use that as a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450
inside could be probably use that as a
 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.020
inside could be probably use that as a
radiation chemo radiation therapy and if

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
radiation chemo radiation therapy and if
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.300
radiation chemo radiation therapy and if
you tagged the outside of c60 with a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310
you tagged the outside of c60 with a
 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.090
you tagged the outside of c60 with a
recognition mighty you could probably

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100
recognition mighty you could probably
 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.969
recognition mighty you could probably
tag it on to the place where the cancer

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979
tag it on to the place where the cancer
 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.940
tag it on to the place where the cancer
was and that seems to be probably one of

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
was and that seems to be probably one of
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.010
was and that seems to be probably one of
the most likely future applications of

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020
the most likely future applications of
 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.130
the most likely future applications of
of c60 in the medical area as far as the

of c60 in the medical area as far as the
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.560
of c60 in the medical area as far as the
rackets are concerned well I've often

said that if we can make this bundle of
nanotubes wouldn't be c60 particularly

light as well it would be definitely be

stronger than all rackets that have been

stronger than all rackets that have been
made up to now and significantly lighter

the problem of course in tennis is that

there's also a momentum effect so a

there's also a momentum effect so a

there's also a momentum effect so a
lighter racquet is not always all you

lighter racquet is not always all you
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.190
lighter racquet is not always all you
need you need some momentum in the head

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200
need you need some momentum in the head

all stuck together and you have the

all stuck together and you have the
 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.830
all stuck together and you have the
coordinated structure and properties of
