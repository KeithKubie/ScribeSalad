00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is 8.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's go through it together to see why.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Sentence only has one re-write rule.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
These are sometimes called "production rules" as well.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Only one production rule. Only one thing to do with it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We're always going to get started with optional adjective followed by subject

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
followed by verb.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This could go to accurate or nothing.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The subject could go to William or Tell.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The verbs could go to shoots or bows.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We have two choices here, two choices in the middle, and two choices at the end.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
When we multiply that out, we get eight possibilities--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
accurate William shoots, accurate William bows, accurate Tell shoots,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
accurate Tell bows, William shoots, William bows,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Tell shoots, Tell bows--eight possibilities in total.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
William Tell was a 15th century Swiss folk her.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Famously, he did not bow.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
He was requested to bow to the hat of a city leader or some such.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
In exchange, he was asked to shoot--or offered to shoot--the apple off of his son's head,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
using a crossbow. This is not a crossbow.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
At least two of the sentences above--William Bows, Tell bows,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
accurate William bows, accurate Tell bows--four of them didn't happen

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
as far as the story goes.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Even if you're not familiar with this story, you may have heard the overture.

00:01:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
It's actually quite a bit of fun.
