00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:07.959
Jeans are easily one of the most ubiquitous
pieces of clothing on Earth with millions

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:13.010
of pairs being made, sold and wrapped around
the butts of style conscious individuals every

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.150
single day.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.640
But why are jeans so popular and for what
purpose were they first made?

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.480
Before we answer that it’s important for
us to first define exactly what we mean when

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.779
we say “jeans” because the word has changed
in context over the last few hundred years.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.300
As detailed by the Fashion Enyclopedia, the
term “jeans” has existed since the 1600s,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.970
where it was used as a catch-all term to describe
the “rough clothing worn by working men”.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.440
Since the fabric used to make these clothes
often came from the Genoa region in Italy,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.530
it was commonly referred to as “jean”.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.380
Weavers from the Nimes area of France tried
to replicate this fabric and it eventually

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.149
came to be known as “denim” a bastardization
of the words “de Nimes” (from Nimes).

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.149
Cool, huh?

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.850
So what makes modern jeans so different from
the work trousers found on the legs of 16th

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.850
century workers?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.530
Well, the key difference is in how modern
jeans are held together, rivets.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.429
If you’re currently wearing a pair of jeans,
which is statistically quite likely, you may

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:12.079
notice that they are held together at key
points with small rivets.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.850
(You may also notice that your zipper has
the letters “YKK” on it and if you’re

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.970
interested in why, we covered that in another
article).

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.150
These rivets are a relatively new addition
to jeans and they’re the reason for the

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.340
garments legendary longevity.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.560
Contrary to what you may have thought, unlike
the stitch pattern often found on the rear

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.259
pockets, the rivets aren’t just for show,
they’re strategically placed at the locations

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.159
the garments suffers the most strain, like
the pockets and (sometimes) the zipper (hey-oh!).

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.359
The idea to use metal rivets to reinforce
the stitching of work trousers is the brainchild

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:48.319
of one, Jacob Davis, a native Latvian who
lived in Nevada as a salesmen during the 19th

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:49.319
century.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.569
Davis earned his keep selling clothing and
general supplies to the many miners and workers

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.649
who called the area their home.

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.149
The legend goes that the wife of a miner (some
sources say a woodsman) came to Davis lamenting

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.349
the fact that he often tore the pockets off
of his work trousers and implored him to find

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:04.469
a way to strengthen them.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.819
The legend continues that Davis drew inspiration
from a horse’s saddle in his shop and hatched

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.879
the ingenious idea to reinforce the pockets
and other areas with metal rivets.

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.840
Annoyingly, the exact details surrounding
the invention of the first pair of jeans as

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.819
we’d understand them today will likely never
be known, so we’re just left with the aforementioned

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:23.819
legend.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.959
But it, at the least, seems plausible enough
that Davis probably got the idea from a customer

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.379
or customers who were having problems with
torn pants, so he came up with a solution.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.209
What we do know for sure though is that Davis’
“riveted work pants” were a huge hit with

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.569
locals and that it only took a short while
for demand to greatly outstrip the already

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.849
meagre supply.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.849
Realising that he’d stumbled upon a goldmine
potentially more lucrative than the actual

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.390
goldmines his customers were working in, Davis
understandably became very paranoid about

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.980
someone stealing his idea and he sought to
patent it.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.810
However, despite his short-term success, he
simply didn’t have the scratch to do it

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.849
himself, a whole $68 (about $1300 today).

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.760
So, he reached out to the man whose name would
eventually become synonymous with the product,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.910
Levi Strauss.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.620
Strauss, similar to Davis, was a native European
(originally hailing from Bavaria) who’d

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.019
travelled to the states to try and make his
fortune.

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.049
The pair became acquaintances through Strauss’
dry goods store, which supplied Davis with

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.969
the material he needed to make his riveted
pants, among other product.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:30.280
After a brief and poorly spelled letter exchange
(“The secratt of them Pents is the Rivits

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.120
that I put in those Pockots…

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.330
I cannot make them up fast enough…My nabors
are getting yealouse of these success…”),

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.299
the two men met and, with Strauss’ money,
they were able to successfully apply for a

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.340
patent on their riveted pants in 1873.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.670
That same year the pair began producing the
pants on a mass scale.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.401
Curiously, when the pair first began producing
jeans, they sold two varieties, the blue denim

00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:58.269
kind you could find on the shelf of any clothing
store today and a pair made from a fabric

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.639
not dissimilar from canvas, known as “duck
cotton” (often also used by Davis for making

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.150
tents and wagon covers).

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.040
The former proved to be wildly more popular
than the latter and soon became the only kind

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.129
the company sold.

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.819
The reason denim proved to be so much more
popular than duck cotton is twofold.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.670
Firstly, denim becomes softer as it ages (unlike
duck cotton that will pretty much always feel

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.900
like you’re wearing a wagon cover), an attractive
quality in a piece of clothing you’re expected

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.900
to wear every day.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.900
And secondly, because it looked better.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.610
Denim jeans were originally dyed blue partially
because indigo dye was cheap and readily available

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.560
in large quantities in America, but also because
the dye was dark enough to easily hide stains.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.979
Further, the dye in the small quantity needed
per jean, combined with the weave of denim,

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.990
wouldn’t seep through the denim to the other
side.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.289
This meant the risk of the dye staining your
legs is effectively nil, which is again, a

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.020
desirable quality in a piece of clothing you’re
going to be getting sweaty in on a daily basis.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.110
The fact that the dye only stains the outside
of denim jeans also means that as they age,

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.699
they gradually fade as the dye is inevitably
worn away.

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.289
This proved to be another highly desirable
quality of the garments that’s still popular

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.370
today, with many even preferring to buy pre-faded
versions.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.009
So how did the world of riveted pants go from
being the exclusive domain of the cowboy to

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.850
the go-to fashion for everyone from sweaty
hipsters to cool grandparents?

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.259
Well, that’s down to a multitude of factors.

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.610
The first, and probably biggest thing to happen
to the world of riveted pants was the expiration

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.720
of Levi’s patent in 1908, which gave dozens
of imitators a chance to flood the market

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.720
with knock-offs.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.770
The second thing was likely the romanization
of the “cowboy lifestyle”.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.940
While the deeply entrenched association with
manual laborers and rural people initially

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.550
turned more affluent people off of the idea
of wearing denim jeans, as time passed, the

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.360
allure of wearing something so quintessentially
American began to take hold, culminating in

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.200
the “dude ranch craze” of the 1930s with
people paying money to experience the “traditional”

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.500
cowboy lifestyle, jeans and all.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.659
A third thing that helped denim jeans become
popular, particularly overseas, was their

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:04.470
popularity with servicemen in the 1940s and
1950s, who often liked to wear them when they

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.470
were off duty.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.690
A fourth thing that made the garment popular
with the younger generation was the release

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.060
of films like Rebel Without a Cause and The
Wild One, in which the protagonists wore jeans

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.800
as a way of rebelling against societal expectations.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.440
After the release of these films in the 1950s,
demand for jeans exploded amongst like-minded

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.440
youths.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.400
This demand continued through the 1960s and
1970s where jeans were picked up by almost

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.409
every youth counter-culture movement that
sprung up.

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:35.650
In the 1980s, interest in jeans went nuclear
with the release of a series of sexually charged,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.780
strong armed ads like the infamous Brook Shields
Calvin Klein ads or the decidedly more tame

00:06:40.780 --> 00:08:15.830
“laundrette ad” which saw sales

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:51.360
of Levi’s increase by 800% in the UK.
