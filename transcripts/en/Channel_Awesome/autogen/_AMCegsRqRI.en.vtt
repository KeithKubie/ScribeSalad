00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.710
nothing but jokes but the reason it
didn't connect with me is that these are

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720
didn't connect with me is that these are
 

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.770
didn't connect with me is that these are
not character based jokes these are

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:46.780
not character based jokes these are
 

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:51.120
not character based jokes these are
jokes based on kind of an awareness of

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.130
jokes based on kind of an awareness of
 

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.230
jokes based on kind of an awareness of
the environment and key culture and

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240
the environment and key culture and
 

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.940
the environment and key culture and
surprise humor and and kind of awkward

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:56.950

fine but the Teen Titans were very
 

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.070
fine but the Teen Titans were very
character-based and I think that's why

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:07.080
character-based and I think that's why
 

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.860
character-based and I think that's why
