SARAH THOMSON: Hello, everybody.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.260
Good morning.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.370
My name is Sarah, and for
the last 2 and 1/2 years

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.730
I've been heading up the indie
community on Google Play,

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.660
and it's been an
awesome experience.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.300
I started as an indie myself
well over 10 years ago,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.150
and it's still my
favorite group of people.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.860
I'm a little bit
biased with indies,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.290
so you'll probably
see that come through

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.680
as I talk to these
two amazing humans.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.720
And this morning we
talked a lot about-- we

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.720
had some great talks
run by Googlers

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.750
and some of our partners who
were talking about improving

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.630
game quality, and how
can you really maximize

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.990
your discoverability.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.960
And we're going to
actually kick off

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.860
into a lot of different
discussions carrying on

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.670
to build on top of that.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.370
So today I have Sam and Mike,
who are two indie developers

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.780
and publisher, who are
really experts and have seen

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.290
a lot of success around user
acquisition, which is something

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.600
that I think a lot of
indies really struggle with.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.850
Put your hand up if you
struggle with user acquisition--

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.230
like, where to even
start, what is it.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.770
It's super overwhelming.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.020
And then we also have
Butterscotch Shenanigans here,

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.810
which are experts around
community-building.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.005
So we're going to talk
about those two things.

00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:24.980
It's going to be super exciting.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.480
All right.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.022
Welcome guys.

00:01:26.022 --> 00:01:26.938
Thanks for joining us.

00:01:26.938 --> 00:01:27.730
SAM COSTER: Thanks.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.670
SARAH THOMSON: So maybe let's
start with some introductions.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.810
Sam, maybe you can start.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.350
Talk a little bit
about yourself,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.322
your history in gaming,
about your company, so forth.

00:01:36.322 --> 00:01:37.030
SAM COSTER: Sure.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.530
Yeah.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.390
So Butterscotch Shenanigans was
founded about seven years ago

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.190
by me and my two brothers.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.850
And a family-owned business,
which is always a terrible idea

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.060
I've heard, but it's
working out pretty good.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.790
And we've launched five games.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.010
We started on mobile
and we've recently

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.315
gone more cross-platform,
so our games now

00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:54.940
reach out onto other
platforms as well,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.313
like Steam and console.

00:01:56.313 --> 00:01:57.730
And a big part of
our strategy has

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.010
been answering the
question, once we somehow

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.560
manage to get a
player, how can we

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.030
just keep that player around?

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.235
So instead of worrying
about user acquisition

00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:08.110
in terms of bringing
new people in, how do we

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:08.991
keep people with us.

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:10.949
And that's sort of been
what a lot of our focus

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.630
is, around community management
and that sort of thing.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.646
MIKE GORDON: Cool.

00:02:13.646 --> 00:02:14.490
I'm Mike.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.510
I'm the CEO of Iron Horse Games.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.450
There's one person at Iron
Horse Games, and that's me.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.750
I started the company
three years ago.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.180
Last year we did 11
million installs,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.550
with a heavy amount
of user acquisition.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.670
So I do a lot of
marketing myself,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.430
a lot of creative
testing, and mostly

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.270
focus on Idle Game publishing.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.200
That's it.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.340
SARAH THOMSON: Cool.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.360
So the first obvious question I
want to ask you is, why indie?

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.570
Why did you choose to
be an indie developer?

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.360
I think a lot of people
feel it's harder than ever

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.240
to be indie, especially
in mobile and increasingly

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.600
on other platforms.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.370
Why did you choose this path?

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.120
MIKE GORDON: Sure.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.000
I can start.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.540
It's personal and professional.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.455
So personally, I had worked
at Kongregate previously

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:05.580
and helped build up the
mobile publishing business.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.063
We'd worked with a lot
of really big teams,

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:10.230
and I wanted to get more
hands-on with smaller teams

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.860
and make an impact
on their games.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.340
And that's been personally
really satisfying.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.080
Professionally, I
saw that there was

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.290
a big gap in the market from
a publishing perspective.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.790
From a business
perspective, the way

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.250
that publishing typically
works if you have success

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.540
is you build on that success.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.618
You have a game, it generates
a lot of money, you market it,

00:03:27.618 --> 00:03:29.910
and then start hiring on a
team to help build the games

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.040
bigger, which means that
subsequent games need

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.180
to be bigger and bigger.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.140
And that creates
a snowball effect,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.690
and then you look
up after four years

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.910
and you're publishing
like two games a year.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.040
I never wanted to
do that, and felt

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.860
that there was a huge
opportunity for one

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.048
and two-person teams
to really benefit

00:03:46.048 --> 00:03:48.090
from a lot of the learnings
that the big team had

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.930
from publishing.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.062
So that's what I set out to
do, and largely what I've done.

00:03:52.062 --> 00:03:53.020
SARAH THOMSON: Awesome.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.728
SAM COSTER: Yeah.

00:03:53.728 --> 00:03:56.550
So on our end, one is that
we really like to make games.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.460
In the past we liked
to make them fast.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.730
That's changed a bit.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.890
But we started out
doing game jams,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.390
and so that sort
of creative freedom

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.682
you get from just iterating
over a weekend we basically

00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:08.620
extended into how we
make our games generally.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.370
So we have a really iterative
design and development cycle.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.340
And on top of that,
the sort of new thing

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.148
that we do at our
studio is a lot

00:04:16.148 --> 00:04:17.940
of this really interesting
web tech and web

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.930
integration with our games.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.690
So we built our own
proprietary account

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.280
system called Bscotch
ID, which is now

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.760
transitioned into Rumpus,
which is our "powerful back

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.086
end," as we call it.

00:04:27.086 --> 00:04:27.657
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:27.657 --> 00:04:29.490
And what that allows
us to do is get players

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.000
into this email system, which
now we have half a million

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.383
players who have at some
point bought one of our games

00:04:35.383 --> 00:04:37.050
who we actually have
their email address

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.410
and we send them emails
basically once a month letting

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.450
them know what's
going on at the studio

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.080
as well as essentially hyping
up whatever our new game is

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.590
or selling merch
or whatever else.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.143
So a big part of
our learnings have

00:04:46.143 --> 00:04:47.310
come on that side of things.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.268
We really wanted to have
the time and the space

00:04:49.268 --> 00:04:50.940
to explore that
whole aspect of it

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.600
and see what we could do there.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.600
SARAH THOMSON:
That's super cool.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.926
So Mike, I'm going to move
over to you and dive into--

00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:00.790
you come from gaming.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.020
You're not new to games.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.530
But being in this space of
really being this one-man indie

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.490
sensation, what's that been
like over the last few years?

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.990
What's the learning
curve been like?

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.170
MIKE GORDON: Yeah.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.430
So it's nice that you called me
a sensation, because it's not--

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.750
SARAH THOMSON: Yes.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.730
You are a sensation.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.640
You are sensational.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.500
MIKE GORDON: Thank you.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.740
It's been difficult and good.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.960
I think you can
probably relate to this.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.420
If you have any
degree of success

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.220
you start feeling a
little bit nervous

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.680
that it's going to go away.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.172
So that's one
element that I deal

00:05:32.172 --> 00:05:33.880
with quite a bit,
especially when we have

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.070
a successful business, is
the feeling that it's not

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.490
going to be that way forever,
so you stay really scrappy.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.150
I think the most important
learnings of the past three

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.050
years have really been the need
to adapt and do it quickly.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.450
When I started Iron
Horse Games, about a year

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.840
later the app store
did its redesign.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.590
If anyone here is a
mobile game developer,

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.250
you've probably seen what
the impacts of that are.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.320
And then also there
have been a series

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.200
of changes on Google Play where
a lot of organic installs that

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.180
used to kind of
fall from the sky

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.135
have changed how they
come into your game.

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:10.510
They're all still
there, you just

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.177
have to figure out a
way to unlock them.

00:06:12.177 --> 00:06:15.340
For me it was leaning really
heavily into marketing and user

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.360
acquisition.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.480
So when those things
happen you need to pivot,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.822
and you need to do it
incredibly quickly,

00:06:21.822 --> 00:06:23.530
because otherwise
you're going to wake up

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.197
and you're not going
to have a business.

00:06:25.197 --> 00:06:28.030
I mean, if I didn't make the
changes that I made to start

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.920
marketing aggressively
last year--

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.280
and I had done zero marketing
at Iron Horse before this--

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.260
I wouldn't be here today.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.760
Period.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.968
The business would not exist.

00:06:37.968 --> 00:06:38.802
SARAH THOMSON: Yeah.

00:06:38.802 --> 00:06:40.930
So building off of
that and in reference

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.190
to what we were talking
about a little bit earlier,

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:49.300
is that you have really taken
on head-on the concept of user

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.990
acquisition.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.440
And how you started
from square one--

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.520
you really didn't
know much about it,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.752
and now you've acquired this
incredible wealth of knowledge

00:06:57.752 --> 00:06:58.335
in that space.

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.202
So how do you do
that as an indie?

00:07:00.202 --> 00:07:01.660
Where did you even
start with that?

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.410
MIKE GORDON: Yeah.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.290
So, credit to Kongregate
and my time there because--

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.563
well, I wasn't actively
doing marketing myself.

00:07:07.563 --> 00:07:08.980
I was working with
that team a lot

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.190
and kind of getting an idea
of what that looked like.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.753
For the specific way that
I started doing marketing

00:07:15.753 --> 00:07:17.170
and started tackling
it, the first

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.822
was algorithm change
rolled through Google Play.

00:07:19.822 --> 00:07:22.030
Some of my games lost installs
and a lot of the games

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.900
kept them.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.220
So I looked at why the
games who still had installs

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.830
were continuing to get them.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.580
The answer, at least
for me, was that they

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.033
had a high third-party
referral rate.

00:07:33.033 --> 00:07:34.450
So I was getting
a lot of installs

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.617
from outside of Google Play.

00:07:35.617 --> 00:07:38.470
I inferred that that meant
that the algorithm might

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.470
be encouraging developers
to market their games,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.740
so I started marketing
really conservatively

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.400
to start on live games.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.710
I'd take about 30% of
the projected net revenue

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.070
for the month, I would reinvest
that into marketing and user

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.690
acquisition through
sources that I

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.200
was confident would have
either net neutral--

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.622
so I wouldn't lose any money on
them-- or ROI positive payback.

00:08:02.622 --> 00:08:04.080
I mean, this is
not a lot of spend.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.730
We're talking like
$1,000 a month.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.010
I monitor the results,
and then as that

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.590
started gaining
success and snowballing

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.070
I developed a strategy
around marketing on open beta

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.500
and then marketing during
launch, which is probably

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.170
the most important window
that you can market

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.850
your game in on Google Play.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.170
So the first 30 days when you
release your game globally

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.830
from open beta or
pre-registration,

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.470
the paid to organic
ratios are insane.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.090
Like, normally on a game
that's live maybe you

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.990
buy one install on Google
Play and you get one organic.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.690
During that launch window,
you buy one install

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.830
and you get four organics.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.463
So knowing how to
market your game

00:08:48.463 --> 00:08:50.380
and having some experience
marketing your game

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.770
and then aggressively marketing
during that 30-day window

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.290
gives you all kinds of
benefits outside of just

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.950
you're making money.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.710
You can also use
that information

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.502
to pitch the folks at
Google and say, look,

00:09:01.502 --> 00:09:03.335
I've got a really good
game here and I think

00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:04.460
you guys should support it.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.335
SARAH THOMSON: Right.

00:09:05.335 --> 00:09:06.640
And you just scaled from there?

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:06.820
MIKE GORDON: Yeah.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.320
That's it.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.230
I mean, on every game we start
really small in open beta.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.650
I'm predominately
spending my budgets

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:20.660
on Facebook, Unity, Google
Play, AdWords, Tapjoy, and Iron

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.650
Source, and some ad action.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.060
Those are the big six for me.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.070
It's a mix of display
and video ads,

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.540
and then as the
game's net revenue

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.260
grows we come up with
a monthly budget,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.290
and then we spend that
every month at either net

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.910
neutral or ROI positive.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.980
And my games don't
have massive RPUs.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:43.720
We're talking like $0.50
CPIs for Western users.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.800
So it can be done.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.600
I do it every day.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.250
I did it this morning.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.110
Yeah.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.820
SARAH THOMSON: And just one
last question around that.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.740
Can you tell me a
little bit about--

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.470
you referenced the fact that
things change on the store.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.970
Right?

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:58.950
MIKE GORDON: Yeah.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.410
SARAH THOMSON: The way
that games are surfaced

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.990
and what's going on behind
the curtain, so to speak,

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.670
is changing.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.220
And that can be
really daunting, I

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.670
think, for developers of all
sizes, but especially indies.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.710
So how has that
been to navigate?

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.293
What's sort of your
outlook on that?

00:10:16.293 --> 00:10:18.210
MIKE GORDON: My outlook
on it is that you guys

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.820
have a business that you're
optimizing and growing.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.510
So I don't begrudge any changes
that happen on the store

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.990
because it's something that
Google's heavily invested in,

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.240
and it's their right to do
whatever they want with it,

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.680
to grow it and change
it as they see fit.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.890
The way I feel about it
is that it's terrifying

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.620
when users start disappearing.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.790
But there's always a signal.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.220
So I have a broad data set.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:45.300
I'm a publisher, so I
have 15 games or more.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.720
Whenever anything changes I
dig deep to see who the winners

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.430
and losers were
and try and come up

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.190
with a hypothesis as to
why they won or lost.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.980
But typically
marketing has allowed

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.020
me to weather most storms.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.310
I think if you have a consistent
stream of marketing, whatever

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.080
is happening with organic
installs on the store,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.440
as long as it's not affecting
that first 30-day window

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.760
and it's not punishing
us on the paid

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.337
to organic ratio for live games,
you can pretty much weather it.

00:11:15.337 --> 00:11:16.920
You just gotta get
to that point where

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.710
you're reinvesting in
marketing on a monthly basis.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.290
SARAH THOMSON: And I want
to point out and give a plug

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.650
for Mike's talk tomorrow.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.200
So Mike, can you give details?

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.700
If this is really
interesting to you

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.140
and you want to hear more and
some really specific examples

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.738
in Mike's talk tomorrow, where
can they join you tomorrow?

00:11:33.738 --> 00:11:35.280
MIKE GORDON: That's
a great question.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.370
It's tomorrow.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.475
SARAH THOMSON: Somewhere.

00:11:39.475 --> 00:11:41.100
MIKE GORDON: It's
around 2 o'clock-ish.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.350
SARAH THOMSON: Here.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.930
MIKE GORDON: And it's at GDC.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.760
It's called "Scrappy Marketing."

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.510
SARAH THOMSON: OK.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.030
MIKE GORDON: That's it.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.130
SARAH THOMSON: That's probably
enough information for people

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.210
to--

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:49.530
MIKE GORDON: That's the title.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.190
And it's a really
good presentation.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:52.250
This sounds like I
haven't prepared.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.833
I've prepared.

00:11:52.833 --> 00:11:54.990
I just don't know the
specific [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.540
SARAH THOMSON: Awesome.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:55.850
OK.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:56.320
Great.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.000
MIKE GORDON: Good time.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.917
SARAH THOMSON: So let's
jump over to Sam here.

00:11:58.917 --> 00:12:00.315
Thanks, Mike.

00:12:00.315 --> 00:12:03.210
So you guys have been around
for a number of years now,

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:07.830
and doing a pretty good job of
weathering some crazy storms

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.170
in the indie world, and
you've seen great success.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:12.567
So, what's your secret?

00:12:12.567 --> 00:12:13.900
How have you managed to do that?

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.910
SAM COSTER: So I
think it kind of

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.577
goes back to what you
were talking about

00:12:16.577 --> 00:12:19.140
as far as the concept of how
do you build a business that

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.200
is able to weather the various
changes that are happening

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.993
literally all the time.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.160
So while Mike's taking more
of a marketing approach,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.750
ours has been more on
the community engagement

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.420
side of things.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.908
So through that
newsletter system--

00:12:31.908 --> 00:12:33.450
essentially the
first reason we built

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:34.780
that was because we said, OK.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.930
We can't necessarily
always guarantee

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.060
that Google or Apple
or anybody else

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.390
is going to give us a feature.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:40.890
Right?

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.872
It's never guaranteed,
and also they've

00:12:42.872 --> 00:12:44.080
got their own stuff going on.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.380
Maybe Super Mario Run
launches and absorbs

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.840
all of the top
spots for something,

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.820
or all sorts of games
come out and just start

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.380
absorbing all sorts
of feature spots

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.630
where usually you would
think you'd be in there.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.900
So we said, how can we
actually robustly build

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.430
a future for
ourselves where we get

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.060
to control at least a little
bit of that launch potential,

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.070
and actually do it without
any marketing money?

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.140
So we're heavy on the tech side.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.120
We build a lot tools
for ourselves and things

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.490
like that to really
optimize workflows

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.090
as well as to optimize things
like these sort of marketing

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.090
back channels and stuff.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.000
So for us the answer came
in the form of building

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.520
this proprietary tech,
which really was originally

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.510
built in PHP--

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.492
like a really kind of
hideous back end system,

00:13:24.492 --> 00:13:26.450
Which is much better now,
much more stable now.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.728
But it allowed people to
just back up their data.

00:13:29.728 --> 00:13:30.770
It's a Cloud save system.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:31.440
Right?

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.480
And because our games
are cross-platform

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.700
that meant that if someone
played it on their tablet

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.303
on Android and then
hopped on their PC

00:13:37.303 --> 00:13:39.720
then they could just pick up
exactly where they came from.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.762
And we found our users
really, really liked that,

00:13:41.762 --> 00:13:44.370
and it also gave them a reason
to give us their email address.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.870
So the question
then is, what do you

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.670
do once you have
that email address?

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.170
For some reason
indies in particular

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.460
really love Twitter,
when Twitter has, like,

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.320
the lowest pick-up rate of
almost any communication

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.460
channel you could ever
try to broadcast on.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.350
It's sort of like
you're just kind

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.350
of screaming into the
void a lot, with hashtags.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:01.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.475
And so, I mean, we're talking
between a 15% and 40% open rate

00:14:05.475 --> 00:14:07.350
on these emails that
we're sending to people.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.990
We're sending them to,
like, 150,000 people.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.900
And what we found over the
years is that everywhere we've

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.000
gone to build an
audience has always

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.380
ended up getting restricted.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.720
So, for example, we first
built an audience on Facebook,

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.090
and then it became
quickly clear that if we

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.190
wanted to actually reach
the 20,000 people that we

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.030
had driven to that page to
like us through our games,

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.680
that we had to pay money now
to reach the audience that we

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.618
had curated there.

00:14:29.618 --> 00:14:32.160
And on Twitter it was the same
thing, where we couldn't quite

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.308
hit our total audience pool.

00:14:34.308 --> 00:14:35.100
And so we said, OK.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.725
Email looks like a
good way to do this.

00:14:36.725 --> 00:14:38.910
And for some reason it's
not a tool that indies use.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.203
So as far as something
that's-- it's a really,

00:14:41.203 --> 00:14:42.120
really effective tool.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.620
And, yes, there are some
complications with something

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.230
like GDPR, but it's actually
not particularly difficult.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.340
It seems really scary.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.590
And it is really easy to
walk through once you get it.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.640
So the email newsletter system.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.240
And then on top of that,
we do a weekly podcast,

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.717
which is just us--

00:14:55.717 --> 00:14:58.050
me and my two brothers-- just
getting a room for an hour

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.115
and basically being weirdos.

00:15:00.115 --> 00:15:01.490
We talk about the
games industry,

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.790
we talk about the
game we're working on,

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.415
and then we answer
community questions.

00:15:04.415 --> 00:15:07.610
And we-- depending
on the week-- will

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.910
have around between 1,500
and 2,500 listeners per week.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:15.650
And if you talk about the
power of having your fan base

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.930
listen to you talk for
an hour every week--

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.890
that's something that
really can't be matched.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:26.180
And cumulatively the podcast
has had over 350,000 hours

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.630
of people listening.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.130
Right?

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.470
And so it's allowed us
to build a fan base,

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.780
even start a little tiny
mini convention of our own

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.120
in St. Lewis where we're
based in the Midwest,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.270
that people flew from
Florida and drove from Texas

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.053
to come see us.

00:15:39.053 --> 00:15:40.970
So it's allowed us to
do a lot of these things

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.140
that normally we would
feel very out of reach for,

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.680
and in a lot of ways weather
all these changes long

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.240
enough that we can
pivot effectively

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.580
and take advantage of whatever
the new sort of shiny thing

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.570
is that we're supposed to do.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.195
SARAH THOMSON: So
was that intentional,

00:15:52.195 --> 00:15:57.780
to build your fan base
around your studio brand

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.595
as opposed to--

00:15:58.595 --> 00:15:58.760
SAM COSTER: Yes.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.927
SARAH THOMSON: And then,
of course, it cascades down

00:16:00.927 --> 00:16:01.940
into the gaming brands.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.530
But was that an intentional
thing or did you just get

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:05.030
lucky?

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.180
SAM COSTER: Absolutely.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:05.950
Yeah.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.910
Well, do I think it's
absolutely intentional?

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:09.452
And definitely luck
is involved, too.

00:16:09.452 --> 00:16:12.110
So a big part of
it was recognizing

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.760
that we were tired of--

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.710
so basically we had
launched these four games

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:16.880
within two years or so.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.790
And these were smaller,
strictly mobile titles.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.820
And doing the run-up every
single time to launch

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.985
was always so harrowing
because you're like,

00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:26.360
are we-- we're
talking to Google.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.450
Are we going to get
a feature in there?

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:28.285
Like, I don't know.

00:16:28.285 --> 00:16:28.785
Maybe.

00:16:28.785 --> 00:16:29.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.760
And then we don't have money to
spend on ads, so we're like--

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.230
MIKE GORDON: You and I
both know that's not how

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.250
that happened on Crashlands.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.430
SAM COSTER: Well,
not on Crashlands.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.280
MIKE GORDON: Am I
going to get a feature?

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:35.780
Yes.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.604
SAM COSTER: Crashlands will.

00:16:36.604 --> 00:16:37.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.280
So the previous
four, not so much.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:40.820
So, yeah.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.030
So a big part of that
then was just saying,

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:48.530
how can we take a single
player coming into Crashlands

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.750
or into Flop Rocket--
one of our other games--

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.852
and how can we get them
excited about the breadth

00:16:52.852 --> 00:16:54.060
of all the rest of our games?

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.040
So all of our
games actually take

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.290
place in the same universe.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.290
They have the same art
style across all of them,

00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.090
no matter what the genre is.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.100
And they hop around
genres all over the place,

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.540
from things that
make you want to snap

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.915
your phone in half
to Crashlands,

00:17:03.915 --> 00:17:05.480
which is like a 60-hour RPG.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.472
So a big part of it was,
yeah, this really intentional,

00:17:09.472 --> 00:17:11.180
how do we get someone
to come in and then

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.530
stay with us as a team as
opposed to just saying,

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.880
I really like that game.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.630
I've no idea who made
it and I don't care.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:18.020
SARAH THOMSON: Yeah.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:18.920
That's awesome.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.730
So we're almost
out of time here,

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.390
and I really want to know--

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.810
obviously you and your brothers
have a particular talent

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.750
of that kind of
community-building effort

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:30.800
around the podcast.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.063
And there's charisma and
personality happening there,

00:17:34.063 --> 00:17:35.730
and not all of us are
blessed with that.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:36.438
SAM COSTER: Sure.

00:17:36.438 --> 00:17:39.680
SARAH THOMSON: So how
can you, as a very small,

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:45.242
resource-limited team, build
a community in different ways?

00:17:45.242 --> 00:17:45.950
SAM COSTER: Yeah.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.825
I mean, honestly I think
the highest leverage

00:17:47.825 --> 00:17:50.180
way to do it is through
something like a newsletter.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:50.960
SARAH THOMSON: OK.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.130
SAM COSTER: A lot of people--

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.630
especially if you're an indie
or you just like making games,

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.620
a lot of people are more
introverted by nature.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.100
And I do actually consider
myself an introvert,

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.100
I'm just good at
talking when I need to.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.720
But I think everybody
usually has the ability

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.898
to write pretty effectively.

00:18:03.898 --> 00:18:05.690
And you should actually
develop that skill.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:08.232
And that's something that you
can do sort of on your own time

00:18:08.232 --> 00:18:10.820
without the pressure
of an instant response.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.980
And those email newsletters
are honestly so phenomenal.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.520
I know there's a talk
about Chris Zukowski

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.325
about this exact topic,
I think, tomorrow,

00:18:19.325 --> 00:18:21.200
which is all about how
to build an email list

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.530
and then use it
really effectively.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.260
And it's one of those things
that, for some reason,

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:24.843
people ignore.

00:18:24.843 --> 00:18:26.940
Kind of like the user
acquisition side on indies.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.060
And it can help
you so much, even

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.470
if it's just like 2000 people.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.540
Or even-- like, we started
ours with 13 people.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.110
So, you know, it
takes a little bit.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.610
Then you go.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.858
MIKE GORDON: Do you guys
do any incentivization

00:18:36.858 --> 00:18:38.150
in the actual games themselves?

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.200
Do you, like, get
this cool thing--

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:39.520
SAM COSTER: Yeah.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.000
That's where, essentially,
the Cloud saving--

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.440
all those additional
features come from.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.190
And we do cross-game--

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.980
MIKE GORDON: All
packaged together.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.840
SAM COSTER: All
packaged together.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.852
We do cross-game
unlocks and stuff, too.

00:18:46.852 --> 00:18:48.560
So if you beat a boss
in one of our games

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.840
it will unlock a quest
line in Crashlands

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.180
when you're playing, as long
as you're on the same account.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.360
So all sorts of crazy
tech stuff like that.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.010
MIKE GORDON: That's cool.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.830
SARAH THOMSON: That's awesome.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.450
So we're going to
end on that note.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:58.130
Thanks, guys.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.170
This is huge gems
of wisdom you're

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:01.670
able to share with
this audience.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.650
And thank you so much.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.660
Join Mike's talk tomorrow.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.940
And next up we have
Serena and Moonlit

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.930
who's going to take you on
monetization adventures.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:11.430
Thank you.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.790
SAM COSTER: Awesome.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:12.290
Thank you.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.028
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:14.070
SERENA SHIH: Hi everyone.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.060
My name is Serena, and I am a
Google Play [? BD ?] based out

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.970
of Beijing.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.370
We do fully overseas,
so no rumors here.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.570
Today me and my
colleague Moonlit

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.930
will be discussing on why
revenue diversification is

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.120
a must.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.100
We'll be going over
the following agenda,

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.900
starting from why
diversification is important,

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.440
followed by how Playgendary
and Kongregate were

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.150
able to succeed with
diversifying their revenue.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.020
And finally, we'll be focusing
on how Google products aim

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.690
to help you successfully adopt
different business strategies.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.070
To start, why diversify?

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.570
In the last few years
we've seen [? emergences ?]

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.070
of genre-mashing titles.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.800
For example, we have DH
games as Idle Heroes,

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:02.950
which combines the RPG gameplay
with Idle Clicker assets.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.170
And we also have
Pixelberry's Choices,

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.320
which combines the player's
love of story books

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.050
with the ability to control
the overall narrative.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:12.820
The genre-mashing
trend therefore

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:17.020
opens up more way of revenue
diversification and innovation.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:21.820
Multiple genres allow for
additional business model

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:27.220
combinations of IAPs,
ads, and subscriptions.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.840
In addition to
genre-mashing titles,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.670
in the real world
when we're trying

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:35.650
to access a very diversified
and good stock portfolio

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.920
it's important to not place
all of your eggs in one basket.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.520
And therefore this helps you
diminish your overall risk.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.180
What better way to back this up?

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.600
Well, we've plotted all
of our top-grossing titles

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.270
on the chart that you see
on your left and right.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.970
On the x-axis we can see
the percentage of revenue

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.370
from the top 5% of
buyers, which means

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.970
the more you're leaning
toward your right,

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.190
the more you're
dependent on your revenue

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.110
from your top HVUs.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.200
On the y-axis we see the
buyer reactivation rate,

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.950
which is essentially how likely
your players will come back

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.660
after they're already turned.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.490
You can see an overall
negative correlation here,

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.240
which means that the more you're
squeezing out of your buyers,

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.990
the more they are less likely
able to come back after they've

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.520
already turned from the game.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.580
So we have a really
nice little sweet spot

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.150
marked by the yellow star,
where it follows the philosophy

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.270
that you would rather have
everyone spend $1 in your game

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:32.910
than to depend on
that one person

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:35.630
who is going to spend $100.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.040
So where can you start?

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.200
We would like to
encourage you to challenge

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.120
the conventional
thinking that we have.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.300
On this graph we can see
that essentially the lower

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.817
the engagement, lower
skill needed from players,

00:21:47.817 --> 00:21:49.400
you're more or less
likely going to be

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.200
expecting an ads-only game.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.890
On the other side
of the spectrum,

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.550
if you are expecting higher
engagement and higher skill,

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.490
you're more or less
likely expecting an IAP

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.270
and subscription-based game.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:01.670
What is important
is to challenge

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.350
this overall
conventional thinking

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.570
that the genre of your
game should necessarily

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.360
determine your monetization
strategy in order

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.430
to evolve your game economy
with evolution of games today.

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.380
So, just like the
evolving game genres,

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.100
gamers today have also evolved.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.610
So we're not talking about
the three or four years ago

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.280
players who are not
really familiar with one

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.290
of the strategies that
are already present.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.880
So therefore, whether you have
a casual or mid-core game,

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.470
a singular or a
multi-genre title,

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.570
you're still able to
succeed with serving

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.670
different monetization
strategies

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.860
to this new, mature audience.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.920
So now let's take a look
at how Playgendary does it.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.660
Headquartered in
Germany, Playgendary

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.910
is a hyper-casual and
casual game developer

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.010
founded in 2016,
with their heart

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.207
of development in Belarus.

00:22:48.207 --> 00:22:50.540
Starting all the way from the
design stage of their game

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.260
development, Playgendary has
always been very experimental

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.780
with the way that they
do their in-game revenue

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:57.928
diversification.

00:22:57.928 --> 00:22:59.720
We're going to take a
look at the two games

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.650
we have right here.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.410
We have Tank Stars, which
is a hyper-casual game,

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:08.030
and we have Partymasters,
which is an idol clicker

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.830
and story-based game.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.930
I'll be using these
two titles as examples

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:13.700
of how Playgendary
has challenged

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.776
the traditional gaming
revenue strategy.

00:23:16.776 --> 00:23:18.930
At the designing
stage of their games

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.430
all three monetizations
have already

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.220
been considered at the
initial planning stage.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.080
From the start
Playgendary is keen

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.760
on combining all
three methods that

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.520
are possible in order to strive
for the most optimized results.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.520
Therefore, when looking
at their current titles,

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.370
regardless of how the
title actually is,

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.010
you'll see different
combinations of rewarded ads,

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.020
IAP, and subscriptions.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.440
How do they do this?

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.250
To Playgendary, games
is an art form just

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.950
like music and just like movies.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.930
Therefore, creating a
great gaming experience

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.480
for your partner is their
number one priority and is,

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.040
therefore, the most important.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.590
With this in mind they
put their main focus

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.750
on adding a lot
of in-game assets

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.460
for their players to consume.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.460
The focus of having really good
content and in-depth content,

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:06.400
therefore, leads to a more
stable revenue stream.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.220
How is this content distributed?

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.440
We're split into two
different focuses.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:14.070
One, they are allowing
the game currency

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:17.910
to be distributed and consumed
in any way the player chooses.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.920
So whether you're a
payer or a non-payer,

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.410
you're able to
choose how you would

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.250
like to experience your game.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.180
And two, gamers loyalty.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.150
We were talking about LTV with
[? Nacho, ?] and therefore

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.050
the importance of keeping
your players inside your game

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:35.490
through a lot of live-ops
opportunities and events.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:38.910
So honing in on game currency.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.070
In Tank Stars, which
is a hyper-casual game,

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:44.700
you can see that all three
methods are used in this title.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.500
How they use it is, IAP--

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:50.100
you're able to buy
different tanks and weapons

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.110
and upgrade your in-game assets.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.690
And subscriptions will do
almost exactly the same,

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.600
but adding a little
more for the subscriber.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.700
In this game in
particular, actually,

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:05.200
the subscriber revenue takes up
a 46% of the total IAP revenue.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.240
Of course, we can't
forget rewarded ads.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.370
And rewarded ads, although
the players are not

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.890
willing to contribute
monetarily directly,

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.170
they're still able to
contribute their time.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.710
So what they've done is to
set up a gotcha system where

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:21.100
the player is able to
choose based on gotcha

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.570
to see if they can
actually pick out and draw

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:28.170
the tanks that are available
through IAP or subscription.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.620
So in Partymasters, which is a
story-based idol clicker game,

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.410
all three monetization
models are also utilized,

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.290
and each ties very closely
back to the storyline.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:40.853
For example, players are able to
help their in-game protagonist

00:25:40.853 --> 00:25:42.770
through watching ads for
character accessories

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.200
and upgrades, or purchase
gems through IAPs

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.850
to purchase similar items.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.800
Or players can get
both needed currencies

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.010
through becoming their diamond
members and subscribing.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.160
By focusing on creating a good
storyline for their players,

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.950
Playgendary is able to split
their in-game currencies

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:04.090
and content among different
variations of revenue models.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:06.240
So in terms of
creating gamer loyalty,

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.340
Playgendary stresses
the importance of having

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.340
a consistent revenue
heartbeat with Live Ops Having

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.580
a casual/hyper-casual game did
not rule out the importance

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.590
of keeping a really good
lockup system in their game.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.220
As you can see from the graph
that they've shared with us,

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.700
Playgendary was able to utilize
one Live Ops event to re-engage

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.040
the players who had
installed their games three

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.110
to four months ago previously.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.820
How they do this is
split into two types.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.710
So we have the free
holiday content

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:37.230
events that follows
the holiday calendar,

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:40.810
and we have the paid
new mode star available.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:44.560
For the non-paying buyers,
free Live Ops events

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.020
are used to re-engage
the players,

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.380
new or old, into letting them
know that the developer still

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.180
cares about the player.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.980
So fresh new content
is being pumped

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.850
into the game in general just
to create more excitement

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:58.960
for the player.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.462
But even though this
is a free event,

00:27:01.462 --> 00:27:02.920
it doesn't rule
out the possibility

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.422
of increasing revenue
throughout this Live Ops event.

00:27:05.422 --> 00:27:06.880
We can see from
what they've shared

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.600
with us that the blue bar
represents all the game packs

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.950
that are present regularly.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:15.040
And the red bars are the
effects of the revenue

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.410
through during this
free Live Ops event.

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:20.320
So it's also a good way to
be able to create new paying

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.480
buyers.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.072
So, of course, paid
content therefore

00:27:25.072 --> 00:27:26.530
is the most direct
way to stimulate

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:30.250
your overall monetization for
your players, new and old.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.220
So this is the method where
you can also create excitement,

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.470
but at the same time
create more places

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.980
where people are able to
engage and become a new buyer.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:45.640
Overall the Live Ops account for
40% of their total IAP revenue.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.980
So, as Playgendary has
shown through their games,

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.310
having more content
creates more possibility

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.230
of adding different
revenue streams.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.060
With the flexibility
of allowing players

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.150
to choose how they can
consume in-game content,

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.730
as well as creating Live
Ops events to ensure player

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.950
engagement and
re-engagement, Playgendary

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.870
was able to see
a healthy revenue

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.650
stream regardless of the
different genres they have.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.520
Playgendary focus
on gaming experience

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.770
and setting up that
in-depth content has also

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:14.220
allowed Playgendary to use
multiple business models that

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.380
are complementary but
also substitute-able

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.910
for their players
to choose how they

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.975
like to experience their game.

00:28:19.975 --> 00:28:21.600
And with this I would
like to introduce

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.892
my colleague, Moonlit, who
will be sharing with you how

00:28:23.892 --> 00:28:27.466
a mid-core game was able to
find success with reward ads.

00:28:27.466 --> 00:28:29.906
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:34.980
MOONLIT BESHIMOV:
Thank you, Serena.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.130
Hello, everyone.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:37.558
My name is Moonlit.

00:28:37.558 --> 00:28:39.600
I'm a business development
manager at Google Play

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.270
Games based in Mountain View.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:46.020
Today I'll be sharing with
you the story of Kongregate,

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.100
how they're able to
boost their revenue

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:53.680
by leveraging ad monetization
across a portfolio.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.400
Kongregate is an indie publisher
based in San Francisco.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.030
They have a portfolio of
games of diverse genres,

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:03.700
ranging from casual to mid-core.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.620
Diversifying their
business model

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.590
is the company-wide
strategy, as they

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.630
believe it's a
great way to drive

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:17.200
substantial incremental revenue
without much cannibalization.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.920
When we say ad
monetization we think

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.800
about casual and hyper-casual.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.490
No wonder, as most of these
games on the market do

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.890
rely heavily on ads for revenue.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:34.090
But what about deeper
mid-core games?

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:37.210
Would ads work for
these genres as well?

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:40.670
Kongregate decided to find out.

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:43.500
Through experimentation
with an open mind,

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.200
they found that with
the right design

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.870
principles ads actually work
really well for mid-core genre

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:50.240
as well.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.730
Of course, this does
not mean that ads is now

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:54.860
the primary source of revenue.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.420
But, as you will see in
the next few minutes,

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:00.470
the revenue as well
as engagement gain

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:04.160
could be substantial.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.140
Now, before I dive into
the how, in true Google

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:10.830
and Kongregate fashion,
let's look at the data.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:13.530
Across Kongregate's
portfolio of games

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:16.530
they've seen that ads have
boosted their annual revenue

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.970
by 20% to 30%.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.260
And this is without
IAP cannibalization.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.350
Moreover, depending
on the game, ads

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:29.950
can contribute up to 10%
to 70% of total revenue.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.350
So how do they do it?

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:32.610
Two things.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:37.260
First, Kongregate launched all
new games with ad integration

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.490
since Q4 2016.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:42.780
And two, this
growth is the result

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:48.670
of intentional ad integration
and deliberate ad management.

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.430
Now, let's double-click
on the ad revenue.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.220
They found that rewarded
ads has a large market

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:59.540
share on mobile, which is 70%
to 80% of all ads revenue.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.190
Therefore, rewarded ads
is what we'll focus on

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.295
in the next case study.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.800
Now, regardless of genre, there
are four design principles when

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.410
we implemented rewarded ads.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:15.970
First, for the ads to be
part of player's habit,

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.850
tie the entry points into the
core loop of the game play.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:23.330
Second, rewards that's
meaningful in how

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:25.290
players progress.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:29.880
Make sure the rewards also scale
as players advance in-game.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.600
For example, if you only gave
out a fixed amount of currency,

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.930
and as players
level up this amount

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:41.360
will quickly become
negligible as players level up

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.940
and in-game inflation kicks in.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.720
Third, in terms of
placement the ads

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.340
should be accessible
for everyone.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.010
Ideally on the main home
page, but ensure it's

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:56.730
not intrusive or detrimental
to the user experience.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:01.100
And last, make sure that the
experience itself is also fun.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.860
Inject some humor and
delight by tying it

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.960
into the fiction
of the game world.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:10.820
The case study we'll
look at together

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.080
is from Animation Throwdown.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.980
It's a mid-core
card-collecting battler game

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.850
that Kongregate launched
in September of 2016.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:23.000
Together we'll walk through
three different ad units that

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.490
have been added in
the game over time,

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.370
as well as their
impact in the KPIs.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.550
The first ad unit was
available at launch.

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:35.800
It's a standard ad
unit that provided

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.440
better rewards for
all battles played

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.910
while the bonus is active.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:44.030
Let's tie this back
to design principles.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:47.890
First, the ad unit reinforces
the core game mechanic

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.330
of battles.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:52.240
Second, the reward also scales.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.770
Because it's applied
as a percentage,

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.760
thus it remains relevant
regardless of which level

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.630
the player is at.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:01.720
And the third,
this ad design also

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:05.410
encourages repeated
engagement, as players

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:09.130
can stack the bonuses by
watching multiple ads.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.160
The second ad unit was
inspired by the game

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:20.290
Burrito Bison, which is a casual
game in Kongregate's portfolio.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:24.370
Burrito Bison added an ad
unit that was very successful

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:26.200
called the pinata.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.050
As the name implies,
you reward something

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:32.070
by randomly drop the rewards.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.910
Now, after seeing the great
results from Burrito Bison,

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.600
the Animation
Throwdown team also

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.880
implemented this
in their own game

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.730
by randomly dropping
locked ad crates

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:47.440
as battle rewards, which can
be unlocked by watching an ad.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.020
Now, let's tie this back
to design principles.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:55.000
First, this ad once again
reinforces the core game

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.190
mechanic of battles.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:02.135
Second, because the
reward is randomized,

00:34:02.135 --> 00:34:05.530
it can scale depending on
what level the player is.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.360
The third ad unit was
added more recently.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.820
Now, one of the core game
mechanics in this game

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.130
is allowing players
to combine two cards

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.920
into a more powerful combo.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:25.670
But this combo has to first be
discovered through research.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:30.650
Knowing that players engage with
the research slots every day,

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:34.400
the Animation Throwdown team
added a third research slot

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.250
that is only
activated through ads.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.730
They also set clear expectation
that, to activate the research

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:43.730
timer, players will
have to tap a button

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.739
to start watching an ad.

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:49.830
Now, tie this back to
the design principles.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:53.130
First, once again, this
reinforces the core game

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:56.219
mechanic of tech improvement.

00:34:56.219 --> 00:35:00.210
Second, in terms of placement,
the ad research slot

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.780
is prominently placed next
to the other research slots.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:08.070
But again, the user initiates
the ad-viewing experience.

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:15.090
Now, let's look at
the KPIs and impact.

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:18.270
The two most important
metrics for rewarded ads

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:22.830
is, first, the number of ads
viewed per player per day.

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:26.220
As you can see on this graph
here, from the original reward

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.010
bonus--

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.410
which is the blue bar--

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:31.560
to adding the second ad
crate-- the green bar--

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.500
they were able to increase
the number of ads viewed

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.740
per player per day to
the target of seven

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.350
and remain stable since.

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.180
But you might be
wondering, why didn't it

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:46.230
grow more with a third ad unit
added, which is the research

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.410
[? slot in ?] the yellow bars.

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:51.670
Kongregate told me that
it's actually very important

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:55.240
to keep this metric
steady and balanced,

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.240
as to not overwhelm the players.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.510
Therefore, they designed
the ad experience such

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:05.110
that the reward and
benefits is optimized

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:08.480
when players watch between
six and eight ads per day.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.610
The second important
metric is ad engagement.

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:19.780
Well, how many players watched
ads as a percentage of DAU?

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:23.620
This is the metric to
maximize within each game.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:27.940
Strong engagement counts on
diversifying the ad units, thus

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.010
to increase the percentage
of players engaging.

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:34.600
And this is why Kongregate
designed three ad units that

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.940
were just covered earlier.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.240
Looking at this graph you
see that adding two more ad

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.210
units increased the
ad engagement number

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:46.950
to 60%, which is their target.

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:50.360
Even though Animation
Throwdown is a mid-core game,

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.675
this number is actually on
par with other casual games.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.570
Now, if you're thinking about
diversifying your business

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:04.650
model with rewarded ads
or in-game subscriptions,

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:07.890
I have some exciting updates to
share with you from our product

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:09.280
team.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:12.420
I'll share new features
in two categories,

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.500
three will help you find
new buyers, and three more

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.510
to help you retain them.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:19.790
Now, some of these
features are only available

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:22.730
through close beta
right now, so feel

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.640
free to take a picture of the
slides when there are links

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:29.010
to the early access
into forums available,

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:31.250
or you can stay in touch by
following the Google Play

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:34.580
newsletter.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:38.840
First, a feature that'll
help you find new buyers.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.480
Google Play has
partnered with AdMob

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.700
to make it even easier
for game developers

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:47.510
like you to integrate
rewarded ads in your games.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:49.850
Introducing the
rewarded product,

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:52.910
which is Google Play's
offering of rewarded ads.

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:57.050
You can try it in your games
without any additional SDK

00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:58.960
integration.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.450
You can find it on your
Play console today.

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:02.700
It is not available.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.870
It is open beta.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.380
Now, for those of you who
are already using AdMob,

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.560
this remains to be the most
fully-featured way offered

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:15.070
by Google to integrate
rewarded ads in your game.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:16.600
More on this after this session.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.280
The second new feature
around new buyer acquisition

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.570
is about subscriptions.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:28.200
This feature is available
in closed beta right now,

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.090
and that's the link.

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.320
Subscribe, then install.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.730
It's a new feature we're testing
that will allow your players

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:39.660
to subscribe directly in
your Play Store listing page

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.640
while the game
gets auto-installed

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.450
in the background.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.220
The third and the latest and
greatest of new subscription

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.920
feature is allowing
your future buyer

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.100
to start their subscription
by directly redeeming

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.890
a gift card or a promo code.

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:04.000
This feature is also
available through closed beta.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.650
Now, onto new features that
will help you retain buyers

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:12.090
by reducing voluntary
cancellation.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:17.370
First, in the cancellation flow,
we now allow players to pause

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:20.120
is an alternative to canceling.

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.300
As you can see here that
players have the option

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:26.200
to pause for one,
two, or three months.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.080
Pause will be publicly
available in a few months.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.680
Now, if they still
decide to cancel,

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.055
this might be a good time to
create a win-back offer that

00:39:38.055 --> 00:39:40.800
will let your players
continue their subscription

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.510
at a discount.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.720
This feature is
available in closed beta.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:51.140
Last, if they still
decide to cancel,

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:54.950
understanding why it's a
good win-back strategy.

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:57.530
Last year we launched
a cancellation survey

00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:59.330
to provide you with
the insights of why

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:02.240
your subscribers are leaving.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:07.610
We found that 74% of users chose
to respond, with 10% of them

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:11.030
actually give a
free formed answer.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:14.510
The survey results are
available through API query now,

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.270
and these insights will be added
to your Play Consoles soon.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:24.690
Now, I should think about the
takeaways for this session.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:28.450
I have three wishes for you.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:31.840
First, I hope you
found the inspiration

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.270
to reinvent your
monetization strategy.

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:38.920
Second, I hope you believe
now that your past doesn't

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.060
necessarily dictate your future.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.820
And last, I hope you will
all go back to your teams

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.930
and ask, how can
we diversify more?

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:53.920
I am excited to see
how you will innovate

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.650
and defy conventional thinking.

00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:00.220
Would it be through business
model diversification,

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:04.650
regardless of genre,
or maybe more?

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:06.660
Thank you, everyone.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.750
Next I'd like to introduce
Duke, director of product

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:13.713
from AdMob to go deeper on that.

00:41:13.713 --> 00:41:15.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:19.210
DUKE DUKELLIS: It's amazing
to see the science and the art

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.460
going into rewarded ads, and
I think about the journey

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.030
that we've been through.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.070
So I need to do a
statistical question.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:26.590
How many of you are fans--

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:29.796
like, raging fans-- of ads?

00:41:29.796 --> 00:41:32.090
I'm seeing 80%, 90%.

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:33.220
I'm seeing 110%.

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:33.720
OK.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.320
It's amazing.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.310
Remarkable.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:36.680
So I am Duke.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.660
I lead mobile app
monetization for the ads.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:44.480
It's been quite an
amazing period of time.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.580
So for those of you who
didn't put your hands up,

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.705
we're going to talk through
a couple pro tips here.

00:41:48.705 --> 00:41:50.570
I'm going to see how
many hearts and minds I

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:54.050
can shift to embracing it.

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:56.210
And the truth is, when
done right it can actually

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.250
improve some experiences,
which is something

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:02.120
that we're pretty
amazed to find that.

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.520
You saw some of those
experiences come before,

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.990
and really it's
around psychology.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.610
Today I'm going to
talk about three tips

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:11.700
that are very focused on this
evolution of the industry

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.110
and what we're seeing out there.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:14.300
And at the end we're
going to check back.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:15.967
We'll do another
statistical sample here

00:42:15.967 --> 00:42:17.840
and see if we
shifted that from 80%

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.370
to the rest of the 100% of you.

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:20.870
All right.

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:23.690
So first tip is about building
this into game design.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:27.320
You saw some of that in
the sessions we just had.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:32.510
And if you do this right you can
actually make users feel good.

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:33.775
They're getting something.

00:42:33.775 --> 00:42:35.900
They're earning something
extra that they otherwise

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.730
felt like they could
not have gotten.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:40.200
And that's terrific.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.440
But you could also
build revenue streams.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.130
Now, we saw all this happening.

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:44.970
It's been going.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:46.020
You saw the experiences.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:49.430
So we put our heads
together and we really

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:55.520
thought about how can we
make this easier for you.

00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:01.310
And right now we have a huge
base on AdMob and Ad Manager,

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:03.750
and we said, well, for
those of you not on there,

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:07.080
what can we do to get this into
your hands as fast as possible?

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.210
And we're just watching
this chart grow and we said,

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:12.920
who else can we reach out to?

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.520
And there's a whole
segment of developers who

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.410
really have been IAP focused.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:20.300
And I think back
two years ago where

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:24.620
a lot of those discussions were
really, don't touch the app.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.615
IAP is everything.

00:43:25.615 --> 00:43:27.740
And I'm going to talk a
little bit more about this.

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.140
This has shifted remarkably
in the last two years.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:33.600
I mean, this has been
really remarkable.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.290
So the first step we've
taken-- and you just

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:39.363
heard this before-- was
getting rewarded ads in play.

00:43:39.363 --> 00:43:41.030
So this means if
you're already offering

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:42.810
IAP you can do it very quickly.

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:44.370
So I'm going to show you--

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:46.157
here's a screenshot
of the Play console.

00:43:46.157 --> 00:43:47.990
And you'll notice the
tab over on the right.

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:49.920
So there are these
rewarded products.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.220
And one of those rewarded
products is rewarded ads.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.390
So this is as simple as,
instead of choosing an IAP price

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:58.520
you choose an ad.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.970
An ad is the cost.

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.850
That's the cost that
the user is paying here.

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:03.790
And it's that simple.

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:05.470
So that's awfully darn easy.

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:07.480
We're really excited to
see how this is going.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.480
We've been running it
through some beta programs

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.590
and now we're announcing
the open beta right now.

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:12.090
OK.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:12.880
Let's move on.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:13.840
Number two.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:18.100
So, supplementing
IAP revenue with ads.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:23.020
So what we're seeing
is, developers

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.150
who use this combination--
yes, the numbers are all

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:26.358
going in the right direction.

00:44:26.358 --> 00:44:28.360
You add ads-- and
again, this is a shift

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:34.900
of thinking from just IAP or
just ads to go, how can we

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.940
put these two things together?

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:39.970
And rewarded ads, again, is one
of these areas where it just

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:40.880
changes the mold.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.490
And if you think
about-- initially it

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:44.860
was about banners or
native, find the space,

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:45.610
and interstitials.

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:48.850
You put them between, and
rewarded has really just

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:51.070
been something different
because it's that opt-in.

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:52.540
It's that I choose
to do something.

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.660
I choose to do this.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.610
So here's Cookie Jam.

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:01.510
It's just a really
terrific developer.

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:03.910
And they've really put
these two things together.

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:06.580
They put these boosters in.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:10.710
And over the over long-term--
so here's the remarkable part.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:15.310
They're using the free
rewarded experience

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:17.208
to drive an experience
that then people say,

00:45:17.208 --> 00:45:19.000
I like that experience
so much I'm actually

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.060
willing to pay for it.

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:20.560
OK?

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:24.610
So they're seeing an uplift
in IAP with rewarded ads

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:27.760
being the trial way in.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.160
And they're also seeing
the users who never would

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.230
have made any money for them.

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:33.940
Which, by the way, in
most of these games

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.762
tends to be an awful
lot of those users.

00:45:36.762 --> 00:45:38.220
They're watching
rewarded ads which

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.240
means they're generating
advertising revenue.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.160
So this is where--

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.870
this breaks the mold.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:47.500
Like, this is not a
pure, oh, show ads,

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:48.810
user experience declines.

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:50.740
That's not necessarily
what's happening here.

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:53.590
In fact, we're seeing a drive
towards better monetization.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:56.620
And that's just really
terrific to see.

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:57.120
OK.

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.310
So let's move on to
tip number three.

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:01.303
So non-spending players.

00:46:01.303 --> 00:46:03.220
So this has been the
really interesting piece.

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:03.840
And I'll go back--

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.507
two years ago I was talking to a
number of different publishers,

00:46:06.507 --> 00:46:10.080
developers around, hey, we know
you make a lot of money on IAP,

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.050
but really how much?

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:15.720
And we heard things
from 1%, 3%, 5%, 10%.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.120
That's the number
of users in my base,

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.560
or the percentage
where I'm making money.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.320
It turns out the rest--

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.710
so sometimes that's
80%, 90%, more--

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:26.730
are not making money.

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:29.563
That's a net cost for your
app, for your service,

00:46:29.563 --> 00:46:30.480
if you're on a server.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.830
They're sort of costing money.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:34.620
In some places that makes sense
because of networks and such.

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.050
But in many cases they're
sitting there going,

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.600
I really want to
monetize that group,

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:45.120
but I want to take no chances
on this other group of users

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.388
who are paying me money.

00:46:46.388 --> 00:46:48.180
I just can't afford to
take the risk there.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.340
So again, we went to
work here and we thought,

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.640
how can we do this?

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.710
So what if there was a
way to segment out smartly

00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:00.200
the users who are going to
spend and don't show them

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:04.970
this ads experience from the
users who are almost certainly

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:07.770
not going to purchase?

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:11.370
And those users we want to go
ahead and put the personalized

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:13.820
ad profile, and that's how
we'll make money off of them.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.156
And it's that simple.

00:47:15.156 --> 00:47:19.410
So here's an example.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.770
You've got the game on the
left in mission overview.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:23.932
And we segment this, we look.

00:47:23.932 --> 00:47:25.640
We use our machine
learning to figure out

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.870
what's going on here.

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:27.690
Who's the spender?

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:28.190
OK.

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:30.440
They follow the
path up at the top.

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:33.780
Who's not the spender?

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:35.730
Unlikely to make a
purchase, very unlikely

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:36.668
to make a purchase.

00:47:36.668 --> 00:47:38.710
We send them through, we
give them ad experience.

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:44.030
so we've tailored this to
the profile of the consumer

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:48.420
and how they prefer to
help pay for the app.

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.270
So this is pretty big
news because now we're

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:56.530
taking a risk-free approach
to generate more revenue here.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:58.710
So, it's a first step.

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:00.170
It's really easy to do this.

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:01.920
When you go create an
interstitial ad unit

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:02.830
right now--

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:06.180
this is what we've
announced we're launching--

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.310
there's a box that says,
smart segmentation.

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:10.010
It's that simple.

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:12.550
And then what we do is
we go ahead and look.

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:14.230
We use our machines
to go figure out who

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:16.120
are the spenders, the
likely spenders, who

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.920
are the unlikely
spenders, and then

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.500
we just start doing this
for you automatically.

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.103
It's as simple as a checkbox.

00:48:22.103 --> 00:48:24.270
OK?

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:25.650
And we've seen-- yeah.

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:26.470
Here's an example.

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:28.890
We've seen 30% increase
on ads revenue site

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:33.710
because they've been introducing
ad units that they before

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:37.107
were afraid to introduce because
it might have impacts on IAP.

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.060
So that's what I've got.

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:43.900
They're pretty
quick and tactical,

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.755
but can make a huge difference.

00:48:45.755 --> 00:48:48.130
And I actually find these
things just so revolutionary to

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:50.420
where we were one
year, two years ago.

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.608
So, number one was,
really think about how

00:48:52.608 --> 00:48:54.775
this rewarded fits into the
game and the psychology.

00:48:54.775 --> 00:48:57.220
You heard that through
the sessions before.

00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:02.260
You can go to the
rewarded play option

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.570
and you can get that design
and placement up, like,

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:05.320
immediately.

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.850
You can test out
what things work,

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:09.320
what things don't work
without a lot of integration.

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:13.620
Number two, you can
supplement that IAP revenue

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:18.010
with the rewarded and
probably grow your IAP

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.140
if you do this right.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.150
And then number three,
our smart segmentation

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:23.830
offering-- now it's a checkbox.

00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:24.730
It's that simple.

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:26.530
Don't put any of
your IAP at risk.

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:29.020
And you have a
chance to monetize

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:31.730
90% plus of your users
who aren't spending.

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:33.250
So it's a real win.

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:37.000
So, that said, I need to do
another statistical sample

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.170
here.

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:42.140
Show of hands, who now
is a raging fan of ads?

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:42.640
OK.

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.060
Yes?

00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.010
This is overwhelming.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:46.480
I feel the love.

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.920
This is great.

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.720
[INAUDIBLE] I think
it just comes in

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:54.970
to really talk about how
successful this whole area has

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:55.520
been.

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:58.300
And the more we can put these
tools and these products

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.380
in your hands to make
money, just the happier

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.630
it really makes the team here.

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:04.560
So thank you all for that.
