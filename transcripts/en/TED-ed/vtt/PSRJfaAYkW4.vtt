00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:09.401
A mosquito lands on your arm,

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:13.831
injects its chemicals into your skin, 
and begins to feed.

00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:18.103
You wouldn’t even know it was there,
if not for the red lump that appears,

00:00:18.103 --> 00:00:20.882
accompanied by a telltale itch.

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:24.037
It’s a nuisance, but that bump 
is an important signal

00:00:24.037 --> 00:00:26.932
that you’re protected 
by your immune system,

00:00:26.932 --> 00:00:31.881
your body’s major safeguard 
against infection, illness, and disease.

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:35.961
This system is a vast network of cells, 
tissues, and organs

00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:40.524
that coordinate your body’s defenses 
against any threats to your health.

00:00:40.524 --> 00:00:45.611
Without it, you’d be exposed to billions 
of bacteria, viruses, and toxins

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:51.262
that could make something as minor
as a paper cut or a seasonal cold fatal.

00:00:51.262 --> 00:00:55.883
The immune system relies on millions 
of defensive white blood cells,

00:00:55.883 --> 00:00:58.002
also known as leukocytes,

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.583
that originate in our bone marrow.

00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:04.279
These cells migrate into the bloodstream
and the lymphatic system,

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:08.892
a network of vessels which helps 
clear bodily toxins and waste.

00:01:08.892 --> 00:01:11.354
Our bodies are teeming with leukocytes:

00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:17.071
there are between 4,000 
and 11,000 in every microliter of blood.

00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:20.588
As they move around, leukocytes 
work like security personnel,

00:01:20.588 --> 00:01:25.620
constantly screening the blood, 
tissues, and organs for suspicious signs.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.121
This system mainly relies 
on cues called antigens.

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:34.254
These molecular traces on the surface 
of pathogens and other foreign substances

00:01:34.254 --> 00:01:36.985
betray the presence of invaders.

00:01:36.985 --> 00:01:39.003
As soon as the leukocytes detect them,

00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:44.084
it takes only minutes for the body’s 
protective immune response to kick in.

00:01:44.084 --> 00:01:46.275
Threats to our bodies are hugely variable,

00:01:46.275 --> 00:01:49.445
so the immune response 
has to be equally adaptable.

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:52.674
That means relying on many 
different types of leukocytes

00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:55.685
to tackle threats in different ways.

00:01:55.685 --> 00:02:01.396
Despite this diversity, we classify 
leukocytes in two main cellular groups,

00:02:01.396 --> 00:02:04.005
which coordinate a two-pronged attack.

00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:06.606
First, phagocytes trigger 
the immune response

00:02:06.606 --> 00:02:11.406
by sending macrophages 
and dendritic cells into the blood.

00:02:11.406 --> 00:02:15.655
As these circulate, they destroy
any foreign cells they encounter,

00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:17.855
simply by consuming them.

00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:19.696
That allows phagocytes to identify

00:02:19.696 --> 00:02:22.576
the antigen on the invaders 
they just ingested

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:26.027
and transmit this information 
to the second major cell group

00:02:26.027 --> 00:02:27.976
orchestrating the defense,

00:02:27.976 --> 00:02:29.739
the lymphocytes.

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.246
A group of lymphocyte cells called T-cells
go in search of infected body cells

00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:37.467
and swiftly kill them off.

00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:40.468
Meanwhile, B-cells and helper T-cells

00:02:40.468 --> 00:02:43.477
use the information gathered 
from the unique antigens

00:02:43.477 --> 00:02:48.036
to start producing special proteins 
called antibodies.

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:50.287
This is the pièce de résistance:

00:02:50.287 --> 00:02:54.837
Each antigen has a unique, matching 
antibody that can latch onto it

00:02:54.837 --> 00:02:56.728
like a lock and key,

00:02:56.728 --> 00:02:58.897
and destroy the invading cells.

00:02:58.897 --> 00:03:01.268
B-cells can produce millions of these,

00:03:01.268 --> 00:03:04.308
which then cycle through the body 
and attack the invaders

00:03:04.308 --> 00:03:07.460
until the worst of the
threat is neutralized.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.859
While all of this is going on, 
familiar symptoms,

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.078
like high temperatures and swelling,

00:03:12.078 --> 00:03:16.620
are actually processes designed 
to aid the immune response.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.029
A warmer body makes it harder for bacteria
and viruses to reproduce and spread

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:24.169
because they’re temperature-sensitive.

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.088
And when body cells are damaged,

00:03:26.088 --> 00:03:30.298
they release chemicals that make fluid
leak into the surrounding tissues,

00:03:30.298 --> 00:03:31.619
causing swelling.

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:34.000
That also attracts phagocytes,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.969
which consume the invaders
and the damaged cells.

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:42.090
Usually, an immune response 
will eradicate a threat within a few days.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.659
It won’t always stop you from getting ill,
but that’s not its purpose.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.099
Its actual job is to stop a threat

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.111
from escalating to dangerous 
levels inside your body.

00:03:52.111 --> 00:03:54.601
And through constant 
surveillance over time,

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:57.128
the immune system 
provides another benefit:

00:03:57.128 --> 00:04:00.460
it helps us develop long-term immunity.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.480
When B- and T-cells identify antigens,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.821
they can use that information 
to recognize invaders in the future.

00:04:07.821 --> 00:04:11.901
So, when a threat revisits, the cells
can swiftly deploy the right antibodies

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:15.201
to tackle it before it affects 
any more cells.

00:04:15.201 --> 00:04:19.381
That’s how you can develop immunity 
to certain diseases, like chickenpox.

00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:21.771
It doesn’t always work so well.

00:04:21.771 --> 00:04:24.201
Some people have autoimmune diseases,

00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:25.852
which trick the immune system

00:04:25.852 --> 00:04:29.652
into attacking the body’s own 
perfectly healthy cells.

00:04:29.652 --> 00:04:31.981
No one knows exactly what causes them,

00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:36.161
but these disorders sabotage 
the immune system to varying degrees,

00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:38.542
and underlie problems like arthritis,

00:04:38.542 --> 00:04:39.961
Type I diabetes,

00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:42.082
and multiple sclerosis.

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:44.100
For most individuals, however,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.162
a healthy immune system will successfully
fight off an estimated 300 colds

00:04:49.162 --> 00:04:54.384
and innumerable other potential infections
over the course of a lifetime.

00:04:54.384 --> 00:04:58.441
Without it, those threats would escalate 
into something far more dangerous.

00:04:58.441 --> 00:05:02.374
So the next time you catch a cold 
or scratch a mosquito bite,

00:05:02.374 --> 00:05:04.144
think of the immune system.

00:05:04.144 --> 00:05:05.993
We owe it our lives.
