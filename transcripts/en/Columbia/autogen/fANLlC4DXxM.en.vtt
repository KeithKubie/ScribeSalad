experience for us was the day we had the

00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:29.149
experience for us was the day we had the
 

00:09:29.149 --> 00:09:31.240
experience for us was the day we had the
conversation in the spring of 2008 about

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:31.250
conversation in the spring of 2008 about
 

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.310

the book and conceptualized it and then

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.320
the book and conceptualized it and then
 

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.680
the book and conceptualized it and then
had a few follow-up conversations the

had a few follow-up conversations the
 

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.170
had a few follow-up conversations the
result the the the conception of what we

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:38.180
result the the the conception of what we
 

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.710
result the the the conception of what we
wanted to do in the book from those few

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:41.720
wanted to do in the book from those few
 

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.569

questions as I say from the chair or the
floor well I have just a couple of

00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:55.319
floor well I have just a couple of
 

00:15:55.319 --> 00:15:57.499
floor well I have just a couple of
questions then I'll just open it up for

00:15:57.499 --> 00:15:57.509
questions then I'll just open it up for
 

00:15:57.509 --> 00:16:00.619
questions then I'll just open it up for
everyone else one question I have you I

00:16:00.619 --> 00:16:00.629
everyone else one question I have you I
 

00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:02.569
everyone else one question I have you I
mean you you rely very heavily on

00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:02.579
mean you you rely very heavily on
 

00:16:02.579 --> 00:16:06.199
mean you you rely very heavily on
interviews and I wonder how many of

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:06.209
interviews and I wonder how many of
 

00:16:06.209 --> 00:16:08.929
interviews and I wonder how many of
these interviews occurred during the

00:16:08.929 --> 00:16:08.939
these interviews occurred during the
 

00:16:08.939 --> 00:16:10.549
these interviews occurred during the
campaign and how many of them occurred

00:16:10.549 --> 00:16:10.559
campaign and how many of them occurred
 

00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:14.710
campaign and how many of them occurred
afterwards because I would think that

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720
afterwards because I would think that
 

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.939
afterwards because I would think that
people working campaigns would have a

00:16:16.939 --> 00:16:16.949
people working campaigns would have a
 

00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:18.619
people working campaigns would have a
very different way of talking about it

00:16:18.619 --> 00:16:18.629
very different way of talking about it

we'd interview them and then we'd
interviewed them later and often they

but all of those campaigns sort of had a

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640
but all of those campaigns sort of had a
 

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.780
but all of those campaigns sort of had a
meltdown and I just wonder why you think

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:47.790
meltdown and I just wonder why you think
 

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.030
meltdown and I just wonder why you think
or do you have a sense of is this just a

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:51.040
or do you have a sense of is this just a
 

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.100
or do you have a sense of is this just a

out to be a really terrible campaign or
 

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.320
out to be a really terrible campaign or
is there something about this election

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:01.330
is there something about this election
 

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.090
is there something about this election
that made it excel and unusually

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:03.100
that made it excel and unusually
 

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.560

effectively I think there's a there's
 

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.700
effectively I think there's a there's
some truth to both those things

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:08.710
some truth to both those things
 

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.160
some truth to both those things
certainly the the the length of the of

certainly the the the length of the of
 

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.750
certainly the the the length of the of
the process you know how long these

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760
the process you know how long these
 

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.180
the process you know how long these
people had a campaign for was certainly

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:15.190
people had a campaign for was certainly

part of the put a huge amount of stress

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960
part of the put a huge amount of stress
 

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.250
part of the put a huge amount of stress
on everyone involved that you know the

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:20.260
on everyone involved that you know the
 

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.830
on everyone involved that you know the
extraordinary demands of fundraising all

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:22.840
extraordinary demands of fundraising all
 

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.990
extraordinary demands of fundraising all
of those factors but you know I think

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000
of those factors but you know I think
 

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.540
of those factors but you know I think
it's a fair observation to say that they

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:27.550
it's a fair observation to say that they
 

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.910
it's a fair observation to say that they
were all that there are plenty of train

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:29.920
were all that there are plenty of train
 

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.250
were all that there are plenty of train
wrecks in those campaigns what's

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:32.260
wrecks in those campaigns what's
 

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.290
wrecks in those campaigns what's
interesting about them I think at least

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:34.300
interesting about them I think at least
 

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.340
interesting about them I think at least
from our perspective what was so

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:35.350
from our perspective what was so
 

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.660
from our perspective what was so
interesting about them was the ways in

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:36.670
interesting about them was the ways in
 

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.670
interesting about them was the ways in
which the the the train wrecks had

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:38.680
which the the the train wrecks had
 

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.230

different kind of characters they look

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240
different kind of characters they look
 

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.050
different kind of characters they look
different from campaign to campaign and

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:43.060
different from campaign to campaign and

were both I think surprised to report it
 

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.630
were both I think surprised to report it
to learn as we reported the book just
