00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
[Captions by Y Translator]
Today, we're taking a look
at movie theater popcorn

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.740
versus homemade popcorn.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.800
Is it possible to perfectly
replicate the movie theater recipe?

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.600
And if so, does it
cost more or less?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:17.280
[Music]

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.700
The popcorn in this bucket right
here is from a movie theater.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.500
I bought it less than an hour ago,
and it's quite good stuff.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.100
The goal today is
to replicate this popcorn so

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.600
that it looks the same, smells the same,
and most importantly, tastes the same.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.500
We're going to show you what
we used to get that kind

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.700
of popcorn here at home.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.400
The basic idea here is simple.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.900
By cooking good quality popcorn
in the right kind of oil

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.460
and adding the right kind of flavoring,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.600
you get popcorn that tastes exactly
like what they serve at the movie theater.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.600
There are some important ingredients
and equipment you need to get

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.900
this kind of popcorn,
but don't worry.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.620
None of it's very expensive.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.160
First off of course,
you're going to need some popcorn,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.800
and it might seem at
first like all popcorn

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.500
is going to be the same
after all in the container,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.800
it pretty much all looks identical.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.700
But I have had noticeably better results
using better quality brands of popcorn.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.500
I'm not saying you have to use this one,
but this is a good brand,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.180
and there are other good brands,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.700
and I do think
that they work better

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.200
than just the cheap store brands.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.300
Next, we need to be able to cook
our popcorn in something,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.900
and there's lots of ways to cook popcorn.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.000
You can cook it with hot air.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.160
You can cook do with oil.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.740
You can actually just
cook it in the microwave,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.300
as long as the dish it's in can handle
being in the microwave that long.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.200
We're going to use oil
to cook our popcorn,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.440
and not just any oil,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.980
we're going to be using coconut oil,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.140
and just because it adds a little bit
of this delightful movie theater color,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.180
we are using coconut oil
that has been dyed with beta-carotene.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.400
Beta-carotene is nothing more
than a plant based color.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.900
It's found naturally
in the plants.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.300
It's extracted, and then they
add it to the coconut oil

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.300
so we can have this nice
butter colored popcorn.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.540
Next up is an ingredient that
is pretty brand-specific.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.960
This is called Flavacol.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.100
It's a powdered salt that
has butter flavoring added,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.400
and this is kind of the magic.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.100
This is what gives our popcorn
that movie theater butter taste.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.900
It has almost the exact same color
as our coconut oil,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.000
but it doesn't transfer the color as much,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.200
so it is important
that we have the color

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.162
in the coconut oil if we want
our popcorn to look authentic.

00:02:04.752 --> 00:02:06.600
This stuff is
a really fine powder.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.100
Much finer than most salt,
and a little bit goes a long way.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.100
Finally, once our popcorn is popped,
we have some movie theater butter oil

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.500
that we pour on top of it.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.460
And this is just an oil that
has a butter flavor to it.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.800
Occasionally, they used
some real butter in them,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.780
and this, you pour on top of your popcorn

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.500
if you like that extra
buttery flavor and texture to it.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.300
Those are the ingredients
were going to be using,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.800
and I said that there are
multiple ways to cook popcorn,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.900
but it is actually
pretty important how

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.240
you do it in this case.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.900
We need to cook our popcorn
in the coconut oil,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.360
and we need to do it in a pot
that stirs the popcorn as it cooks.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.200
This is just
a thin aluminum pot.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.700
But the lid that goes
onto it has a handle

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.400
with a gear that goes down onto this.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.180
So as we turn the handle,
it actually just spins down inside the pot.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.100
There are multiple popcorn cookers
that use similar mixing techniques.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.100
Some of them are electric.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.300
You can actually buy some miniature
theater-style popcorn makers that you

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.500
can just put in your home theater,
or your living room,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.600
if you like popcorn that much.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.500
This particular one uses
no electricity and it's pretty cheap,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.700
which is why we're using it.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.540
To get started with a batch of popcorn,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.280
we are going to use
2 tablespoons of our coconut oil,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.800
1/4 cup of our popcorn,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.800
and one teaspoon of our flavored salt.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.300
We're not going to add
it all at once though.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.200
We'll start with the coconut oil,
put that on the stove, heat it up,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.800
and once it's all nice and liquid,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.000
then we add the popcorn
and the flavored salt.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:47.200
[Music]

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.800
Now that our coconut oil is all melted,
we're going to add 1/4 cup of popcorn,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.100
and that doesn't seem like much.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.560
It's not even going to completely
cover the bottom of the pot,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.400
but it'll do a pretty good job
of filling this once it's popped.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.000
If you have a bigger or smaller container
that you're cooking your popcorn in,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.200
you can add more
or less to match.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.200
We're just trying to get a good ratio
for the oil, the popcorn, and the flavoring.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.440
Speaking of which, it's time
to add one teaspoon of our flavor.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:27.160
[Music]

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.260
Alright.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.400
Things are getting hot.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.780
We're going to close the lid
and stir it as it pops.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:43.960
[Music]

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.260
Alright, the popping
has mostly stopped.

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:48.022
Time to take it off the heat.

00:04:48.022 --> 00:04:51.700
[Music]

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.860
That's looking good.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.200
Now, there is going to be some flavor
because we poured in the flavored salt.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.020
However, if you like
a little bit stronger of the flavor,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.300
you can add a little bit more.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.400
Some people like it weaker.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.640
Some people like it stronger.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.700
I'm definitely not going
to do a whole teaspoon again,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.832
that would be probably too much.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.620
We'll start with
about half a teaspoon.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.700
Just sprinkle some
of that down on top.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.040
Not even using that
whole half teaspoon.

00:05:13.662 --> 00:05:15.200
Just going to pour this
into our serving bucket.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.360
[Music]

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.300
Now, if you are the kind of person
that likes to have the butter oil

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.700
on top your popcorn,
it's time to add that.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.560
I wouldn't go
overboard with it.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:41.260
[Music]

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.700
Time for our comparison test.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.740
Here, we have our authentic
movie theater popcorn,

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.840
and here we have our home-brewed
movie theater popcorn.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.800
First Impressions is
that I think we actually have

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.500
a little bit better color
from the homemade popcorn.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.500
They smell pretty
much the same.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.900
There's a little bit more
of the smell coming off of this one.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.200
I think it's because the movie theater
popcorn was popped about an hour ago

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.700
at this point, whereas this
was popped about five minutes ago,

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.320
and it's still warm.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.760
So there's like some steam
coming off of it, but the smell,

00:06:09.852 --> 00:06:11.000
although there's more of it from here,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.492
it does smell pretty much the same.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.880
Of course, the real test
is how does it taste?

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.440
Movie theater popcorn.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.040
Tastes like the artificial butter
of movie theaters,

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.160
which is delicious.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.300
Home-brewed popcorn.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.340
That is almost
exactly the same.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.900
Very, very similar taste.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.200
You can buy popcorn that says
it's movie theater flavor

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.700
in microwave packets
at the grocery store and stuff.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.800
To me, none of those
have ever really tasted

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.200
like movie theater popcorn
the same way this stuff does.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.100
If I went to a movie theater,
and they served me this exactly,

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.600
I'd be super happy with it.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.940
Movie theater popcorn
is legendary for being expensive.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.920
This right here is probably
about the smallest size popcorn

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.080
you can order at a theater,
at least it is in mine,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.400
and in my theater, they charge,
I think it's about $6.75 for a small,

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.220
whereas using the ingredients that I did,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.300
what I popped up cost
about 86 cents of materials,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.460
and that's the more expensive side.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.500
Getting these little containers cost
more than if you get big containers,

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.900
and if you go through popcorn a lot,
maybe you've got a big family,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.100
you do movie night a lot,
you definitely want to get

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.832
the bigger containers,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.940
and that would bring
the price down even more.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.700
This stuff is particularly cheap.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.500
It's just over $8 for this.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.700
But because you use so little,
I calculate you should be able

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.100
to make about 140 batches of popcorn

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.700
with one of these containers.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.820
One more cool thing though,
is when you buy this flavored powder,

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.480
there's actually an option
to get it in a pack of three.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.000
One that is for glazed popcorn,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.160
and one that is for
caramel glazed popcorn.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.620
This is sort of just
a sugary sweetened popcorn,

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.100
and this is a really good caramel popcorn
that you cook almost the exact same way

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.120
as the regular popcorn.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.300
Let's whip up a batch of that
and see how it looks,

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.200
just I really like this stuff.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.100
Now, we do need to use quite a bit more
of the caramel flavoring than we do

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:04.900
for the butter flavoring.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.500
This has sugar and caramel
flavor all mixed into it.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.312
You can see it's
much larger grain.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.000
Kinda looks like sand actually.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.260
Tastes a lot better
than sand though.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.560
For 1/4 cup of popcorn kernels,
we're going to use about 3/16

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.052
of a cup of the caramel mix.

00:08:20.052 --> 00:08:23.600
3/16th is not a common
measuring cup size.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.100
What that really comes down to is
that we're going to take the quarter cup,

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.280
and fill it 3/4 of the way full.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.900
Now, as this heats up it,
will begin to melt all

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.500
of that sugar and caramel
mixture that we just poured in,

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.400
and then when the popcorn pops,
it gets coated in the melted sugar mixture.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.020
However, it is better
if we leave the lid closed so, sorry.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.320
[Music]

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.700
Random Fact: Grains of popcorn
around a thousand years old

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.920
have been found in tombs in Peru.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.600
The kernels are so well preserved,
they can still be popped.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.300
Caramel-coated goodness.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.100
Light, crispy, crunchy,
caramely popcorn goodness.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.580
It's just like you're going to buy
at a state fair or something.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.500
Super good, super easy to make.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.860
Movie theater styled popcorn,
and caramel corn made at home,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.680
it's cheap, it's easy,
and it's fast.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.000
This barely takes any longer than
cooking popcorn in the microwave.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.160
Maybe one minute more, it's super quick,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.620
and like I said,
it makes really good popcorn.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.900
If you want to get started making
movie theater style popcorn at home,

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.600
check the links in the description
for where to get everything you need.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.100
Wonder if you could just
carry this into a theater,

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.900
and be like, Oh, yeah.
I bought this a few minutes ago.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.620
I just walked outside for something...

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.200
Guys, the fun doesn't end here.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.600
That box at the top
will transport you

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.600
directly to our last video,
and you should go check that out,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.600
and the other box will show
you what YouTube thinks you

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.300
should be watching next.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.800
And if you are not a subscriber yet,
just hit this bomb in the middle

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.780
to join the club.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.300
That way, you'll never
miss out on a video.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.500
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see you in the next one.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.200
Talk to you then.
