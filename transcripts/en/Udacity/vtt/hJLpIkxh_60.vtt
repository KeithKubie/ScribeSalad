00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.150
Our columns work pretty well, but

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.970
if we start putting text in them, you can see that things get pretty cluttered.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.400
It can be really difficult to read when the words are so

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.580
close to each other in adjacent columns.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.950
In design, we have a concept called negative space.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.798
That is to say, space that doesn't contain anything.

00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:20.650
On the Udacity website, we can see pretty easy examples of negative space.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.230
Between this text here in this paragraph and this icon,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.020
we have this empty space that makes it easy for this text to stand out.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.770
It makes it much more readable, the page feels less cluttered, and our brains

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.980
don't have to work as hard to figure out what this page is trying to tell us.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.000
To make this paragraph more legible, let's go into Dev Tools and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
add some padding.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.400
I will right click, go to inspect element, and we can see that

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.510
we're selecting this paragraph, this p tag which corresponds to this text.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.890
And, to make changes just to this piece of text,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.760
I'm going to go to element.style.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.900
So this is only going to affect this paragraph, I can click in here and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.750
start typing.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.520
So let's add the CSS class padding and we'll do ten pixels,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.800
that sounds pretty good, and I'll close this.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.710
Notice that the red box around the paragraph didn't change, but

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.890
there's some extra space here, already making it much easier to read.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.540
Padding is a great strategy to create some negative space between elements.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.820
But, what if instead of creating space inside the element,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.970
we wanted to create space outside the element.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.460
To do that, we'll use margins.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.380
First off, I refresh the page.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.770
Then I'm going to right click here, and go to Inspect Element.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.630
So, once again, we're looking at the same paragraph, but

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.530
things are back to normal.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.840
Let's make a change.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.890
Now, this time we want to push it away from other elements, so

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.310
we'll use a margin instead.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.140
Margin 10 pixels, why not?

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.470
Press Enter and close Depth tools, and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.160
now notice how there's a red box around the paragraph that has some

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.480
extra space on the outside between it, and the column four.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.340
This is called a margin, padding was on the inside, margins are on the outside.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.560
This is another great way to create some negative space between elements.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.890
If you're ever confused about what's creating the space around an element,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.480
you can actually look it up in Dev Tools.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.510
If you scroll down to the bottom of this CSS lists, we can see the box model for

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.810
the entire page here.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.060
We've got a margin of eight pixels, which we can see highlighted.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.350
Then we have a border of 0.8 pixels.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.220
And then inside the border,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.710
we have, well, no padding, because we don't see any numbers here.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.490
And, then we can see the size of the screen.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.530
Using the box model is a great way to figure out how elements are being laid out

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.720
on the page.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.200
If this black box were an element on the page, we've got options for

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.570
spacing it out against other elements.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.500
Margins let us push elements away from each other,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.630
while paddings create space internally.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.830
In the example we just looked at, we just used the generic margin and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.330
padding to affect all four sides of the element, but we can also add a side to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.230
get a little bit more specific, using either top, bottom, left, or right.
