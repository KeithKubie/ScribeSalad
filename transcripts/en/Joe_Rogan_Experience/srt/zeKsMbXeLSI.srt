[inaudible] [inaudible]

9
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,960
ladies and gentlemen,

10
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,920
the lovely and talented Mr

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,230
Bill Burr has joined us. He's going
on. How are you? How are you fella?

12
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,870
I'm fantastic. I'm enjoying my
coconut water. This is shit, isn't it?

13
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:17,390
It's going to be all product
placement. Yeah, it should be three.

14
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,260
They sent me a couple of cases of
this stuff. It's fucking awesome.

15
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,930
Do you know something? If anybody
else offered me a coconut water,

16
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:25,900
I wouldn't have done it. I'd be like,
that sounds like some gross, uh,

17
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,640
Vegan whole shit at. But just because it
was you when you always read like that,

18
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:31,390
you know, dude, I was on a, you know,

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,200
fucking coconut science.com read this
whole thing about it so well somebody just

20
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:37,991
stops man.

21
00:01:37,991 --> 00:01:41,890
Once after Jujitsu classes at Duda I work
out with brought like a whole bunch of

22
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:42,724
them to class.

23
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,230
Was it an apology after he body
slammed you with something here though?

24
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,740
I have some coconut water
though. Nice gesture, but it's
fucking delicious. It's a,

25
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,040
it's, it doesn't feel, it doesn't,
it's not as boring as water,

26
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,830
but it doesn't feel like you're drinking
juice or something where it's like

27
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,630
heavy and Sarah be and
you know what I mean?

28
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,110
That I absolutely still shit. I'm gonna
love it. And this, this stuff is healthy.

29
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,350
Yeah. Yeah. That's really good for
seriously, if you drink a lot of Gatorade,

30
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:08,600
see I drink a lot of
Gatorade cause I drink a lot.

31
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:11,630
So I've kind of switched my
Gatorade out for coconut water.

32
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,800
That's all I drink when I work out.

33
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:17,801
Now how I drink Gatorade if I get the
stomach flu or like a food poisoning or

34
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:21,740
whatever the hell I had. Like yeah, like
last week. Yeah. They have PTO light.

35
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:22,030
That's,

36
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,100
that's something that's actually even
better for you because it's all balanced

37
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:28,070
out. Like when guys dehydrate, when
they cut weight, they drink pedialyte,

38
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,810
isn't it for me? I don't
have any kids. Yeah.

39
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,530
Everybody who has a kids was just
saying, no, no, no, not gateway.

40
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,440
Do you want to get PDO?
Like why does that,

41
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:36,020
that the beginning of
that word just scared me.

42
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:39,770
He just having a beard and not having any
children being a Caucasian, I can't go.

43
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:43,370
You don't even that Pto light for the
pdf file over here. My names in the mix.

44
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:47,140
Carrots, the name's not, that's a
little unfortunate, right? Media Light.

45
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,800
It should be, you know, some sort of
a super electrolyte drink. You know,

46
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,260
obviously means kid like pediatrician.
Well it's,

47
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:57,290
I think it's designing for it
for children when they get sick,

48
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,010
if they're dehydrated because you
want to make sure that they get enough

49
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,460
electrolytes or fucks them up. Yeah. You
know there's plenty of kids out there.

50
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,730
There are. Look at the one
there. Oh dear. Your own bill.

51
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,380
You'll see and you'll see when they had
half looks like you and no matter how

52
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:13,630
bad your day is,
when you to [inaudible]

53
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,140
people used to say that your
two minutes to drive me nuts.

54
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,570
You'll see when you have young kids
would be like, we shut the fuck up.

55
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,340
You're all wrapped up
in your own bullshit.

56
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:23,920
You got this little fucking human being.
It was an accident.

57
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:27,220
You shot a load into a woman.
The A's divided. Come on man,

58
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:31,620
what the fuck are you talking about? Half
looks like you and half the trick, man.

59
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:35,020
It's a fucking biological trick,
but then you have one. You Go, Whoa,

60
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,940
this is a different,

61
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,090
I never considered the amount of
responsibility and attachment and just the

62
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:43,780
biological attachment you have to them.
Oh No, no, I'm not. I'm not crazy.

63
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:47,410
I'm not saying that it is an amazing, oh
no, I know you're not. No, you're not.

64
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,700
A lot of times I say things, I say things
and they become misconstrued. Yeah,

65
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,510
you build.
It doesn't like that.

66
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,050
Slurping by the way is just for all you
fucking getting angry that I slept my

67
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:02,830
coffee. I get all these people
emailing me easy drinking. You cough,

68
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:05,200
you mute the microphone.
When he drinking

69
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,633
during your pants.

70
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,760
I gotta admit that's one of my pet peeves.
When I watched your movie.

71
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,170
I hate if there's a scene where
the actors are eating. I hit mute.

72
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,740
I can't listen to it because they fucking,
you know actors,

73
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:22,070
they've got to make an interesting,
they can't just eat. They got up,

74
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,490
we're going to fucking fucking robbed
the bank and they start throwing shit in

75
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:27,780
their mouth and it drives me nuts.

76
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:32,100
Just the sound of somebody's lip smacking
or like when you're a car with a girl

77
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:34,830
that you just got in a fight with and
she's eating Doritos and get to hear it

78
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:38,580
like echoing off her skull, the crunching
noise issues. This mother Fucker,

79
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:39,963
he turned that into

80
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,730
shit. Yeah, he went to his own
life. I have a fucking pet peeve.

81
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:47,890
It's a weird one, but when I
see someone eating in the movie,

82
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,610
I secretly hoped they had to do a hundred
fucking takes and they all threw up.

83
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,700
I can can't keep eating because
it just seems so forced.

84
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,890
You know you're eating while you're
having this conversation, you know,

85
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:59,780
like what you were saying. No, we're going
rubbers, folk on break. He's got a mouth.

86
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,620
I'm on point with the bread was shit.
You wouldn't do it.

87
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,190
People will fuck is pointing with
their sandwich. He'd be like,

88
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,590
this guy is an asshole.
He's one.

89
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:12,830
He's fucking sandwich at me and telling
me what's going to happen some way.

90
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,770
You know? That's some
weird intimidation. Shit.

91
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,320
You ever have someone fucking talk to
you and in the middle of we had talking,

92
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,160
they put a hand on your knee, squeeze
your knee while they're talking to you.

93
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:23,140
It's like,
what is happening here?

94
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,490
I got it. I got a couple of those.
I mean, one time I liked it.

95
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,530
I was shooting a pilot for some show
that never got picked up and it was,

96
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:35,390
it was hilarious because, uh, what the
hell happened? Basically what they wanted,

97
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:37,400
an edgy show, you know, all
these things always start.

98
00:05:37,401 --> 00:05:40,460
So we give them this edgy
show and right around,

99
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:43,340
right before we did the run through the
don imus thing went down what he said,

100
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:46,850
nappy headed hoes.
So the industry gets so terrified,

101
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,960
it's not even just about radio now
becomes about this frigging pilot.

102
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,470
So they were already
nervous about the jokes.

103
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:57,030
So we went in there and one of
the first jokes was, um, I dunno,

104
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,130
some homeless guy comes up and as you
know me for some change, um, you know,

105
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:02,770
on the liberal guy, no,
no, I don't want that.

106
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,840
And the other guy was a republican guy
and he turns around and he flicks ice

107
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:08,030
cream and it hits them right in
the face. It was hilarious. Right.

108
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,410
So they basically,

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,830
they freaked out and then they didn't
laugh at any jokes who are doing this run

110
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,370
through and do it. I'm telling you,
we're absolutely bombing. Okay.

111
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:19,640
Now to me it's hilarious and it's not
even that big a deal because I've bombed

112
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:23,610
horrifically by myself. I'm bombing
with the group. It's funny. Easier. Yes.

113
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm walking into scenes and the other
actors, I see the deer in the headlights,

114
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:28,910
I'm almost laughing.
And the more it bombs,

115
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:31,690
the harder I'm committing to these jokes.
So anyways,

116
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,440
so the whole thing tanks and
by the end of it, you know,

117
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,900
me and the other guy like,
dude, I'm getting fired. He's
like, no, I'm getting fired.

118
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:39,380
So he ended up going back to the hotel
and everybody shows up to talk about it

119
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,410
and you know the creators of the show,

120
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:44,600
I'll come walking in along with
the director and I'm standing up.

121
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,140
I let him to run,
the fucking director comes walking in,

122
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,870
sits down in my bed and then reaches over,
had some pain,

123
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:53,750
it's there and just grabs a handful
and start and starts eating.

124
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,320
And I just wanted to be like, yeah
dude, yeah, make yourself at home,

125
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:00,410
have some fucking peanuts. But I was
so in that I'm going to get fired.

126
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,940
I was trying to be the nice guy.

127
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:04,840
And that's like one of those things that
slowly killing me is every once in a

128
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,350
while like, you know,
it was like years ago,

129
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,200
I'll be driving down the highway and I
just think of that motherfucker sitting

130
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:12,590
down eating my goddamn peanuts, and I
talked to you about it and you're like,

131
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:16,250
dude, that's like some Alpha male shit.
He comes into your placement live.

132
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,510
He starts eating your food.

133
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,140
That is a weird thing that people do.

134
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:22,260
Some people just open refrigerator
and start eating. I don't like that.

135
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,080
Now that drives me nuts.
The only person that I mind,

136
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,850
I don't mind it is Brian Cowen and
Joey and Joey always ask Brian Cowen,

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,340
I'll come in my fucking kitchen.
This dude's Eaton Pumpkin Pie.

138
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:35,760
He's got whip cream on it and shit. I'm
like, you, you broke up the whip cream.

139
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,850
You made yourself a plate of Pumpkin
and you broke out the whip cream and

140
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:41,640
everything. I got all mine with
Brian, Brian's my brother. I mean,

141
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,810
he can do whatever the fuck he wants.
Doesn't bother me, but it's still crazy.

142
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,090
I wouldn't do it if I'm over your house.
Somebody I'm gonna need.

143
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,970
You don't even get a drink water. I'm
going to wait. I'm going to ask you. Hey,

144
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,760
can I have a water? I know you're going
to say yes, but I have to ask you.

145
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:56,250
I'm not gonna eat your fucking
Pumpkin pie and put whipped cream

146
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,070
pill. Then I could let go
of chef, stuff like that.

147
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,220
I'd like a high school teacher called
me the dumbest kid in the room and I'll

148
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:05,220
still think about that.
There was a 20 something years ago.

149
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,260
I have the same issue.
I talk about it on stage.

150
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:11,520
I reenact arguments from 1997
screaming at your windshield.

151
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,080
That's what I do now. Now let me tell
you something. Math teacher. Well,

152
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,910
I'm glad I over all the years though,

153
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,240
although all the stupid ideas that
I've had about arguments in my head,

154
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,610
I've avoided all physical altercations.

155
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,380
I've never had a physical altercation of
kid. I've had situations where, you know,

156
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:31,260
a long time ago, I wish I told this
guy that or I wish I told them this,

157
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,310
but the reality is it's way better
than I didn't cause what if he went,

158
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:36,270
well fuck you.

159
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:39,420
And then he fucking throws a rock at me
and then all of a sudden were two men

160
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:42,270
biting each other. You don't,
you don't go that route.

161
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,710
Wrestling in the street like fucking
children. You know what the fuck is that?

162
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,480
When I was a kid, my dad came home from
work once with a fucking black eye.

163
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,850
My Step Dad's business was going,

164
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,050
it was falling apart and at one point
shit got squirrelly in him and his partner

165
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:02,400
fucking duked it out
is crazy. Yeah, he can.

166
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,750
Youtube wasn't around then.
You know,

167
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,000
there'd be some sort of
security who was like, Whoa,

168
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:10,440
aren't you looking your fucking forties
it's like, what is happening? It was,

169
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,130
it was disappointing.
Embarrassing. It was sad.

170
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:15,810
It was a bunch of different
things all at once.

171
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,470
It was bad ass on any level that your
stepdad could still throw down. No,

172
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:22,740
he could. I think he got his ass kicked.
I'm pretty sure that's embarrassing.

173
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:27,030
I'm sure. I'm pretty sure he got sucker
punched and then uh, he hit the guy back.

174
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:29,490
He punched the guy in the stomach,
but I don't know who punched who first,

175
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:31,050
but it's just fucking pathetic.

176
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,260
This guy was his friend and this guy used
to come over to the house and we used

177
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:37,170
to, you know, we all still
have family dinners together.

178
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:39,500
Like him and his wife would come
over to the house and there was,

179
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,750
this is my dad's partner and then all of
a sudden they're fucking duking it out

180
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:45,870
at work. Cause the, the business
fell apart. Who was very,

181
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:49,860
very strange to come over for dinner again
or no, they became friends again. Yeah,

182
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:52,230
they, they, they stayed
friends. You know, they just,

183
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,840
they've duked it out as friends
and then they stayed friends.

184
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,180
But it was just embarrassing
and he was embarrassed to,

185
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,360
he felt like such a fucking idiot. He
came home with a black eye, you know,

186
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:04,140
it's like, what am I dealt with? Ayroni
man to read, pick up the friendship.

187
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,860
It'd be easier if I won the fight,
if I lost the fight,

188
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:10,540
that would be in the back of
mind. You want the rematch? Uh,

189
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,530
at some point you get used to,
when you do Jujitsu a lot,

190
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:17,550
you get used to getting beat comes formal.
That's a different thing.

191
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,020
They're going to fight and then like, hey,
let's, let's try these techniques. It,

192
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,351
you know,

193
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:25,710
if like what if we had some big argument
about we were going to combine our

194
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:28,920
podcasts and then it just didn't go well
and I didn't give you the money for the

195
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:32,640
microphones and then we duked
it out and you somehow lost.

196
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:37,110
I somehow surprised you and it had
all feel like one in a million chance.

197
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:40,920
I somehow caught you. I would feel
way stupid or that we're fighting.

198
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,250
I would feel way stupid. Other
than that, it's my buddies. I know,

199
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:46,910
but you're martial artists that
get it yet, but just right now

200
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,090
go in peace. You've got
[inaudible]. It's always worth,

201
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,400
you wouldn't see me in there and like I
got my back turned you down and my head,

202
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:58,890
I'd be like, what bill? How
can you host me in the face?

203
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,590
Did that Ron Howard look and
Jackie has that wouldn't bug you.

204
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,140
Depends on if you really just told me up.

205
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,450
Like all of a sudden you
just fucking unload like uh,

206
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,510
a one to leg kick combination
on me and robbed me.

207
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,860
You hit me with a liver shot and dropped
me in a, and then I had a tap out. Yeah.

208
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:16,200
Then I'd probably want some sort
of a rematch. Let me ask you this,

209
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:19,320
which really upset,
which you lose a belt class.

210
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:23,130
Would you have to go back down to Brown
belt? Purple Belt? You don't lose,

211
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,000
I mean the only way you get the ideas that
you're a certain level of proficiency,

212
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:28,560
but it doesn't mean that
someone can't get you.

213
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,250
What if I started tapped all the time?
If my face do your Dojo,

214
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,720
there's no way you'd have
to lose out when a bill

215
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,680
who's next and I'm just sitting there
with a stupid look on my face. You know,

216
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,430
competition is healthy.
I think it's fun and everything,

217
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,170
but when it gets in the real world,

218
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,600
like as far as like fighting
people and shit like that,

219
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,430
it's too squirrely because
you don't just fight someone.

220
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,640
They get mad and they come back and they
want to bring a baseball bat or fucking

221
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:01,060
stab you or shoot you. I never
fought outside my family past June.

222
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,130
Outside class you in

223
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,820
junior high? Oh yeah, let's get
started getting to be like, you know,

224
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,300
buck and a quarter and like knew
how to becoming coordinated through.

225
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,650
I saw one kid take a pounding
and I was just like, yeah,

226
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:14,620
I'm sticking with the jokes. It
was this kid who, he was Jack,

227
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:18,040
he's one of those man childs, you
know, and like in like eighth grade,

228
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:18,520
you know they aren't,

229
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,520
they could like beat up the teacher but
then they get to high school and they

230
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:23,650
just stopped growing and then
they're just this little fireplug.

231
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:26,530
But in eighth grade that's like the,
that's their peak.

232
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,610
And this kid was at his apex of,

233
00:12:28,611 --> 00:12:31,100
of physical fitness and he
was fighting this doughy,

234
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,310
this baby who we looking kid and they
go to get off the bus and baby who is

235
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:40,990
behind Manchild and he just, you know,
he just pushed him down from behind,

236
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,450
jumped,
got on his chest and it was just,

237
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,450
he just started teeing off of his head
and it was one of those, you know,

238
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:48,580
when people go crazy and
then it becomes disgusting.

239
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,510
Like the crowd was just like,
oh. And I was just like,

240
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,770
he was just beating the fuck out of him.

241
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,500
He didn't come to school for the rest of
the week and he came back the next week

242
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,940
and the swelling in his face, he had
come down probably 80% but he listens.

243
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:05,560
Manchild still didn't look
and he had a look in his eye.

244
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,850
I remember his confidence
was shaken. I'm I, it was, it
was amazing, man. I was like,

245
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:10,750
you saw it was a,

246
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,810
it was a moment in his life and I remember
just looking at that going, yeah, yeah,

247
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,230
def, it was funny because I
almost went out with that baby.

248
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:20,080
He was a kid I would've gotten
killed. And he's like, he just,

249
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:25,000
he would have stabbed me with
the, the fucking kid. No,

250
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:27,700
he used to get bullied
and he just, I dunno, uh,

251
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,800
he was used to getting the crap kicked
out of him by people like two years older,

252
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:34,510
which is basically
you're in seventh grade.

253
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:39,490
Like that two years is a
huge jump physically. And uh,

254
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:42,500
it's like you're sitting there, you
know, like, okay, I'm going to fight you.

255
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,130
And the other guys, like you
got like a beard, you know,

256
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,960
smashing you over the head. So, um, yeah.

257
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:53,290
So all my fights were basically within
my family and I had four brothers,

258
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,590
so I used to practice on my three younger
ones and then try to take my older

259
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:58,780
brother where the psychological
advantage over me. So

260
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,220
all the brothers always have
an advantage. Yeah. I can beat.

261
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,180
I had a friend who's a older brother,

262
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:08,181
used to beat the fuck out of him and it
tortured him late into like adulthood.

263
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,420
He was in his late thirties and it
was fucked. It fucked his head up.

264
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,490
He always wanted to get
back at his brother.

265
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,860
He used to go over his brother's house
and his brother wasn't home and steal

266
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:20,190
shit from him. Like he would go like
his wife, his brother's wife was there.

267
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,920
He'd say hi.
And again,

268
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,810
John told me to go pick something up
and you'd go in and just steal from his

269
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:28,260
brother was still in friendship rather
than the other way the fuck out of him.

270
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,540
His brother beat the fuck out of them.

271
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,090
My brother was like two years older
and just used to just box him up.

272
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,360
He used to fucking really hurt them
and intimidate the shit out of him.

273
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:38,480
I got one for Ya.
I went last time I fought

274
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,000
my youngest brother, uh, I forget
where we went out and about.

275
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:45,150
My Dad came in to break it
up and like a piece of shit.

276
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,190
I did one more over my dad's shoulder,

277
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,910
caught them and it made that classic like
Hollywood should have rec recorded the

278
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,010
sound for like the punch in the face was
that classic but like with a little bit

279
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:58,550
of lip sounds caught him
right in the mouth. And uh,

280
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,930
I knew what bugged him and then what
would it for like 15 years we would be out

281
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:07,100
drinking. And like when he
got on his third drink, I
would feel him sizing me up.

282
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,910
I felt it.
I felt that I was just going,

283
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:11,810
is this in my head or is
this dude sizing me up?

284
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,990
And then like years later I'm drinking
with my other brother and we were talking

285
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:18,230
about, and I'm going, yeah,
he doesn't think I noticed,
but I feel him size and up.

286
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,910
He goes, oh yeah, dude. He goes, every
time I drink with them, he brings that.

287
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,060
And like by then he was a little bit
taller than me and he had that, that,

288
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:29,780
that anger and stuff. But, uh, I just
want to, I want to just tied them up.

289
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,670
Like I got to a point where I just,
you know,

290
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm going to strategy play that you
had dug out of the sucker punch.

291
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,140
Get the clench.
Yeah.

292
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:41,030
My older brother came at me a baobab
11 years ago and like a red roof inn.

293
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,240
It was some, some sort of bullshit. Uh,

294
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,090
and he came flying at me, you know, my
brother is no joke. He can fight and I,

295
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:51,740
I just tied them up.
I had been,

296
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,130
but I had the advantage where he
has a real job so he has to work.

297
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,040
I can sit here and going on hikes
and going to the gym and stuff.

298
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,850
So I was in cardio, I was in better
shape, so I just, I just tied them up.

299
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:06,510
Hello Jeff. Time up for not, not long
too. And he was like, he was teen.

300
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,360
Second was liking cubicle shape. He
had like that initial, I'm going to,

301
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,500
I'm going to kill you. But
this is the thing though, if
he would have, if I didn't,

302
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:18,310
uh, tie him up. Yeah. That's all
I, it's, it's like in hockey when,

303
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,370
when someone goes out on a fight,

304
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:21,020
they just grabbed the guy
in like bear hug them.

305
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,340
I just thought it did that and I was, uh,
how was it? He was kind of on top of me,

306
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:27,650
but I just, I just said I'm sort of
smothered in there. I was like, dude,

307
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:30,260
I'm not gonna find nothing. Can he
didn't talk to me for a year. Wow.

308
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,160
You didn't talk to me for a year. And what
was he mad about? I don't, it was, dude,

309
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,450
it's that family shit. Some,
I dunno, something from 1974.

310
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:41,300
I'm glad I don't have bread off cause I
would not want to grow up with someone

311
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,190
like me if I was a brother,

312
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,250
if I either like one or two things would
have happened would have been either we

313
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:51,251
would join an alliance and fucking start
a team take on the world and tag team

314
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,520
chicks or we would fight to the death.
It's going to be one or the other.

315
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,650
I don't really see any of
the other options. Yeah.

316
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,170
So which one's going
to be fucker? Yeah. No,

317
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,620
I think there's a reason why you
didn't have a brother. Cause I,

318
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,950
whenever I talked to him,
he has like,

319
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,830
you'll have like a couple of parakeets
and they somehow have a fight to the

320
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:11,210
death. Like, dude, I don't know what's
with Perkins. They just go at it too.

321
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,540
It's like you're way more mellow.
When I met you in the nineties dude,

322
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,450
this guy was like in game seven energy.
It's so fun.

323
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,950
Everyone keeps on saying that the way,
way more mellow.

324
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,210
I think we're just now feel comfortable
to tell him now. Is that what it is?

325
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,040
Not [inaudible] you're now so
mellow. We can talk about it. No,

326
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:38,300
but I was way more angrier when I met him.
You know what I mean?

327
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:40,790
It's one of those things while
you're, you're, yeah, you're, yeah,

328
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,180
your twenties you're processing what
the fuck just happened to you when your

329
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:46,280
first 20th hopefully you had a
good childhood. If you didn't,

330
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:48,800
you end up in show business
or whatever and then you know,

331
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,220
you kind of thinking back

332
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,430
to that stuff. So, yeah. You know?
Yeah. I'm kind of just realizing how,

333
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,650
how much of a difference it must be for
people because so many fucking people

334
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:00,540
bring it up and I try to think like,

335
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:05,220
what the fuck I was like when
I was younger that I don't
think I was a Douchebag,

336
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,820
but I definitely think I had
douchebag tendencies. You know,

337
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,360
like if you were a Douche
bag to me I could just go
full douche right back at Ya.

338
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,390
And it gets stuck in some stupid ass
douchey argument that really rationally I

339
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:20,340
shouldn't have been caught into it.
Like your energy man,

340
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:23,160
you are on the balls of your feet,
you will fucking ready.

341
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,630
It was like your energy was like
you had just gotten into a fight.

342
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,080
Well you met me.
I was only probably when,

343
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:36,060
what do you mean when I 96 96.
Wow. That's a lot of years later.

344
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,660
That so's thinking you probably met
me earlier in the nineties when I, uh,

345
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,760
my last fight I think was like an 89.

346
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:45,750
I took a while for me to just wind
down as a human being from that,

347
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,940
just from the idea of competing,

348
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,630
because most of my life from 15 to
21 was just competing in martial arts

349
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,600
tournaments. That's all I dare you would
like a retired athlete and now you just,

350
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,660
you know,
21 you know,

351
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,580
it's all of a sudden I'm trying to do
comedy and I still have this fucking weird

352
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,100
mind. You know, that's tuned in
for physical plan to hand combat.

353
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,240
You're still in blood.
Sport is so stupid.

354
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:09,000
When I look back and think
about what I have done that now,

355
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:10,080
there's no fucking way.

356
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:14,220
I'm not going to fight somebody for
free and dedicate my whole life to doing

357
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:14,580
this,

358
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,850
traveling around the country and kicking
people in the head like that's what I'm

359
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:21,240
gonna do it and they're going to kick
me travel now. Nobody covers shit.

360
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,100
You had to pay for your
own travel everywhere.

361
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:24,330
He had to pay for your own hotel room.

362
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,190
We sleep like a bunch of
people in a hotel room.

363
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,220
Like one of us would sleep on the
floor. One guy was sleeping, one bed,

364
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:31,620
one guy was sleeping in another bed,
one guy would sleep in that tub.

365
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,840
We just slept a bunch of guys in rooms.

366
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,390
Everyone who was broke and we're all
fighting full contact with no fucking no

367
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,130
protection. I mean you, you,

368
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:43,410
you have like this little
chest protector on your body.

369
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,280
But the really scary thing,

370
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,260
the really scary thing is your feet.
It's not,

371
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,620
it's not punches and it's kicking
someone in the head. It's a scary shit.

372
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,550
So after awhile, what part of
your foot do you use? So it hurts,

373
00:19:56,551 --> 00:19:57,510
the less the least.

374
00:19:57,511 --> 00:20:01,230
Who has you just get used to kick your
head is going to hurt a lot more than my

375
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:02,970
foot is. You know, it, it will hurt.

376
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:06,360
Like I've broken my foot on people's
Shins and a broken my foot on elbows.

377
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,270
But you're, you're, it's like between
like kicking someone in the head.

378
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:11,880
It doesn't really hurt your foot.
And I go out,

379
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:16,881
Family Guy Miller had gone somewhere
and it would be over if you'd catch them

380
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:20,160
with the toes. You see that a lot
in fights. Like it's more of a slap.

381
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,360
But if somebody like solidly kicks you in
the head, man, God, if you do it right,

382
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:26,910
almost everybody goes out.
It's like scary things.

383
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:29,460
I watched those bus route
videos where he just,

384
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,420
I dunno like watching that guy like
he was so everybody was so afraid of

385
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,320
of that liver shot. Oh yeah.
Richard Pryor victim a minute.

386
00:20:36,321 --> 00:20:39,480
But where he talked about how he came out
with his hands high in the guy. Right,

387
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,880
right.
In the next round he comes out,

388
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:44,780
he's going to say elbows down by his
waist and then they're doing this like,

389
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,790
I don't know. I watch his videos and
it's like this amazing like information

390
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,280
and then just completely Hillel
like the guys is Great. We had one,

391
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,360
the podcast I saw that you had that
you haven't listened to a yard.

392
00:20:55,361 --> 00:21:00,100
That guy is fucking a killing machine
and he's absolutely hilarious.

393
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:01,960
Did you see that one where he goes,
he walks in.

394
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,180
If you see somebody fucking your wife,

395
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:09,070
I give him the gun and then I take
out the nine. It's just a hilarious,

396
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,440
he's crazy.
He's the fighting days and he did.

397
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:14,410
He did the bare knuckle Pancrase days
where you weren't allowed to punch to the

398
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:14,980
face,

399
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,070
but you're allowed to punch the body
and you can open palm slap each other in

400
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:20,440
the face. Just so much more
humiliating. Yeah. Yes.

401
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,720
Well he knock guys out like
that and he's such a savage.

402
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,790
He figured out if you just pull your hand
way back and throw it like a punch and

403
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:30,280
they use the palm of your, your fist
instead of like slapping them in,

404
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:32,170
hitting him with the hand,
which is kind of flexible.

405
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:35,950
It gives into the shot of you hit him
with the palm. It's like it's a bone,

406
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,251
it's a,

407
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:38,980
and it's a bone that you really don't
have to worry about breaking unlike your

408
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:41,530
hands. How can you punch someone
in the face? Bare knuckle.

409
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:43,390
You really have to worry about
breaking your hands. Yeah, he's,

410
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,890
people don't realize that.
Like a lot of [inaudible] not stab,

411
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:51,030
Smash Bang, Bang, goodbye thing.

412
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,680
And you know what's funny is
that sound effect is so funny,

413
00:21:53,681 --> 00:21:58,000
but you're watching him. His
form is perfect. Yeah. Oh yeah.

414
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,750
He's got some fucking great stories
about brawls too. You know, he managed,

415
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,580
imagine picking a fight
with that fucking guy. What?

416
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:05,890
I want a giant dantic mistake.

417
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,380
Apparently there was some football
player that got mouthy with them.

418
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,560
Boss accidentally stepped on the
guy's foot and the guy goes, you know,

419
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:14,440
he's a little animated and get a little
crazy and other guy didn't know until

420
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:17,170
afterwards. But you know, boss gets
a little animated and he's at a bar,

421
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:19,870
I guess he was just really loud
and he's fun guy, you know,

422
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,830
and you just tell them some
story or somebody stepped
on this guy's foot and the

423
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:27,340
guy got just really do shit with him. And
he goes, I'm sorry, I apologize. My fault.

424
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:30,040
Let me buy you a drink and the guy
has no fuck you and fuck your drink.

425
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,750
And you're like, got in
his face. And he said,

426
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,600
you want to take this outside of
class room and goes, sure, okay,

427
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:38,020
let's take it outside. And then his
friends come up to him and goes, dude,

428
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:42,020
you know what the fuck you're doing.
Okay. You know, he's just some,

429
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,730
we just a big dude and thought I'm going
to go outside and fuck up this bald guy.

430
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,920
He's got a giant mistake.
Yeah.

431
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:50,770
But this guy is way bigger this because
of football and football players. Man,

432
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,890
I was in Phoenix once,
I was in tamping,

433
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,580
it was going to the Improv
and some fucking kid was
there. Who's a one of the uh,

434
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,250
Arizona state guys who's playing
what professional football now.

435
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,490
He was so big,
right?

436
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,560
Like you don't realize like how big that
kind of big is that Bas Rutten is like

437
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:11,080
215 pounds. That's like, that's nothing
compared to these guys in a bar in Utah.

438
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,560
And there was a guy who
used to play quarterback for
like Oregon or Oregon state

439
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,230
and I was just looking at a guy
going, that's a, that's a quarterback.

440
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,170
That's cause they looked like rag dolls
when they get hit on TV. This guy was,

441
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,830
he was like six, five, like two 40 yeah.

442
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,830
And he was still in shape and
it's like that guy, you know,

443
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,180
if a linebacker comes from behind,

444
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:31,450
he doesn't seem as head snaps back
and he's on the ground like all woozy.

445
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,160
Are you a football fan? Yeah.
Football. Hockey to you.

446
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,980
When you see guys like collide, when
you see like a really bad hit, you know,

447
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:41,140
does it, does it fucking
freak out when you see that?

448
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:44,470
When you see like a guy go out?
Not really in foot. It's hockey.

449
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:46,160
Hockey is because

450
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,740
hockey players, I don't know that
they're as big as football players,

451
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:51,410
but they're going like 15,
20 miles an hour.

452
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,620
I don't know that you can
obviously go faster on skates,

453
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:57,530
but just sometimes like
when guys, uh, you know,

454
00:23:57,531 --> 00:24:00,740
the head shots sometimes in hockey,
if you just watch a guy, you know,

455
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,690
I've seen a couple of guys
that their careers got ended.

456
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,950
Somebody's phone is
somebody buzzing some mung?

457
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,790
I don't even have a phone on me. That's
boss calling in the show. Joe Rogan.

458
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,500
It's bus route then. Yeah. Uh,

459
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,550
your comb is here too, somewhere.
Joe. Does he still have his comb? Uh,

460
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:23,000
laying around here, I probably
got 80 emails about that comb. Uh,

461
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,750
we were going to auction it off. Oh
there it goes. A couple of Buddhas

462
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:33,710
I was telling, I was telling, I'm
sure this is still nice and clean. Um,

463
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,010
it is, he has a blue stuff. He
keeps your use the Tacoma ball hairs

464
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,800
special. No, I played drums and a lot of
times I'll play right before I go out.

465
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:46,340
So it would like the headphones on.
I get like this weird like it's,

466
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,540
it's not even a hat head,

467
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:51,650
it's a head headphone head and it
comes down here on the side so it just,

468
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:54,860
you know, push my hair up
and go like that. So I saw
him would go to what do you,

469
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:58,850
what do you like fucking John Travolta
and racist and all the things that we

470
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:00,560
always wondered who still buys combs.

471
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,160
My dad still carries around a comb
and I always tried to like try it up.

472
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:06,350
Like there's something
to it if my dad uses it.

473
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:10,310
So like I always try to do it but it
does nothing for me. No, you have to,

474
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:14,720
you have to be like over like I dunno,
60 I think at this point.

475
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,330
I think that because you've got
to realize like a lot of them,

476
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,940
like one of the guys like Ted nutrients
and under, they're in their sixties now,

477
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,940
so it's William Shatner
just turned 80 yeah,

478
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,270
the fuck man.
That real freaks me out when someone,

479
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,580
you know what I say so many things
in the podcasts that people tell me.

480
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:34,490
What about you can't be real. No, no, no.

481
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,440
He's like 70 he was, he was like 35 when
he did it. How do you spell his name?

482
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:44,150
William Wallace. A. H. A.
T. N. E. R, maybe not an s.

483
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,360
H Shatner. Yeah, Shah. S. H.
A. T in the year maybe. Okay.

484
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,660
What's truly exposing?
How stupid we are not done.

485
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:53,450
You can beat people and still be
successful in Showbiz. Yeah. It's amazing.

486
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,550
You could be so stupid
and yet still make it.

487
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,510
I remember an agent one time telling
me he gets, you've got some comedian,

488
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:04,150
some huge gigs, some huge
big money playing gay cause
this guy was kind of, no,

489
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:04,984
it's true.

490
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:09,830
He was born in 1931 that is fucking crazy.
It's crazy.

491
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:10,431
What makes sense?

492
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:14,510
Because the star trek was in the
60s so he was thirties thirties.

493
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,750
Well he was kind of sucking in his
gut with that little tidy 30 seconds,

494
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:20,830
go a little bit. And then they were, they
were walking a wig with him back then.

495
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:25,000
I don't know. He still had his hair. Wow.
That's so weird. Ah, I don't know. Yeah,

496
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,340
it was like, it was just going. But he's
got parents. Fuck right plugs though.

497
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,300
Cause you could never really look like
you don't thinks that's not plugs. Oh,

498
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:37,030
what did he get? Oh, it's a toupee.
Yeah. Yeah. That's a, that's a set.

499
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:40,880
Pay as a wig. Whatever. He's cool as
fuck. I let them get away with it.

500
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,990
Those old guys,
like you ever see like Humphrey bogarts

501
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:48,120
wig than he used to wear back in the day.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Pretty obvious one.

502
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,030
Yeah. I'm free. Bogart was going
bald as he was a movie star.

503
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,170
They got him a fucking wig.

504
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,480
Frankly. Jesus Christ, you know. So
I have watched a bunch of his movies,

505
00:26:57,481 --> 00:27:01,860
man. Honestly, bro Grind. I saw a lot of
Frank Sinatra and I know frank liked him.

506
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:04,540
Frank took a lot of his swagger
from that guy nearly. Yeah. Yeah.

507
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,400
If you watch those movies.
Yeah. Yeah. He's got a couple
man, he's got one. I can't,

508
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:09,960
I'm so bad at remembering
the names of movies.

509
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:14,760
He's got one where he calls this girl
out on some female shit that like,

510
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:17,220
you know, I saw it. I was like,
that shit happened to me last week.

511
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:21,270
Just totally calls her out when she tried
to change the subject about something

512
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:25,500
and it was, it was just, it was awesome.
Say That's not what we were talking about.

513
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,110
Naw, he, but he wasn't back. This story
he had that he didn't know that was,

514
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:31,290
what was it like Edward G.
Robinson?

515
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:37,530
Shitty accent. So w w was it like
hit no, his, he had just more,

516
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,290
I can't do an impression of the guy,
but he had just more of a laid back.

517
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,640
He just would,

518
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,550
she just would be sitting in a scene
looking at you and you just immediately

519
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:45,420
felt like,
oh shit.

520
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,760
Movies where the guy would get mad, he
would fucking smack the check. Yeah,

521
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:53,230
that's what they used to do. I think they
did it on Archie bunker, didn't they?

522
00:27:53,231 --> 00:27:55,710
They would never consider it watch.
She didn't, Archie hit Eden's.

523
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:59,220
She got really mad at him I think so she

524
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,960
was really upset. I remember that Shit.
I just sort of vaguely remembers you.

525
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,470
We're not making this up.
I think I remember that too.

526
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:13,000
I think there was so long ago that's,
that's tricky. Wanted it to happen.

527
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:13,720
You know you're home.

528
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,800
Every cell in your body except your
neurons gets replaced every seven years.

529
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,980
So your memory, where the fuck is you
memory stored? Is it in your brain?

530
00:28:20,981 --> 00:28:24,220
Is it in your neurons? Is it
nonlocal? Nobody really knows.

531
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,980
So when you look back on a memory
that you had from like 20 years ago,

532
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,630
who knows what the fuck,

533
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:33,660
whether you've made that up on the story
of a memory that you use to remember

534
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,080
and he created something new.

535
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,080
You know who lived in,
no,

536
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,730
I know what you're saying because I've
listened to guys tell stories about stuff

537
00:28:40,731 --> 00:28:43,610
where I was there. And I was just like,
I don't remember it like it. Yeah.

538
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,410
Well people were, remember the
guy in the sale, people, you know,

539
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,460
we want our living room.
Are you talking about no brow.

540
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,350
We just won the lottery.
You don't remember

541
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,250
just came back from a
banding on a Ustream. Um,

542
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,220
I was banned yesterday for throw.
Showing a phone. Showing a thong. Yeah.

543
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,230
What? Yeah, this girl, uh,
we had on peaches and we
also had the holidays of all,

544
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,920
what, what'd you say her name
was peaches. I know one peaches.

545
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:17,160
That it was her real name. She was
a wardrobe person on a fear factor.

546
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:21,070
Very nice lady. Right. That was a real
name. What's this girl's real names?

547
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,560
This girl Sarah Peaches.

548
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:25,150
And the reason we were asking why
she was called peaches cause there,

549
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,890
but it looks like a peach. And so we're
like, oh, we got to see this button now.

550
00:29:28,891 --> 00:29:33,030
So she pulled down her pants and
she had a thong on. Uh, and uh,

551
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,190
I guess people complained and they
just banned my whole account. But,

552
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,350
but I thought they,

553
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,320
the Ustream just hooked you up and just
said that you were going to get oh yeah,

554
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,070
yeah, yeah. But that
doesn't, there's that there's

555
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,400
a difference between, uh, like, you
know, standards and practices. Exactly.

556
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,640
So did you contact the guy contacted him,

557
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:52,300
they pulled the video and then put me
back up and they're just saying that,

558
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:56,140
you know, nowadays it's kind of like a
network TV. They have sponsors, you know,

559
00:29:56,141 --> 00:30:00,190
you can't, you can't have certain things.
But that's what I thought I was like,

560
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:04,010
thongs though are like you can go
on the beach with a Thong, right?

561
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:09,970
Yeah. I mean, what two? You like
country music, right? And that work,

562
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,630
I'm sure. Like you couldn't show a
thong on that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

563
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:17,650
So the broadcast network, so I guess,
you know, it's all new technology.

564
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:21,670
It's all new shit. So kind of had
to find the Bordeaux, we talk about,

565
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:26,770
well we talk about it as a fucking
thousand times more light. Absolutely.

566
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:30,670
All a thong. That's it.
Really. Yeah. So fucking weird.

567
00:30:30,671 --> 00:30:32,560
Like what you were saying
about that, the, you know,

568
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,000
the situation that happened when you
were doing that show and you know,

569
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,050
people get offended. And
what was the, was the one,

570
00:30:38,051 --> 00:30:40,420
what was the story that was in the
news while you're doing the show?

571
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,270
Don Imus with Donna. I'm a store. Would
you call the girls nappy headed hoes?

572
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,540
When I was doing the man show, it
was um, Janet Jackson's nipple.

573
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,530
Janet Jackson's nipple in the Superbowl
came out right while we were doing the

574
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:54,070
man show. And I thought, Oh, what
the fuck? It's nothing. You know,

575
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:58,720
what is this stupid stunt,
you know, but Dee, who cares
really? I mean to me it was,

576
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,650
it was a nonissue,

577
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:05,010
but it became this fucking huge thing
in show business where you could,

578
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:09,490
I mean they came in and
changed monologues. They
came in and cut out scenes.

579
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,640
They cut out, cut out sketches. They were
like, no more, we can't, we can't do this.

580
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:13,660
We're going to have to take this way back.

581
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,560
Could be on the phone call when it comes
from whatever group or Washington DC.

582
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:22,160
When they say that I, I think it's, it's,

583
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,400
it's because that they actually
take it seriously. Yeah.

584
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,010
It's just so disappointing though.

585
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:30,040
When you see all these fucking people
scrambled because some chick pulled out

586
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:32,500
her nipple and the crazy thing
was the news, the big thing,

587
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:36,470
and the paper said that it was during
the dinner hour. That's what it said.

588
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,830
I totally blocked it.
People will write to be amended.

589
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:44,950
It was on network television.
All right. It was the super bowl.

590
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:46,870
You got your kids watching.
I understood.

591
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:50,070
What could I have kids are you raising
that are going to be freaking out about a

592
00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:53,390
chicks nipple? Siri, yeah.
Wait, no, wait a minute. Wait,

593
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:55,830
and when you still want your
kids to have a child that,

594
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,690
that's what I think about Nipples,

595
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:02,710
a smelling months. That's a little bit
bit of excitement in their childhood.

596
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:05,160
It's not like fucking Janet Jackson
and starts stroking the nipple and,

597
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:06,300
and fingering or I'll tell you what,

598
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,440
man is whip out a black
tent in front of my kids.

599
00:32:08,441 --> 00:32:11,200
They're going to start laughing at you.
I don't think it's funny. Well listen.

600
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,190
Okay, because people out there, they
have how they want to raise their kids.

601
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:17,170
So it's like they don't have cable,

602
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,290
so keep all the smite on cable
and I should be able to be here.

603
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:23,360
So that thing crossed in, I would,
you know what I compared it to,

604
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,520
it was like a orange juice and brushing
your teeth individually, they were fine,

605
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,260
but you bring them together.
It's back.

606
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,740
There's nothing wrong with seeing
an iconic good point, iconic titty.

607
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,190
But you had it on network TV and that was,
that was the problem.

608
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:38,540
So that's an interesting
way to look at it. Yeah.

609
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,260
I think we're way too hung up about
sex though. I think that's a nonissue.

610
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,080
I really do. It's not like they
were fucking on TV. If they,

611
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,320
if she pulled out her pussy and fingered
herself in front of the camera and go,

612
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:52,770
yeah, you just went too far.
Now you're all sexual. It's
a football game. Yeah. Yeah.

613
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,420
But they're doing some sexual
performance network television.

614
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,280
We watch dancing with the stars. They're
fucking on the stage. I mean the,

615
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:03,440
the lumbar on each other and when the
woman will straddle the guy's cock,

616
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:07,540
what's going on there? But you're, you're
imitating some songs for sexuality. Yeah.

617
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,490
But this is the thing, you
know that okay. Football,

618
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,840
the kid doesn't know that.
Know what I'm saying is as a parent,

619
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,540
if you've decided to watch
dancing with the stars,

620
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,870
if you're going to watch a football game,
you're not expecting to see a titty.

621
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,100
So you just expect to see dudes that weigh
300 pounds of jacked up with Anna and

622
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:28,860
human growth hormone running at each
other and smashing into each other. Yeah.

623
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,010
And somehow or another,
a tit is scarier than that.

624
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,830
I'm not saying I have a problem
with it. I'm saying, look,

625
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:37,470
you have to understand I'm not either,
I'm just does a fake argument, bro.

626
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:41,120
I'm just try to keep this going. All
right. People are fucking roll with it.

627
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:43,460
Like you just fucking like,

628
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,830
just like you got to respect that
other people don't aren't, you know,

629
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,800
I told, I told her, I go, look, I want
my kid to have like, dude, you know,

630
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,980
even if it was like one second,

631
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,850
I don't even know what a pussy
looked like until I was like, what?

632
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,450
Like 12 should I grew up with
me, you know, I want to show you,

633
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,690
we're talking about one second by the way,

634
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,050
I'm just saying I was allowed to have a
fucking childhood and be innocent for a

635
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:09,381
little bit.

636
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:13,640
But like now it's just like the shit that
you can get away with on like network

637
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:16,850
TV now because of cable is fucking,
I remember like the,

638
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:21,020
when the Benny Hill show came out,
people are freaking out. He was doing,

639
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:24,890
he was walking up behind girls acids
pretending he was warming his hands and

640
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:28,250
you'd had that silly and Wayne Antica
Dante's walking in fast motion and they

641
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:28,851
were freaking out.

642
00:34:28,851 --> 00:34:33,851
And I sat there as like a fucking like
seven year old turned on by it because

643
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:37,790
the that was like to bait was
the Benny Hill show back then.

644
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,210
And I think that like, seriously,
I don't think that it's that,

645
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,840
I think kids do see way too much.

646
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,390
I don't think that you
should be embarrassed about
bodies and stuff like that.

647
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,930
But I mean,
dude,

648
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,390
you want to understand they can go
into your laptop and like we didn't,

649
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,750
we couldn't,
you couldn't see any light.

650
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,990
I got porno when we were coming up here
to have to have a fucking night at work,

651
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:54,980
a reel to reel,

652
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,310
and then it became VCR and then you'd
have to find your parents stash.

653
00:34:58,311 --> 00:35:01,490
Now you can just go on the damn laptop.
I really sound like some, right? No,

654
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:02,510
but you're right,
you're right.

655
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,380
I'm just everything that they're going
to raise their kids the way they want to

656
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:06,711
raise him.

657
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:10,160
So if you chose not to have cable and
you want to stay away from that shit,

658
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:11,840
then it's fine.
I see what you're saying.

659
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:15,050
But the way I look at it as everything
accelerates and including access to

660
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:18,890
things, access to information, access
to even bad things. And you know, the,

661
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:20,990
the kids are gonna have to deal
with an ever changing world.

662
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,250
And if you went from where you were when
you were 12 to how you see the world

663
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:29,450
now, it'd be a pretty big fucking
shock, you know? And I think for kids,

664
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:32,000
it's like they're, they're going
to get it way earlier than did,

665
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,780
but that's just the nature of the world
today. It's kind of fight against that.

666
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:39,180
I don't think it's kind of like how
the started off as such slow speeds.

667
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:43,020
They get 56 k modem for top four and he
used to be like, Hey, what's this photo?

668
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,230
Oh Hey, oh, that's a horse's stick. Oh my
God, what's going on in that person's ass?

669
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:46,681
You know,

670
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:50,430
you kind of were diluted to the Internet
because you did this slowly as it was a

671
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:55,260
slow process of all this disgusting
Shit route on the Internet where people

672
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:59,220
watch that type of shit or they
watch like, uh, beheadings oh no, no.

673
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,850
I mean I'm talking about sending you
things or you're not going to do really

674
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:03,301
fucked up.

675
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:07,260
There's a lot of people who aren't on the
vice squad but have like that level of

676
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:11,400
mental damage in there like an accountant
because they go on and watch somebody

677
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:12,540
get their head sought off.

678
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,240
Like I remember that video and like
comics come in and go on yet. Dude,

679
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:18,190
I shouldn't have watched say like
you saw like I've got a bit my echo.

680
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,350
I talk about you Sol.

681
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,500
I view it like it's pixelated and
every time you see something that you

682
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:23,071
shouldn't have seen,

683
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:26,930
like a couple of cubes float away and
you get just never the same person. So I,

684
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:31,610
I think, I don't know, I'm trying, I'm
trying to like watching porn is though.

685
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,430
Yeah. Yeah. I just, I tried to do
that when I started having kids,

686
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,450
but stop watching porn. You started
thinking about those kids, you know,

687
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:42,570
stars and you've got the Watson anymore.
It's like a tipping point.

688
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,900
There's a tipping point with this shit
where it's kind of like, all right,

689
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:46,740
this is healthy.

690
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,610
You're exploring what you're into and
then you just go down a rabbit hole,

691
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,230
you closes behind you and uh,
easily you can easily go down.

692
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,740
How many guys do we know that have been
addicted to masturbating when they talk

693
00:36:58,741 --> 00:37:02,400
about live masturbate in three times a
day, every day. Even if they're not hard,

694
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,310
you know, they just keep
going. See what I mean?

695
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,520
[inaudible] get a guy a lot of free times.
Shag rug here.

696
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,300
You give guys enough free time there.

697
00:37:10,301 --> 00:37:12,930
They're going to drug off just the
fact totally. They do it in prison.

698
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,310
Even though people know
people are watching.

699
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,070
They don't care who's guys in
solitary confinement there.

700
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,790
Naked beaten off with a camera on him.
Just do it on that,

701
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,520
on that podcast with that chick
with the Sarah Peaches. Uh,

702
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:27,560
the guy that came with her
was the Hollywood sex, uh,

703
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,170
like anyone that has a sex tape,
they go to him to sell it and stuff.

704
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,040
He did a Paris Hilton's and he was
talking about how no, she was behind that.

705
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:37,980
She made about $7 million from that shit.
And like,

706
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,660
like he just fucking broke through.

707
00:37:39,661 --> 00:37:43,410
Like all these people like that have
come up to him like, he's like, yeah,

708
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:45,870
I have a Lindsay Lohan one,
but it's from the back,

709
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:47,820
so I can't verify if it's herb.
It's supposedly,

710
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:49,380
it really is her giving a blow job.

711
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:53,790
And how crazy is it that these people
figured out a way to make money and get

712
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:56,640
famous off of porn? Yeah,
I was in dash was in, yeah,

713
00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:00,420
I was in Australia and there was a fucking
giant Kim Kardashian poster and all I

714
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:04,080
can think of that girl got famous
for fucking a guy on film. I mean,

715
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,820
she's a porno star,
you know,

716
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:10,821
I mean fucking the film that they used
to ruin your career now makes something

717
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:14,000
out of nothing. I'm going, I should really
shouldn't throw a name out here by it.

718
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,560
Was it Jane Kennedy?
You guys don't watch sports.

719
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:21,520
There was this girl back in the day.
She was on the NFL on CBS and uh,

720
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,540
her ex boyfriend sent out a tape,

721
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,370
a sex tape after they broke up a,
of her getting fisted, I believe.

722
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,240
Oh my goodness. The general public didn't
see it because there was no youtube,

723
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:36,130
none of that. It just went around the
industry. That was the end of her career.

724
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,380
Wow. Yeah. You can't get fisted. Yeah.

725
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,370
And now nowadays, yeah. Like
that would actually, you know,

726
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,180
you know that that would be part of
like your, your imdv page, you know,

727
00:38:45,181 --> 00:38:47,550
if they will try and see how much
money she get paid for a pilot.

728
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,700
Well he's done already two pilots.
He's done a Letterman, you know, we uh,

729
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,710
Bang this girl and fucking came on her
face so you know, his dick is out there.

730
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:59,100
Definitely has some sort of
cue ration, you know, ratio,
whatever the fuck you say.

731
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,220
Well she has two fists things
online. Actually, wait a minute,

732
00:39:02,221 --> 00:39:04,800
why am I saying I've got a guy
can't get away with that shit.

733
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,620
Like think like females
can make like a sex tape.

734
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,010
Certain ones can have it sex tapes before
and I'm going to Tom Sizemore and one

735
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,700
or the Tom Sizemore one, but he didn't
blow up after that. That was part of that.

736
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:19,690
We're still awesome. It's
still awesome. Oh yeah. Yeah.

737
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,061
I know what he said,

738
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:29,530
that he has a tape right now with
usher that he's like getting sued for

739
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:31,600
something like that and
he's getting pegged in it.

740
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:36,070
And I didn't know what pegged means,
but uh, whoa. Wait a minute. Ushers Gay.

741
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:40,160
Wait a minute. You don't like peg means,
I don't know, zooming in the, but it's,

742
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,570
it's where a girl wears a
Dildo and fucks you in the ass.

743
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,650
Why listen to the podcasts. It's
crazy. Uh, it's not as show number 12.

744
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:52,840
I going to get sued. Yeah. Yeah. You
can't say he said, I didn't say it.

745
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:56,350
All right on. I will say allegedly,
but that's what he said. Funny.

746
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:59,500
That is so common that guys like
girls fuck them would strap ons.

747
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:03,550
They have a nickname for it pegged
and everybody's like, oh yeah,

748
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:07,570
hey does that before? Oh yeah. Oh,
I'm well aware of what that entails.

749
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:13,240
What a fucking crazy business. It
was a, this, this guy that I know,

750
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:17,990
his buddy was dating a porn star and he
was dealing with it for awhile because

751
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,580
he was kind of a loser.
He didn't have a job and you know,

752
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,810
didn't really have much going on.

753
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,210
She would like pay for dinner and stuff
like that. And you know, he just said, ah,

754
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,580
it's just work for her. It's
work for her. She just work.

755
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:32,410
One day he comes home and she's going
over her contract for our next thing and

756
00:40:32,411 --> 00:40:35,050
uh, and he goes, what is air tight mean?

757
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,090
That's like one of the descriptions of
scenes. It means a dick and every hole.

758
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,560
And she goes, one of my mouth, what am
I? But when I post it, I'm out. He goes,

759
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:47,440
that's it. I'm out. He got up. That
was the end of the relationship.

760
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:52,090
He packed up his shit and he moved
out. Fucking them. Done what?

761
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,010
Air Tight. Like this bitch
wasn't just doing porn, you know,

762
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,040
he tried to distance himself and
not watch any of it. You know,

763
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:01,420
it just kind of a liberal fellow and
I'm trying to create this man air tight.

764
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:02,740
I like this,
but it was just,

765
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:06,940
it's so common that girls know what it
means when it's in the, in your contract,

766
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,980
you have to do one air tight.
You know, one cream pie,

767
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:13,300
they'll think it's funny that they still
have to come up with these euphemisms

768
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,510
because even with them they try and make
it so you know, we're gonna, you know,

769
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,020
start off with the standard or do you
know Blah Blah Blah and we'll build to an

770
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,920
airtight and do a facial sounds
like a spa. Well some of them,

771
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,990
some of them are so common that
it's actually with the search terms,

772
00:41:28,991 --> 00:41:33,560
like cream pie cream pie is you shoot a
load inside a girl and then she kind of

773
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:33,980
squirts

774
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,220
it out like a, like a cream pie.
I'm familiar with the porn. Yeah,

775
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:40,880
but I mean what the fuck
man? Yeah, everyone, it's so
common that it's a category.

776
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,770
Like if you go to like youporn
or something like that,

777
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,810
that's one of the
categories is cream pies,

778
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:50,410
shooting loads and girls like hello
diseases here have a disease in your butt.

779
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:54,300
But that's, that's what I, I don't get
that in there, but I don't get like a,

780
00:41:54,301 --> 00:41:56,310
I know they get tested all the time.
What does that mean?

781
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,950
Those guys are fucking heroin
junkies every night. You know,

782
00:41:58,951 --> 00:42:02,580
who knows what they're doing. You take,
they get tested like every three months,

783
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,850
you know, like that doesn't mean
anything. That's crazy. I don't know.

784
00:42:05,851 --> 00:42:08,030
I don't know how good it is now,
but I remember back in the day, man,

785
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:10,350
when they way of scaring the shit out
of every straight guy out there that

786
00:42:10,351 --> 00:42:13,020
you're gonna get aids.
Yeah. They said that uh,

787
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:16,460
the fuck doesn't mean the safest
way. Oh yeah. Do you remember that?

788
00:42:16,461 --> 00:42:19,920
Like back in the day you get, when did,
what year did you take an aids test?

789
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:24,930
When I took one was 96 or
seven and I remember I had to,

790
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,690
you had to wait like five,
six days.

791
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,950
It's one thing walking about walking
around worrying because they had everybody

792
00:42:31,951 --> 00:42:34,050
worried that they had it.
So worrying that you had,

793
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,640
it was something that you give out,
you know,

794
00:42:35,641 --> 00:42:38,830
but knowing that you are
going to find out in fact,

795
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:40,620
actually one way or
the other in five days.

796
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:42,320
But fortunately I had
a really cool doctor.

797
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,780
I was sitting there in the waiting room
just like just rocking back and forth on

798
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:50,940
why did I bang that shit? Jesus Christ so
fucking weak. Why did I give it to her?

799
00:42:50,941 --> 00:42:55,180
Right. And he came walking up and he was
really cool. He said, Mr. Byrd combined.

800
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,850
He said, come on back. And he
goes, don't worry, you're all set.

801
00:42:56,851 --> 00:42:58,710
Like he said it in the waiting room.
He didn't,

802
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:02,670
he didn't let me take that long walk,
like the next Douche bag. Like I,

803
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,270
I would like I,

804
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,630
the only time I would get tested
would be like if I was getting into a

805
00:43:06,631 --> 00:43:08,280
relationship and basically the girl said,

806
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,820
we need to go out and get tested for
everything. And I was like, yeah,

807
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:12,960
let's be responsible.

808
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,140
Well, and I was like, fuck the
guy taking my test. I took,

809
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,010
I had to get insurance when I first moved
to New York because it was like 90 91

810
00:43:20,011 --> 00:43:23,700
that's why I took my first test and
the guy who was testing me, he said,

811
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,060
have you ever had gay sex? No. Have
you ever shared a needle? No. He goes,

812
00:43:27,061 --> 00:43:30,180
you don't have nothing to worry
about. I'm like, really? Really goes,

813
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,490
you got nothing to worry about it. He
goes, trust me, you're going to be okay.

814
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,280
And I'm like, this guy's just being
nice to me. Manage just being nice.

815
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:36,300
And you just think about all those girls.

816
00:43:36,301 --> 00:43:38,970
I should've wore a condom with the fuck
was I thinking and what does that mean?

817
00:43:38,971 --> 00:43:41,310
I should have wore a condom if you knew
she had aids or would you stick your

818
00:43:41,311 --> 00:43:45,090
dick inside of her with a little tiny
thin little membrane protecting you from

819
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:49,830
the depths of hell? No, you wouldn't.
You know, it's fucking craziness. But uh,

820
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,870
I,
I went and the guy did the same thing.

821
00:43:51,871 --> 00:43:54,300
He called me up and he gave
me the results over the phone.

822
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,820
And as he called me up, he goes,
Joe, you're all set. You're all set.

823
00:43:56,821 --> 00:44:00,750
I just want to relax. Nope,
totally negative. No problem. Yeah.

824
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:04,290
But for fucking days are
shitting my pants. Convinced,

825
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,630
convinced I added like a red shirt.
Virgin.

826
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,630
What do you get to think about that
and how much knowledge that we have,

827
00:44:09,631 --> 00:44:13,020
what we really know the average person
knows about medical science and think

828
00:44:13,021 --> 00:44:16,140
about what it must've been like when
medical science didn't exist and you

829
00:44:16,141 --> 00:44:20,520
thought you really were cursed.
You know the shit probably worked.

830
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,240
You know you could probably car someone
with witchcraft and they probably would

831
00:44:24,241 --> 00:44:27,600
fucking trip every way they go and fall
and land on their fucking face and break

832
00:44:27,601 --> 00:44:28,230
their neck

833
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:32,790
and I dodged. That happens. That's like
when say bad things come in threes.

834
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:35,640
It's no,
you keep restarting counting after three.

835
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,980
That's what happens when people go off
this, do this, and then this is like, yes,

836
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:44,250
that makes four. If you count back
to the beginning of your life,

837
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,780
you now is it divisible by three?
It's like it's life. Bad Shit happens.

838
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,410
Good Cycle. Whenever his celebrity dies,
they would say, you know, dead straight.

839
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,573
They're all comes from,

840
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,300
this is a thing though.
Even jokes when you described jokes,

841
00:44:57,301 --> 00:44:59,970
they'd come in through the best
way to tell a joke. I have. Yeah.

842
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:04,080
I usually have three, three examples
that are ridiculous. I know that's true.

843
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,310
I'm just talking about the bad she'll,

844
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:09,630
why is that though that things in three
celebrities dies in celebrities dying in

845
00:45:09,631 --> 00:45:13,960
three they don't. People recount after
three if they went one right there.

846
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:17,520
We're talking about a small period in
time. It's not like time is open ended.

847
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:19,650
They're talking about over a
course of all your couple of weeks,

848
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:23,700
three very famous people will die and
it happens all the time. It really does.

849
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,410
It really doesn't know that people just
stopped counting at three and then I

850
00:45:28,411 --> 00:45:29,280
just start over again.

851
00:45:29,281 --> 00:45:32,870
I could say let somebody would die like
two days later and it doesn't count.

852
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:37,470
It all dies like a month later.
Then they go, okay, that's one.

853
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,190
You wait and you wait.
It's like, yeah, I guess

854
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:43,920
celebrities probably don't count because
fucking there's a billion people over

855
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:45,860
there. They must be dropping
off every day. Yeah, there's,

856
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,520
I'm sure there's famous
country singers to you.

857
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:50,070
That would have been like the biggest
star ever. Where other who me,

858
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:51,390
I don't even know who that guy is.

859
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,900
Wrap your fucking head around the fact
that China has more than three times the

860
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:58,590
people that America has. Yeah.
More than three times. What's up?

861
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,120
People shitting on the side of the road.

862
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:04,470
I said to on the podcast that they
will self sustainable that they uh,

863
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,600
but apparently they're not anymore.
Apparently now they're,

864
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:10,390
they're important grain people got
upset at me so no, I guess they'd not,

865
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,840
but you know what I want
to hear about pouring rain.

866
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,790
I always wonder like how
am I wonder if that's,

867
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,380
I wonder if they're forced to do that one.

868
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:20,040
If they're forced to buy like American
grain and we sell them grain and you know,

869
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,870
well if you want to read a great article
is the one in rolling stone this month

870
00:46:22,871 --> 00:46:25,720
that has Howard stern on the cover is
they talk about these two basically

871
00:46:25,721 --> 00:46:30,460
potheads who became these international
arms dealers and just how that whole

872
00:46:30,461 --> 00:46:31,300
thing goes down.

873
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:36,301
How boundaries when they want to arm a
certain side and some smaller country,

874
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,050
but they don't want the shit coming
back to them. How they go about it,

875
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:45,850
how they go through these people.
There's to some website, uh, uh,

876
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,860
Christ, what the hell
is it? I can't remember,

877
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:52,600
but it's like the military is required
to put all their contracts on it so you

878
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,910
can read all their contracts.
This is typical,

879
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:58,000
may something interesting and I can't
tell you where to go to and you can read

880
00:46:58,001 --> 00:47:00,310
all their contracts and
they're open to any bitter.

881
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:03,190
I think during the Bush administration
they made it like that, you know,

882
00:47:03,191 --> 00:47:05,200
so I dunno, free enterprise.
I don't know why,

883
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:09,460
but it kind of seemed like it was a
way for them to then arm certain people

884
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,810
without it coming back.

885
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:13,720
It's like we basically have another people
do your dirty work, but just the way,

886
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,560
well that's what the hard

887
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,910
idea about mercenaries is. I mean that's
what the big complaint about what,

888
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:18,211
you know,

889
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:22,110
blackwater and those types of groups
is that we use them overseas and it's

890
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,540
basically a way to get away
with doing like really dirty.

891
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,850
Oh yeah, totally thing. I mean,
this is the, how I look at it.

892
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:33,070
Everybody does it and I don't
know what their end game. Right.

893
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:35,860
But she's been doing it.
I mean [inaudible]

894
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,770
if we are what we pretend we are,

895
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,100
then we should be the ones who
stand up and say that this is, well,

896
00:47:41,101 --> 00:47:44,910
this is what you can't do. You can't
torture prisoners. You can't, you can't.

897
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:45,740
Absolutely.

898
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,280
Do you think we can do
that in a country that uh,

899
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,610
actually sticks by what we say we are?
Because everybody

900
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:54,560
seems that someone has to
lead an example, right? We do.

901
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:57,200
We say the world's filled with line
con, so we're going to be lying. Cons,

902
00:47:57,201 --> 00:48:00,200
I don't know. I mean, I see
what you're saying. I see
the other argument that like,

903
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:00,501
look,

904
00:48:00,501 --> 00:48:03,290
the world's a dirty place and you're going
to have people that are willing to do

905
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:04,600
your bidding. No. You know, like,

906
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,220
yeah, no, I'm going to ask. Yeah.

907
00:48:06,221 --> 00:48:11,221
I don't get how war is legal and I don't
get how like Jesus freaks and really

908
00:48:11,481 --> 00:48:14,030
religious people get behind war.

909
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,300
They've been doing it for like the
acquisitions and the, and the Crusades.

910
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:20,780
They were taking murderers
out of prison going,

911
00:48:20,781 --> 00:48:25,781
you are forgiven and then unleashing
them and like the Middle East to do what

912
00:48:25,851 --> 00:48:26,090
you,

913
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:28,940
the reason why you stuck it behind bars
but they just don't want it for them.

914
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,380
Church, did they really? Yeah.
When? What year was this?

915
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:35,530
That's just some fucking website.
I've read it off for three minutes.

916
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,530
One of the reasons why I wanted
to have presented as fact,

917
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,780
I mean I always loved
my son talking to you,

918
00:48:39,781 --> 00:48:43,800
but I know that you're one of those guys
that doesn't believe anything in the

919
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:45,870
news is what it is and
these motherfuckers,

920
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:48,600
so that's why I wanted to talk to you
about all this shit that's going on in the

921
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,430
Middle East. It's like every fucking day
some new government is being overthrown.

922
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,250
It's, it's getting really weird
to the point where I'm like, man,

923
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,410
they both like fucking prepping for
something. Like what is going down? Why?

924
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:01,140
How's that?

925
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:05,190
Is it really what everybody says it is
that all the sudden with the Internet,

926
00:49:05,191 --> 00:49:07,530
people are becoming aware
and they're all rising up.

927
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:11,520
It takes more than just being aware to
get people to risk their fucking lives

928
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:12,960
and get, I mean, in Libya,

929
00:49:12,961 --> 00:49:16,740
this is motherfuckers flying jets and
launching missiles in the crowds and shit.

930
00:49:16,741 --> 00:49:19,630
He's killing people. They're shooting
right into crowd. Might not be with jets,

931
00:49:19,631 --> 00:49:20,550
but I might've made that up,

932
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,610
but I know they're shooting into crowns
and killing people left and right and

933
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,920
like these people that
are fighting against him.

934
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:29,300
Yeah. There's a movement that's going
on. I don't know what it is, but it was,

935
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:30,930
you know, no, the real fear.

936
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:35,720
There's guys out there who we put in
power and we were cool with and then when

937
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,900
they stopped being cool with us,
then we go in and we try to take them off.

938
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:39,321
I'll tell you,

939
00:49:39,321 --> 00:49:42,230
you know what's really fucked up where
those celebrities who went out and they

940
00:49:42,231 --> 00:49:46,730
did like a corporate gig for like Kadafi
these kids. Yeah. They try to act like,

941
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,440
oh, I didn't know. It's like, dude,

942
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:51,800
if you work at a comedy club and
there's somebody like in a wheelchair,

943
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,530
the club owner comes back, hey,
not telling you how to do your act.

944
00:49:54,531 --> 00:49:57,710
Just to let you know that someone in
the crowd, the wheelchair. So I mean,

945
00:49:57,711 --> 00:49:58,340
you know.
Yeah.

946
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:01,940
Is she aware of that show that you close
with? You might want to not use it.

947
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:06,950
So these people are going to perform
for the kids. Have a mass murderer.

948
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,900
Don't you think they get some sort of
halftime speeds? Listen, don't say this.

949
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,980
You don't want offend their cult. Just
letting them know, like I had no idea.

950
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:18,570
I was really disappointed when I saw it
are formed for Gaddafi. Uh, what was it?

951
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,860
A Beyonce usher, Mariah Carey.
And then they all just sit.

952
00:50:22,861 --> 00:50:26,940
Then they all donated it to charity, but
only cause they got busted Kadafi pegs.

953
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:27,823
That's what I heard.

954
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:33,040
Gadhafi pays a peg eggs. Are
you just making shit up? Oh,

955
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,800
they're asking people if they should,
uh, give their, uh, their money back.

956
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,350
Apparently there's a lot.
Yeah, be onsite. Did it? Huh?

957
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:42,170
Yeah. And I saw this photo and
it's like, dude, it's hilarious.

958
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,130
It's like you got somebody who can sell
out the fucking staple center. It's like,

959
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:47,930
why you do,
you really got to go there and entertain.

960
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:51,060
That's scumbag cause it just so
much money. Like what do they all,

961
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,660
they pay for like a million million
bucks for like a night and you come.

962
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:55,580
There was funny.
Was that one of the pictures I saw now,

963
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:59,750
I don't know if this was actually
her at the Gig, but dude,

964
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:04,400
it's like she's standing out in your
living room going full out doing fucking

965
00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:08,210
routines. Be Awesome for the kid
of a murder of, of a mass murder.

966
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,720
The guy who admittedly is buying
those pan-am bombings. Right. Wow.

967
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:15,200
My crazy thinking that that
killed Americans and that
kid has a musical. Yeah, no,

968
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:18,170
he is the [inaudible] rig on it.

969
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:25,470
Dancing like literally dancing
dance for me. Let's go.

970
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:29,900
And that kid is my backup.
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah.

971
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,930
Oh sure.
Apparently performed for him to the bow.

972
00:51:32,931 --> 00:51:36,620
He gave a Beyonce $2 million
for her private performance.

973
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:42,080
Whoa. That's pretty crazy. His youngest
son Hannibal. That's his fucking son.

974
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,680
After the silence of the
lambs, if you name your kid
Hannibal, you're a sick fuck.

975
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,180
Yeah,
and it wasn't even a nickname.

976
00:51:47,181 --> 00:51:50,060
He knew coming out of the woods yet his
kid was going to be a sick. Fuck you.

977
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:53,330
So nothing is scarier than
the sons of dictators.

978
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:58,370
You ever hear about what is the Udi and
Qusay or whatever the fuck Saddam's kids

979
00:51:58,371 --> 00:52:02,960
wrote all the shit they
did. They fed women to dogs.
They did. They did horrible.

980
00:52:02,961 --> 00:52:04,430
Should they do,
they were fine women.

981
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:07,160
One of the things we would do is find
a woman as she was getting married,

982
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,130
they would find her like as like
you literally go into the wedding,

983
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,720
kill the husband in front of everybody.

984
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:14,510
I take the wife raper and
killer and feeder the dogs is,

985
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,430
they used to grind people
up in meat grinders.

986
00:52:16,431 --> 00:52:18,890
Like some of those
stores are just horrific.

987
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,860
I mean they grew up with Ryan and Mikko.
What's what sort of,

988
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,090
how big was the MC when they're alive?
I don't know who. Who Will? Ha Ha. Well,

989
00:52:26,091 --> 00:52:29,720
you can easily stick someone in the wood
chipper if you want it to. Oh yeah, no,

990
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:32,660
I understand that. That would be easy.
Guys fall into woodchippers all the time.

991
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:34,630
I saw,
I saw a guy get busted.

992
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,410
They figured out that he did it and then
they just went out on his property and

993
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:43,120
he just had like, you know,
basically human bone shrapnel.

994
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,240
Oh, I love this part of the Oliver,
the part of the woods. Dude,

995
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:49,600
I was on a key recently and
this guy, you know, who is, uh,

996
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:52,780
allegedly a federal agent, but if by
the end of it, I didn't even believe,

997
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,420
and he was telling me all these horrific
stories and I'm sitting there looking

998
00:52:55,421 --> 00:52:56,530
at the guy,
first of all,

999
00:52:56,531 --> 00:53:00,160
when he walked in on of the first things
he did was he picked his nose and I'm

1000
00:53:00,161 --> 00:53:01,360
like,
and I had already shook his hand,

1001
00:53:01,361 --> 00:53:03,340
like a fucking segway who
doesn't pick their nose?

1002
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,910
Then he adjusts his Dick and at one point
he's in the middle of telling me about

1003
00:53:06,911 --> 00:53:10,900
being on a stakeout.
He starts digging in his ass to the point.

1004
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:15,040
It's like almost on his tip toes.
He's like fucking dude. And he's like,

1005
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:18,160
and you could tell he was like habitually
picking his ass because he's in the

1006
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,960
middle of talking to me. He just
met me and he said, yeah, you know,

1007
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:24,070
so standing out there and we have
fucking sounds going like this.

1008
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:27,210
I'm looking at and he's going, yeah,
I'm a federal agent. It's like, Dude,

1009
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,980
you're picking your ass.
And also why you telling me all this shit?

1010
00:53:31,981 --> 00:53:34,830
It's Kinda like the guys who go to
war and they actually see some shit,

1011
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:37,890
never talk about it. And then the guy
who's fucking working in the kitchen,

1012
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,980
oh yeah, man, shit was crazy. I
shot this guy in the fucking head.

1013
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:43,260
That's after awhile. I was like,
I think this guy is like this.

1014
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:46,130
Did you see these new photos
that came out from Afghanistan?

1015
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,690
They're basically just like the,
um, the, what was the fucking,

1016
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,810
the prison was the prison
where a Guantanamo? No, no, no.

1017
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:59,120
Well the one where they took all those
photos of all the Iraqi's and did all

1018
00:53:59,121 --> 00:54:03,530
that fucked up shit in the soldiers did.
I can't remember too long ago. Brian,

1019
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:05,180
do you remember? No. You
don't know what it is.

1020
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,840
You don't even know what the
story is anyway. These, um,

1021
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:10,880
there's new photos to just
surfaced and they're, uh,

1022
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:15,680
they're just like those photos. What
the fuck was the name of the, uh, yeah,

1023
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:19,280
but is that shocking you, you really don't
want to get captured by the enemy? No.

1024
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:21,120
Yeah, it's pretty fucked up. The Oem,

1025
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:24,200
they won't be there smiling like holding
people up by the hair and like look,

1026
00:54:24,201 --> 00:54:28,790
Aba grave. Thank you. Bobby Walton
42. Mr. Alex Walton. You've,

1027
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:32,630
you got it for me bunny. They Aba
grape, you know, and they, uh,

1028
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,330
they were doing the same sort of
shit and one of them was a fence.

1029
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,940
Family friends with Sarah
Pailin for like 20 years.

1030
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:41,960
It's fucking holding up this guy by his
hair. Bullet holes in them and shit.

1031
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,100
I'll have to, he's dead. Yeah. Yeah.

1032
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,040
The definition. I gotta
admit, if I was over there,

1033
00:54:46,041 --> 00:54:47,280
I'd be doing that shit with you.

1034
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,760
How many people can you shoot in the head
before you don't get a little twisted?

1035
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:51,020
You've got to find the comedy in it.

1036
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,550
Well, the crazy thing is I was fucking
poor. Kids are coming back, you know,

1037
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,290
and you meet him,
you know.

1038
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:00,850
[inaudible] they kind of cocked a
squelch that, by the way. But yeah.

1039
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,740
Well at one point in time,

1040
00:55:02,741 --> 00:55:07,660
more people had died in one month
in suicides than had died in combat.

1041
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,520
I mean, it's, it's scary shit. You know
the number, the ratio for the month.

1042
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,490
I, yeah, I mean,

1043
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:20,620
you're not supposed to kill another
human pig if it goes against the, uh,

1044
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:24,300
I don't know. Especially somebody you
don't even know, you know. All right.

1045
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:29,050
It's okay if you know him. No, I
mean, pinup killing someone for,

1046
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,810
you know,
you just get told this is a bad person.

1047
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,540
Go over there and kill them and you're
over there going, what the fuck?

1048
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:36,160
I flew to their neighborhood,

1049
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:40,570
I landed and I snuck into their backyard
and I shot them in the fucking head.

1050
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:42,440
Yeah.
If I think if I ever went to war,

1051
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:45,890
I would be the guy crying in
the foxhole during battle.

1052
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:50,930
But if I could somehow muster up the balls
to kill somebody after I did that one,

1053
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:54,380
it would be like a fucking water slide.
I mentally would just get used to it.

1054
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:57,170
Now that and know, it's like I just
know how my brain works. It's why,

1055
00:55:57,171 --> 00:55:59,790
you know I had, I had some buddies
of mine who will, who have, you know,

1056
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,420
go down to Brazil and banging those
girls and doing that. And it's just like,

1057
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,590
and I never went and they, you know,
wow. Why don't you go? It's like,

1058
00:56:06,591 --> 00:56:10,730
cause I'll go down there, I'll come back,
but mentally you'll be fucked, dude.

1059
00:56:10,731 --> 00:56:13,580
I can't go to a land where I can go.
Yeah,

1060
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,520
well you can go fuck a bunch
of j Lo's for like eight bucks.

1061
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,840
Come back here and think that
I can function in society.

1062
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:23,980
That's what those x patch and we
need to sit down and talk about

1063
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,930
this. Lately I'd be like, shut up.

1064
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,220
Fuck j Lo for $8 you can get on a plane.

1065
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:34,450
It's six hours. I can, I
can as many as I wanted.

1066
00:56:34,451 --> 00:56:37,210
I know that you can bring her back here.
You could go stealer,

1067
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:39,820
bring her back here.
Yeah. I mean it's evil.

1068
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:41,550
If you are willing to deal with something.

1069
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:45,250
I don't want to fly to the third world
and fuck the children of some of the

1070
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:49,220
poorest people on the planet for
like DVD money after my shows.

1071
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:53,980
It's just something, you know,
not to say I'm not a twisted fuck.

1072
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:55,630
I think it's cause I
know how twisted I am.

1073
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:00,070
I try to like stay away from that shit.
I'm the same way.

1074
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,540
I think there's a certain,

1075
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:04,840
well I think everybody's a comic cause
a little bit of a side girl, you know,

1076
00:57:04,841 --> 00:57:08,410
just to the act of going on stage,
demanding that kind of attention.

1077
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:12,670
Lit Microphone, voice, the whole
deal. I woke up the other day,

1078
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:17,130
I had an argument with a girl I went
out with 15 years ago about what about,

1079
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,510
I asked you, it's a long fucking
store. Just some bullshit.

1080
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:23,410
She did something stupid. She
did something stupid. All right.

1081
00:57:23,411 --> 00:57:24,910
And I wanted to be like,

1082
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:30,340
I was trying and she fucked up in
her life and she fucked up so bad.

1083
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:32,080
I was actually scared going,

1084
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,440
how am I going to pick her up off the mat
because I know if I did some shit like

1085
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:37,840
that, I'll be thinking about
kill me. She fucked up.

1086
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:42,320
So I'm trying to build her up and the
whole time of more specific emotions now,

1087
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,430
she just goes, I know. I know.
She kept gone. I know, I know.

1088
00:57:45,431 --> 00:57:48,130
I just maybe being so fucking people
like, you know what? You don't know.

1089
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:52,820
You're a fucking moron, but you did you
arrogant pig headed it just, it just,

1090
00:57:52,821 --> 00:57:57,730
she have a nice house. Yeah. So
I woke up and that's what I was,

1091
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:01,050
my eyes weren't even what weren't
even open. I was laying in a,

1092
00:58:01,051 --> 00:58:05,530
in a fucking hotel yelling at it with my
eyes closed and then sort of knowing in

1093
00:58:05,531 --> 00:58:07,060
my head how fucked up that is.

1094
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:10,540
How long ago was this argument
that you had with her? Like I said,

1095
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:14,350
it was like 15 years or so by yourself.
You're in a hotel room, you wake up,

1096
00:58:14,351 --> 00:58:18,370
your eyes aren't even open and you go
like, you fucking dummy. I told you.

1097
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:23,740
Yeah, that's crazy. You need. I bet.
I bet. Been need a cat scan home.

1098
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,700
I've been to one, I got one.
Uh, whenever I do Letterman,

1099
00:58:27,701 --> 00:58:29,890
I always have a nightmare than I that I,
that I bombed.

1100
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,860
But I've been through enough times and
I always do well, so I know I'm fine.

1101
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:35,830
I thought you were going to say, whenever
I do Letterman, I always get a cat scan.

1102
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:40,210
No, no, no. So last time I did
it, I was having those thoughts.

1103
00:58:40,211 --> 00:58:43,480
They woke me up in the middle of the night
and I actually started talking to the

1104
00:58:43,481 --> 00:58:47,200
voices. I just said, oh, shut the
fuck up. It's going to be fine.

1105
00:58:47,201 --> 00:58:48,730
And I went back to sleep.

1106
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:54,190
Well sometimes it's a good thing to
do to actually have conversations with

1107
00:58:54,191 --> 00:58:58,200
yourself, I think. I think you have to
be aware that you're a psycho. That's,

1108
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,510
that's step one. And then just you,
you know, you, if you're a psycho,

1109
00:59:01,511 --> 00:59:05,020
you're a fight. You can't be cured
of being a psycho. You just have, oh,

1110
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:05,830
that's not true.

1111
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:09,820
You evolve to put show on showtime
where he only kills the bad people.

1112
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,170
Dexter Dexter. Yeah. It's like
Dexter. No, you evolve, you evolve,

1113
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:18,400
you texters time. You recognize what
you're doing wrong with your life.

1114
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:22,030
You understand what makes you feel shitty,
what you feel good and you have

1115
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,520
all that happened. That's for it for me.
I'm joking. You don't want it anymore.

1116
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,150
So this shit is a deck. The
coconut water, it's the shit,

1117
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,240
that little burst of energy and
then you want some more. You're,

1118
00:59:31,241 --> 00:59:34,970
you're all fired up. You look at fight
one of your brothers right now. Fun, Fun,

1119
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:36,410
fun, fun, fun. Yeah.

1120
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:39,860
Have you heard this fucking song and I
talked about it to you before we started.

1121
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:41,940
You haven't heard it.
It's a song bed.

1122
00:59:41,941 --> 00:59:45,320
So the by a 13 year old girl and they
were talking about it on Opie and Anthony.

1123
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:48,640
I had already heard it, but I didn't
know the story behind it. And uh, uh,

1124
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:50,740
opie and Anthony were saying
that apparently this girl,

1125
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:55,810
13 or dad has a lot of money and they
produced a song for her and it's fucking

1126
00:59:57,490 --> 01:00:00,380
Rudel this pork kid,
first of all,

1127
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:04,740
there's like 34 million hits in Youtube.
And when I watched it the other day,

1128
01:00:04,741 --> 01:00:06,800
it was only a couple of days ago,
there was only 24 million,

1129
01:00:06,801 --> 01:00:11,240
so 10 million fucking hands in a
couple of days just because it's awful.

1130
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:15,140
That's how awful it is. And can
people's lives are awful. Yeah,

1131
01:00:15,141 --> 01:00:19,370
but may want to see somebody fail.
They do, but it's also the [inaudible].

1132
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:22,670
I want to see it do. What the fuck
is that thing? That's an iPad.

1133
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,670
Check this. I'm so far behind in the
times. That's like in the future.

1134
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,040
This is the worst time in the
history of the world. And by the way,

1135
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,350
if I was 13 my song
would be worse than this.

1136
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,370
So I'm not judging when I was 13 my
song and be a hundred times worse.

1137
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:44,080
7:00 AM waking up in the morning.
I love it to you.

1138
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,290
She's like dead ends.
Listen to the lyrics.

1139
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:51,600
Mommy's calling, checking on and
on. Everybody's machine dance.

1140
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,660
You got to catch my breath

1141
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:01,300
and my friend
got,

1142
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:03,270
I made my mind up.

1143
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,760
Which seat can I take?
It gets worse.

1144
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,420
Okay, what the fuck, Bro? No, no, no.
That's fine. I don't want to hear anymore.

That was a twit. Come on, don't, don't,

1146

1147
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:25,230
I want billboard to Berta. Freak out.

1148

Alright. Shut it off. Oh No, no, no, no.

1153
01:01:47,451 --> 01:01:50,630

it spells it out and writes out what the

1154
01:01:50,631 --> 01:01:53,330
words are. No, don't tell

She's somebody runs over that 50 Tyson.

1169
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:06,440
Have you heard from 50 survey know
who is this black guy? Oh, I know.

1170
01:03:06,441 --> 01:03:08,250
At first I thought it was
like somebody that's famous.

1171
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,090
The fuck is this fascinating.

1172
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:15,160
Switching the names where the cough my
side [inaudible] some black dude with a

1173
01:03:15,501 --> 01:03:19,550
big watch. He must be the producers like,
yo Yo make this video. Let me let it out.

1174
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:23,030
But I got to get into some fucking
horrible cancer saying his runner through

1175
01:03:23,031 --> 01:03:23,864
auto tune.

1176
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:27,380
And then you had the black guy do the
guest set to give it some sort of,

1177
01:03:27,381 --> 01:03:30,560
I wouldn't say more. I would say 13
year old little girl, but yes, y'all,

1178
01:03:30,561 --> 01:03:33,740
she's got a peg now.
Her name is Rebecca Black.

1179
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:35,120
That's the than the name of this song.

1180
01:03:35,121 --> 01:03:39,470
She's going to blow up now and she's

1182
01:03:43,761 --> 01:03:45,310
I wanted to keep watching it because I,

1183
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:49,750
I knew he was going to freak out. Have
you guys ever seen a MC a 50 Tyson? Yeah,

1184
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,850

1185
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:59,190

of the black eyes still there.

1186
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:02,290
He lends street cred.
It gives her street cred.

1187
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,840
The thing is that the traffic
isn't that bad compared to,

1188
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:05,860
what are you talking about?

1189
01:04:05,861 --> 01:04:07,960
It's the one of the worst tracks
in the history of the music.

1190
01:04:07,961 --> 01:04:11,920
The music underneath that shit kills
birds. They played that in a, in a, in a,

1191
01:04:11,921 --> 01:04:15,670
in a modern sanctuary and butterflies
will fall from the music. That's, that's,

1192
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,910
that's just the shit that's out there.
That's like everybody,

1193
01:04:18,911 --> 01:04:21,550
like hate Justin Bieber going,
what is happening? A new look.

1194
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:23,920
It's like they've always had that guy,

1195
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,890
that guy who's always been there all
the way because in the block kids on the

1196
01:04:26,891 --> 01:04:31,300
block. Yeah. Fucking David
Cassidy. Yeah. Um, you know,

1197
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,150
was that kid who killed himself? Remember
Brian Frazier? Where you around for?

1198
01:04:34,151 --> 01:04:38,240
Brian Frazier. Randy Gibbs. Shag dancing.
Did he kill himself and he, you know,

1199
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,860
he's fucking oh deed. But there
was somebody else, the uh, uh,

1200
01:04:41,861 --> 01:04:44,770
something about you saying about being a
teenager. Do you remember Brian Frazier?

1201
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,200
Was he in your, around your
time in Boston. All right.

1202
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:50,170
Who Do you wonder what happened to
him? He's a writer now. He's writing,

1203
01:04:50,171 --> 01:04:54,760
but he had, he went fucking nuts.
Wants about Bill Hicks. Like there's,

1204
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:58,360
over the years there's been a few
guys that were big Bill Hicks.

1205
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:01,090
The centers like ours is a big Bill
Hicks to center all. He says, yeah,

1206
01:05:01,091 --> 01:05:03,550
he says important things,
but you know, he's not funny.

1207
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:06,220
Or he just says he's not funny. He doesn't
make me laugh. It never made me laugh.

1208
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:07,960
And he like,
and the death of Bill Hicks,

1209
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:11,380
it was really pretty funny on
his Facebook are he goes, um,

1210
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:14,800
now that it's a bill Hicks,
his death in his honor and you know,

1211
01:05:14,801 --> 01:05:18,610
in seeking truth as he did,
I want to admit that he's not funny.

1212
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,090
Show me one video where he was
funny and it's fucking, it's brutal,

1213
01:05:22,091 --> 01:05:26,410
but he's got a point. I was a big
Bill Hicks Fan, but he's got a point.

1214
01:05:26,411 --> 01:05:29,790
There's a lot of that stuff that's just
not funny, you know. And, um, our report,

1215
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:34,260
what was my point with what we were
talking about before this Friday,

1216
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,430
Friday

1217
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:42,470
we lost fit in the backseat now Ben,
Ben,

1218
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,340
Ben,
Ben.

1219
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:46,730
What was my fucking point?
God dammit,

1220
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:52,040
we were talking about, I said she
was a whore. You said she's 13. Oh,

1221
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:52,610
this is what it was.

1222
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:56,300
Brian Frazier, Brian Frazier. Let's
write back. Brian Frazier was going nuts.

1223
01:05:56,301 --> 01:05:58,430
He's like, okay. Everybody says
he's fucking awesome. He goes,

1224
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:02,000
he's making fun of new kids on the block
and making fun of live pop, pop culture.

1225
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:05,330
He goes, that's what's important. Pop
Culture. Who started going fucking crazy?

1226
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:08,780
And I'm like, yeah, this kind of a silly
thing to get all upset about. You know,

1227
01:06:08,781 --> 01:06:12,410
he's doing like someone sucking
Satan's cock like a u was a Tiffany.

1228
01:06:12,411 --> 01:06:15,620
Tiffany was sucking Satan's cock and
he's like, Tiffany's a little girl.

1229
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,330
She's a little girl.
Of course your songs suck.

1230
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,790
You're not supposed to fucking listen
to him. And he starts going crazy.

1231
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:20,624
And I'm like,
wow.

1232
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:24,350
Right. That's right. I agree with,
look, he's right. But he's wrong.

1233
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:28,520
But I'll know this is what I'll tell you.
This is why Sam Kinison is underrated.

1234
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:33,350
Before he let fame consumer many days and
he did a special with fucking girls on

1235
01:06:33,351 --> 01:06:38,150
the ends of dog leashes. Do his
first specials. His first Letterman.

1236
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:42,830
Yes. Still holds up. Yes.
Yes I am with you on matters.

1237
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:43,910
And I say it all the time.

1238
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:47,450
That is the test of how like
people go talk about comics now.

1239
01:06:47,451 --> 01:06:48,710
All this guy's this,
this guy's at,

1240
01:06:48,711 --> 01:06:52,790
you're not gonna know until 1520 years
later and then you go back and you listen

1241
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:54,020
to this stuff.
Does it hold up?

1242
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:56,840
You know Kinison and 86 was the
best comment that ever lived.

1243
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:59,630
That's what I think the Kinison the came
out. There was never a guy like him.

1244
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:00,710
There was never a guy who was

1245
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:01,633
fuck [inaudible]

1246
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:06,980
he had his own thing and this
rage and get in front of people.

1247
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:11,730
She this parachute, it's phase. This is
marriage. Motherfucker just [inaudible].

1248
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:12,883
There was nobody

1249
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:16,870
[inaudible] what about,
but he had the ability to,

1250
01:07:16,871 --> 01:07:20,910
to reel it in and then unleash
it like preacher. Yeah.

1251
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,070
Like a lot of guys who,
I've been guilty,

1252
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,750
I've been on stage and you just feel
like Jesus, I just screamed for an hour.

1253
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:29,860
That was bullshit. And I said, fuck too
many times they hit, bought him. He had a,

1254
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:32,980
he had the ability, you know,
when he would bring it down? Yeah.

1255
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:36,550
When he did that bit about like
necrophilia and when he's laying,

1256
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:39,610
laying face down and he just goes,
okay, all right, so I'm dead. You know,

1257
01:07:39,611 --> 01:07:41,830
he's all the way down there
and then, oh, what is that?

1258
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:45,340
You know how I found out about it? One
of the greatest tags ever. It never ends.

1259
01:07:45,341 --> 01:07:47,740
It never ends. One of the greatest
excuse fucking in the ass,

1260
01:07:47,741 --> 01:07:51,610
even after you're dead. It never
ends. But he, he, he, he, but he,

1261
01:07:51,611 --> 01:07:55,220
all of that was in just the line.
It never ends. Yeah. It's just fine.

1262
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:58,270
I heard about that bit because I was
working at the Boston Athletic Club.

1263
01:07:58,271 --> 01:08:03,271
There was a girl who worked there and
she just got home from seeing the Hbo

1264
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:06,370
Comedy Special With Sam Kennison and
she reenacted that bit in the fucking

1265
01:08:06,371 --> 01:08:09,370
parking lot of the club in South Boston.
She got on her stomach

1266
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:14,510
and she goes, so I'm dead. I'm going
to be with Jesus. What is this?

1267
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:18,800
It feels there's a deck in my head.
You mean live keeps fucking in the ass.

1268
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:22,670
You've been after your dad had
never ran. Never had. Oh God.

1269
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,550
Yeah and I was like,
that is the funny.

1270
01:08:24,551 --> 01:08:28,150
I was 19 and I remember thinking that
is the funniest fucking thing I've ever

1271
01:08:28,151 --> 01:08:30,480
heard in my life and
then I got a copy of it.

1272
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:32,980
It was the first time I ever
thought I got in common.

1273
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,940
This is sort of throw off bit that he did.
Why was this a CD after he had died,

1274
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:39,680
they did like this compilation.
He did like the whole,

1275
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,610
that whole bit on Captain Kangaroo,
which would normally be like a hacky bit,

1276
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:47,300
but he got into the psyche of
the guy playing captain kangaroo.

1277
01:08:47,301 --> 01:08:49,460
This was the w later CD, right? Yeah.

1278
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:52,340
This is like one of his last ones and
he was one of the things with that.

1279
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:55,280
He decided not to put on and then he
dies and then somebody else puts it out.

1280
01:08:55,281 --> 01:08:56,570
It's one of those things,
it's kind of not fair.

1281
01:08:56,571 --> 01:08:59,840
Like a lot of the other material
wasn't, you know, up to snuff.

1282
01:08:59,841 --> 01:09:02,180
But he never released it. Don't
when he was alive. So I don't,

1283
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,700
I don't criticize them for that,
but the uh,

1284
01:09:04,701 --> 01:09:08,510
the captain kangaroo bit through where
he gets into the psyche of the guy

1285
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:14,180
talking about and he somehow he brings
it all around to s he was an out of work

1286
01:09:14,181 --> 01:09:17,660
actor. So he took the Gig and the, and the
end of the bit, he's yelling at his wife

1287
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:20,330
go and we data the cash,
you know,

1288
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:24,770
I didn't know that Gig was gonna last
20 fucking years and just screaming,

1289
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:28,310
fucking haircut and
just the, the, the, the,

1290
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:30,830
the horrific life of this guy.

1291
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:35,780
Make somebody great. The ability,
anybody can be like a cat. The cat group,

1292
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:36,770
let's up with this guy.

1293
01:09:36,771 --> 01:09:39,980
Like he got out and eat the whole
thing and just he turned the guy,

1294
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:42,920
you saw the actor that played them,
which I grew up

1295
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:46,970
watching him. And here's the
most important thing, and
this is where, I mean, again,

1296
01:09:46,971 --> 01:09:48,260
I'm a huge bill Hicks Fan.

1297
01:09:48,261 --> 01:09:52,130
I think what he did was brilliant and
he changed the way I looked at a lot of

1298
01:09:52,131 --> 01:09:56,240
things and he opened my eyes up to a
lot of things that were fascinating and

1299
01:09:56,241 --> 01:09:58,610
interesting but not necessarily funny.

1300
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,300
And I would scream and cheer with it and
I would laugh along with it because I

1301
01:10:02,301 --> 01:10:03,134
agreed with it.

1302
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:06,710
But you would see Kinison and he would
make a point that would fucking have you

1303
01:10:06,711 --> 01:10:09,680
doubled over with laughing.
And it's totally different.

1304
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:13,400
Like there's a hicks bit that you can
find online about Hicks talking about he

1305
01:10:13,401 --> 01:10:16,550
wants his rock stars to have passion. It's
another one of these things, you know,

1306
01:10:16,551 --> 01:10:17,390
I want you to rock stars,

1307
01:10:17,391 --> 01:10:20,390
to go onstage and to unite everybody to
shoot yourself in the head and do heroin.

1308
01:10:20,391 --> 01:10:23,120
All is all these different things.
And he's screaming and yelling.

1309
01:10:23,121 --> 01:10:26,060
I want him to have passion.
But I'm looking at him
like, but where's the jokes?

1310
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:29,210
Where's, where's the joke? Whereas
you watch a Kinison sketch,

1311
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:32,600
especially the 86 Kennison like how about
the fucking thing about sending money

1312
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:35,150
to the homeless, the poor kids
in Africa. And he goes, he goes,

1313
01:10:35,151 --> 01:10:37,290
don't send the money.
Send them a guy like me send.

1314
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:38,600
My guy was going to go over there and go,
hey,

1315
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:42,270
we just drove 3000 miles with
your food and it's realized, look,

1316
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:45,820
we wouldn't have to do this if you'll
be able to live where they live in a

1317
01:10:45,821 --> 01:10:47,710
fucking desert.
Can you see that?

1318
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:50,470
See that this is not going
to be a hundred years now.

1319
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:54,510
We got deserts in America too.
We just don't live in a mass.

1320
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,390
I know that word word fucking is the best.

1321
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:02,340
He was based,

1322
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,960
he's the guy.
He's the guy.

1323
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:08,940
My Mount Rushmore's guy
would be prior Kinison. Uh,

1324
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,750
Carlin. Yeah, I need like one
out of gangs is in there for me.

1325
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,000
Pixels in there for me.
But Hicks

1326
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,550
is in there in a different way.
He's like a brilliant social satirist.

1327
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:20,300
Just say Martin Martin. Lawrence.
I'm tell you something, man,

1328
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:22,080
don't discount Martin Lawrence Dude.

1329
01:11:22,081 --> 01:11:26,070
And then the Sunday see Martin Martin
Lawrence. Oh yes, for sure. Good point.

1330
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:30,270
Steve Martin's a monster. The early Steve
Martin fucking, I wish he never stopped,

1331
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:33,600
man. He was so good. Let's get
small. Actually, it's a brilliant,

1332
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:37,170
especially Martin Lawrence because what
everybody else was doing at the time,

1333
01:11:37,171 --> 01:11:41,070
everyone was trying to do what I think
Carla was doing. Oh, what prior was doing?

1334
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,580
And he just came out with a fucking
arrows between and was just being simply

1335
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:49,200
guys. That's the thing too.
Like I love silly comedy. Yes.

1336
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:52,560
I love that stupid shit.
Like not saying that his stuff was stupid,

1337
01:11:52,561 --> 01:11:57,170
but I liked that kind of stuff.
Uh, I like my stuff. Wait, silly.

1338
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:01,020
My favorite stuff is my stuff. That's
silly. I mean, I like angry stuff,

1339
01:12:01,021 --> 01:12:02,400
but I like doing silly stuff.

1340
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:05,350
Sometimes it's a function of Gio
has to wear the leather coat,

1341
01:12:05,351 --> 01:12:09,680
smoking the cigarette guy. Hey man,
you know, corporations, I mean I,

1342
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:13,830
I have parts of my equity talk about
like a conspiracy theory in that type of

1343
01:12:13,831 --> 01:12:15,480
thing and I'm not into that.
But I'm always conscious,

1344
01:12:15,481 --> 01:12:19,320
like one of the words I avoid when
I do my act, this is the word we,

1345
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,670
whenever somebody uses that,

1346
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:24,150
it's a fucking turn off to me and
I feel like I'm being preached at,

1347
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:28,890
I'm not really, ah, I learned weird.
I thought I learned writing word. No,

1348
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:31,440
I know with the PR, depends
on how you do it, but I just,

1349
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:34,470
I saw comic a long time ago at the comic
strip and I just remember he was going,

1350
01:12:34,471 --> 01:12:38,640
he was going on, on ongoing like,
you know, but do we do this now?

1351
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,590
We want to country in that form yet.

1352
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:46,020
Like you don't fucking
speak. That's silliness. Say,

1353
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:48,600
say what you think about it and
then I'll listen to your opinion.

1354
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:50,700
If I agree with it, I'll laugh.
Or you if I don't, if it's funny,

1355
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:53,960
I'm going to laugh, but like,
uh, like I don't like being,

1356
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:58,770
I don't like preachiness out like
being selfish fake shit. Yeah.

1357
01:12:58,771 --> 01:13:02,820
That you're being dangerous or yeah. Or
like pushing an image. Like, you know,

1358
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:06,660
you're going on stage with an image.
You're trying hard to push it. Yeah.

1359
01:13:06,661 --> 01:13:09,750
I worked with this chick Laura House once.
She knows she is not a comic.

1360
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:10,720
Funny girl from,

1361
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:14,550
I believe she's from Texas and you
lived in San Francisco and uh, she,

1362
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:18,540
when she met me, the first thing she
said, she took a deep breath. She goes,

1363
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:21,490
I heard you're really like edgy and dark
and I was so worried that you're going

1364
01:13:21,491 --> 01:13:26,290
to show up wearing black. That's
hilarious. Areas she gives us worried.

1365
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:29,460
You're going to be one of those cards
with a black shirt and black jeans sitting

1366
01:13:29,461 --> 01:13:32,100
in the green room and [inaudible] I
have a bill Hicks shirt that says,

1367
01:13:32,101 --> 01:13:35,520
do you think I'm wearing all black in
the summer because I'm a ray of sunshine.

1368
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:39,270
It's like, you know, like I'm wearing
but I'm wearing black. I'm dangerous.

1369
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:41,940
It is sort of fucking stupid.
It's an outfit.

1370
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:45,150
No different than ones that someone
wears at Burger King or at a fucking

1371
01:13:45,151 --> 01:13:48,150
monastery. We're in a big stupid
orange row. I will give it a shot.

1372
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:51,930
Him is his Leno bit was great,
like, yeah. And he had great shit,

1373
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:56,130
but I shouldn't say some of us, some
of his stuff was funny. You know,

1374
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:00,360
I laughed at it. But Ari, you know,
was like he was making a very,

1375
01:14:00,361 --> 01:14:03,270
very valid point that there's a
lot of like fluff in his business.

1376
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:06,690
Just him talking about ideas.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1377
01:14:06,691 --> 01:14:07,800
I think it's interesting and you,

1378
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:11,560
I don't need to laugh every minute to
be entertaining. It's like 20 later.

1379
01:14:11,561 --> 01:14:12,040
And then you're also

1380
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:17,040
talking about a guy who went down a road
where you're not going to get a sitcom,

1381
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:20,120
you're not going to leap to movies.
So there's,

1382
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:24,690
you gotta give the Guy Credit that he
did that he had a lot of the statistical

1383
01:14:24,691 --> 01:14:25,180
integrity,

1384
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,180
but that's also who he was. I mean, he
would just snug it was going to get one.

1385
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:28,620
Anyway,

1386
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:28,831
dude,

1387
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:32,070
you're going to get tweets where people
are going to our emails where people say

1388
01:14:32,071 --> 01:14:34,810
Kinison socks. So it's, so it's one of
those deals where it all comes down to,

1389
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:39,390
I definitely like personally for me,
the guy during that period,

1390
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:40,640
for me,
what was,

1391
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:43,790
but I have to be honest
with one time I watched, um,

1392
01:14:43,791 --> 01:14:46,790
I saw Richard Pryor's
first specials when I was,

1393
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:51,140
but I hadn't even done comedy yet. I had
just moved out of my parents' house and,

1394
01:14:51,141 --> 01:14:53,540
uh, I was with my buddies
and we watched two, uh,

1395
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:56,810
we had a VHR player in the
fucking VHS rather in a,

1396
01:14:56,811 --> 01:14:59,750
an apartment shitty apartment wall fam.
And uh,

1397
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:04,040
we watched Sam Kinison and then right
afterwards we worked Richard Pryor and I

1398
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:07,850
was like, wow, prior is way
better prior, first prior.

1399
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:11,900
The first prior special is just
fucking brilliant. It was brilliant.

1400
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:15,110
It wasn't that he was better, it's
just, I've almost felt like, God,

1401
01:15:15,111 --> 01:15:18,800
why was Kenton screaming so much?
You know what I mean? Like prior,

1402
01:15:18,801 --> 01:15:22,160
like Pri was so smooth
and so real on stage.

1403
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:26,030
We're sitting as Kinison was putting on
a show, it was a brilliant fucking show,

1404
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:28,820
but the way he was talking to you was
not the way you would really talk to

1405
01:15:28,821 --> 01:15:33,190
someone, you know? Oh, I was
mad for two fucking, yeah.

1406
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:37,760
Whereas prior would be talking
to you the way you really felt.

1407
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:40,910
You were drawn into him as a human being.

1408
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:43,750
That's how I looked at.
There's certain is a very few guys,

1409
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:47,900
but certain guys who just take it so far,
you can't be surpassed.

1410
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:51,160
I would say him, James Brown,
all this music that has come,

1411
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,740
no one has ever done it better than
that guy. You can't. You can't.

1412
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:58,320
There's very few guys as a handful of
artists that they're just, you can't pass.

1413
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:02,520
Have you ever seen the James Brown
live and Zaire clip you want to show?

1414
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:04,290
We played this on here
once with Joey Diaz.

1415
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:08,070
Find that Brion pull that shit up on
your iPad. James Brown live in Zaire. I,

1416
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,170
I've seen that yet.

1417
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:14,130
One of the greatest performances
the human race has ever,

1418
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:18,720
the thing that was just one night. Yeah.
Yeah. Just one lady and I was like 50,

1419
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:20,910
and he kept banging that
out all over the country.

1420
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:25,710
He would throw that mic stand offish
shoulder and kick it and he just fucking

1421
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:28,140
never missed a beat,
never slipped.

1422
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,990
He had leather fucking slippery bottom
shoes on, spinning around. I also

1423
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:33,580
liked as far as like,

1424
01:16:33,581 --> 01:16:36,430
you know when you work with the comedian
and after like two shows, you realize,

1425
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:39,370
oh, this guy is going to do the exact
same jokes in the exact same order.

1426
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:42,820
That whole shit we'll with a band,
he just starts.

1427
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:45,880
If he decides he's just going to talk,
they just start playing on like a loop.

1428
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,950
Like that's what I like when I,

1429
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,870
when I watched like bands like
you can tell when they're,

1430
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:53,740
when they're improvin is because they
don't look at the crowd there fucking

1431
01:16:53,741 --> 01:16:56,550
looking at the s there's waiting for some
sort of cue. Like what is it that one,

1432
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,130
like Steve, when I used to watch
Stevie Ray Vaughan, like, uh,

1433
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:02,070
like some of the live shit that
he did always knows Tommy Shanna,

1434
01:17:02,071 --> 01:17:04,040
Chris late in the drum and
the bass player in the drama.

1435
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,500
They would always be
kind of looking in the,

1436
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:10,160
and once you got educated to watching
him enough you would see the nods where

1437
01:17:10,161 --> 01:17:12,920
like sometimes they would be
looking, thinking out, here he comes,

1438
01:17:12,921 --> 01:17:13,900
he's coming out of an anti,

1439
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:17,360
he's going back into more soloing and
then he'd be on his way out and he just,

1440
01:17:17,361 --> 01:17:21,800
we just sort of glance over at him and
then seamlessly that that shut shit just

1441
01:17:21,801 --> 01:17:22,640
blows me away.

1442
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:23,710
People were able to do that.

1443
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:26,270
It's just the practice together
all the time like that.

1444
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:27,530
I guess you just get tuned in.

1445
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:30,370
I don't know. I just, I'm not a
musician so I don't understand that.

1446
01:17:30,371 --> 01:17:32,460
You play drums, right? Yeah.
And that's the kind of thing,

1447
01:17:32,461 --> 01:17:34,590
but I'm like the same way I watch sports.
Like I'm a geek.

1448
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:37,650
Like I wish I played in the NFL, but you
know, I wish she played drums. I wish,

1449
01:17:37,651 --> 01:17:40,710
no know I can play drums
at decent for a comedian,

1450
01:17:40,711 --> 01:17:43,950
but like the like how good
those guys are, man. Sure.

1451
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:46,020
Like I went to a foul on tape
and I was watching the roots.

1452
01:17:46,021 --> 01:17:49,200
I actually got to see them
play during a break. Dude,

1453
01:17:49,201 --> 01:17:51,960
they're fucking ridiculous
raising. Yeah, ridiculous.

1454
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:55,230
And they don't even have to look at
each other to us. What blows me away,

1455
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:57,460
they just sort, Kj. Glen said,
man, let's do this for a while.

1456
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,030
We think you're doing that when you,

1457
01:18:00,031 --> 01:18:02,670
when you go on stage and you're free
ball and sometimes talking to somebody in

1458
01:18:02,671 --> 01:18:04,200
the crowd and all of a
sudden it becomes a bit,

1459
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:07,350
I mean how many times you've done that?
Someone will say something in the crowd

1460
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:10,260
and you go, look at this fucking guy. He
thinks all the sudden he's at a carnival.

1461
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:12,450
Hey, I'll have some
popcorn, please. You know,

1462
01:18:12,451 --> 01:18:15,630
and then you turn it into a fucking bit.
How many times have you done that?

1463
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:18,210
And I've talked to people that
say after you get off stage,

1464
01:18:18,211 --> 01:18:20,000
like is that guy a plant? And you go, Nah,

1465
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:23,760
I was just fucking around with that guy
though. You made all that up on the spot.

1466
01:18:23,761 --> 01:18:27,240
I don't want to think about it.
Is, is your locked into you right?

1467
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:30,780
You got to fucking worry about the guy in
the bongos and the dude over here like,

1468
01:18:30,781 --> 01:18:32,760
is this guy paying attention
when I go to do this? Did he,

1469
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:36,990
did he see what he just did like gave
the little nod like I don't get how it

1470
01:18:36,991 --> 01:18:39,800
works, but like maybe it's because I
can't do it then I'm so blown away by,

1471
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:43,090
no, you're good point. I mean I can't
do it either. I mean I don't even,

1472
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:45,730
I wouldn't even know where to start.
I think it's the same thing though.

1473
01:18:45,731 --> 01:18:47,290
I think when you tune into comedy,

1474
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,900
I guess it's got to be harder because you
got to have a bunch of people that are

1475
01:18:49,901 --> 01:18:54,310
tuned into May. It's got to be all
about everyone making the song better.

1476
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:56,170
It can't be all about like,
okay,

1477
01:18:56,171 --> 01:19:01,060
here's it's Tom for time for Tommy's
fucking drum solo. He needs a drum solo.

1478
01:19:01,061 --> 01:19:05,110
Every song or he gets pissed off and this
guy gets to go off and then it becomes

1479
01:19:05,111 --> 01:19:06,650
like self indulgent,
but there's,

1480
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:09,880
when it's tuned in and it's just to
to make the song better and they do it

1481
01:19:09,881 --> 01:19:13,780
together, you know? I guess
that's what you like. Jazz
is supposed to be all about,

1482
01:19:13,781 --> 01:19:16,180
right? Everybody like does it
together to make the song better

1483
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,930
me,
once I got out of that bad at that bed,

1484
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:23,810
I can't let somebody sounds like five
guys playing five different songs on that

1485
01:19:23,811 --> 01:19:24,310
shit.

1486
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:27,410
On my message board about this.
Cause I said that I hate jazz and uh,

1487
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:29,530
I don't really hate jazz.
I just don't like it. I,

1488
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:32,440
I shouldn't say I hated because I do
listen to it sometimes in the background.

1489
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,680
Have you ever listened to that? Yeah,
I've listened to a lot of different shit.

1490
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:39,550
I look, I don't, I, but I wouldn't choose
it over fucking the almond brothers.

1491
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:43,670
You know, you choose it over. See
if it's fucking Leonard Skinner.

1492
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:49,140
Alabama is the only thing I cannot fucking
listen to other than if it's early on.

1493
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:52,200
Ban Dwight Yoakam I can listen to Dwight
Yoakam and that guy's a bad mother

1494
01:19:52,201 --> 01:19:56,210
fucker. And I even like some stupid shit.
I'll ask them to Coby Tz I like some of,

1495
01:19:56,211 --> 01:20:00,090
should have been a cow boy. I liked
that stuff. I know it's stupid.

1496
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:03,120
I like stupid shit. I don't mind.
I like a lot of stupid shit.

1497
01:20:03,121 --> 01:20:07,170
It doesn't bother me that it's stupid. I
enjoy some of that, but often it's corny.

1498
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:08,123
Me,

1499
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,050
I just,
I get like douche chips when I listened.

1500
01:20:10,051 --> 01:20:12,780
I have a problem with people that
don't like Willie Nelson or something.

1501
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:15,390
I shouldn't do this.
I shouldn't judge people.

1502
01:20:15,391 --> 01:20:19,080
But when some people don't like
certain things, I think badly of them.

1503
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,990
Like this girl the other day said that
she didn't like now cause I don't like

1504
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:24,120
those are,
those are fine things.

1505
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,780
But this girl said she didn't like
Stevie Ray Vaughn. She's like, oh,

1506
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,690
I can't listen to that. I go, what
are you talking about? She goes,

1507
01:20:30,691 --> 01:20:33,900
I can't listen to that. It's,
it's guitar stuff. It's terrible.

1508
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,660
And I don't know her very well. So I just
walked someone who works for the UFC,

1509
01:20:36,661 --> 01:20:39,470
I just walked away. I'm like, okay,
well but all I think it was that Bro,

1510
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:41,240
she's broken.
You don't like see you can't,

1511
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:45,720
you don't like couldn't stand the
weather. Du Du, Du, Du, Du du Du

1512
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:50,820
and it just because I've heard it
so many times culturally is man,

1513
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:55,110
you smoke a joint and listen to Stevie
Ray Vaughan live. Listen to that shit.

1514
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:57,710
Stevie Ray Vaughan and double
trouble live. I would introduce it.

1515
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:02,730
He has a fucking live version of Voodoo
child that will knock your Dick into the

1516
01:21:02,731 --> 01:21:06,990
dirt. He has the only version of Voodoo
child that's right up there with Hendrix.

1517
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:10,240
Put head.
Find that friend that when you use,

1518
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:13,560
when you talk about a guy just took it
to the end and you can't be passed. Yes,

1519
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:17,640
I would say him.
Stevie is as close as you can to that,

1520
01:21:17,641 --> 01:21:22,440
but he was definitely a major
deciphal yes. Of of Hendricks.

1521
01:21:22,441 --> 01:21:25,050
Just to put that out there
cause everyone's gonna to
be writing and going like,

1522
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,440
oh actually he stole a lot from
Hendrix. Well yeah, he certainly did,

1523
01:21:28,441 --> 01:21:31,870
but he also was a huge Hendrix
fan and like broadcast that thing,

1524
01:21:31,871 --> 01:21:34,860
you know what I mean? He like, it
was all in, in homage to Hendricks.

1525
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:37,470
He never pretend your fans to watch.

1526
01:21:37,471 --> 01:21:40,400
Just to watch Stevie Ray
Vaughan play are not tight rope.

1527
01:21:40,401 --> 01:21:44,740
Our Live Austin city limits. Yeah, it's
just add to, it's fucking me thinking.

1528
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:48,780
He was a tremendous motherfucker dude.
He was a tremendous motherfucker. I,

1529
01:21:48,781 --> 01:21:52,680
you know, I almost got a chance to drive
him. I drove Jeff Beck around once I,

1530
01:21:52,681 --> 01:21:55,740
when I was driving limos and Jeff Beck
and Stevie Ray Vaughan were on tour

1531
01:21:55,741 --> 01:21:57,900
together and I was going to
get to drive Steve Ray Vaughan.

1532
01:21:57,901 --> 01:22:00,950
I was all psyched about it, but Steve
Ray Vaughan was such a bad mother fucker.

1533
01:22:00,951 --> 01:22:02,940
You wouldn't take limos,
took a cab everywhere he goes,

1534
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,790
the band would all get in their limos
and their vans and he would just get in a

1535
01:22:05,791 --> 01:22:09,420
cab by himself and smoke cigarettes.
Listen to how good this is.

1536
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:10,950
Cracked the shit out.
Jeff Beck is unreal.

1537
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,270
It's a slightly different version.

1538
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:18,120
I mean it's not what Jimmy
Hendrix did is different.

1539
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:26,230
He's got like a little twain going on.
It's funny. Is in the middle. He does it.

1540
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:29,050
He does a solo on one of them and he
actually is playing the harmony of a

1541
01:22:29,051 --> 01:22:33,970
Hendrickson when he played with a
band of Gypsies. Crank that shit up.

1542
01:22:33,971 --> 01:22:34,804
Brian.

1543
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:41,500
This is the only guy that comes close
to Hendrickson with the song. Yeah. No,

1544
01:22:41,501 --> 01:22:45,910
it's overall stomps him. Oh yeah.
He came up is he's the man. I mean,

1545
01:22:45,911 --> 01:22:48,760
he's a complete original,
but there are both heroin addicts.

1546
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,510
That ain't a coincidence.
Now here at the,

1547
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,090
Steve really kicked up the name is coke.

1548
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,380
His heroin to Roddy heroin
makes you feel that groove.

1549
01:22:56,410 --> 01:22:59,650
I don't know what it is with
those singers. Love that.
Heroin musicians love that.

1550
01:22:59,651 --> 01:23:03,700
Heroin
is a great one.

1551
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,010
[inaudible] it you ever see when he got

1552
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:10,510
booed now you got booed. Stevie Ray
Vaughan. I hope they're all in hell now.

1553
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,790
Bring this down. This
is great. Why did they,

1554
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,820
why did the performance gives me
chills to, this is what happened.

1555
01:23:15,821 --> 01:23:19,150
He went over to the, uh, still not as
good as Hendrix. Pretty God damn good.

1556
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:22,600
But I was good. Yeah. That the
Monterey jazz festival he played at,

1557
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:25,120
so they pursued him off
for some stupid reason.

1558
01:23:25,121 --> 01:23:28,720
They book them at a jazz festival
and he plays blues. He plays loud.

1559
01:23:28,721 --> 01:23:31,750
I mean other than that, like
Stang swaying. I mean it's
not a lot of jazzy shit.

1560
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:34,600
So everybody had been playing
acoustic up to that point,

1561
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:37,420
I think it was in France, I don't know
what it was. Somewhere over in Europe.

1562
01:23:37,421 --> 01:23:42,421
So he goes out there unknown and he went
out there and starts playing and stuff

1563
01:23:42,761 --> 01:23:45,760
and it took about two, three songs in and
they started booing them. But what are,

1564
01:23:45,761 --> 01:23:48,190
and you could see it was
affecting him those really,

1565
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:52,030
but when they would start playing
the song, dude, he total commitment.

1566
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:55,060
It gives me chills every time I watch
it eat. That's all. One of his DVDs,

1567
01:23:55,061 --> 01:23:57,160
they finally showed it and uh,

1568
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:59,680
but that was the time when David Bowie
was in the crown and David Bowie's

1569
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:00,910
watched him go on,
this guy's a beast.

1570
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:04,120
That's how he ended up
playing the solo on that song.

1571
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:05,950
Let's do while he was bombing.
That's funny.

1572
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:09,370
You can bond way better as a musician
though, then you can as a comic,

1573
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:12,500
as a musician I have to do is
just do the song as a comic you,

1574
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:15,100
this was pretty brutal because he was
playing by the time he got to the third

1575
01:24:15,101 --> 01:24:18,850
song or something like you can od,
you can audibly hear boos. Yeah.

1576
01:24:18,851 --> 01:24:22,480
But the thing is is it's,
as much as it's bugging him,

1577
01:24:22,481 --> 01:24:26,430
he still fucking is,
is just ripping on the G.

1578
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:29,080
It's unbelievable. And He, and
he gets off stage. I remember,

1579
01:24:29,081 --> 01:24:31,420
I remember reading a thing where he said,
I'm a total Seaver Yvonne head.

1580
01:24:31,421 --> 01:24:34,760
He got off stage and just like Jesus, I
didn't think we were that bad. And uh,

1581
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,730
then of course he got with David Bowie,

1582
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:40,090
but we wanted them to go on tour and do
like these dance steps and he wouldn't

1583
01:24:40,091 --> 01:24:43,510
fucking do, it was like, I'm not doing,
it's like a comedian not selling out.

1584
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:46,160
And he went back to Texas.
I'm going to go back with my trio.

1585
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:48,760
We're going to try and make it that way.
So we've got huge credibility that way.

1586
01:24:48,761 --> 01:24:51,970
And then, then he blew up. And then a
couple of years later he went back to, uh,

1587
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,300
the Monterey jazz festival. Of
course, they were giving them a call.

1588
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:57,610
He wanted them to do dead stumps.
Yeah. It was probably step one.

1589
01:24:57,611 --> 01:25:01,060
The second his car, he was like, Texas.

1590
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:04,470
Two steps on my fucking balls here.
We're going to have a choreographer.

1591
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:08,710
We're going to work together. And before
I performance, which we'll take a shower,

1592
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:12,760
they wanted him. Yeah, he was, he was
going to be on the let's dance tour. Uh,

1593
01:25:12,761 --> 01:25:15,770
you know, we had that whole pop, you
know, put on your red shoes at Hong Kong.

1594
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:17,650
There was some sort of thing.

1595
01:25:17,651 --> 01:25:20,650
He was coming down the stairs and he had
to do like some little dance step with

1596
01:25:20,651 --> 01:25:24,100
everybody else. And Stevie
would just, yeah, I'm not
doing it. We just walked down.

1597
01:25:24,101 --> 01:25:28,420
And then finally it was just like, ah,
I can't do the [inaudible] replace me.

1598
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:33,430
Steve [inaudible] fucking
tour with David Bowie. Wow.

1599
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:35,860
And I heard he also used
to get mad laws gossip.

1600
01:25:35,861 --> 01:25:40,450
I know he's gonna get mad at
the, uh, David Bowie video.

1601
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,740
Wait for,
let's dance.

1602
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:46,080
Is David boy with with a pair of gloves
on starts playing the solo that Stevie

1603
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:48,940
played. I heard Stevie saw
the video was like, no,

1604
01:25:48,941 --> 01:25:52,040
he shouldn't be out there
fucking pretending like he
played some shitty didn't

1605
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:55,630
play. Wow. Like all stuff like that. Wow.

1606
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,030
This is all shit that just old like
I've poured through the Internet.

1607
01:25:58,031 --> 01:26:00,910
Just reading all these. That makes sense.
It's like comics that you know, I mean,

1608
01:26:00,911 --> 01:26:04,070
how many comics do you know that
looked down upon that hired joke

1609
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,800
writers? You know, we know a lot
of guys. There's a lot of guys,

1610
01:26:06,801 --> 01:26:10,220
especially when they hit a certain
level, they really did become like, uh,

1611
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:11,990
like almost like a figurehead.

1612
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,350
They almost become like a character
and then they have guys write for them.

1613
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:18,740
It looks old school guys especially, well
they have a lot of writers, you know?

1614
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:22,370
Yeah. I mean, I know a guy who has like
five fucking writers and he's a, you know,

1615
01:26:22,371 --> 01:26:25,220
national headliner and he has all these
guys who come up with his own jokes for

1616
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:27,320
him because he's too busy with
movies and all sorts of other shit.

1617
01:26:27,570 --> 01:26:32,050
So, but that, that is the way to do it.

1618
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,780
This is a bad idea tank.
At least that's not the way to do it.

1619
01:26:34,781 --> 01:26:39,190
But like as far as a business model,
so you act never slips down.

1620
01:26:39,191 --> 01:26:41,610
Like I look at that with
like what it does slip.

1621
01:26:41,611 --> 01:26:44,620
I look at it with them because I go,
I could never fucking do that.

1622
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,980
And I watched like five years from now,
here's the problem, here's the problem,

1623
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:48,710
Louie.

1624
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:48,921
Okay,

1625
01:26:48,921 --> 01:26:52,070
does it absolutely the best because he
does a new hour every year and he does

1626
01:26:52,071 --> 01:26:55,910
his own hour. It's all his writing,
right? When you hire somebody else, man,

1627
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:59,360
you might agree that something's funny.
You might agree that you know,

1628
01:26:59,361 --> 01:27:01,910
this idea is funny and you might
use it as a tool. You say, well,

1629
01:27:01,911 --> 01:27:04,520
I'm going to go on stage. I'm going to
plug this thing in and press this button.

1630
01:27:04,521 --> 01:27:05,990
It's going to get a big laugh.
It's going to work,

1631
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:08,330
but it's not going to be
your thoughts being pretty

1632
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:10,650
Jeff. That's what I thought to get
fast. If I can't get past that,

1633
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,420
how can I stay in and if it kills and
you'd be like, do you want to be like,

1634
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:16,920
oh yeah, keep it going. For Frank, frank
wrote that one. You know no districts

1635
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:18,410
back to the comics that we know that.

1636
01:27:18,411 --> 01:27:22,700
Do you use writers that do use writers
but they do not have the same impact on

1637
01:27:22,701 --> 01:27:27,110
me as guys like Norton or guys like
Louie or guys who I know write their own

1638
01:27:27,111 --> 01:27:31,040
shit. The Guy, so I know that's, this is
their thoughts like Norton especially,

1639
01:27:31,041 --> 01:27:34,010
I got Norton's new CD sent me despicable.
I heard it's awesome.

1640
01:27:34,011 --> 01:27:37,430
Fucking whole areas. It's very
fun. Gordon's, oh by the way,

1641
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:41,630
Norton is doing my podcast tonight.
We're doing it live at the smog castle.

1642
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:43,190
By the time you hear this,
if you're on iTunes,

1643
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:47,440
it's Tuesday the 23rd and 22nd
do you use during meetings?

1644
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:49,970
It's so it's,
it's probably not going to be on Ustream.

1645
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:52,280
And if you're listening on iTunes,
it already happened.

1646
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,040
But it's tonight we're going to do
a at nine o'clock at the smog cast.

1647
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:55,760
We're going to try these out.

1648
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,880
We're gonna start doing live
ones in front of an audience.

1649
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:00,610
I think it'd be fun if 50 people,
we put the tickets online,

1650
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:02,930
it's sold out in two hours.
So did these,

1651
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:05,830
they already have like
Mike's and everything. They
have it all set up and you,

1652
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:10,790
he has it completely wired for a podcast
and then he just put in an SD card and

1653
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:13,460
he records it and gives it to you and
you can upload it that night. But anyway,

1654
01:28:13,461 --> 01:28:16,100
Norton is, I'm Greens down there.
It was great. Yeah, I did his too.

1655
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:18,300
And Norton is doing my
thing tonight and not,

1656
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:21,560
so I've been listening to a CD over the
like last night on the way to the gym.

1657
01:28:21,561 --> 01:28:23,390
It's fucking hilarious.

1658
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:28,310
It's so twisted and
crazy. He's so funny, man.

1659
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:31,580
I saw him when I was in Austin.
I was there for uh, the, um,

1660
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:34,940
the UFC and I had the Friday night off.
So a buddy of mine who lives in Austin,

1661
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:39,200
we, I said, hey, you know Jim Norton's
sales, go see him, fucking killed it.

1662
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:41,150
He was show funny dude.

1663
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:44,900
He made me want to go home and write
and he made me do shorter sets.

1664
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:48,230
He did like 50 minutes and I've been
doing this thing lately where I did like,

1665
01:28:48,231 --> 01:28:49,160
I was doing like an hour and a half,

1666
01:28:49,161 --> 01:28:51,800
sometimes two hours and I'd do like a
big question in the answer at the end.

1667
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:52,813
But I always felt like,

1668
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,510
and a lot of ways it kind of like took
away from the energy of like just one big

1669
01:28:56,511 --> 01:29:00,140
powerful performance. Yeah. A huge
believer that you don't go beyond,

1670
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:01,620
I've done.
And it's like,

1671
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,070
you know, you do an hour. That's perfect.
They get at you funny. They walk out,

1672
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,170
they got that excitement.
Yeah. No, cause I, you know,

1673
01:29:07,171 --> 01:29:11,040
whore myself out selling DVDs afterwards.
If I do an hour and 10 an hour and 15,

1674
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:15,000
they come out like, yeah,
they're like this. Especially
if you don't close strong.

1675
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:17,250
Yeah, no. Even if you do
though, even if you do,

1676
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:22,251
it's just a fucking exhausted and it's
just like 50 to an hour is you've given

1677
01:29:22,261 --> 01:29:25,080
them their money's worth and
you've the classic show business.

1678
01:29:25,081 --> 01:29:28,230
You left them wanting more,
but like you go beyond that to what?

1679
01:29:28,231 --> 01:29:30,750
I saw a guy one time,
he did two hours. Okay.

1680
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:33,900
Right in an hour I looked at my watch.

1681
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:37,380
I just instinct avails and how much
has he done? Oh right now look at me.

1682
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:41,760
This is my first kind of, okay again.
Yeah your, this is your take on the world.

1683
01:29:41,761 --> 01:29:42,140
I get it.

1684
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:45,930
Then I'll 15 hour and 20 to one hour
and 25 my fucking ass to start to fall

1685
01:29:45,931 --> 01:29:46,711
asleep.
I agree.

1686
01:29:46,711 --> 01:29:51,540
A hundred by an hour and 35 I came up
with a strategy for me and my girl to

1687
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:52,351
leave cause it was like,

1688
01:29:52,351 --> 01:29:55,170
what's that in a theater and it was
really going to be noticeable if we got up

1689
01:29:55,171 --> 01:29:58,410
and left and so I ended up
being the bad guy. She got up,

1690
01:29:58,411 --> 01:30:00,990
made it look like she was going to the
bathroom and then I just grabbed both our

1691
01:30:00,991 --> 01:30:03,340
cooks. I go, excuse me. She was,
and I saw people like, oh my God,

1692
01:30:03,341 --> 01:30:05,090
I can't believe he was walking out on it.
Really.

1693
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:09,700
It really is too much to sit there
and listen to [inaudible] though.

1694
01:30:09,701 --> 01:30:11,740
Depends though.
Cause I've seen some guys,

1695
01:30:11,890 --> 01:30:15,220
I've seen some hour and a half sets while
I was fucking real happy that the show

1696
01:30:15,230 --> 01:30:15,910
didn't end.

1697
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:18,910
Like I saw Chappelle do an hour and a
half for the comedy store and I enjoyed

1698
01:30:18,911 --> 01:30:20,620
the fuck out of it.
I enjoyed the whole hour and a half.

1699
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:24,550
But then again I'm a stand up comic.
I'm going to on a sewer of comedy.

1700
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:27,760
I had the night off. I don't fucking
have to get up at seven in the morning.

1701
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:30,160
I don't have, at the time
I didn't know a, you know,

1702
01:30:30,161 --> 01:30:33,720
a a normal job that I had to go to
and work all day. So it's like when,

1703
01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:35,390
especially Friday night late show,
dude,

1704
01:30:35,391 --> 01:30:38,130
that shows fucking 10 o'clock these
people been up since seven you know,

1705
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:39,820
that's a long ass time.
They're tired.

1706
01:30:39,821 --> 01:30:42,880
Ship your barn in the crowd
and they're drunk. You know?

1707
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:47,330
I think it actually, it decreases them
wanting to come and see you again. Yes.

1708
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,990
I definitely like if you
go out there and just

1709
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:51,240
can you just blast to for an hour,

1710
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:56,640
that's Boston style to Boston style is
short and nobody in Boston ever did a

1711
01:30:56,711 --> 01:31:00,110
fucking two hour set. They would look at
you like, what are you fucking retarded?

1712
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:04,270
What did we do 40 remember those fucking
Nick's comedy stop sets where the

1713
01:31:04,271 --> 01:31:07,360
fucking headliner would do 20 minutes.
Everybody would do 20 I'm,

1714
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:11,950
it'd be five guys do in 20 minutes and
they would do the same 20 minutes for a

1715
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:16,120
hundred years and it would be honed to
a Samurai sword, sharpness, Don Gavin,

1716
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:16,990
his timing,

1717
01:31:16,990 --> 01:31:20,230
he could talk about anything and it
would be brilliant because he had talked

1718
01:31:20,231 --> 01:31:24,850
about it so long he knew the exact right
beats and how to pause Knoxy all those

1719
01:31:24,851 --> 01:31:28,990
guys. Don Gavin made me think
that I shouldn't have been
in comedy. Made me think,

1720
01:31:28,991 --> 01:31:30,370
how could I ever be as good as this guy?

1721
01:31:30,430 --> 01:31:35,430
I was an open miker watching him fucking
destroy one night it was stitches,

1722
01:31:35,621 --> 01:31:37,780
comedy club. Okay. And
it was the new stitches,

1723
01:31:37,781 --> 01:31:39,280
which wasn't as good as the old stitches.

1724
01:31:39,281 --> 01:31:41,650
It was nice because it was bigger and
it had a restaurant attached to it,

1725
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:46,160
but there was like carpet in the floor,
the ceiling, it was a little too high.

1726
01:31:46,161 --> 01:31:49,780
I didn't absorb the, it didn't bounce
back. The laughter like the old stitches.

1727
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:53,440
Stitches with dark anyway,
the fucking shows long dude.

1728
01:31:53,441 --> 01:31:55,690
It was like an a an open
mic night and you know,

1729
01:31:55,691 --> 01:32:00,430
1520 unfunny want to
be over and over again.

1730
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:03,350
Go Up. And I was one of them.
And then at the end, Kevin Flynn,

1731
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:06,010
who was part of the pool, I was part of
the problem for sure. And I was thinking,

1732
01:32:06,011 --> 01:32:08,140
wow, this is audiences
exhausted. At the end,

1733
01:32:08,141 --> 01:32:13,141
Kevin Flynn brings up Don Gavin any
fucking crushes and crushed to the point

1734
01:32:14,771 --> 01:32:19,771
where me and Chris Mcguire and a couple
other guys were sitting in the back

1735
01:32:20,591 --> 01:32:23,730
room, hands in our face, like
the fucking home alone kid going,

1736
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:27,460
we should just quit comedy. We can't do
this and will never be able to do this.

1737
01:32:27,461 --> 01:32:29,920
I'm never going to be that good. We're
going, we need to stop right now. No,

1738
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:32,380
that was a great thing.
I think about that shit.

1739
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:35,650
Like thank God I started there as fuck.
It was a few place like San Francisco,

1740
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:40,450
Boston and New York is a great place
back in the day. Like now, not the same.

1741
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:43,990
Unfortunately. The last stops gone and
now they just have, they do it on Sundays.

1742
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:47,560
They call it the comics union I think.
But uh, the, the old laugh stop,

1743
01:32:47,561 --> 01:32:51,160
the old one in river oaks was
the shit, you know, that was a,

1744
01:32:51,161 --> 01:32:55,090
that was the place where, you know, I mean
Kinison started out back then, you know,

1745
01:32:55,091 --> 01:32:57,920
they used to have, it was the comedy
annex, I think they call it. They,

1746
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:01,910
by the time I got out there, that place
was already gone. Unfortunately. Man, I,

1747
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:05,620
I recorded my first CD there.
Yeah. And Hicks did his uh,

1748
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:09,550
his first special sane man. Yeah,
yeah. At the same club that see that,

1749
01:33:09,551 --> 01:33:11,680
that that's that thing on the wall.
That's from [inaudible] 99.

1750
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:14,530
That's what I recorded my,
those are my Warner brothers CD.

1751
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:16,780
I'm going to be dead some day
and I did that in Houston.

1752
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,330
That was when I was on
news radio on those,

1753
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:21,670
there was only one place in the country
where I would sell out every show and

1754
01:33:21,671 --> 01:33:24,920
that was Houston. I'd sell out
way in advance. Like, like,

1755
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:27,850
like I would sell out the whole
weekend by Friday. No, my dad says no,

1756
01:33:27,851 --> 01:33:32,630
I didn't do that anywhere else, you
know, and does nowhere else. But the um,

1757
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:36,190
maybe I didn't, maybe I sold out like
one day in advance. What a point is.

1758
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:40,030
There was no place where I would like
they would stuff in extra people in like

1759
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:44,170
violate the fire code. Like when I
recorded my CD there, they stuffed in 50,

1760
01:33:44,171 --> 01:33:46,240
60 people over the fire code.
I mean, there was people,

1761
01:33:46,241 --> 01:33:48,400
there was chairs in the aisles and shed.
It was ridiculous,

1762
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:51,910
but it was because that was the
style of comedy that they love.

1763
01:33:51,911 --> 01:33:55,800
Like Hicks and Kinison and they were
both dead by that time. They had grown,

1764
01:33:55,801 --> 01:33:59,560
like Houston had developed this table.
One of those guys left. Yes. Both of them.

1765
01:33:59,561 --> 01:34:03,310
I saw both of them live. I saw Kennison
live only as an audience member,

1766
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:05,290
but as I Hicks alive when
I was already a comic,

1767
01:34:05,291 --> 01:34:07,330
I saw him live at least three times.

1768
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:09,460
One time I left the room
because he wasn't doing so well.

1769
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:12,430
So it was just like the
audience had no idea who he was.

1770
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:15,000
And he was just onstage talking about,
uh,

1771
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:19,270
Debbie Gibson and Jimmy Hendrickson was
just fucking, people weren't buying it.

1772
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:19,690
You know,

1773
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:24,280
there's a couple of times where I saw
him where he absolutely destroyed though

1774
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:28,330
one time at the old comedy connection man,
where he was just on his fucking game.

1775
01:34:28,331 --> 01:34:32,410
Man, he just destroyed, just,
just came in there, guns blazing,

1776
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:36,400
all this shit about Jim Fixx dying while
jogging and all that shit. You know,

1777
01:34:36,401 --> 01:34:40,450
because Jim Fixx was the jogging guy
and the Yule Brenner bit, you know,

1778
01:34:40,451 --> 01:34:42,390
he had a Yule Brenner,
Yule Brenner, you know,

1779
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:45,750
Jim Fixx would get up and Dewey
track at dawn jogging and you'll run.

1780
01:34:45,751 --> 01:34:46,550
It would be coming home,

1781
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:50,350
its head out of the limousine to chicks
blowing them smoking a cigarette and

1782
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:54,400
they're both dead and he's like,
you know, he's dead. I'm dead.

1783
01:34:54,670 --> 01:34:57,950
Shit. That could be, I
was fucking up at dawn

1784
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:01,400
doing. Yeah, I mean it was a really
lovely guys saw from back then.

1785
01:35:01,401 --> 01:35:05,840
I saw dice clay at the, at the height
of, I saw him at the Worcester Centrum.

1786
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:09,080
I sat at the second to
last row in the upper deck.

1787
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:13,780
Eddie Griffin or unknown Eddie Griffin
opened up and we were all like Boone ago

1788
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:17,690
[inaudible] dice man. And I was doing
that. I was doing that dumb audience,

1789
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:18,180
you know,

1790
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:21,620
[inaudible] going to like us because
we're treating his opener like shit.

1791
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:24,000
And Eddie Griffin was hilarious.
He's like, fuck you motherfuckers.

1792
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:28,070
And then he actually got the crowd, he
turned him around and everything. But uh,

1793
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:29,780
how old was I at the time?

1794
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:35,570
28 I saw Tennyson when I was 19 when
I was working for a great woods.

1795
01:35:35,571 --> 01:35:39,660
I was wearing you for a
great woods performance arts
center and he's like, yeah,

1796
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:42,200
I saw Eddie Murphy on the
raw tour. Oh, did you? Yeah.

1797
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:44,930
I just didn't see Eddie Murphy out there,
but I saw bill Cosby.

1798
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,410
I saw Rodney Dangerfield out.

1799
01:35:46,411 --> 01:35:50,030
Dangerfield out there to Dangerfield was
naked with a robe on who would go with

1800
01:35:50,031 --> 01:35:52,370
a bathrobe on and slippers
and that's how he'd do comedy.

1801
01:35:52,490 --> 01:35:55,910
Fucking naked as balls hanging out. He'd
go backstage as balls were hanging out.

1802
01:35:55,911 --> 01:35:56,780
He didn't give a fuck.

1803
01:35:57,090 --> 01:36:01,430
You like to do comedy naked with
a robot and destroyed. By the way,

1804
01:36:01,431 --> 01:36:04,690
one of the most underrated comics
of all time fucking destroyed.

1805
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:06,800
He had the classic get
up with the red tag.

1806
01:36:06,950 --> 01:36:11,120
We see something that you said before that
I wanted to go back to because I both,

1807
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:14,360
we both agree with this about this,
and I've talked about this before,

1808
01:36:14,361 --> 01:36:18,890
is that Hicks or not in a Hicks? Whether
the Kinison was genius in the beginning,

1809
01:36:18,891 --> 01:36:20,390
but then terrible at the end.

1810
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:24,980
He's might be an example of a guy that
got famous and he got huge and then he

1811
01:36:24,981 --> 01:36:27,470
bought into his own hype and
then he became a character.

1812
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:29,590
He stopped writing when he was at doing.

1813
01:36:30,210 --> 01:36:32,180
I don't think I've ever
seen a guy handled it worse.

1814
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,410
If you just watch the difference
between his first and second Letterman,

1815
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:39,130
his first Letterman, like, you
know, they say that like, you know,

1816
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:41,870
they give that intro like,
Jesus, we don't this next guy,

1817
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:44,090
the next guy's going to be different.

1818
01:36:44,091 --> 01:36:47,660
We know does that air of like
something crazy could fucking happen.

1819
01:36:47,661 --> 01:36:51,710
And usually it's just hype will, this
guy's crazy. But it's, it's, his act is,

1820
01:36:51,711 --> 01:36:55,700
he's crazy, but it's like Kennison
it was real. And he came out, dude.

1821
01:36:55,701 --> 01:36:59,060
I mean he just fucking came out and he
was walking up into the crowd and it

1822
01:36:59,061 --> 01:37:03,650
wasn't cheesy, it was just, it was, it
was amazing. And then the second one,

1823
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:06,250
he comes in, he just comes, you
know, do you know that his face,

1824
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:11,430
what's going on day? And he just
was just like relaxed to him. Yeah,

1825
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:15,950
he was just like a, I made it not hungry
yet. I made it. He's a fat guy, you know,

1826
01:37:15,951 --> 01:37:19,370
at the end of the day he's lazy.
I mean that's really true.

1827
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:23,390
I mean fat people are fucking lazy.
You know his personality in his book,

1828
01:37:23,391 --> 01:37:26,870
his brother Bill, his
brother, his brother's name,
I forget his name, I met him,

1829
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:30,050
unfortunately, I forgot his name.
Whatever his name is. I'm sorry,

1830
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:31,530
whoever you are as Rocco,

1831
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:36,200
his brother who wrote the book wrote
that he was a normal kid and then you get

1832
01:37:36,201 --> 01:37:40,340
hit by a fucking truck. He got hit by
a car and when you get hit by a car,

1833
01:37:40,350 --> 01:37:44,090
he got fucked up and he came
out of that head injury,

1834
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:45,380
a completely different person.

1835
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:49,580
And then it became like reckless and
fearless and all fucking wild person like

1836
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:53,590
the accident literally made him Sam
Kinison. I mean, cause you think about it,

1837
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:56,210
I'm like, who the fuck
thinks like that? Who

1838
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:59,250
has that kind of boldness to go on
stage and scream and yell about things?

1839
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:01,290
You know? And did you ever
see when he was preaching,

1840
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:05,460
you ever see the videos of him
preaching? Yeah. Hey man, it's great.

1841
01:38:05,490 --> 01:38:07,440
Holy Shit.
I mean it was so,

1842
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:12,470
there was like a rhythm to someone
preaching when they believe have a Lord

1843
01:38:13,071 --> 01:38:15,300
touches me. You're like, fuck. I mean,

1844
01:38:15,301 --> 01:38:18,350
knowing what I know what I'm saying
is nonsense. The applause break. Yeah.

1845
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:21,670
And nobody knows how to build.
They fucking like you're,

1846
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:24,690
that's why he was such a good comic.
Cause you would add those principles.

1847
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:29,120
He would draw it out.
Like ladies and gentlemen,

1848
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:33,240
I know the devil's in this room. And they
were like, oh, we'll bring them down.

1849
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:33,870
Yeah,

1850
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:38,870
the devil would like you to believe that
there's something wrong with the Lord.

1851
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:40,141
You know?

1852
01:38:40,141 --> 01:38:42,780
And then he starts walking back and
forth and then it builds up to this.

1853
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:46,710
But I'm here to tell you,
James, that says a lot, Jay,

1854
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,790
this is where he's with.
And then everybody's fucking screaming,

1855
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:55,120
dude, I gotta tell you she would do. I
don't buy any of the, any of that shit.

1856
01:38:55,450 --> 01:38:57,670
But I love watching preachers. I
watched the guy that, you know,

1857
01:38:57,671 --> 01:38:59,830
we just clearly a bigoted psychopath,

1858
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:04,570
but he was fucking a phenomenal
performer and you know that guy,

1859
01:39:04,770 --> 01:39:07,840
he would, he would bring up
people who like, uh, you know,

1860
01:39:07,841 --> 01:39:10,920
who were living like probably
the life that we're living in.

1861
01:39:10,930 --> 01:39:14,110
And he had this way of saying what they
were doing and then he would just sort

1862
01:39:14,111 --> 01:39:17,140
of look to the side and shake and you'd
get a laugh every time I got now he

1863
01:39:17,141 --> 01:39:19,300
would read a quote with
somebody said like, you know,

1864
01:39:19,301 --> 01:39:22,600
this guy says premarital
sex is not a bad thing.

1865
01:39:22,601 --> 01:39:24,760
It doesn't want to think for yourself.
It doesn't do anything bad to your soul.

1866
01:39:24,761 --> 01:39:26,590
Right.
And then he just had this look,

1867
01:39:26,591 --> 01:39:29,200
he was like Carson watching Carson
when he would look over at the band.

1868
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:32,080
He just had this thing where he would
just sort of looked down and the crowd was

1869
01:39:32,081 --> 01:39:34,870
just like, oh, here he comes. He's
going to take the piss out of this guy.

1870
01:39:35,170 --> 01:39:37,470
You know what I mean? It's like watching
your favorite wrestler. Like here you go,

1871
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:41,080
here we go. Then the guy builds it all
the way up and I would just, you know,

1872
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:42,230
and it was one of those things where he,

1873
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:44,830
I would actually start getting into it
like, hey, maybe this guy's got a point,

1874
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:48,520
and then they would just say something
horrific about gay people or just

1875
01:39:48,521 --> 01:39:49,630
something that just, you
just, you're like, God,

1876
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:51,960
this is how does an adult
think something like me,

1877
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:54,640
while he probably couldn't wait to
get off stage and fuck some kid,

1878
01:39:55,430 --> 01:39:58,550
I ain't go to Thailand, Bang
some kids. Yeah. You know,

1879
01:39:58,590 --> 01:40:00,850
do what I got in this huge thing with
this fucking guy in the internet.

1880
01:40:00,850 --> 01:40:02,250
Like it's the last time
I'm getting with like,

1881
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:07,360
I fucking like 10 deep
on emails and emails,

1882
01:40:07,361 --> 01:40:09,100
deep diameter and about what?

1883
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:13,570
About how I said why I stopped going to
Catholic Church and this guy was upset

1884
01:40:13,571 --> 01:40:17,420
at that. Yeah. And he knew, bothered to
argue with that because I'm an Ada yet,

1885
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:21,250
like I come from a, you know, I can't,
I take the fucking budget, use that one.

1886
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:26,540
Um, guilty because note,
because there's, there's a, uh,

1887
01:40:26,541 --> 01:40:30,820
a sense of, uh, I don't
know what the fuck it is,

1888
01:40:30,821 --> 01:40:35,350
what the word is that super
religious people have that, you know,

1889
01:40:35,351 --> 01:40:37,840
you just wanna boners no,

1890
01:40:37,841 --> 01:40:42,220
you just want to expose
like their bullshit. Right.
All right. So I just said,

1891
01:40:42,221 --> 01:40:42,641
listen,
you know,

1892
01:40:42,641 --> 01:40:46,240
I stopped going because I was going to
church and every time the basket came

1893
01:40:46,241 --> 01:40:47,470
around and I was putting the money in,

1894
01:40:47,471 --> 01:40:51,010
I felt like I was giving money for a
fucking defense attorney did offend these

1895
01:40:51,011 --> 01:40:55,690
guys who look the other during
pedophilia, right? Or whatever.

1896
01:40:55,691 --> 01:40:56,290
So He's,

1897
01:40:56,290 --> 01:41:00,400
his big issue was saying that I couldn't
say that they were kid fuckers because

1898
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:05,380
most of the people who got violated
were teens. And I was like, oh,

1899
01:41:05,381 --> 01:41:09,880
great. See you grade on a fucking scale.
So he directs me to this Wikipedia page.

1900
01:41:09,881 --> 01:41:14,320
It was over 10,000 fucking incidences
that they're talking about it.

1901
01:41:14,321 --> 01:41:15,370
This is just the ones that were reported,

1902
01:41:15,371 --> 01:41:17,440
forget about the kids who killed
themselves and didn't come forward because

1903
01:41:17,441 --> 01:41:19,780
they're too embarrassed.
They 10,000 instances,

1904
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:23,980
22% of them were 10 10 years
of age and under. So I go,

1905
01:41:23,981 --> 01:41:28,240
let's just round it off to 10 grand.
That's 2100 cases of dental and a kid.

1906
01:41:28,241 --> 01:41:31,390
How many kids do you gotta fuck before
you get labeled as a kid? Fuck her.

1907
01:41:31,391 --> 01:41:34,930
Because the other ones and a and he was
trying to spin it that I was actually

1908
01:41:34,931 --> 01:41:38,650
helping pedophiles because I wasn't going
to church and the church did all these

1909
01:41:38,651 --> 01:41:41,240
things and people back in the
day were confused. They thought

1910
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:45,600
was it? You got trolled thought it was
like a spirit. Second thing I was me,

1911
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:51,810
you got trolled by a 14 year
old pretending to be religion.
No, no, no, no, no, no,

1912
01:41:51,811 --> 01:41:55,290
no, no. Cause it happened possible.
Possible. You can't trick me. I know.

1913
01:41:55,291 --> 01:41:56,200
A real really know but

1914
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:57,860
no, cause there's, there's certain,

1915
01:41:57,861 --> 01:42:00,770
there's certain things that he was going
through cause I was sitting at some

1916
01:42:00,771 --> 01:42:02,750
point goes this guy just
trying to piss me off,

1917
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:05,950
but two he got all the way into the
fucking, I'm a correctional officer.

1918
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:09,800
My grandfather was a correctional officer
and I work with these pieces of shit I

1919
01:42:09,801 --> 01:42:13,440
made. If I did, it was the greatest
one ever. [inaudible] website.

1920
01:42:14,430 --> 01:42:18,900
Yeah. Everyone's in their trolls. Seems
easy. It seems like I want to try it.

1921
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:23,630
I know. I'm thinking about
getting a vague email gets low.

1922
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:25,800
I fuck with you every day.

1923
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:30,120
I'm going to bring up [inaudible] like
there's people who go to those churches

1924
01:42:30,121 --> 01:42:31,860
who aren't that fucking
stupid would there is,

1925
01:42:31,861 --> 01:42:34,260
but there's a lot more people that would
like to fuck with you now that they

1926
01:42:34,261 --> 01:42:37,050
know how easy it is. Look,
my message board right now,

1927
01:42:37,051 --> 01:42:42,040
they're sharpening up their
dicks right now. Right dress,
but it's over. No, no, no,

1928
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:45,300
no. Not Him. You say it's not, they're
going to get nice and subtle with you.

1929
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:46,980
They're going to start off nice and slow.

1930
01:42:46,981 --> 01:42:50,070
They're going to say something to you
about some picture of the timeline of you

1931
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:53,630
grow your Dayton. Yeah. Just don't send
any photos of you and your Dick. Yeah.

1932
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:56,250
At the same time that your face and
you're going to know some shit about you

1933
01:42:56,251 --> 01:42:59,600
that's personal, some inside
shit and they're going to
exploit it. Your fuck? Nah,

1934
01:42:59,601 --> 01:43:03,850
Nah. You've got an issue,
bro. You're you're, you're
in trouble. I'm not theories.

1935
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:06,660
Easy to troll.
I'm not in screen capturing things.

1936
01:43:07,470 --> 01:43:10,650
You were thinking about coming to Jujitsu.
I talked to you about it for awhile.

1937
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:13,500
You were thinking about doing it.
Just even if you don't want to do that,

1938
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:16,800
get out God damn punching bag.
It'll make a better bill burr.

1939
01:43:17,010 --> 01:43:21,810
Just get a bag of gloves. It's so easy.
That's nice and cute and shit, but

1940
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:27,390
you get off telling me that I
need that to not take the bait.

1941
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:30,420
You Joe are really worse at this than me.

1942
01:43:30,930 --> 01:43:32,760
I'm telling you this is what happened.

1943
01:43:32,761 --> 01:43:36,600
You basically just said that I got trolled
and I used your presenting it as fact

1944
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:40,940
having not read any wild,
obviously additional
candidates. You're arguing core.

1945
01:43:40,941 --> 01:43:44,700
Who are you with? Me? [inaudible]
you fucking listeners.

1946
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:47,970
[inaudible] sending me fucking
emails. It's ridiculous. Easy.

1947
01:43:47,971 --> 01:43:50,580
This is how easy it is to get you
upset you or trolled right now.

1948
01:43:50,990 --> 01:43:52,550
Tell you right now,
I

1949
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:55,940
could get you. I could get you if I didn't
tell you what my feelings about weed,

1950
01:43:55,941 --> 01:43:59,240
where I couldn't. I had you standing
up with a fucking vain, even high.

1951
01:43:59,390 --> 01:44:01,670
I could make you freak out if I,
if I pushed your buttons,

1952
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:04,520
I was still laughing at you. I would
say it's ridiculous. Oh, that's right.

1953
01:44:04,521 --> 01:44:09,120
I forgot this is, this is the
new spot. Joe Rogan. Come on out.

1954
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:11,400
Jesus. Stop his joke. Joke. Joke me. Well,

1955
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:14,840
one of the great things about being a
psycho as you can spot another one across

1956
01:44:14,841 --> 01:44:18,350
the room for you to sit here, but I
managed my psychosis better than you.

1957
01:44:18,351 --> 01:44:21,530
That's all it is, buddy. I'm all Tom
saying you've got, you've not signed them.

1958
01:44:21,531 --> 01:44:24,020
I have it on the line. A bubbling
brook in the back. I get it.

1959
01:44:24,030 --> 01:44:27,820
Not Saying I got it under the
one that I'll go with that,

1960
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,320
but you're a little out of hand.
You're going

1961
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,530
back and forth with a guy who believes
that the church protects pedophiles.

1962
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:34,980
Yeah.
I like to debate.

1963
01:44:37,110 --> 01:44:40,710
I go back and forth with fucking
jets fans. I hate the phone Jack.

1964
01:44:41,450 --> 01:44:42,450
I go back and forth on them.

1965
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:45,140
Did you hear about this fucking guy?
You know, I'm only kidding, right?

1966
01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:48,650
What about all, I mean, I don't really
think you're a loser. I don't think that.

1967
01:44:48,770 --> 01:44:49,603
Now you never said,

1968
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:54,200
I'm going to interrupt. Think that
you're going to be easy to troll. I know.

1969
01:44:55,470 --> 01:44:57,440
I want people to know
that this all in fun.

1970
01:44:57,441 --> 01:45:01,940
I want people to know that this is all in
fun people. Right moment on the pocket.

1971
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:02,390
People

1972
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:05,600
don't understand. Like people go, Whoa,
fucking these idiots on my message board.

1973
01:45:05,601 --> 01:45:07,670
We go Joe Rogan to Bill Berg on issues.
I thought,

1974
01:45:07,671 --> 01:45:11,090
but they really got into it all.
You hear bill first, Joe Comics,

1975
01:45:11,091 --> 01:45:12,890
fuck around like this all the time.
This is what we do.

1976
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:16,320
And especially people that, uh, you know,
especially if you live on the west coast,

1977
01:45:16,321 --> 01:45:18,290
she never really understand
that sort of sense of humor.

1978
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:21,830
It's why people didn't
understand that Gilbert Godfried
thing. To me, it was like,

1979
01:45:21,831 --> 01:45:23,660
you know, when, when he started
tweeting about Japan, I'm like,

1980
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,690
east coast comic would
do, I mean, you know,

1981
01:45:26,691 --> 01:45:31,180
you gotta you all want to go for the
juggler. Yeah, I didn't like to do,

1982
01:45:31,210 --> 01:45:33,620
but how he leave in new,
he did the voice of the duck.

1983
01:45:34,430 --> 01:45:38,360
You know who fucking
just like that classic.

1984
01:45:38,361 --> 01:45:41,450
Certainly it's a lot of Japanese people
that were in this insurance competence.

1985
01:45:41,450 --> 01:45:44,540
One of the reasons why I was a busy
always. Now did you hear about this?

1986
01:45:44,541 --> 01:45:47,990
A high profile Vegas drug
prosecutor. This guy, uh,

1987
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:52,610
he busted Bruno Mars. He busted Paris
Hilton on all, on cocaine charges.

1988
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:56,810
He got arrested for buying crack head.

1989
01:45:57,120 --> 01:45:59,120
You gotta believe that she must
know who you hang out with.

1990
01:45:59,210 --> 01:46:01,280
But I was thinking about this when
we were talking about, you know,

1991
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:03,280
the pedophiles and you know,

1992
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:07,470
all these fucking crazy people that
don't want to believe. It's like w how,

1993
01:46:07,471 --> 01:46:12,380
how many people that go against
something really want to do it.

1994
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:17,020
I mean, how many fucking people like that?
How many people that are against gain,

1995
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:20,480
like the Ted haggards of the world that
are against gay marriage against gay,

1996
01:46:20,481 --> 01:46:22,890
this, against that, let's say
something like that. Yeah, yeah.

1997
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:25,640
I remember that guy that got busted
in New York. You're really recently,

1998
01:46:25,641 --> 01:46:28,100
he was a a judge or something like that.

1999
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:32,000
He got busted and some sort
of an influence scandal and
it turns out that he was

2000
01:46:32,001 --> 01:46:35,030
a voting against gay marriage and
he was fucking gang, you know,

2001
01:46:35,031 --> 01:46:37,250
the guy's gay and he was living
with a guy and he's, you know,

2002
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:40,370
making all these votes against gay
rights. Yeah. Which goes back to religion.

2003
01:46:40,490 --> 01:46:42,620
They just let people live and
be who the fuck they were.

2004
01:46:43,410 --> 01:46:45,200
Then you wouldn't have
people doing shit like that.

2005
01:46:45,201 --> 01:46:47,520
But as far as like the drug thing I think
is a lot of people don't have to drugs

2006
01:46:47,530 --> 01:46:50,010
that they, they seriously are. I like

2007
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,530
against him. But, uh, I
think you know the thing,

2008
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:54,540
you've got to watch out who you hang
out with because you end up doing what

2009
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:57,930
they're doing.
I think eventually you just try it.

2010
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:02,190
You think you're in the evidence room.
Wow. Really. You fill tried crack,

2011
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:03,480
you're feeling a little sleepy.

2012
01:47:03,481 --> 01:47:06,240
You can leave me alone with buckets of
crack in my house and I'm not going to

2013
01:47:06,241 --> 01:47:08,520
smoke it. Yeah, but can you just
leave it all over the place?

2014
01:47:08,521 --> 01:47:10,950
I'm never going to touch the crack.
This is what I would do.

2015
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:14,200
I leave you with booze first,
get you when you're like 11 you know,

2016
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:18,780
and we moved away. This is
a developed human, which is
like a gateway drug, right?

2017
01:47:18,781 --> 01:47:19,614
You go to the weed,

2018
01:47:20,730 --> 01:47:25,110
then that must've then it all depends
on what you want to feel like for you.

2019
01:47:25,111 --> 01:47:26,990
I see why the way your makeup,

2020
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:31,590
you want to feel less smell like
Joe Rogan on coke. You'd start,

2021
01:47:31,591 --> 01:47:35,730
you'd be like Godzilla. He'd start
stepping on fucking skyscrapers downtown,

2022
01:47:35,731 --> 01:47:37,890
so it would be hard to get
you to go the crack route,

2023
01:47:37,891 --> 01:47:41,310
but like hallucinogenics and that type
of thing. It'd be, well my buddy Jimmy,

2024
01:47:41,311 --> 01:47:44,670
when I was in high school and my buddy
Jimmy used to do coke and he told me,

2025
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:49,600
whatever you do, don't do it. You'd like
it. Don't do it. Yeah. That's my resume.

2026
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:49,850
Well,

2027
01:47:49,850 --> 01:47:52,320
that's why I never really fucked her
another week because I knew when I finally

2028
01:47:52,321 --> 01:47:54,860
did it, I loved it. I definitely
loved it and I, that's,

2029
01:47:54,890 --> 01:47:57,750
I get a lot of shit in my podcasts cause
people think I'm anti wait cause they

2030
01:47:57,780 --> 01:48:01,380
fucking more, I got a million
tweets around those. Yeah,
no it's, I'm not anti weed.

2031
01:48:01,410 --> 01:48:06,000
I'm just saying stop acting like it's
not addicting like this that it's just,

2032
01:48:06,001 --> 01:48:09,630
it's just like alcohol. Well No,
it's not just like alcohol, but in,

2033
01:48:09,631 --> 01:48:11,250
that'd be addictive.
Psychologically.

2034
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:15,120
Physically though physiologically is not
physically whatever, psychologically,

2035
01:48:15,121 --> 01:48:18,090
what do you want to call it? But like
those wake and bake guys, those guys,

2036
01:48:18,091 --> 01:48:21,090
I got a buddy of mine who smokes
weed because I said, why do you,

2037
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:26,850
why do you like doing in a seriously
fucking with his life and he's going to do

2038
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,460
weed is not the issue. And I go, why?
First of all, why do you do it? He goes,

2039
01:48:29,490 --> 01:48:34,490
I like weed because it
turns my life into a movie.

2040
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:41,040
All right. And it's like this
dude, like, I don't know.

2041
01:48:41,041 --> 01:48:42,990
I don't want to fucking rat
them out or nothing like that.

2042
01:48:42,991 --> 01:48:47,190
But he's lost the job because
he flunked a fucking drug test.

2043
01:48:47,860 --> 01:48:51,150
That's a shitty job. And every job
that was their job sucked. Okay.

2044
01:48:51,151 --> 01:48:53,850
Any job that you can do that's
boring as fuck you can do on weed.

2045
01:48:53,851 --> 01:48:57,680
And it becomes interesting. You know? I
find, I'm not saying that it's a bedroom,

2046
01:48:57,690 --> 01:48:58,800
I'm saying,
but this guy,

2047
01:48:59,190 --> 01:49:04,050
he gets fucking high because
he's just keeping life.

2048
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:06,810
Yeah. He's using it the way an Alka
uses alcohol, where it's just like,

2049
01:49:06,811 --> 01:49:09,540
I got all this pain. I don't how to
process it. I don't want to deal with it.

2050
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:12,660
Let me just, let me just get fucked
up. That's how he does it. And Dude,

2051
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:15,240
I'm telling, and the thing about it,
think about it is too, with weed,

2052
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:19,860
is I can't go to work drunk. You know
what I mean? But you will be high,

2053
01:49:19,861 --> 01:49:22,290
you can go to work fucking high, and as
long as you're going to handle your shit,

2054
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:25,140
people aren't gonna fucking notice.
I just,

2055
01:49:25,141 --> 01:49:27,470
there's a bunch of emails I gotta gotta
gotta go, you know? Yeah, I handle,

2056
01:49:27,471 --> 01:49:30,900
we straight just every night I smoke a
little fucking bowl and then I go to bed

2057
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:34,160
and it's just like, well what if I, you
know, drank a beer and a half, two beers.

2058
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:37,740
So I got buzzed every fucking night.
People will be looking at me like, dude,

2059
01:49:37,741 --> 01:49:40,260
I think, I think you have like a
drinking problem that you have to get.

2060
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:44,070
He's like sedating himself. So he's
using it as like a fucking sleep aid.

2061
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:46,020
I'm not saying that,
but I don't have any problem with me.

2062
01:49:46,021 --> 01:49:48,010
I think it makes you feel
great and that type of shit.

2063
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:51,650
It's just like anything as long in
moderation. But people who sit there like,

2064
01:49:51,670 --> 01:49:53,350
and annoys me that on intervention,

2065
01:49:53,351 --> 01:49:57,730
they've never had just some pothead
who's been fucking high since he's 16 and

2066
01:49:57,731 --> 01:50:01,660
he's still watching like fucking the
Hanna Barbera hour. And you know,

2067
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:04,720
cause it doesn't compare to the math
guys pulling his face off with his

2068
01:50:04,721 --> 01:50:08,080
fingernails. And I know that she
seems a lot worse. That's the,

2069
01:50:08,081 --> 01:50:09,690
don't know that that's definitely worse.
But that's,

2070
01:50:09,691 --> 01:50:12,850
that's what then if you know meth heads,
they're the fucking worst.

2071
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:13,990
Does that mean you shouldn't go after?

2072
01:50:14,060 --> 01:50:15,630
It was all the difference
between not being

2073
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:18,880
in your normal state. You know,
you're escaping your normal self.

2074
01:50:18,881 --> 01:50:23,650
So even if your wheat stoned
all day, you're escaping,
you're, you're sober self,

2075
01:50:23,651 --> 01:50:27,910
your, your core self, which
is always a problem in some
ways. You know what I mean?

2076
01:50:27,911 --> 01:50:28,744
Like just people,

2077
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:32,770
I drive better when I'm high and I know
exactly the way he's talking about.

2078
01:50:32,771 --> 01:50:35,650
There's so many people that we know
that just wake up from the beginning.

2079
01:50:35,651 --> 01:50:38,920
They wake up, they have to get stone
to the go to bed and they're never,

2080
01:50:38,921 --> 01:50:41,170
they're sober self because
they're hiding something.

2081
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:45,300
You know, they all have in common
photo bombing. I agree. I agree.

2082
01:50:45,301 --> 01:50:47,220
100% of the vaporizer,

2083
01:50:47,221 --> 01:50:50,780
it's probably a thousand
times more healthier than
drinking a fucking six pack.

2084
01:50:50,781 --> 01:50:53,520
You know what they all have in common?
They're all fucking hilarious. Yeah,

2085
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:58,140
absolutely. Listen, when I was on
fear factor, I totally self medicated.

2086
01:50:58,141 --> 01:51:00,900
I used to get high before every show.
After the first season,

2087
01:51:00,901 --> 01:51:05,670
I got high before every fucking show.
I was so bored doing that show.

2088
01:51:05,671 --> 01:51:08,820
I mean, sometimes it was cool. Don't get
me wrong, I'm very happy I had the job.

2089
01:51:08,821 --> 01:51:11,010
It was a fucking wonderful opportunity,

2090
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:14,940
great people to work with the
producers and everyone was the fucking,

2091
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:18,030
the crew grow fantastic.
It was just a wonderful job.

2092
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:20,730
But I would rather be doing
other shit, you know? Yeah.

2093
01:51:20,731 --> 01:51:23,910
I wanted the money and I wanted to do
it and I wasn't gonna quit. But Mandy,

2094
01:51:23,911 --> 01:51:25,920
you know, at certain
points in time, I mean,

2095
01:51:25,921 --> 01:51:28,400
how many fucking animal Dick's
can you feed people? But we like,

2096
01:51:28,401 --> 01:51:30,570
what the fuck am I doing with my life?
You know,

2097
01:51:30,571 --> 01:51:34,980
how many times can you hang somebody by a
crane and go, ready? Three, two, one, go.

2098
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:36,420
Right.
You know how many is to think about you.

2099
01:51:36,421 --> 01:51:40,950
It's like you smoking weed doesn't
affect you from prevent you from fucking

2100
01:51:40,951 --> 01:51:44,370
coming up with the new hour of material
doesn't prevent you. It doesn't, it helps.

2101
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:45,870
I ended. Okay. Yeah.

2102
01:51:45,930 --> 01:51:50,370
And you're not slacking off and just
watch some cartoons fucking up your

2103
01:51:50,371 --> 01:51:53,040
motivation. All right. So, yeah,

2104
01:51:53,070 --> 01:51:55,680
I'm not saying like people just thought
I was just straight across the board

2105
01:51:55,681 --> 01:51:57,180
saying it was bad.
I wasn't saying that.

2106
01:51:57,181 --> 01:52:00,540
I was just saying like I just got sick of
people going, yeah, it's not addicting.

2107
01:52:00,690 --> 01:52:05,340
I drive better when I'm high and like,
like there was no repercussions.

2108
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:08,100
Like there's repercussions to
fucking everything. You don't,

2109
01:52:08,101 --> 01:52:11,430
especially if you're smoking that Fuckin
Oji Kush that a lot of dudes like to

2110
01:52:11,431 --> 01:52:14,490
smoke that that Endeca,
there's two different types of weeds,

2111
01:52:14,491 --> 01:52:17,460
sativa and Indica and the sativa is,
or like more heady,

2112
01:52:17,461 --> 01:52:21,510
like you want to go watch a documentary
on space and the indycars you just want

2113
01:52:21,511 --> 01:52:23,820
to watch cartoons and eat
cereal and sleep. You know,

2114
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:27,900
they're two really different effects
and most of the country only gets that.

2115
01:52:27,901 --> 01:52:30,980
We'd most of the country gets the
sleepy weed. They get to college.

2116
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:34,230
You know what I found lately that
sleepy weeds the best we'd have sex on.

2117
01:52:34,231 --> 01:52:38,370
That's like ecstasy on weed. Yeah,
they're kind of makes sense. Yeah. Well,

2118
01:52:38,371 --> 01:52:41,470
you know what though? The regular is
pretty awesome to the regular, you know,

2119
01:52:41,471 --> 01:52:46,100
what's the best for sex? Eating weed. When
you eat wheat, you get that body. You get

2120
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:46,970
that because it's,
you know,

2121
01:52:46,971 --> 01:52:49,400
it really affects you in a different
way because it's a different chemical.

2122
01:52:49,401 --> 01:52:52,230
When you knew it's processed by your
liver and that's the best for second.

2123
01:52:52,260 --> 01:52:53,880
It's like everything feels better.

2124
01:52:53,881 --> 01:52:56,250
Watch the Oscars and it
was like the Best Oscars.

2125
01:52:56,580 --> 01:53:00,600
Why was I heard that there was some
bad monologue or something. I didn't,

2126
01:53:00,630 --> 01:53:04,010
I don't watch any of that nonsense.
I think people awards for ours.

2127
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:07,590
It's ridiculous. Was the moment James
Franco, you could just see tapped.

2128
01:53:07,591 --> 01:53:09,190
I was just like, ah, fuck this. He got,

2129
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:12,060
I came out in a dress and
you're not going to laugh at me.

2130
01:53:12,061 --> 01:53:15,030
Go Fuck yourself and just had this
look on his face and I keep working.

2131
01:53:15,031 --> 01:53:18,300
Who gives a fuck? It was great. He
says, take my phone out and check.

2132
01:53:19,090 --> 01:53:21,510
It was like a comedian when you
just look at a crown and they got,

2133
01:53:21,511 --> 01:53:22,530
these people are fucking idiots.

2134
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:25,550
Well, how about the shitheads that
got upset at a, what's his name?

2135
01:53:25,730 --> 01:53:29,540
The English guy. There was, yeah,
there was doing the Golden Globes.

2136
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:30,570
They got upset at him

2137
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:31,790
cause he was shitting on everybody.

2138
01:53:31,791 --> 01:53:34,280
But I didn't think he deserved
any sort of edgy points.

2139
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:36,840
I mean it's like you show
up and you, you, you,

2140
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:41,240
you have a staff of writers write
roast jokes and you took his jeep like,

2141
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:44,300
yeah cause been done heavy. That was
like, like it was this amazing fucking,

2142
01:53:44,301 --> 01:53:45,140
can you believe in,

2143
01:53:45,141 --> 01:53:49,280
know you fucking get a staff writers
to write roast jokes to sling them at

2144
01:53:49,281 --> 01:53:51,650
people armed with acceptance speeches.
It's like,

2145
01:53:51,651 --> 01:53:54,290
and then when you did go down and
fucking start slapping around some first

2146
01:53:54,291 --> 01:53:55,124
graders,

2147
01:53:55,530 --> 01:53:59,360
I just think that that's a gig where
it's really easy to come off as edgy.

2148
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:01,460
I mean given were gasping
and what was he doing?

2149
01:54:01,470 --> 01:54:03,590
I'll Robert Downey JR Rehab joke.

2150
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:06,290
It goes back to that Hicks Shit that
you were talking about. It's just like,

2151
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:09,920
I thought it was really like, uh,
like I just look at that Gig boy,

2152
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:13,790
that's like the comic where you get like
a corporate gig and they go, listen,

2153
01:54:13,791 --> 01:54:17,060
don't talk about this, don't talk
about this and we're clean. Okay.

2154
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:18,050
And you agree to it.

2155
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:21,710
And then you go out there and then
you just say fucking blah, blah blah,

2156
01:54:21,711 --> 01:54:23,750
and you're walking around like you're
fucking Lenny Bruce. You're now,

2157
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:27,590
you just have to do,
if you didn't want to do the Gig,

2158
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:30,020
if you don't like celebrities,
do you think they fucking suck?

2159
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,570
What are you doing there? And awards
show with the fucking Tuxedo on.

2160
01:54:32,650 --> 01:54:35,530
Greg Fitzsimmons was telling me the
story about a Gig that he did in New

2161
01:54:35,530 --> 01:54:36,520
Hampshire,
you to drive up there,

2162
01:54:36,521 --> 01:54:38,440
it's like fucking four hours
in the middle of nowhere.

2163
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:42,940
And he did the Gig and they told them
whatever you do, you can't swear.

2164
01:54:42,941 --> 01:54:44,650
Don't say fuck. So he
goes on stage, he goes,

2165
01:54:44,651 --> 01:54:47,740
apparently I'm not supposed to
say fuck like what's that about?

2166
01:54:47,980 --> 01:54:51,800
He gets off stage, they have his bags
packed like right there by the side says,

2167
01:54:51,820 --> 01:54:55,720
get the fuck out of here. You're fired.
And so he has to drive home and you know,

2168
01:54:55,721 --> 01:54:59,410
he was telling it to rich slicer actually
and slicers like Dan let you drive

2169
01:54:59,411 --> 01:54:59,981
home at night.

2170
01:54:59,981 --> 01:55:02,230
Usually they tell you to never drive
at night because there's a moose.

2171
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:07,210
They're like, fuck this
kid. He said the evil word.

2172
01:55:07,330 --> 01:55:10,240
But yeah, that's a Douche. But that's
a thing you do when you're 20 you know,

2173
01:55:10,950 --> 01:55:14,350
you're like, yeah, that's how I
always viewed it. I viewed it like,

2174
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:16,930
cause I went through that period,
but I sort of viewed it like,

2175
01:55:17,770 --> 01:55:21,940
it's like they're telling you what they
want and they hired me to do this and

2176
01:55:21,941 --> 01:55:24,490
you're agreeing to fight.
It's like that fucking kid at Byu.

2177
01:55:24,491 --> 01:55:27,700
Everybody's flipping out. Like he had
sex and they kicked him off the team.

2178
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:32,590
They said what they expected and you
signed a fucking contract, you know,

2179
01:55:32,591 --> 01:55:33,670
don't go to this school.
Yeah.

2180
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:37,210
But the idea of stopping teenagers
for fucking, it's just like saying,

2181
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:41,290
I'll drink water is ridiculous. I'm not
saying it's smart, I don't agree with it.

2182
01:55:41,291 --> 01:55:44,190
I think it's fucking ridiculous.
But

2183
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:49,170
who in their right fucking mind
signs a contract and says, I'm not,

2184
01:55:49,171 --> 01:55:50,160
I'm not gonna fuck.

2185
01:55:50,190 --> 01:55:54,480
Dan had to have been all written up back
in the fucking dark ages though, right?

2186
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:57,390
It was in Brigham Young University.
That's a Mormon University. Right.

2187
01:55:57,420 --> 01:56:00,090
I don't agree with it, but it's one
of those things. Don't take the Gig.

2188
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:03,030
You're telling me that guy couldn't put
a ball through a hoop and someplace else.

2189
01:56:03,031 --> 01:56:07,440
Yeah, but it's not like Byu is his fucking
North Carolina or some really like,

2190
01:56:07,441 --> 01:56:08,160
you know,

2191
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:11,700
traditional like where they were all
these like Jordans and James Worthy's came

2192
01:56:11,701 --> 01:56:14,280
from. Byu is like the best they got. They,

2193
01:56:14,281 --> 01:56:18,810
they've had a couple of seasons with
like Steve Young and Jim Mcmahon.

2194
01:56:18,811 --> 01:56:21,450
They've had like great,
great teams with their football,

2195
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:24,690
but now with basketball it's fucking Byu.
No idea what you're talking about.

2196
01:56:24,691 --> 01:56:29,520
Now you lost [inaudible]. Right? But
you know what your listeners see,

2197
01:56:29,521 --> 01:56:33,180
right? Do they, they know sort of sports
football for the losers out there.

2198
01:56:34,030 --> 01:56:36,800
All right. It would be like kidding.
I don't think you're losing.

2199
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:40,110
If you like basketball, right?
Settle Down, put your panties,

2200
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:43,880
straighten them out and say this is Sydney
thinks he's going to get on with that.

2201
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:46,290
Talking about them, not you. I'm
talking about those people out there.

2202
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:48,600
Then you just get upset because I said,

2203
01:56:48,630 --> 01:56:50,640
you're a fucking loser if you're
like basketball. And then I'm like,

2204
01:56:50,641 --> 01:56:54,390
relax everybody on Twitter. I'm just
joking around. These are just jokes.

2205
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:56,400
These are just chokes.
And did you see Gallagher?

2206
01:56:56,880 --> 01:57:00,810
I heard that he fucking got
a stroke on stage right now.

2207
01:57:00,811 --> 01:57:03,810
I saw I was on the local news when
a satisfying things I've ever seen.

2208
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:06,030
He's standing outside of his
house that he somehow owed.

2209
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:09,480
He's owned for 30 years
and he's having an auction.

2210
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:11,760
He's selling all it half the
shit you've seen in a special.

2211
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:14,280
Why selling these off?
Because he's losing his house.

2212
01:57:14,470 --> 01:57:17,010
Jadon tells losing his house.
Yeah. I'm telling you right now,

2213
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:21,780
there aren't fucking TV. Talk about Barry
Bonds and Roger Clemens and what they,

2214
01:57:21,781 --> 01:57:22,840
you know what baseball means?

2215
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:25,710
They should be hunting down these bankers
and fucking shooting him between the

2216
01:57:25,711 --> 01:57:26,700
eyes.
Oh wait a minute.

2217
01:57:26,701 --> 01:57:29,880
The owner house for 30 years and
you're getting kicked out of it.

2218
01:57:29,881 --> 01:57:33,850
I thought it's a 30 year loan money.
Type it in the SEC is loan. So you know,

2219
01:57:33,870 --> 01:57:37,470
he really puts a second
mortgages and probably didn't
pay it. I didn't hear that.

2220
01:57:37,471 --> 01:57:39,150
He got,
he was getting kicked out of his house.

2221
01:57:39,390 --> 01:57:42,690
He was like selling large bananas and
he just had a fucking heart attack on

2222
01:57:42,691 --> 01:57:46,740
stage to it. I don't get how you're
in a fucking house for 30 years.

2223
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:50,460
You're doing road gigs and you somehow
can't afford to keep your fucking house

2224
01:57:50,900 --> 01:57:55,320
to those mortgages. It's modern day
fucking slavery. It's ridiculous.

2225
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:59,700
How can you say that when you say that
a kid should be able to go to Brigham

2226
01:57:59,701 --> 01:58:03,300
young and sign a contract that he's not
going to fuck. You don't think that.

2227
01:58:03,301 --> 01:58:06,910
It's just as ridiculous that someone
signs a contract for a second mortgage on

2228
01:58:06,911 --> 01:58:11,610
there. This is why they're green to that
because you can't live outside home.

2229
01:58:12,030 --> 01:58:14,550
Well, you're a fucking idiot. You're
an idiot, man. If you're homeless,

2230
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:16,590
you better have some
friends sleep on the couch.

2231
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:19,800
You're the dummy wants to take out a
second mortgage when you think you can pay

2232
01:58:19,801 --> 01:58:22,490
it off. I mean, it's an
agreement. It's like it's not,

2233
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:24,740
you're not dealing with
a long a loan shark who,

2234
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:28,050
I completely disagree reeling
because I felt like first of all,

2235
01:58:28,051 --> 01:58:31,470
it shouldn't take you 30 fucking years
to pay the thing off. Didn't take,

2236
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:34,200
you'll get 30 years.
You shouldn't take a Donald Trump.

2237
01:58:34,201 --> 01:58:36,330
30 years is a lot of people
that play this capitalism game.

2238
01:58:36,331 --> 01:58:38,040
They figured out a way to
do it and this guy didn't,

2239
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:42,310
he didn't pay his fucking bills. It's
that simple. Organic or something crazy

2240
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:46,090
organic watermelons. Maybe something
happened. We don't know about.

2241
01:58:46,170 --> 01:58:50,470
Forget it right now. It's just
how the game is set up, dude.

2242
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:54,460
Banks and insurance companies are the
two most crooked motherfuckers out. Yes,

2243
01:58:54,461 --> 01:58:59,140
I agree and as you get older you start
having health fucking problems and you

2244
01:58:59,141 --> 01:59:00,780
have a little heart attack
and then you got it.

2245
01:59:00,790 --> 01:59:04,390
You know you get hospital bills through,
right? They look, this is what the deal.

2246
01:59:04,391 --> 01:59:07,570
They want you to run on the wheel for 30
years and then they want you to fuck up

2247
01:59:07,571 --> 01:59:11,230
financial to, they can kick you
out and stick somebody else.

2248
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:12,160
Listen to what you're saying.

2249
01:59:12,161 --> 01:59:16,060
You are right now doing exactly what
you say you hate comedians doing.

2250
01:59:16,510 --> 01:59:19,090
They want you to do this and
they want you to do that.

2251
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:22,610
That's just the same as we this
the same thing. Notice you're,

2252
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:25,390
you're making this them,
which you're doing is you're being like,

2253
01:59:25,391 --> 01:59:28,660
the guy sent me the email and you're
defending pedophiles in a financial way.

2254
01:59:29,150 --> 01:59:31,150
I'm not defending them at all.
You're saying,

2255
01:59:31,270 --> 01:59:34,450
I think the system is completely fucked
up and did a lot more people should be

2256
01:59:34,451 --> 01:59:38,560
in jail. They, Bernie Madoff. They should
fucking front end load the interest.

2257
01:59:38,740 --> 01:59:41,800
I think Gallagher made millions
of dollars. That's what I think.

2258
01:59:41,801 --> 01:59:44,350
And I think of Gallagher lost his house.
He's probably a fucking idiot.

2259
01:59:44,351 --> 01:59:45,010
Absolutely.

2260
01:59:45,010 --> 01:59:48,520
And then I heard Gallagher on the Marin
podcasts like running off and I've seen

2261
01:59:48,530 --> 01:59:51,160
Gallagher on opie and Anthony.
He's a douchebag.

2262
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:54,110
All those stupid jokes he was trying
to play on Patrice. This is that.

2263
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:56,110
This is the thing,
this is what I can't stand about.

2264
01:59:56,111 --> 01:59:57,850
This shit is Gallagher's the douchebag.

2265
01:59:57,910 --> 02:00:00,940
But what about the fucking bankers do
that made homeless guys qualified to get a

2266
02:00:00,941 --> 02:00:03,160
fucking home? That's a
different argument. They drive.

2267
02:00:03,161 --> 02:00:06,850
They were talking about Gallagher.
I'm never getting back. It's Calico.

2268
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,480
I'm never going to defend defend
Gallagher or bankers or Gallagher.

2269
02:00:10,510 --> 02:00:13,960
Fuck Gallagher. You know, obviously
I don't know the guy's finances shit.

2270
02:00:13,961 --> 02:00:16,450
It just got any chance I had to
take a shot at fucking bankers.

2271
02:00:16,451 --> 02:00:19,970
Have you seen inside job yet?
It's on the wall.

2272
02:00:20,690 --> 02:00:22,660
Just got it and I'm going
to watch it tonight.

2273
02:00:22,661 --> 02:00:24,070
I was going to watch it last night,

2274
02:00:24,071 --> 02:00:28,990
but I try to fix my pool stroke guy named
Stevie more told me my elbow comes up

2275
02:00:28,991 --> 02:00:32,610
in a funny way. I gotta fix my pool's
trucks. I've been telling you, doctor,

2276
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:37,330
you have been watching pool instructional
[inaudible] Estrada than a fucking hot

2277
02:00:37,331 --> 02:00:39,910
chick who's good at pool.
There's a few,

2278
02:00:39,970 --> 02:00:42,520
but the problem is you don't
want to beating you. You
don't want to grow beating.

2279
02:00:42,521 --> 02:00:44,290
You know that's a very masculine game.

2280
02:00:44,470 --> 02:00:46,480
I know guys that were going on
when I would play in a tournament,

2281
02:00:46,481 --> 02:00:49,900
so they didn't have to play women. They
would freeze up. Even good pro players,

2282
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:52,540
they freeze up. They panic because
I don't want to lose to a chick.

2283
02:00:53,350 --> 02:00:57,040
I think Bullard chicks he bench
pressing more than does matters.

2284
02:00:57,041 --> 02:01:01,480
She's playing pool into a whole who
is a very manly game cause it's about

2285
02:01:01,481 --> 02:01:05,530
controlling your instincts and controlling
your emotions and staying calm and

2286
02:01:05,531 --> 02:01:08,200
focused and showing that you
can fire under when you're,

2287
02:01:08,201 --> 02:01:10,660
when they're under pressure,
like pull like the most,

2288
02:01:10,810 --> 02:01:13,630
the big thing about pool is not playing
for fun. The big thing about pools,

2289
02:01:13,631 --> 02:01:17,890
gambling, that's where pool really
what? Pool meeting halls. A manly, well,

2290
02:01:17,891 --> 02:01:22,280
what pool means is pooled the money in
and gamble. That's what it was invented.

2291
02:01:22,330 --> 02:01:25,360
I mean that's literally the name, the
origins of the name pool, the game,

2292
02:01:25,361 --> 02:01:27,310
his pocket billiards.
That's the real game.

2293
02:01:27,490 --> 02:01:30,610
It's called pool because you
fucking gamble on it. And when,

2294
02:01:30,611 --> 02:01:31,990
when guys are gambling,
man,

2295
02:01:31,991 --> 02:01:36,100
last thing we'll do is lose money to a
chick and a game. When you dog the ball,

2296
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:39,220
you panic and you think, oh don't
miss this nine ball. This is yet.

2297
02:01:39,221 --> 02:01:40,054
This is everything.

2298
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:43,060
Put the jars in the moment when
he's going to lose to her in the,

2299
02:01:43,061 --> 02:01:45,980
in the driving thing. Yeah,
man. Gotta beat Marsha.

2300
02:01:46,060 --> 02:01:48,980
Got To get closer than a quarter of an
inch and he knocks the fucking egg off

2301
02:01:48,981 --> 02:01:49,701
the coast in man.

2302
02:01:49,701 --> 02:01:54,350
I remember I had a sit up contest with
my cousin when I was like 11 and I was

2303
02:01:54,410 --> 02:01:58,130
fucking so devastated that she was
beating me in this sit up contest.

2304
02:01:58,340 --> 02:02:02,480
I was super upset or 11. I know,
but look, some people don't mature.

2305
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:05,540
Some guys, it just, look,

2306
02:02:05,541 --> 02:02:09,020
I've lost the girls and tournament's
before and I didn't enjoy it back when I

2307
02:02:09,021 --> 02:02:10,190
was like in my early twenties.

2308
02:02:10,191 --> 02:02:12,730
I didn't like it at all
playing some fucking a woman.

2309
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:14,540
Anything other than an argument.

2310
02:02:14,541 --> 02:02:19,120
If I lost an argument that would fucking
kill me. I really just, I mean, just like,

2311
02:02:19,510 --> 02:02:23,000
like whatever. She yelled louder
than me. I mean, like she got down,

2312
02:02:23,001 --> 02:02:26,510
she just got just like reams of
information and that's why you're wrong.

2313
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:29,060
Go Fuck Yourself. Has that ever
happened? That would drive me nuts.

2314
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:33,650
Has that ever happened? I lost an arm
to the uh, yeah, but this is the thing.

2315
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:37,790
Um, I, I don't, I should have
clarified that not a girl
I'm in a relationship with.

2316
02:02:37,791 --> 02:02:39,680
Right. That's a big thing
with me. If I'm wrong,

2317
02:02:39,950 --> 02:02:41,300
I admit I'm wrong in a relationship.

2318
02:02:41,301 --> 02:02:44,660
You got to do that because then
you're setting up if they're wrong,

2319
02:02:44,661 --> 02:02:47,020
for them to tap up and that,
that will save and do,

2320
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:49,550
you just had a little help a lot and
you know, you're right. You're right.

2321
02:02:49,551 --> 02:02:52,430
I flipped up. I shouldn't have yelled at
that guy. You're right. Blah, blah, blah.

2322
02:02:52,431 --> 02:02:53,330
What it,
it shows,

2323
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:57,020
it shows like a willingness to grow
and honesty and things that people

2324
02:02:57,021 --> 02:02:59,490
appreciate. I appreciate that
in friendships too. When a,

2325
02:02:59,491 --> 02:03:02,420
a friend will come up to me,
dude, I, I shouldn't have
said that to you. I'm sorry.

2326
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:04,580
I appreciate that.
That's what about strangers?

2327
02:03:04,581 --> 02:03:07,490
You don't give a shit and you get no,
fuck. You fuck you back with them.

2328
02:03:07,491 --> 02:03:10,730
If they actually, if they actually, uh,

2329
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:15,470
like I had a victory in and turned it
into a loss about fucking about a month

2330
02:03:15,470 --> 02:03:19,370
ago I was sitting in my car and I'm happy
doing this phoner this meeting, right?

2331
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:24,020
And I'm outside the bank, right? And
this girl pulls up, gets out of a car,

2332
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:28,280
opens the car door right into
my door, boom, hits it and like,

2333
02:03:28,310 --> 02:03:31,760
but didn't even react. I mean,
not like really hard, hard enough,

2334
02:03:32,180 --> 02:03:35,870
but it was the fact that she didn't
fucking react that I actually questioned.

2335
02:03:35,871 --> 02:03:39,570
I'm like, did she just maybe,
I dunno, is it that maybe I,

2336
02:03:39,640 --> 02:03:40,670
I thought she did it or whatever.

2337
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:43,550
So I'm still on the phone doing
this conference call, right.

2338
02:03:43,850 --> 02:03:47,840
She fucking comes back out. She
does it again. So I'm on comp,

2339
02:03:47,841 --> 02:03:51,500
I get these people on speaker 10
noise. So I said, hang on a second.

2340
02:03:51,890 --> 02:03:53,870
I opened the door. I said, hey, I go,

2341
02:03:53,871 --> 02:03:58,460
you just opened your car door to my car
on the way into the bank and on the way

2342
02:03:58,461 --> 02:04:03,320
out of the bank. And she goes,
oh, I didn't chip the paint. I go,

2343
02:04:03,321 --> 02:04:04,910
chip. The paint. He didn't even look,

2344
02:04:05,330 --> 02:04:07,190
why don't you be a little
more considerate next time?

2345
02:04:07,191 --> 02:04:11,540
And I slammed the door so I won game set,
fucking match. And then like an idiot,

2346
02:04:11,541 --> 02:04:15,320
I still have to look over at
her and she just goes, smile,

2347
02:04:15,530 --> 02:04:18,290
have a nice day.
Like I'm an asshole for getting upset.

2348
02:04:18,350 --> 02:04:21,650
And then she gave me the finger
and drove away. She kind of,

2349
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:23,420
she kind of stole around on me.

2350
02:04:23,450 --> 02:04:26,450
It's like I won and I got when
sugar ray Leonard that yeah. Yeah.

2351
02:04:26,451 --> 02:04:31,451
Like when you hang on one that fucking
fight by the way you like to the little

2352
02:04:31,911 --> 02:04:35,460
fucking American flag shorts
decided my head and I was like, oh,

2353
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:37,980
why did I look at her?
I should just spend like be a little more

2354
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:40,710
considerate. I had the slam of
the door at everything you do.

2355
02:04:40,711 --> 02:04:44,170
You know the conspiracy on that fight is
that Hagler through it and then Hagler

2356
02:04:44,171 --> 02:04:47,160
a kudo knocked out Leonard, but he
was hitting him with pity pat punches,

2357
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:48,540
which if you watch it,

2358
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:51,450
it really doesn't look like the same
kind of punches he threw on with Gabi and

2359
02:04:51,451 --> 02:04:53,460
Hearns. It looks like
he was like, you know,

2360
02:04:53,461 --> 02:04:56,910
almost like three quarters speeding his
punches because I am genuinely looked

2361
02:04:56,911 --> 02:04:59,650
devastated when they lie,
when these problems is why I should,

2362
02:04:59,651 --> 02:05:02,660
should've never fought in Vegas.
Maybe. I mean, but he retired. Look,

2363
02:05:02,670 --> 02:05:05,550
it was close enough. I did. He could
have lost decision. He retired. I mean,

2364
02:05:05,551 --> 02:05:08,220
only if he doesn't see it that way it's
as ego because it was pretty close.

2365
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:10,440
You can see a decisions are squirrely.
Anything could happen.

2366
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:13,230
Judges don't have monitors. No, he didn't.
No one got knocked down that fight.

2367
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:15,630
I thought he'd knocked him down.
I believe so. I don't think so.

2368
02:05:15,631 --> 02:05:19,320
I don't think Hagler ever
knocked down. Leonard, hold on.

2369
02:05:19,321 --> 02:05:20,670
You didn't knock him down.
Maybe I'm thinking one of his,

2370
02:05:20,671 --> 02:05:23,820
all the fines that was the worst
watching liner down knock guys down.

2371
02:05:23,821 --> 02:05:28,440
They really usually didn't get up to how
great was the Middle Weight Division.

2372
02:05:28,530 --> 02:05:32,270
But what I was saying is amazing,
but what I was saying is that, um,

2373
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:36,960
he sent her, Nah, Nah, Nah, I don't
think he knocked him down. Um,

2374
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:40,980
when we're saying is though
that he retired and he
moved to Italy and it became

2375
02:05:40,981 --> 02:05:44,820
a fucking movie star. Yeah. And it's like,
look, if the mom really wanted a bet,

2376
02:05:44,821 --> 02:05:47,460
a shitload of money on the,
the underdog,

2377
02:05:47,490 --> 02:05:50,920
which is sugar ray Leonard fighting
this destroyer, who is Marvin Hagler,

2378
02:05:50,940 --> 02:05:51,840
just fucking crushed.

2379
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:55,050
Tommy Hearns was knocking everybody
senseless and sugar ray Leonard had fought

2380
02:05:55,051 --> 02:05:57,890
years and years, you know,
he's older. He would look like,

2381
02:05:57,900 --> 02:06:00,720
even when people didn't ever think
anybody ever came back and was successful

2382
02:06:00,721 --> 02:06:02,550
because most of the time they weren't.
I thought he did.

2383
02:06:02,551 --> 02:06:05,850
Is he looked like he did a
cycle before that, that fight.
He was, Leonard did. Yeah.

2384
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:08,160
He was huge.
Didn't Tommy Hearns accused him of that?

2385
02:06:08,370 --> 02:06:12,140
Tommy Hearns accused him of that before
their second fight. Oh, Atlantic. Yeah.

2386
02:06:12,220 --> 02:06:14,910
Yeah. I do know he, when he,
when he won that fight in any,

2387
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:18,160
he did the classic flex dude. He was
like, you know that guy, you know,

2388
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:22,290
I don't know. You know who they're
going after is Lance Armstrong? Ooh.

2389
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:26,580
They're going after him,
man Damn. And Barry bonds
forever. But they got a lot in.

2390
02:06:26,670 --> 02:06:29,760
They've got a lot of information then
there's, fuck no, no, they gotta stop.

2391
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:32,250
We gotta Stop Martha Stewart.
We've got to say that. Yeah,

2392
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:36,150
we got stop Rodger Clements. This is just,
it's just fodder. It's too, it's true.

2393
02:06:36,151 --> 02:06:38,610
You're totally right. It's a good
point. Yeah. It's kind of crazy.

2394
02:06:38,900 --> 02:06:42,420
It's not that it's, it's not that it's
baseball. It's what baseball represents.

2395
02:06:42,421 --> 02:06:45,850
While it's like what the fucking
bankers that's, does it represent it?

2396
02:06:45,851 --> 02:06:48,930
That is our of losing their houses a
lot worse than someone losing a fucking

2397
02:06:48,931 --> 02:06:52,320
baseball game. Let's just bothers me
every week that I work. And then I go,

2398
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:56,280
it's just everybody works. And you go
and you just give these cuts your money.

2399
02:06:56,610 --> 02:07:00,240
You hand it over like a fucking
child, like a child. Well, here,

2400
02:07:00,241 --> 02:07:02,640
here's the very worst. What the
fuck does money even mean anymore?

2401
02:07:02,670 --> 02:07:05,520
It's not even backed up by anything.
That's just based on your confidence.

2402
02:07:05,521 --> 02:07:08,060
A piece of paper that used to be,
uh,

2403
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:11,160
what you could claim gold that you
can now no longer claim that gold for.

2404
02:07:11,190 --> 02:07:15,420
The most maddening thing to me is these
people that used to work for the sec

2405
02:07:15,421 --> 02:07:19,170
used to be investigating
these big companies and then
when they retire they get

2406
02:07:19,171 --> 02:07:21,360
huge jobs inside these companies.

2407
02:07:21,540 --> 02:07:25,620
Like how the fuck is that legal?
How is that allowed?

2408
02:07:25,621 --> 02:07:30,480
How you let people profit off of the
fact that they build some sort of a

2409
02:07:30,481 --> 02:07:35,140
relationship with these big fucking
financial institutions that are raping the

2410
02:07:35,141 --> 02:07:36,040
public and taking

2411
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:40,570
all this buyout money and paying off
their fucking executives giant bonuses

2412
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:44,320
while they lost billions and they're
paying these guys 40 million,

2413
02:07:44,321 --> 02:07:47,680
30 million like what is going
on? How was this? It's like,

2414
02:07:47,710 --> 02:07:49,670
oh and robbery in front
of everyone's eyes.

2415
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:54,700
I feel like they're in tight, but it
isn't because nobody liked. They just Bam,

2416
02:07:54,710 --> 02:07:55,950
Brittany Spears shaved her head.

2417
02:07:56,030 --> 02:07:58,610
Yeah, we're bombing Libya.
Folks were bombing Libya.

2418
02:07:58,640 --> 02:08:02,840
Do not pay attention to the hundred mile
long streak of oil that we just knew.

2419
02:08:02,841 --> 02:08:04,070
We discovered in the Gulf.

2420
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:07,130
You hear that there's a new fucking
oil spill in the Gulf, a new one,

2421
02:08:07,131 --> 02:08:10,790
a giant 100 miles long. 20
miles from the other one. Yeah.

2422
02:08:10,940 --> 02:08:12,590
I was in like a second floor

2423
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:15,880
core into conspiracy theory in that type
of shift for about a year and a half.

2424
02:08:15,910 --> 02:08:18,430
And then I just said, fuck it. I
got a great girl and getting a dog.

2425
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:23,710
I don't got shit. I got, I got sick, I
got a dog for you. If you want a dog,

2426
02:08:23,990 --> 02:08:28,690
no dogs a whore or don't take his dog
in mind. Dogs are serious slut. My dog.

2427
02:08:28,691 --> 02:08:31,720
I actually, I finally, if we worked
with a trainer and we got it now,

2428
02:08:31,721 --> 02:08:33,970
it's all cool. And he came. How
long did, how long did it take for?

2429
02:08:33,971 --> 02:08:36,880
The check was wrong. Six months. Six
months. And did they train at your house?

2430
02:08:36,881 --> 02:08:40,900
When did you drop was I was a psycho
and like, no, seriously, like dogs,

2431
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:45,220
dogs, they feed off of your fucking
energy. So you know, I'd watch games,

2432
02:08:45,221 --> 02:08:47,100
I slammed the table, you know, and I just,

2433
02:08:47,101 --> 02:08:51,250
it just in general that fucking the same
energy that I had when I was a kid, man,

2434
02:08:51,251 --> 02:08:54,850
we had these little west
Highland terriers, like we
turned them into maniacs.

2435
02:08:54,851 --> 02:08:57,280
This one. You really didn't think bit
me in my face. I had to get fucking see,

2436
02:08:57,330 --> 02:09:01,480
chill. You beat the kids. What do
you do? A, we would fuck with it.

2437
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:04,420
We didn't know any better meet
the dogs. No, we didn't beat him.

2438
02:09:04,421 --> 02:09:08,370
We just thought piece of play the
glove game. The glove like a uh,

2439
02:09:08,410 --> 02:09:11,590
like a baseball glove. Fucking
wrestle with, I'll get to it. Yeah.

2440
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:16,320
See Price. It's like we're
on fucking $10,000 pyramid.

2441
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:22,370
Fucking Christ. Uh, a gardener's glove

2442
02:09:22,410 --> 02:09:25,980
and we were just fucking them in the
face and then he started biting too hard

2443
02:09:25,981 --> 02:09:27,360
and be like Fox,
then moved onto the boat.

2444
02:09:27,361 --> 02:09:30,390
We didn't realize we turned it into
a fucking maniac. We basically,

2445
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:33,360
any psychologists who wanted to
see how fucked up my family was,

2446
02:09:33,361 --> 02:09:37,590
all we would have to do is walk in,
look at the dog and be like, wow.

2447
02:09:37,710 --> 02:09:41,910
It's cause the trickle down effect. It's
like what was happening to us as kids.

2448
02:09:42,090 --> 02:09:45,000
We did to each other and then
everybody did it to the fucking dog.

2449
02:09:45,630 --> 02:09:47,360
This house,
this house was,

2450
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:50,240
I sh I gotta be careful how I say
this because they were nice people,

2451
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:55,480
but the woman was a very
hot and a little bit older,

2452
02:09:55,730 --> 02:09:59,300
but you know, still hot like in a
MILF way and but super controlling.

2453
02:09:59,301 --> 02:10:02,810
And the man was just like this sort of
a meek guy who happened to be rich and

2454
02:10:02,811 --> 02:10:07,190
the woman had these fucking dogs and
this woman was a mean lady. She was me.

2455
02:10:07,191 --> 02:10:09,710
She would yell at her husband in front
of us and she had these dogs that which

2456
02:10:09,711 --> 02:10:11,270
fucking snap at everybody.

2457
02:10:11,390 --> 02:10:14,030
They would bite people a bit like three
different people in the ground people.

2458
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:16,980
And I grew up with dogs. I grew
up in the pit bulls pit bulls. My,

2459
02:10:17,030 --> 02:10:19,010
my whole life I had crazy dogs.

2460
02:10:19,310 --> 02:10:22,010
So I saw these dogs and they came running
up to me like when I was in the house

2461
02:10:22,220 --> 02:10:24,530
and the dogs got right up to the mountain,
what's going on guys?

2462
02:10:24,710 --> 02:10:27,320
I'm gonna get my hand. And then
she goes, this is incredible.

2463
02:10:27,321 --> 02:10:31,220
They don't let anyone touch them. They
would pay your throat out by this time.

2464
02:10:31,250 --> 02:10:34,000
Okay, great. Owner and I'm like,
fuck is wrong with you. You've

2465
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,920
got these crazy animals live in you.
They want to tear people's throats out.

2466
02:10:36,921 --> 02:10:39,290
When you invite them in your
house and you come into my house,

2467
02:10:39,291 --> 02:10:41,480
let them come up to you. Yeah, you
come to my house and I go, hey,

2468
02:10:41,490 --> 02:10:44,570
there's just say hi Johnny. Johnny will
come over wagging his tail. You pet him,

2469
02:10:44,571 --> 02:10:47,810
he'll kiss your face this cause he
recognizes you as a friend. You're,

2470
02:10:47,811 --> 02:10:51,010
you're in this group of Nice people.
The fuck is really, that's a,

2471
02:10:51,011 --> 02:10:53,340
that's an indicative of a creepy person,
right.

2472
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:59,180
I was just fucking wound up. So the
dog, they feed off the fucking energy.

2473
02:10:59,181 --> 02:11:02,060
So the dog started getting wound up and
then it started growing and people on

2474
02:11:02,061 --> 02:11:04,160
the street and then I got nervous.

2475
02:11:04,250 --> 02:11:07,070
So then the dog would sense my nervous
system will growl a little bit,

2476
02:11:07,071 --> 02:11:09,440
fucking more. And it just, it just built.

2477
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:12,650
And then I would be terrified walking down
the street with the thing and the dog.

2478
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:16,070
And in the meanwhile is the dog would
come up on the couch whenever it wants.

2479
02:11:16,071 --> 02:11:18,620
It's just sort of running shit.
And I didn't know any of that shit.

2480
02:11:18,650 --> 02:11:22,610
But so we undid all of that.
Now the dog is totally fucking cool.

2481
02:11:22,611 --> 02:11:26,660
People come over, it's wagging its
tail and it all had to do with uh,

2482
02:11:26,690 --> 02:11:28,850
the way you were applying
with the energy that the,

2483
02:11:28,910 --> 02:11:31,640
I mean no I didn't do any of that,
that rough housing with the dog,

2484
02:11:32,030 --> 02:11:34,760
but the dog I've been doing in my act
is even if you rough house with a dog,

2485
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:37,250
you got to bring their energy
back down to being chill.

2486
02:11:37,370 --> 02:11:39,690
You can't have them if this
heightened fucking thing. Right.

2487
02:11:39,830 --> 02:11:43,860
And then walk outside cause they fucking,
especially like pit bulls, that thing,

2488
02:11:43,861 --> 02:11:44,694
if you own one,

2489
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:49,280
you have to address the fact that you
fucking own a dangerous breed because

2490
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:52,400
people just said, Nah, she's the most
lovable, blah blah blah blah blah blah.

2491
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:54,980
It's like yeah. And also has
ability to rip somebodies face off.

2492
02:11:54,981 --> 02:11:57,590
So I was having like panic attacks.
Like if this thing I've a bit,

2493
02:11:57,591 --> 02:11:59,960
somebody called like nerve
damage of fucked up their face.

2494
02:12:00,030 --> 02:12:04,160
Oh Deonte Deonte beyond getting sued.
It's the level of guilt I would have had.

2495
02:12:04,161 --> 02:12:07,670
So you know, uh, I knew, you know,

2496
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:10,070
a couple people who had pit bulls and
they took him to this guy and they just

2497
02:12:10,071 --> 02:12:13,600
did a great job. But it was literally,
it was six fucking months of uh,

2498
02:12:13,730 --> 02:12:16,280
in your house or did they not know
he took the dog, first of all,

2499
02:12:16,281 --> 02:12:19,130
I took the dog for six months and then
you get it back a half a year later.

2500
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:24,040
He's still so shocking. That dog,
he had him for like a month. No,

2501
02:12:24,050 --> 02:12:25,670
he had it for a month
and electrode the same,

2502
02:12:25,671 --> 02:12:29,750
should they did the data into your oma
putting neglect Trojans asshole? No, no.

2503
02:12:29,751 --> 02:12:33,160
He had it for a fucking month. The
whole month. It's great. Yeah as well.

2504
02:12:33,170 --> 02:12:37,190
Cause you got to chill the fuck out
because I've got this because uh, yeah,

2505
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:37,641
it wasn't,

2506
02:12:37,641 --> 02:12:41,960
it wasn't cheap but it was way cheaper
than getting the living shit out of me

2507
02:12:41,961 --> 02:12:43,640
and him being guilt and fill in the guilt.

2508
02:12:43,820 --> 02:12:47,860
So we went through all of that bullshit
and now the dog is just like, it's,

2509
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:52,280
it's cool as hell. He just trains it
all day every day. Now it's like, well,

2510
02:12:52,281 --> 02:12:53,810
the funny thing is it's like the dog.

2511
02:12:54,110 --> 02:12:58,040
The second he's around him and
we're removed from the equation,

2512
02:12:59,210 --> 02:13:01,130
it goes back and he's chilling.

2513
02:13:01,131 --> 02:13:04,370
He's in control and instantly was fine.

2514
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:09,020
The dog was instantly did, the
problem was was us. We didn't know.

2515
02:13:09,021 --> 02:13:11,980
And now we were all fucking scared.
Anytime you would come over, all right,

2516
02:13:11,981 --> 02:13:14,450
you just blah blah. And everything
I was doing was fucking wrong.

2517
02:13:14,451 --> 02:13:16,730
And it just kept,
it just kept building the experience,

2518
02:13:16,731 --> 02:13:20,120
which would add to my paranoia.
So it just became a really bad situation.

2519
02:13:20,121 --> 02:13:22,760
But the second he went over
with him, you know, he was fine.

2520
02:13:22,761 --> 02:13:26,510
He was walking in with dogs. Everything
was cool. He had to learn like a cause.

2521
02:13:26,511 --> 02:13:30,890
It's walking into a totally
new environment, new set
of rules. We were gone.

2522
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:32,310
It didn't feel like it had to protect

2523
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:36,150
anybody. So the dog was instantly
fine. What he had to do was undo us.

2524
02:13:36,180 --> 02:13:38,750
It had nothing to do with the dog.
It was us four a.

2525
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:40,950
And the reason why it took six months
was cause I'm on the road every other

2526
02:13:40,951 --> 02:13:45,150
fucking weak ones. Like would they, the
whole family grew from that experience?

2527
02:13:45,180 --> 02:13:50,160
I think so. I go from offering it.
It was awesome. It's very romantic.

2528
02:13:50,180 --> 02:13:52,170
It's good that there's someone
out there that can do that, man,

2529
02:13:52,171 --> 02:13:53,320
because there's a lot of
people that would say,

2530
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:56,070
I wish it was cheaper because there's
a lot of people with fucking dangerous

2531
02:13:56,071 --> 02:13:58,260
dogs. There's a guy who lives
down the street from me.

2532
02:13:58,261 --> 02:14:01,050
His pit bulls are always out and he's
like, oh, they're nice. They're friendly.

2533
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:04,560
Like get the fuck Outta here,
man. To, I've had pit bulls,
I've had a bunch of them.

2534
02:14:04,561 --> 02:14:07,110
They don't like other dogs.
If somebody else's dogs lose too,

2535
02:14:07,290 --> 02:14:09,660
like you didn't have a dead dog
in the street. It depends on,

2536
02:14:09,661 --> 02:14:13,140
it really depends on like if we wanted
to get another dog, we would have to,

2537
02:14:13,540 --> 02:14:14,131
as a female,

2538
02:14:14,131 --> 02:14:17,040
we'd have to get a male and you have to
get a pop in so they would have a mother.

2539
02:14:17,980 --> 02:14:21,420
So relationship. Absolutely right.
You do it that way. You don't,

2540
02:14:21,421 --> 02:14:25,260
you don't bring in another female. Yeah,
like my dog. Just it's personality.

2541
02:14:25,261 --> 02:14:28,110
It's not the kind of dog that you want
to walk with other dogs. Very possessive,

2542
02:14:28,111 --> 02:14:29,970
very jealous.
So it's something you have to keep in con,

2543
02:14:30,030 --> 02:14:31,050
but they're just like people,

2544
02:14:31,051 --> 02:14:34,740
they have different personalities
where I'm fucking a wound up psycho.

2545
02:14:34,741 --> 02:14:37,380
There's another guy who's just totally
fucking chill and wouldn't have had a

2546
02:14:37,381 --> 02:14:41,830
problem with the dog. The dog would
have become a chill dog. Yeah.

2547
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:45,150
Do they do that show you're
watching a game and some
band? What do, what the fuck?

2548
02:14:45,151 --> 02:14:47,600
And then like they come up like,
yeah dude, what the fuck? You know,

2549
02:14:47,610 --> 02:14:51,120
they start getting into that mode and
then if you have a dog that's, you know,

2550
02:14:51,121 --> 02:14:53,800
bred to fight in a pit,
it's red show.

2551
02:14:54,900 --> 02:14:56,760
It's amazing that you could just buy that.
And then people,

2552
02:14:56,761 --> 02:14:57,690
I mean they're great dogs,

2553
02:14:57,691 --> 02:15:01,170
they're super friendly and super sweet
that you can go down to a shelter and

2554
02:15:01,171 --> 02:15:02,780
they just,
it's like just giving somebody a gun.

2555
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:04,870
You don't even know what ended the
bullet comes in other than the guns,

2556
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:08,190
like given him a monster to giving them
a wild monster that's going to be your

2557
02:15:08,191 --> 02:15:11,880
buddy. You know, you didn't even speak
English. She didn't even tell him, listen,

2558
02:15:11,881 --> 02:15:15,600
you can't eat kids. He can't even
fucking tell him shit. Do you understand?

2559
02:15:16,410 --> 02:15:18,660
I have a bank account
and this is how your dog,

2560
02:15:18,910 --> 02:15:22,980
how about you shouldn't fucking kill
people. He'd be a nice doggy, you know,

2561
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:26,110
that's the end. See on the fucking
show, dude, I can't believe this.

2562
02:15:26,111 --> 02:15:28,380
He careful with pit bulls two hours,
two and a half hours.

2563
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:31,710
We went on for a long time. But
you know what, it's always, uh,

2564
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:34,170
it's always fun to have you on
Bro. You're, you're hilarious.

2565
02:15:34,171 --> 02:15:35,640
Your phone number stories I didn't even,

2566
02:15:35,641 --> 02:15:38,220
hype is a means of buddies of mine made a,

2567
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:41,650
a short film and we just got into
the Tribeca film festival. Really?

2568
02:15:41,680 --> 02:15:45,030
It was it called cheat? Cheat.
Yeah. What's it about me,

2569
02:15:45,031 --> 02:15:46,790
Joe de Rosa and Robert Kelly.
Joe,

2570
02:15:46,791 --> 02:15:51,330
Bobby Kelly asked me to write
an article or other, um, uh,

2571
02:15:51,400 --> 02:15:55,030
uh, a chapter because you got, I guess
you guys are going to do a book on it now.

2572
02:15:55,030 --> 02:15:59,490
That story, something to go along with.
That book came out of that. Uh, yeah,

2573
02:15:59,491 --> 02:16:01,260
it's been this, it's been this
great thing. So, you know,

2574
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:04,740
we wrote it and shot at ourselves
about a year ago and finally, you know,

2575
02:16:04,950 --> 02:16:06,930
started submitting it to festivals.
So we're in that thing.

2576
02:16:06,931 --> 02:16:10,620
So we're all really excited about.
Nice. So when can people see it? Uh,

2577
02:16:10,650 --> 02:16:13,870
while they can see it at the festival
if you live anywhere around there. Uh,

2578
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:18,120
but then afterwards that we're striking
back at film festival is in Tribeca,

2579
02:16:18,121 --> 02:16:20,180
New York and Manhattan
and a there'll be a,

2580
02:16:20,280 --> 02:16:25,280
I think it's April 20th through like
May 3rd and then afterwards it will be

2581
02:16:25,861 --> 02:16:28,360
available for DVD or what
you're going to try to get it?

2582
02:16:28,530 --> 02:16:30,130
We haven't got to that point

2583
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:33,550
yet. Yeah, I don't know how
that works. This is the first
thing we've ever done. So,

2584
02:16:33,551 --> 02:16:36,520
uh,
how many minutes is it like 1515 film.

2585
02:16:36,610 --> 02:16:39,820
So do you think you would put it online
and have it available online or how

2586
02:16:39,821 --> 02:16:43,680
would a, what would you do afterwards?
I have no idea. So it's cool. Would,

2587
02:16:43,681 --> 02:16:47,080
where would,
what started this just started talking and

2588
02:16:47,210 --> 02:16:49,790
yeah, I don't want to give away, like,
I don't want to give away the movie,

2589
02:16:49,791 --> 02:16:52,280
but basically it was one of those
deals where it was like three comedians

2590
02:16:52,281 --> 02:16:56,570
sitting around there was a fucking problem
and we just started brainstorming on

2591
02:16:56,571 --> 02:17:00,020
it and somebody was like, dude,
this is a movie. And then we,

2592
02:17:00,170 --> 02:17:04,670
I know we just fucking sat down and
wrote it and then, uh, awesome. Yeah,

2593
02:17:04,671 --> 02:17:05,504
it was really cool.

2594
02:17:05,630 --> 02:17:08,240
Now it's one of the best times I ever
had because we just put the money up

2595
02:17:08,241 --> 02:17:10,790
ourselves and shot at
ourselves and afterwards we
were trying to figure out why

2596
02:17:10,791 --> 02:17:13,160
we had such a great fucking
time and it's like, oh yeah,

2597
02:17:13,161 --> 02:17:14,330
there was no industry going.

2598
02:17:14,510 --> 02:17:18,350
Why doesn't he wear like a red
shirt and he can be like a plumber.

2599
02:17:18,540 --> 02:17:21,030
Well you that you were
there for the Chapelle show.

2600
02:17:21,270 --> 02:17:24,420
Did you get to experience any of them?
You are on a regular on that show, right?

2601
02:17:24,510 --> 02:17:28,650
I know I, I wasn't on the second
season, I was becoming a regular,

2602
02:17:28,651 --> 02:17:32,160
I only did five sketches, but I just
ended up being in five of the huge ones,

2603
02:17:32,400 --> 02:17:34,740
the racial draft,
the world series of dice.

2604
02:17:34,830 --> 02:17:37,050
Even like the Sam Jackson wanted
somebody that everybody loves.

2605
02:17:37,051 --> 02:17:40,130
And all I did was I just sat
there and got yelled at so easy.

2606
02:17:40,140 --> 02:17:43,050
I just took cotton and stuck it in my ear
and just let, let them yell. And he was,

2607
02:17:43,130 --> 02:17:44,400
and he was absolutely hilarious.

2608
02:17:44,550 --> 02:17:47,400
But as far as why the show
stopped and all that time, I mean,

2609
02:17:47,401 --> 02:17:50,530
I'm as much in the dark as a,
as you go.

2610
02:17:50,550 --> 02:17:55,170
I do know that he was going out and
trying to do with shows and everybody was,

2611
02:17:55,171 --> 02:17:59,940
you know, he couldn't get a word
out. Yeah, yeah. You know what,

2612
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:04,620
that's my couch, motherfucker. They
believe all of that shit. So he, you know,

2613
02:18:04,650 --> 02:18:05,790
I have no idea.

2614
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:09,210
But what I think is cool about it is
that you just have to killer fucking

2615
02:18:09,211 --> 02:18:13,830
seasons, you know, air tight to get back
to that expression rather than, you know,

2616
02:18:13,831 --> 02:18:14,041
there's,

2617
02:18:14,041 --> 02:18:19,020
there's certain shows that they probably
should acquit five seasons in and they

2618
02:18:19,021 --> 02:18:20,130
just kept making them.

2619
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:24,230
I think if you gave Dave a ton of weed
and let them do whatever the fuck he

2620
02:18:24,231 --> 02:18:27,140
wanted to do, he would keep
cranking them out our, oh yeah,

2621
02:18:27,290 --> 02:18:28,670
he's perfect for that shit.

2622
02:18:28,820 --> 02:18:33,110
That blind racist that was
accidentally blind Klu Klux Klan Guy.

2623
02:18:33,111 --> 02:18:36,250
That was accident blackout.
That was at first, what was it?

2624
02:18:36,290 --> 02:18:39,570
Which one was that called? What was the
name of this catch? Clayton Bigsby. Yeah.

2625
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:43,520
God Damn, that was brilliant.
Fucking brilliant. Yeah.

2626
02:18:43,550 --> 02:18:45,110
They just need to leave that guy alone.

2627
02:18:45,260 --> 02:18:48,440
When I did the fear factor sketch with
him, he was telling me that they were,

2628
02:18:48,441 --> 02:18:51,170
they were trying to tell him like how
many times he could say nigger and he

2629
02:18:51,171 --> 02:18:54,500
couldn't say nigger. And you got to
stop saying this to stop saying that.

2630
02:18:54,501 --> 02:18:55,130
And you know.

2631
02:18:55,130 --> 02:18:57,740
Well what happens is, is I think
when something becomes a success,

2632
02:18:57,741 --> 02:18:59,660
then everybody wants to try
and get that stink on it.

2633
02:18:59,661 --> 02:19:02,450
So that can be like I was the guy who
said to put the desk over there and blow.

2634
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:05,950
Rather than you just go on
like, hey, you're killing
it. Just keep whatever that,

2635
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:09,840
whatever the fuck you doing. Cause I know
like, like they, they thought that uh,

2636
02:19:10,940 --> 02:19:13,720
somebody on the show read me that
the industry notes for that, uh,

2637
02:19:13,721 --> 02:19:17,060
I'm Rick James Bitch sketch and they,

2638
02:19:17,750 --> 02:19:19,520
the overall thing was basically,

2639
02:19:19,521 --> 02:19:24,260
this is just a series of things
that aren't really funny.

2640
02:19:24,261 --> 02:19:27,670
Like they, they didn't get what was
going on. Like I remember when, uh,

2641
02:19:27,710 --> 02:19:28,070
when they were

2642
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:30,980
doing that, Neal, I lived
like a like, I dunno, like,

2643
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,980
like I could walk up to where
they were editing the thing.

2644
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:37,100
And when they did the Rick James thing,
like Neil called me up, he's like, dude,

2645
02:19:37,101 --> 02:19:38,360
you got to come up here
and check this thing out.

2646
02:19:38,361 --> 02:19:39,470
I don't think we can talk to shit.

2647
02:19:39,471 --> 02:19:42,590
And I remember walking in there dying
laughing for like the first four minutes.

2648
02:19:42,591 --> 02:19:45,050
And I was just in awe. I was
like, dude, this is the greatest,

2649
02:19:45,150 --> 02:19:47,630
that's the greatest fucking
sketch of all time ever.

2650
02:19:47,690 --> 02:19:50,840
That shows the greatest gift show of
all time. Nothing even comes close.

2651
02:19:50,930 --> 02:19:54,270
Nothing comes close. I'll send her and
love, can't fuck with that. No, no.

2652
02:19:54,300 --> 02:19:55,600
Shows can fuck with that.
Yeah.

2653
02:19:55,630 --> 02:19:59,540
If I ever had that laugh reading quality
as far as like social commentary and

2654
02:19:59,541 --> 02:20:00,740
then just like ridiculous,

2655
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:04,040
like silliness of the show when
fucking depressed because it kills me.

2656
02:20:04,050 --> 02:20:07,640
That fucking kills me too, is that he's
like, he's doing stand up and he like,

2657
02:20:07,650 --> 02:20:09,350
you know,
he'll announce on Thursday,

2658
02:20:09,351 --> 02:20:12,980
he's going to show at cobb's on Friday
and I'll do two shows and play bongos for

2659
02:20:12,981 --> 02:20:16,370
five hours. You know, it's like, I wish
that guy was like putting out specials,

2660
02:20:16,371 --> 02:20:18,980
you know, when she was putting
out DVDs and shit. You know,

2661
02:20:19,010 --> 02:20:20,510
I meet him twice in the last month.

2662
02:20:21,310 --> 02:20:23,380
What have you done would
you say on the comedy store,

2663
02:20:23,400 --> 02:20:26,300
which is on that the parlor.
And I saw him at the comedy store.

2664
02:20:26,740 --> 02:20:29,830
Uh, it's interesting the,
the direction he's going,

2665
02:20:29,831 --> 02:20:34,750
he's kind of going into more of a,
where it seems really organic, uh,

2666
02:20:34,780 --> 02:20:36,520
talking to the audience
and stuff like that.

2667
02:20:36,521 --> 02:20:41,150
But with bits kind of mixed in so you
don't even realize you're getting doing

2668
02:20:41,380 --> 02:20:44,290
like he's doing standup on you.
So it's weird. It's really weird.

2669
02:20:44,470 --> 02:20:47,350
And then he had some guys come up
and play music and he was like,

2670
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:51,520
I kind of doing like singing and
rapping at points and stuff like that.

2671
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:53,980
But again,
it felt like it wasn't planned.

2672
02:20:54,010 --> 02:20:57,310
It felt like you were getting a show
that no one else got to see. Right.

2673
02:20:57,520 --> 02:21:01,240
But then I talked to a couple of the other
mic, uh, comics and they're like, oh no,

2674
02:21:01,250 --> 02:21:03,700
no, this is, if you see a couple of these,

2675
02:21:03,701 --> 02:21:07,750
you'll see that this is exactly
what is act is now. Wow.

2676
02:21:07,870 --> 02:21:10,080
And it was kind of interesting. I
liked it. I thought it was cool.

2677
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:12,050
I was entertained.
He pissed off.

2678
02:21:12,051 --> 02:21:15,660
A lot of people have jobs because he's
doing like these five hour sets and wait,

2679
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:17,730
staff's going fucking nuts,
dude.

2680
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:20,630
That's like do two shows
and do like three hours,

2681
02:21:21,410 --> 02:21:25,220
three and a half hours in what Dan was
some lamps. I mean how many fucking,

2682
02:21:25,300 --> 02:21:26,690
I don't know.
It's him.

2683
02:21:26,691 --> 02:21:30,500
And I remember when Dan Cook tried to
top that and he like fucking stayed on

2684
02:21:30,501 --> 02:21:33,930
stage for like eight hours or something
crazy. Was it seven? So that what it is.

2685
02:21:33,931 --> 02:21:34,764
And by the way,

2686
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:37,700
the Guinness Book of World Records is
ridiculous because there's always some

2687
02:21:37,701 --> 02:21:39,110
retard out there with nothing to lose,

2688
02:21:39,260 --> 02:21:40,970
especially when it
comes to standup comedy.

2689
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:43,700
Who the fucking get define
what standup comedy.

2690
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:47,150
You can get some complete sociopath to
stand on stage for three days in a row

2691
02:21:47,151 --> 02:21:51,490
and just shit himself and, and piss all
over the fucking stage. And then he wins.

2692
02:21:51,860 --> 02:21:56,180
Flagpoles yeah, that's both. Stay up
there. They, you know what they should be,

2693
02:21:56,181 --> 02:22:00,170
there should be some like laugh meter
and once you just start running out of

2694
02:22:00,171 --> 02:22:03,740
jokes and just said [inaudible] the
lights go out of the house on a minutes

2695
02:22:03,741 --> 02:22:06,560
where you can play with the crowd. Yeah.
A certain amount of times you can say,

2696
02:22:06,561 --> 02:22:07,730
so what else is going on?

2697
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:10,900
I guess you just get like a red
flag and it's just like, dude,

2698
02:22:10,901 --> 02:22:13,700
this isn't stand up zero airplanes
through there. Yeah. It's like,

2699
02:22:13,701 --> 02:22:17,000
it would be funny if the less you laughed,
the last the audience laughed,

2700
02:22:17,001 --> 02:22:19,400
the brighter the lights in
the room got. Yeah. You know,

2701
02:22:19,401 --> 02:22:22,220
and to let you know when all the lights
are on and the show's not dark anymore.

2702
02:22:22,330 --> 02:22:24,970
It's like, it's like can get off
like a video game. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2703
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:26,060
Like that guitar hero

2704
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:27,030
starts going,
Huh,

2705
02:22:28,390 --> 02:22:33,150
your spotlight dims your spotlight
dems and the audience gets brighter.

2706
02:22:33,270 --> 02:22:35,520
Yeah.
So if people want to listen to a bill,

2707
02:22:35,521 --> 02:22:39,030
Bill also has a great podcast called the
Monday morning podcast that's available

2708
02:22:39,031 --> 02:22:42,190
on iTunes and it's not on
stitcher anymore. Right. You
pull it off stitcher. Yeah,

2709
02:22:42,210 --> 02:22:46,560
I took it off. Yeah. So it's not a lot of
controversy with the stitcher APP. Yeah.

2710
02:22:46,561 --> 02:22:50,970
They just saw that apparently people are
getting stitcher and I back it up 100%

2711
02:22:51,210 --> 02:22:55,140
I think it's fucking awesome.
Be able to go in your car and just have,

2712
02:22:55,170 --> 02:22:59,010
be able to choose podcasts and listen
to them automatically, you know,

2713
02:22:59,011 --> 02:23:03,240
streaming kind of problem I had,
they just took mine, never told me,

2714
02:23:03,450 --> 02:23:07,020
and then was selling advertising and
they will make and fucking money. Whoa.

2715
02:23:07,050 --> 02:23:09,150
Which is, yeah, that's not fucking cool.

2716
02:23:09,151 --> 02:23:12,120
So that's illegal to sue them to stop.

2717
02:23:12,660 --> 02:23:16,020
And then they sent me an offer, which is
hilarious. It's like someone stole your,

2718
02:23:16,021 --> 02:23:19,140
your fucking car and then you show up
guy and give him my car back. Like,

2719
02:23:19,170 --> 02:23:22,440
hey look, I put some rims on it. You know,
you want a piece of that. It's like, yeah,

2720
02:23:22,441 --> 02:23:24,720
well apparently there's a
big move to get off of it.

2721
02:23:24,721 --> 02:23:27,930
Marin was talking to me about it yesterday
and Greg Fitzsimmons called me about

2722
02:23:27,931 --> 02:23:30,600
it and Greg Fitzsimmons at
the same situation that you
had when they put it shut

2723
02:23:30,601 --> 02:23:31,380
off.

2724
02:23:31,380 --> 02:23:34,700
So he said it was a lot of people that
are going to cut me in on the average of

2725
02:23:34,701 --> 02:23:36,900
what about all the money you've
already made off for the fucking thing.

2726
02:23:36,901 --> 02:23:40,950
He didn't get you. Yeah, exactly. Like
that Internet thing. We're just like, hey,

2727
02:23:40,951 --> 02:23:43,020
you know everybody can
take everybody's shit.

2728
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:44,850
I don't think there's a problem with that.

2729
02:23:44,850 --> 02:23:47,740
Brian [inaudible] free content and
they're selling advertisement on it now.

2730
02:23:47,750 --> 02:23:48,990
I have no problem with it.
How come?

2731
02:23:49,020 --> 02:23:51,880
Because they're offering or the
service they're offering. Lift My,

2732
02:23:51,881 --> 02:23:56,370
if my listeners want to drive around
and be able to stream my show,

2733
02:23:56,610 --> 02:24:00,940
I'm not offering that on my website.
So let them do it and I offered online.

2734
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:03,980
How do you drive around? You have
to throw it on mine. On dream it.

2735
02:24:03,990 --> 02:24:05,520
You can stream it off of
your mobile phone. No,

2736
02:24:05,521 --> 02:24:07,640
you can go to iTunes and I like look at,
look it.

2737
02:24:07,830 --> 02:24:10,110
This is the thing about what I'm saying
though. You can't do that. You if you,

2738
02:24:10,111 --> 02:24:11,550
if you're driving in your car
right now and you were like,

2739
02:24:11,580 --> 02:24:14,640
I want to listen to Joe Rogan's
podcast from four weeks ago.

2740
02:24:14,670 --> 02:24:17,970
You're streaming something that I created,
you got to kick me money for that.

2741
02:24:17,980 --> 02:24:20,700
You just take not just streaming that.

2742
02:24:20,700 --> 02:24:23,880
That'd be like if I started a radio
station and I started playing it,

2743
02:24:23,890 --> 02:24:27,810
but let me finish and I
didn't pay anybody. I didn't
play any of the musicians,

2744
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:31,140
but they're not putting advertising
in the show. Yeah, they are. Nope.

2745
02:24:31,230 --> 02:24:33,640
I listened to stream of that.
I showed you miss,

2746
02:24:33,750 --> 02:24:35,940
why are they coming to the website?
They're not,

2747
02:24:36,090 --> 02:24:38,280
they're not putting advertising
in the show, not adding.

2748
02:24:38,290 --> 02:24:40,980
Know that they're not adding ads in
the shorter guy saying that they are.

2749
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:44,130
Because I think on stitchers
website where like on the Apps,

2750
02:24:44,131 --> 02:24:48,450
they have advertising and they're
getting all these hits cares about that

2751
02:24:48,451 --> 02:24:51,280
because, because they're
making money on my stuff. Do.

2752
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:55,170
People aren't going to the website
to just just sit there and listen to,

2753
02:24:55,171 --> 02:24:58,710
to streaming. They're going, they're
listening to content. It's like, dude,

2754
02:24:58,860 --> 02:25:01,410
it's like a fucking network.
Yeah. But if they let me finish,

2755
02:25:01,411 --> 02:25:05,610
you have a production house and they
make shows and to p, it's not like, oh,

2756
02:25:05,611 --> 02:25:07,560
I have a TV show,
so I'm just going to show you a TV show.

2757
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:09,900
I'm not gonna pay any of
the creators of the show.

2758
02:25:09,960 --> 02:25:13,110
I don't have a problem with
them or with what they're doing.

2759
02:25:13,111 --> 02:25:17,150
But you don't just take it and not pay
somebody. That's true. Yeah. You're gonna.

2760
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:19,650
If you're gonna make money off of it,
you have to kick somebody some money.

2761
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:23,980
And how even you use youtube, whenever
you have a, that gets a lot of hits,

2762
02:25:23,981 --> 02:25:25,780
they offer you, you know, you can, Hey,

2763
02:25:25,781 --> 02:25:28,000
you can sell ads on this and
we'll give you money. I mean,

2764
02:25:28,030 --> 02:25:29,890
I gotta offers on my videos all the time.

2765
02:25:30,130 --> 02:25:33,250
I'm not saying like what their
business model is not a bad thing.

2766
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:37,510
It's the way they went about it. It's like
if they said, hey listen, I want to put,

2767
02:25:37,540 --> 02:25:41,500
if they approached me first and said,
listen, we got this great model,

2768
02:25:41,590 --> 02:25:46,120
it's gonna allow people to listen to
streaming the thing or whatever and you

2769
02:25:46,121 --> 02:25:49,330
know, we're gonna, we're gonna advertise,
we're going to kick you some money. Fine,

2770
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:52,810
but don't just start doing it and
making money. Then out of nowhere,

2771
02:25:52,811 --> 02:25:54,940
I find out about it like six months later,

2772
02:25:54,941 --> 02:25:57,730
a year later after you've made all that
money and then I'm like, what the fuck?

2773
02:25:57,731 --> 02:25:59,530
And I go to take it off and
now that I'm taking it off,

2774
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:02,500
now you're going to offer me money.
That's fucked up.

2775
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:06,340
That's not how you do business. You
could also think of it this way though,

2776
02:26:06,341 --> 02:26:09,970
to stream stitcher has their
own community as strip stickers,

2777
02:26:09,971 --> 02:26:13,180
like a Facebook or a Twitter, and so
when they, when you have a show on there,

2778
02:26:13,181 --> 02:26:17,940
they're also introducing you to their
whole community. You have to ask.

2779
02:26:17,950 --> 02:26:18,221
I know,

2780
02:26:18,221 --> 02:26:22,150
but what if I'm signed on for is you're
making it seem like stitcher is this

2781
02:26:22,151 --> 02:26:25,690
entity that is amazing that people are
just going to sit there and stare at

2782
02:26:25,691 --> 02:26:28,480
stitcher. Well, it's, they're going
there for the content. I know.

2783
02:26:28,481 --> 02:26:32,200
I'm not saying that they don't provide a
service and I'm not saying any of that,

2784
02:26:32,230 --> 02:26:36,070
but for them to take my shit and just
put it up there and make money off of it,

2785
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:38,260
I'm not saying that they have
to give me 100% of the money.

2786
02:26:38,380 --> 02:26:40,930
I'm saying you just can't just,
you can't just,

2787
02:26:40,940 --> 02:26:44,530
you can't just take his stuff and copy
it and then start selling ads on it on

2788
02:26:44,531 --> 02:26:48,600
your thing. You can't do that. Well,
I agree. But you have thought sue.

2789
02:26:48,630 --> 02:26:52,420
He can say no, I know, but listen, I
listened. They also like as an example,

2790
02:26:52,421 --> 02:26:55,840
stitcher is now putting in all the brand
new Fords and also with a couple of

2791
02:26:55,841 --> 02:27:00,480
other car dealer or companies have now
added Stitcher as inside there, uh,

2792
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:02,110
cars now.
Why?

2793
02:27:02,260 --> 02:27:06,640
Because now it's where they're moving
away from Sirius radio and Xm radio until

2794
02:27:06,660 --> 02:27:09,730
Internet connected because of the content
and the amount of hits that they're

2795
02:27:09,731 --> 02:27:11,400
getting.
And that has nothing to do with stitcher.

2796
02:27:11,410 --> 02:27:14,050
That has to do with Joe
Rogan's fucking hilarious.

2797
02:27:14,350 --> 02:27:17,560
Greg Fitzsimmons fucking hilarious.
Mark Marin is doing these great pot.

2798
02:27:17,590 --> 02:27:20,640
That's why people are going
there. I guess to me, um, if I,

2799
02:27:20,641 --> 02:27:24,190
if I could have my shit fucking in every
single Ford car that people can listen

2800
02:27:24,191 --> 02:27:27,510
to and it's a, it's a part of the
car now. She was like, you know,

2801
02:27:27,560 --> 02:27:31,840
what's your choice? You're
pitching, you're pitching
what people on that side too,

2802
02:27:31,850 --> 02:27:35,590
which is the pimp game where they talk
about the exposure and all this great

2803
02:27:35,591 --> 02:27:38,910
exposure and then the only way for us
to make money off of the exposures are

2804
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:42,640
people going to your shows and people
buy your cds. Yeah. Let me finish.

2805
02:27:42,670 --> 02:27:45,730
I still have to get on a fucking
plane and fly to Kansas City.

2806
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:48,250
While that was motherfuckers
get to sleep in their own bed,

2807
02:27:48,310 --> 02:27:51,940
they don't have to leave. You
know what I mean? No, Huh?

2808
02:27:54,430 --> 02:27:55,620
What I'm saying?

2809
02:27:57,020 --> 02:28:00,610
That's what's you're acting like
you're acting eats toast. No, wait.

2810
02:28:00,611 --> 02:28:04,150
What you're saying is, is your,
your, your, your, your debt.

2811
02:28:04,151 --> 02:28:09,151
That bullshit where artists get paid in
exposure is the big pimp game in fucking

2812
02:28:11,051 --> 02:28:13,320
Hollywood. It's this character.
They have you changed.

2813
02:28:13,450 --> 02:28:16,450
We're going to stick you on this. We're
not going to give you any fucking money,

2814
02:28:16,660 --> 02:28:19,840
but everybody's going to hear this and
then you're going to go to Kansas City

2815
02:28:19,841 --> 02:28:22,850
and Jesus Christ, the whole, you're
going to play with a fucking royals play.

2816
02:28:23,540 --> 02:28:26,950
Meanwhile, they're making all this fucking
money. Well that's the kind of you,

2817
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:31,060
and you got to be like
fucking what it would dif.

2818
02:28:31,230 --> 02:28:34,430
You got to fucking pack up and
go fly out to go get your money.

2819
02:28:34,580 --> 02:28:37,610
They're sitting at home raking in
all this shit and this is the thing.

2820
02:28:37,690 --> 02:28:39,770
You are providing the fucking content.

2821
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:42,980
They're providing the service so
they should get paid for the service.

2822
02:28:43,100 --> 02:28:45,200
You should get paid for your content.
That's all I'm saying.

2823
02:28:45,320 --> 02:28:48,980
This should be a business, Mary. If you
just don't take the fucking content.

2824
02:28:49,130 --> 02:28:51,590
If your content with some
money free already though,

2825
02:28:52,190 --> 02:28:54,050
your content for free on iTunes.
Yeah,

2826
02:28:54,051 --> 02:28:57,590
but you can't put it on your own
application. That's, which is my choice.

2827
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:02,150
It on iTunes and I have, and I have the
choice. I have the choice to decide.

2828
02:29:02,151 --> 02:29:04,160
My podcast is fucking free.

2829
02:29:04,250 --> 02:29:08,300
I could sit there and I could decide if
I want to charge money for it, but dude,

2830
02:29:08,301 --> 02:29:12,890
it's mine. It's mine and it's my decision.
It's not yours to just fucking take.

2831
02:29:13,100 --> 02:29:14,600
And then because you know,

2832
02:29:14,630 --> 02:29:17,780
I've been busting my ass and work on
this thing for fucking three years and

2833
02:29:17,781 --> 02:29:21,020
everybody wants to go see it and now you
just take it and make a ton of fucking

2834
02:29:21,021 --> 02:29:23,210
money off him and you don't even tell me.
Didn't call me on.

2835
02:29:23,211 --> 02:29:25,280
I don't think that they're making
a shitload of money at all.

2836
02:29:25,310 --> 02:29:27,490
I don't have stitchers.
It's not really making a shit.

2837
02:29:27,491 --> 02:29:29,930
It doesn't matter if they're
making $2 you have to give me one,

2838
02:29:29,990 --> 02:29:33,750
but you can't just do so I just make
money off people's stuff. You're,

2839
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:36,300
you're pretending that they're not
selling content. They have a dream.

2840
02:29:36,470 --> 02:29:40,520
I listened to my shit on
stitcher everyday. I've
never heard of ad once. Okay,

2841
02:29:40,521 --> 02:29:44,450
so it's not seeing the ads. The ads are
on the, there's no ads playing during my,

2842
02:29:44,510 --> 02:29:47,660
on my podcast.
There's No ads before or after my podcast.

2843
02:29:47,690 --> 02:29:51,380
So to me saying no problem with stitcher
and they're not making any money off me

2844
02:29:51,381 --> 02:29:55,630
directly. Okay. That's you. But I
see, I don't know how we're buying it.

2845
02:29:55,631 --> 02:29:57,680
How you're saying that they're
making money or anything.

2846
02:29:57,770 --> 02:30:00,360
I opened the stitch up right
house, open up, stitch it.

2847
02:30:00,360 --> 02:30:04,670
Right now I find my pint that
they do those people ads for free.

2848
02:30:05,080 --> 02:30:08,970
You're confused. Like you listen to
a radio station. Let Brian Finish.

2849
02:30:08,990 --> 02:30:11,200
Let me do they have listened to a radio.

2850
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:15,200
I don't remember every hearing or seeing
one SME. Listen to me. All right. Okay.

2851
02:30:15,230 --> 02:30:18,740
When you listen to a radio station,
they don't play an ad during a song,

2852
02:30:19,130 --> 02:30:22,010
but you listened to the radio station
because the play in the kind of music you

2853
02:30:22,011 --> 02:30:25,310
want to listen to. That's why. Are you
listening to duty? Yeah, I'm listening.

2854
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:30,020
So that's why if you play a
band song on the fucking radio,

2855
02:30:30,410 --> 02:30:33,110
the band gets paid. Okay? You get paid.

2856
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:38,570
Do you want to stay in that are saying
that there's no ads on this? So,

2857
02:30:38,760 --> 02:30:41,300
so I'm going to comedy right now.
I'm typing in comedy.

2858
02:30:41,450 --> 02:30:44,240
Now I'm going to comedians.
Here's comedians right up here.

2859
02:30:44,360 --> 02:30:48,560
Now there's a a little banner
that pops up the very bottom,

2860
02:30:48,890 --> 02:30:53,370
but best make some money. Does squad
him at the very top little banner,

2861
02:30:53,390 --> 02:30:56,270
various money. I know, but Facebook makes
money off of you, but you're on Facebook.

2862
02:30:56,271 --> 02:30:58,970
Are you going to sue Facebook and pull
off your stuff on Facebook that makes

2863
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:00,930
shitloads wait a hold up.

2864
02:31:00,940 --> 02:31:04,910
And he had a blog and they copied his
blog entries and put it on Facebook.

2865
02:31:05,130 --> 02:31:09,560
Then started selling advertising show.
You chose to be on Stitcher, right? No,

2866
02:31:09,561 --> 02:31:13,760
I didn't ask. You know, didn't I? That's
the whole point of what he's saying.

2867
02:31:13,761 --> 02:31:14,660
Brian is that high.

2868
02:31:14,740 --> 02:31:18,740
I chose to be on Facebook and I
choose what I put to go to put up.

2869
02:31:18,920 --> 02:31:23,100
I did not choose to be on Stitcher,
stitcher took my shit and put it.

2870
02:31:23,440 --> 02:31:27,680
See No advertisement before
this is me talking. Okay.
Brian, he's targeting. Yeah,

2871
02:31:27,700 --> 02:31:30,030
Dude. It's like I'm trying to
make, I'm trying to explain it.

2872
02:31:30,031 --> 02:31:33,870
We had it right there and you're so
convinced of your argument. I mean,

2873
02:31:33,871 --> 02:31:36,210
if you're totally conviction of
argument, I'll just stop right now. No,

2874
02:31:36,300 --> 02:31:38,340
I don't think you understand
a lot of like the Internet,

2875
02:31:38,370 --> 02:31:42,180
like I understand that you don't want your
MP three on here so you can tell them,

2876
02:31:42,181 --> 02:31:43,440
yes,
I don't want you on here,

2877
02:31:43,590 --> 02:31:47,640
but stitcher is not like
selling advertisements during
your show. They're doing,

2878
02:31:47,670 --> 02:31:49,290
they're pretty much doing
what it's available.

2879
02:31:49,291 --> 02:31:51,510
You want them to give you this free.
I already read on the Internet.

2880
02:31:51,511 --> 02:31:54,090
I answered this like three minutes ago.
You're just not listening to me.

2881
02:31:54,570 --> 02:31:57,600
You're not listening to me. I realize
that they're not playing it during it.

2882
02:31:57,630 --> 02:32:02,040
I said, when you listen to a radio
station, they play ACDC back in black.

2883
02:32:02,250 --> 02:32:04,830
They don't play a wool light
commercial in the middle of it,

2884
02:32:04,980 --> 02:32:09,240
but in between the songs they advertise
and the amount of listeners that are

2885
02:32:09,241 --> 02:32:11,940
radio station gets is not
because of the commercials.

2886
02:32:12,030 --> 02:32:14,220
It's because of the music that is there.

2887
02:32:14,221 --> 02:32:18,150
The artists that put that out there that
that's why that the bands get played.

2888
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:21,420
They get a portion of the advertising.
That's how business is done.

2889
02:32:21,630 --> 02:32:22,590
I don't have a problem with that.

2890
02:32:22,770 --> 02:32:25,290
I would love to be on stitcher
if they did it the right way.

2891
02:32:25,350 --> 02:32:28,170
If they approached me and said,
listen, this is what we're doing.

2892
02:32:28,290 --> 02:32:30,960
We're going to sell advertising.
We're making this amount of money,

2893
02:32:31,050 --> 02:32:33,120
we're going to kick you that.
I would've done it in a second,

2894
02:32:33,210 --> 02:32:37,890
but the thing is they just
took my podcasts and all my
listeners who go on there

2895
02:32:37,891 --> 02:32:41,310
because they like what I do and then
they made money off of that because

2896
02:32:41,360 --> 02:32:44,970
inbetween on the side of their website
and that shit that you saw at the bottom,

2897
02:32:45,090 --> 02:32:49,650
they're making money off of that and they
didn't kick me any money until you got,

2898
02:32:49,651 --> 02:32:52,830
you got caught. And I said, does keep
people from getting it off of iTunes.

2899
02:32:52,831 --> 02:32:55,680
It's definitely the only negative
part about it in my opinion,

2900
02:32:55,681 --> 02:32:57,630
is that it takes a hurts your iTunes,
the numbers,

2901
02:32:57,750 --> 02:33:01,050
but like as any single
website that you used people,

2902
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:03,690
if you give something out
for free on the Internet,

2903
02:33:03,930 --> 02:33:08,470
you can consider stitcher to be just
an MP, three player. Right. And, and,

2904
02:33:08,490 --> 02:33:11,550
and any application on here. And
I was like, at different numbers,

2905
02:33:11,551 --> 02:33:13,050
they're making money off of it.
Look,

2906
02:33:13,051 --> 02:33:16,380
I put it out there and everybody
downloads it and it's for free. Right.

2907
02:33:16,381 --> 02:33:19,890
But the second you take it and
you start making money off of it,

2908
02:33:19,980 --> 02:33:24,120
it's the same way.
Like if you see both of your points,

2909
02:33:24,121 --> 02:33:25,140
I see both of your points.

2910
02:33:25,141 --> 02:33:29,310
I do see Brian's point that he did pull
up the application and the only ad was

2911
02:33:29,311 --> 02:33:33,230
this little tiny ass banner that
I'm making money off of that. Yeah,

2912
02:33:33,240 --> 02:33:36,570
you could say that. That might be just
enough to keep your sites growing.

2913
02:33:37,350 --> 02:33:39,720
How much money you think that little
banner, how much, how much does the APP,

2914
02:33:39,721 --> 02:33:43,190
let me ask you this dude. How do you,
how do you run a business? The Free App,

2915
02:33:43,590 --> 02:33:45,960
how do you run a business
that makes no money?

2916
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:50,130
Because they are selling their
programs at to put companies like Ford.

2917
02:33:50,190 --> 02:33:52,440
So now you buy a Ford and they
have a stitch you up in there.

2918
02:33:52,441 --> 02:33:56,820
So it's like a serious rate. No. And why
is for getting in business with them?

2919
02:33:56,850 --> 02:34:00,960
Because the s the future of radio is
podcasting. It's not satellite radio.

2920
02:34:00,961 --> 02:34:04,590
It's not [inaudible] is the thing.
Yeah but I'm doing a podcast.

2921
02:34:04,591 --> 02:34:05,910
How come for doesn't come to me?

2922
02:34:06,030 --> 02:34:09,510
He came to these guys cause they stuck
them all together and it's because of all

2923
02:34:09,511 --> 02:34:12,330
the hits that Joe gets. All the
fans that I have, all the fans at,

2924
02:34:12,331 --> 02:34:15,240
all these people have these
guys stuck it all into one,

2925
02:34:15,241 --> 02:34:18,370
but they should have come to us and
said this is we want to do and get in

2926
02:34:18,371 --> 02:34:19,031
business with us.

2927
02:34:19,031 --> 02:34:22,240
You just don't hijack everybody
shit and then stick it on there.

2928
02:34:22,241 --> 02:34:26,290
Start selling advertising banners on the
bottom and then getting contracts with

2929
02:34:26,291 --> 02:34:28,210
Ford because they're
looking at their website,

2930
02:34:28,211 --> 02:34:30,940
they're seeing all the hits
that they won't get an RSS feed.

2931
02:34:30,970 --> 02:34:33,640
What you have when you have a podcast,
so you have an RSS feed.

2932
02:34:33,730 --> 02:34:38,730
What that RSS feed means is that every
single thing you're letting everyone you

2933
02:34:38,771 --> 02:34:40,600
want to play your MP three players.

2934
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:44,410
So there's websites that will grab your
RSS feed and just and put it on their

2935
02:34:44,411 --> 02:34:49,120
website. That's what ours says. You're
sharing it. You're giving me for free.

2936
02:34:49,180 --> 02:34:53,800
Right. But this is the thing is still
count one a load from an RSS feed counts.

2937
02:34:53,980 --> 02:34:56,080
The big argument is a Twitter,
you know,

2938
02:34:56,090 --> 02:34:59,800
or rather then then take the free thing
and then start making money off it.

2939
02:34:59,801 --> 02:35:02,440
You have to pee. It's common as
business. There's business one on one.

2940
02:35:02,680 --> 02:35:06,160
You have to pay the person. If I'm giving
away for free, you can just take it.

2941
02:35:06,161 --> 02:35:07,900
You can't just go out.
Well,

2942
02:35:07,901 --> 02:35:12,820
maybe they tried to do it this way and
just stitcher also has a way to to pay

2943
02:35:12,821 --> 02:35:16,300
their artists now. They had a pay
thing. Now they've started a couple of,

2944
02:35:16,301 --> 02:35:17,100
a couple of months ago.

2945
02:35:17,100 --> 02:35:20,950
Bill was right when I was saying they
should have come to me and say, listen,

2946
02:35:20,951 --> 02:35:23,560
we'd like your podcast. We've seen
you're getting this amount of hits.

2947
02:35:23,920 --> 02:35:24,970
We want to put it on here.

2948
02:35:24,971 --> 02:35:27,460
We have some advertising and
we'll kick you some of it. Dude,

2949
02:35:27,461 --> 02:35:31,330
I would be on stitcher. I haven't done
that to you. Never. You sure? Oh yeah,

2950
02:35:31,331 --> 02:35:34,690
he's positive, bro. You can. They'd
come to me. They've come to me to do it.

2951
02:35:34,691 --> 02:35:37,120
Two months ago they came to me too.
I allowed them to think.

2952
02:35:37,190 --> 02:35:40,240
[inaudible] never came to me. They never
came to him. They never put it into me.

2953
02:35:40,241 --> 02:35:43,670
They just took my shit. See, that's the
thing. If they came to me, I would've,

2954
02:35:43,690 --> 02:35:47,410
I would've, I wouldn't have had a
problem. Our pocket, our podcast is fake,

2955
02:35:47,411 --> 02:35:50,920
came to me when my lawyer sent him a
cease and desist and then they go, oh,

2956
02:35:50,990 --> 02:35:53,620
you want, what if we gave your percentage
of this money that we've been making?

2957
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:56,860
Hmm. Now if it had nothing
to do with my podcast,

2958
02:35:56,861 --> 02:35:59,950
they wouldn't have offered me
that. The, I think a precedent has

2959
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:03,710
established once and it becomes really
profitable. And right now it's not.

2960
02:36:03,711 --> 02:36:07,490
And I totally agree with you that you
can't take your stuff and just put it up

2961
02:36:07,491 --> 02:36:11,060
there without asking and then put
advertisement on the application.

2962
02:36:11,240 --> 02:36:13,310
Even if it's indirectly,
you know,

2963
02:36:13,311 --> 02:36:15,700
if there's a certain amount
of ads that you know, you,

2964
02:36:15,701 --> 02:36:19,580
you just get every time
you go to stitcher, but one
podcast gets a, you know,

2965
02:36:19,581 --> 02:36:22,400
a really high number of downloads,
like your Monday morning podcast does.

2966
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:24,080
Well that's, you're, you're selling that,

2967
02:36:24,081 --> 02:36:25,850
you're selling the Monday morning podcast.

2968
02:36:25,970 --> 02:36:28,340
That's what you're selling when
you're advertising. You know, I,

2969
02:36:28,341 --> 02:36:30,320
I totally get that.
But the way,

2970
02:36:30,350 --> 02:36:35,030
the way I look at podcasting in
the first place is, um, I want,

2971
02:36:35,180 --> 02:36:37,580
I agree that it's good to have,
you know,

2972
02:36:37,670 --> 02:36:41,720
sponsors that pay for things and you
can, you know, you could, you know,

2973
02:36:41,830 --> 02:36:43,940
make money off the show and it's good.

2974
02:36:43,941 --> 02:36:47,330
It's good to get paid for someone
downloading it and listening to it.

2975
02:36:47,331 --> 02:36:49,610
But for me what's important
is that people get it.

2976
02:36:49,820 --> 02:36:50,840
That's what's important for me.

2977
02:36:50,841 --> 02:36:55,280
It's important that it is the reason why
it's free on my website as well as free

2978
02:36:55,281 --> 02:36:58,570
unused stream as well as free on
iTunes as well as on stickers.

2979
02:36:58,760 --> 02:37:00,920
Yeah. USTREAM is making
shit off of it right now.

2980
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:03,560
I don't have a problem with that.
I mean they have to pay for bandwidth.

2981
02:37:04,190 --> 02:37:05,620
They take care of us and I

2982
02:37:05,670 --> 02:37:08,410
don't, to be honest with you,
I don't know. I like Youtube.

2983
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:10,800
I found out that [inaudible] no,
you streaming the video. It's,

2984
02:37:10,860 --> 02:37:13,720
we're doing this right now. This is not
right. No, I don't, I don't do video.

2985
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:16,370
I don't do video a youtube account,
but this is the most, I'm actually

2986
02:37:16,370 --> 02:37:21,020
trying to get advertising on,
on a,

2987
02:37:21,021 --> 02:37:24,590
on my website. I mean, I
mean all my podcasts, I don't
have a problem with that,

2988
02:37:24,591 --> 02:37:26,990
but this is like, this is, this is,

2989
02:37:27,020 --> 02:37:31,550
this is the game of this business where
it's like the artist's does the work and

2990
02:37:31,551 --> 02:37:35,400
then the, the business guys come in and
they give you the fucking Heisman. Right?

2991
02:37:35,401 --> 02:37:37,580
I mean, I mean it's right through
the whole business with those guys.

2992
02:37:37,581 --> 02:37:40,700
Those guys who made fucking Lord
of the rings never got paid.

2993
02:37:40,730 --> 02:37:43,730
They made $6 billion. They had to
sue to get their fucking money.

2994
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:47,420
What do you mean go look it up?
They got the whole fucking thing though.

2995
02:37:47,480 --> 02:37:49,460
That was always the lawsuit.

2996
02:37:49,490 --> 02:37:52,220
Is that one of those things where they
have Hollywood type of counting where

2997
02:37:52,221 --> 02:37:54,170
they show losses, man? Yeah, we have,

2998
02:37:54,171 --> 02:37:58,940
we had $4 billion in whiteout
in 9 billion in, in paper clips.

2999
02:37:58,940 --> 02:38:01,430
So we're still not in profit and fucking,
you know,

3000
02:38:01,431 --> 02:38:02,990
the director doesn't get paid and yeah,

3001
02:38:02,991 --> 02:38:05,520
it was a huge fucking
lawsuit and they just, they,

3002
02:38:05,540 --> 02:38:07,340
and then whatever the conglomerate was,

3003
02:38:07,880 --> 02:38:11,390
they decided that it was cheaper to
just get sued. They paid themselves out,

3004
02:38:11,391 --> 02:38:14,300
then they imploded the
thing and just left.

3005
02:38:14,750 --> 02:38:19,040
And these guys and it was total
is totally fucking legal. Wow.

3006
02:38:19,070 --> 02:38:22,820
It's an interesting thing. The, this
whole podcast thing though, isn't it? How,

3007
02:38:22,821 --> 02:38:25,150
you know, I mean, basically what
we're doing right now, as you know,

3008
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:28,850
at any moment when we put one of
these things out during the week,

3009
02:38:28,851 --> 02:38:31,910
a quarter million people download
this fucking thing. And that's a,

3010
02:38:31,911 --> 02:38:34,820
that's a big number of human beings
that you could just reach on your own.

3011
02:38:34,970 --> 02:38:39,970
Don't you find that like shows or more
packed with like your real fans now than

3012
02:38:40,281 --> 02:38:43,760
ever before? Do you find that? I find it,
it's a combination of doing an opening.

3013
02:38:43,761 --> 02:38:45,890
Anthony doing morning radio,

3014
02:38:45,891 --> 02:38:49,280
my specials and my podcast
people definitely listened
to the podcast and that.

3015
02:38:49,340 --> 02:38:50,700
And, uh, yeah, no,

3016
02:38:50,740 --> 02:38:54,900
it's a great way to get
out and have people, uh,

3017
02:38:55,790 --> 02:38:58,790
come out to your shows. But it's,
it's one of those things where like,

3018
02:38:58,970 --> 02:39:02,990
I don't do that shit where I'm getting
paid in exposure and you're taking all

3019
02:39:02,991 --> 02:39:05,930
the fucking money.
And then so for the rest of my life,

3020
02:39:05,960 --> 02:39:08,570
in order for me to get
the fruits of my labor,

3021
02:39:08,571 --> 02:39:12,090
I got to go fly to fucking
Tennessee when it's like I'm,

3022
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:14,720
I'm doing a fun doing a
fucking radio show here.

3023
02:39:15,500 --> 02:39:18,200
Radio guys don't go on the
fucking road for some reason.

3024
02:39:18,201 --> 02:39:21,170
It just all goes back to,
but then when you do your monkey dance,

3025
02:39:21,470 --> 02:39:22,580
you get paid and it's like,

3026
02:39:22,581 --> 02:39:26,300
so no value is being put on the fact
when you go and don't get money.

3027
02:39:26,300 --> 02:39:27,890
I see their error in judgment.

3028
02:39:28,010 --> 02:39:31,700
I see their error in judgment and I see
the wooded truant doing is they take

3029
02:39:31,701 --> 02:39:36,380
something that's already free and they
make a device that allows you to get it

3030
02:39:36,381 --> 02:39:39,890
to people that wouldn't ordinarily get it.
But it does when I didn't want it.

3031
02:39:40,520 --> 02:39:44,270
His point that when I do radio, I'm
flying, I'm in there, I fly in there,

3032
02:39:44,271 --> 02:39:46,850
I do radio and I'm hyping my shows.
That's the point of it.

3033
02:39:47,030 --> 02:39:51,890
My podcast is not hyping my shipping you,
my podcast is my radio show.

3034
02:39:52,460 --> 02:39:56,360
It's my radio show. That's what
this is a fucking radio show dude.

3035
02:39:56,680 --> 02:39:59,570
Right as they call it a pocket.
It's my radio show you.

3036
02:39:59,571 --> 02:40:04,280
I can't just hijack the stern show and
the and put it on my site and just start

3037
02:40:04,281 --> 02:40:08,420
selling advertising and then when he
tells me to cease and desist, go, hey,

3038
02:40:08,421 --> 02:40:11,600
can I let you in on some of this
money? And then I go, well Howard,

3039
02:40:11,601 --> 02:40:14,280
you're fucking huge man.
Why don't you go fly and stand on a stage

3040
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:16,920
and tell jokes and Kansas
City you'll get paid that way.

3041
02:40:17,370 --> 02:40:20,840
I see what you're saying. Yeah, I see.
Like I understand like it's, it's,

3042
02:40:20,841 --> 02:40:23,520
it becomes an issue. If it takes a
while. I would love to be in business,

3043
02:40:23,521 --> 02:40:26,460
those guys with their exposure, but you
just have to do it the right way, dude.

3044
02:40:26,461 --> 02:40:30,240
You don't just take it and make money and
wait till I find out about it and then

3045
02:40:30,241 --> 02:40:31,830
offer me a cut.
I think when you,

3046
02:40:32,070 --> 02:40:34,860
when it comes to podcast and
certain things on the Internet,

3047
02:40:34,861 --> 02:40:38,100
especially when it comes
to RSS feeds, uh, that,

3048
02:40:38,430 --> 02:40:42,690
that that's just common for the Internet.
Like there's companies,

3049
02:40:42,750 --> 02:40:47,750
there's Zoe now that you're saying
though is because this not RSS feeds or

3050
02:40:48,001 --> 02:40:48,571
you're dealing with,

3051
02:40:48,571 --> 02:40:52,920
you're dealing with someone copying a
thing and then sending it out through an

3052
02:40:52,921 --> 02:40:55,740
application, which is completely
different is RSS feeds.

3053
02:40:55,860 --> 02:40:57,600
You're going to get an
account of every doubt.

3054
02:40:57,700 --> 02:41:01,410
He is presented the two classic arguments
that they do when they fuck artists,

3055
02:41:01,411 --> 02:41:03,030
they stay talk about exposure,

3056
02:41:03,180 --> 02:41:06,870
what great exposure this is Nevins
and then suddenly let me finish.

3057
02:41:06,871 --> 02:41:11,370
And then secondly, he did,
he did the whole, this is
just the way it's done. Like,

3058
02:41:11,371 --> 02:41:12,091
you know, like when, when a,

3059
02:41:12,091 --> 02:41:15,840
when a manager hands you that contract
with this automatically renews.

3060
02:41:15,960 --> 02:41:20,160
If I get you one, one thing at the chuckle
hut and you say, dude, this is bullshit.

3061
02:41:20,330 --> 02:41:23,520
And it's like, no, everything's
negotiable. You're right. It's negotiable.

3062
02:41:23,550 --> 02:41:27,750
If you have an RSS feed as an example,
if you have something on your ear,

3063
02:41:27,810 --> 02:41:31,180
you have something on most websites,
wordpress, even RSS feed, right.

3064
02:41:31,300 --> 02:41:35,170
There's programs like there's one
called Flipboard on the IPAD. What it,

3065
02:41:35,180 --> 02:41:39,570
what it does is it collects RSS
feeds and it's it repackages.

3066
02:41:39,630 --> 02:41:42,210
It makes your website kind
of look like a magazine,

3067
02:41:42,360 --> 02:41:45,930
but they sell kind of mix advertising in
there, here and there. You know there's,

3068
02:41:45,931 --> 02:41:46,201
there's,

3069
02:41:46,201 --> 02:41:49,410
there's programs that do that same thing
that stitcher doing except the only

3070
02:41:49,411 --> 02:41:52,350
thing that stitchers doing is
different is taking it off your server,

3071
02:41:52,530 --> 02:41:55,110
putting it on their server so it
doesn't affect your bandwidth.

3072
02:41:55,111 --> 02:41:59,590
That's a big issue. And it's not affecting
the bandwidth. This is my number.

3073
02:41:59,610 --> 02:42:02,130
I'm not confused. No, you've
explained it like three times. Dude,

3074
02:42:02,131 --> 02:42:04,830
I understand what it is. I know,
but they're not directly like,

3075
02:42:04,860 --> 02:42:07,830
like I'm trying to say is that
they're not like these little banner

3076
02:42:07,831 --> 02:42:11,400
advertisements. Like that's not making
millions of dollars. It doesn't matter.

3077
02:42:11,401 --> 02:42:14,190
But it's making its affecting
the downloads from iTunes,

3078
02:42:14,191 --> 02:42:15,470
which affect his numbers yet.

3079
02:42:15,490 --> 02:42:19,170
But you can get those numbers from
stitcher and if you don't want to be on

3080
02:42:19,171 --> 02:42:21,990
Stitcher, you can tell them to
take you off a stitcher. Yeah.

3081
02:42:21,991 --> 02:42:25,020
But even if you watch this
one, numbers lie and, and I,

3082
02:42:25,030 --> 02:42:28,560
and I told them and then they fucking
obviously, so this is the funny thing,

3083
02:42:28,590 --> 02:42:32,430
obviously they're making some money
if they offered me to stay. Okay.

3084
02:42:32,431 --> 02:42:35,310
And I also know you can't pay your
rent unless you're making money.

3085
02:42:35,430 --> 02:42:37,890
I'm not saying that those guys
are millionaires over there.

3086
02:42:38,130 --> 02:42:42,060
What I'm saying is that that's not the
way you conduct business. That's wrong.

3087
02:42:42,120 --> 02:42:44,190
That's, you can't do
that, man. That's wrong.

3088
02:42:44,191 --> 02:42:48,600
You can't just take somebody's creative
shit and just start making money off of

3089
02:42:48,601 --> 02:42:52,220
it and not, and not paying them. I
don't underst like that. That said,

3090
02:42:52,230 --> 02:42:55,740
bizarre Internet thing where
people feel that because they can,

3091
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:58,200
they can see it and they
can put it on their site,

3092
02:42:58,201 --> 02:43:01,770
that they own it and then have the right
to do whatever they want with it and

3093
02:43:01,771 --> 02:43:04,770
make money off it and not paying anybody.
I'm not being a dick here too.

3094
02:43:05,100 --> 02:43:08,130
I'm really not. I'm just, I'm
just asking to go about it.

3095
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:10,530
I would love to be on
stitcher. It in a, in a,

3096
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:14,080
in a functional business model.

3097
02:43:14,081 --> 02:43:17,260
I don't want to be on it where it's
just you just fucking swipe it and make

3098
02:43:17,261 --> 02:43:19,570
money and wait for me to
find out about it. Well,

3099
02:43:19,600 --> 02:43:21,490
one thing you should
definitely do is take off your,

3100
02:43:21,491 --> 02:43:24,190
your podcast off of your RSS feed so that,
that,

3101
02:43:24,220 --> 02:43:26,110
cause you're not only a stitcher doing,

3102
02:43:26,111 --> 02:43:29,650
that's about probably a hundred different
companies are using your RSS feed and

3103
02:43:29,651 --> 02:43:31,660
your MP3 to make money right now.
Okay.

3104
02:43:31,930 --> 02:43:34,150
So you have to take probably
a hundred people daily,

3105
02:43:34,160 --> 02:43:36,840
over a hundred companies that are using
his shit. To me, one of the women,

3106
02:43:36,850 --> 02:43:38,230
he got things like stitcher.

3107
02:43:38,231 --> 02:43:42,000
There's so many websites that we'll
play your MP three days on it and have

3108
02:43:42,010 --> 02:43:45,040
banner ever talking about too. We're
talking about what's right and wrong.

3109
02:43:45,041 --> 02:43:47,500
You just basically said,
well you busted this drug dealer,

3110
02:43:47,501 --> 02:43:49,930
there's another hundred drug dealers
out there doing it. It's like,

3111
02:43:50,050 --> 02:43:52,440
I'm not saying that there
aren't other people doing it.

3112
02:43:52,441 --> 02:43:54,990
I'm saying why I'm not on
stitcher anymore. Yeah.

3113
02:43:55,030 --> 02:43:58,810
But what I'm saying is that that's
why the RSS means on the Internet.

3114
02:43:58,811 --> 02:44:01,480
If you're putting out an RSS feed,
you're pretty much saying, all right,

3115
02:44:01,510 --> 02:44:05,710
this is an unprotected work that I am
sending out for you guys to have. Yes.

3116
02:44:05,770 --> 02:44:08,410
Do whatever you want.
No, I'm not saying that.

3117
02:44:08,411 --> 02:44:10,600
I'm not saying that you can
then go make money off of it.

3118
02:44:10,601 --> 02:44:14,100
I'm saying this is free. Here you go.
All right, well that's what I'm saying.

3119
02:44:14,101 --> 02:44:16,590
You to take off your RSS
feed off your website, Brian,

3120
02:44:16,600 --> 02:44:20,290
because they're profiting off the point.
I'm not missing the point.

3121
02:44:20,650 --> 02:44:21,250
I'm not missing quite,

3122
02:44:21,250 --> 02:44:23,710
that's what an RSS feed is and
that's mean that you're pretty much,

3123
02:44:23,711 --> 02:44:26,030
it's like an intendant advertisement.
This is my injuries.

3124
02:44:26,290 --> 02:44:30,580
What you're doing is you're telling me
what I'm thinking, what my intent is. No,

3125
02:44:30,610 --> 02:44:33,920
no. I'm just saying what an RSS feed
is. We know what an RSS feed is.

3126
02:44:33,921 --> 02:44:35,980
It's just something that allows
people to download something.

3127
02:44:35,981 --> 02:44:38,340
It's an automatic download.
You're saying that because I,

3128
02:44:38,350 --> 02:44:41,500
I was saying that sites that I'm on that,
yeah,

3129
02:44:41,501 --> 02:44:43,330
but you can't sell the advertising.

3130
02:44:43,420 --> 02:44:45,790
Usually someone's content
and sell advertising.

3131
02:44:45,791 --> 02:44:47,420
I don't know why that's so
hard for you to understand.

3132
02:44:47,421 --> 02:44:50,710
If they're not directly selling content
advertising towards your content.

3133
02:44:50,711 --> 02:44:53,020
They're there. That's what I'm
saying. Like the, the RSS feeds.

3134
02:44:53,140 --> 02:44:55,550
There's websites that are playing
his MP3 right now. Gone there

3135
02:44:57,880 --> 02:44:59,470
but you don't even know.
It's like,

3136
02:44:59,471 --> 02:45:03,070
I don't know exactly when you're
using you're shitty logic.

3137
02:45:04,610 --> 02:45:06,660
They're selling advertising and they're,

3138
02:45:06,661 --> 02:45:11,661
they're using [inaudible] radio so you
don't put on the radio station because of

3139
02:45:12,491 --> 02:45:16,030
the fucking advertising.
It's the bands that bring you there.

3140
02:45:16,031 --> 02:45:19,000
Like these guys play the music I want.
That's why the bands get play.

3141
02:45:19,090 --> 02:45:21,610
People are going to stitch here so
you have a problem with youtube too.

3142
02:45:21,611 --> 02:45:24,340
Then do you have videos on Youtube?
This is one of these guys like this.

3143
02:45:24,341 --> 02:45:27,220
This is going to be those guys where
it's just like you can't make a point

3144
02:45:27,221 --> 02:45:30,820
because he's RSS feeds are
already thinking of his
next point and he just wants

3145
02:45:30,821 --> 02:45:33,790
to be right. No, I'm just saying
what the west with RSF seats,

3146
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:38,110
if you don't want your shit like
distributed and like made money off,

3147
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:39,880
like you don't have an
RSS feed on your website.

3148
02:45:39,970 --> 02:45:43,720
Rss Feed for your website is for other
websites to grab and use your content for.

3149
02:45:43,880 --> 02:45:48,000
No, it's not. It's to get shit vacations.
No, it's the download shit for free. It's,

3150
02:45:48,001 --> 02:45:51,460
it's something that allows you to keep
up with people as they put out podcasts.

3151
02:45:51,610 --> 02:45:55,870
[inaudible], stitcher does stitcher
grabs your RSS feed and repackages no,

3152
02:45:55,871 --> 02:46:00,871
it doesn't dry out your MP three you're
wrong and it gets your MP three and then

3153
02:46:00,971 --> 02:46:02,980
sends it out through its own application.

3154
02:46:03,260 --> 02:46:07,780
[inaudible] top 100% wrong
and, but there's no way to
convince them because he's,

3155
02:46:07,781 --> 02:46:12,140
he's totally of his argument. Okay.
Yeah, it totally convinced of it,

3156
02:46:12,790 --> 02:46:17,170
Brian. The point is they're not saying
you're a bad person down at yourself.

3157
02:46:17,200 --> 02:46:18,260
You cannot listen.

3158
02:46:18,320 --> 02:46:22,010
You use the youtube argument and it's
a shitty argument and here's why. If,

3159
02:46:22,160 --> 02:46:26,960
if fucking youtube was stealing bill
burrs shit and putting it on Youtube and

3160
02:46:26,961 --> 02:46:30,200
then selling ads, that would work.
That would be like, Hey, what the fuck?

3161
02:46:30,201 --> 02:46:33,020
You can't have bill [inaudible]
but youtube is fans.

3162
02:46:33,140 --> 02:46:37,220
It's some kid in Nebraska that things
bill bursts hilarious and he watches his

3163
02:46:37,221 --> 02:46:41,090
special on comedy central and he takes
his computer and he edits or 10 minute

3164
02:46:41,091 --> 02:46:44,570
chunk and he throws it up on Youtube and
then she had been to John with exact no

3165
02:46:44,571 --> 02:46:46,040
problem.
That's completely different.

3166
02:46:46,080 --> 02:46:49,130
It's bad enough when I have a DVD coming
out in the second, somebody sees it,

3167
02:46:49,131 --> 02:46:51,440
then they put it on that. But I
understand now it's like, okay,

3168
02:46:51,650 --> 02:46:55,640
the DVD thing is over now.
Like I get that thing but this,

3169
02:46:55,641 --> 02:46:58,700
this is where the problem comes
is you then take my content,

3170
02:46:59,450 --> 02:47:03,770
okay and then start advertising off
of it and you don't fucking pay me.

3171
02:47:03,771 --> 02:47:04,310
That's the thing.

3172
02:47:04,310 --> 02:47:08,510
I understand that my shit's going to
end up on on the Internet and people are

3173
02:47:08,511 --> 02:47:11,390
going to get it for free and
that's just the way things are now.

3174
02:47:11,420 --> 02:47:13,030
I don't have a problem
with that. The, the,

3175
02:47:13,031 --> 02:47:18,020
the big fucking hurdle is when you take
it and then you start making money on

3176
02:47:18,021 --> 02:47:22,070
application, then have as you start making
money off your arguments completely.

3177
02:47:22,071 --> 02:47:25,620
Yeah. There's a reason why they came
back to me when I took it down and,

3178
02:47:25,630 --> 02:47:29,630
and offered me a cut and there's a
reason why they didn't want me to take it

3179
02:47:29,631 --> 02:47:33,080
down because I have listeners who
go there and when they go there,

3180
02:47:33,081 --> 02:47:37,010
they see the ad and they read it.
And in the advertising world,

3181
02:47:37,011 --> 02:47:38,630
that means while we get
enough guys looking at it,

3182
02:47:38,631 --> 02:47:39,770
they're going to fucking buy something.

3183
02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:42,860
But if they're going there because they
like your podcasts or they're like my

3184
02:47:42,861 --> 02:47:45,680
podcast, that's, that's why they have
to kick you a little bit of money.

3185
02:47:46,190 --> 02:47:48,920
[inaudible] people want to say shit.

3186
02:47:48,980 --> 02:47:53,000
I'm not saying like their
website is fucking awesome
the way they do business is

3187
02:47:53,001 --> 02:47:56,570
not in the youtube argument that the
thing about youtube that's crazy as the,

3188
02:47:56,571 --> 02:48:00,900
even though the kids are putting bill
burrs podcast or bill burrs a, you know,

3189
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,290
standup mp3s or clips from a movie,
that's funny.

3190
02:48:03,470 --> 02:48:06,470
They're getting sued by all these
people that own that switch.

3191
02:48:06,471 --> 02:48:08,270
I wouldn't let the kids hold down.

3192
02:48:08,300 --> 02:48:11,060
That's one of those things where if
stitcher wasn't making any money and just

3193
02:48:11,061 --> 02:48:12,740
want to fucking throw it out there,
I wouldn't give a shit.

3194
02:48:13,010 --> 02:48:14,960
It's the fact that you're
making money off my podcast.

3195
02:48:14,961 --> 02:48:15,800
You've got to give me some money.

3196
02:48:15,950 --> 02:48:19,910
Those kids who take my my specials and
put them all over the fucking youtube,

3197
02:48:19,911 --> 02:48:22,580
I love it. That's fucking great.
I have no problem with that.

3198
02:48:22,700 --> 02:48:24,770
If they were somehow figured
out a way to make money,

3199
02:48:24,771 --> 02:48:29,270
you have to fucking pay me a certain
portion and I respect the fact that you

3200
02:48:29,271 --> 02:48:32,780
come up with the business
model that makes that,

3201
02:48:32,781 --> 02:48:35,300
cause I don't have the business model,
but you still,

3202
02:48:35,720 --> 02:48:39,980
you know the content is the model
of start charging for your podcast.

3203
02:48:40,520 --> 02:48:44,120
What's that? The model is
you start charging for your
podcast. What do you mean?

3204
02:48:44,240 --> 02:48:45,830
That's pretty much how you have to,

3205
02:48:46,670 --> 02:48:49,790
if that is or if you protect
yourself and protect your MBA real.

3206
02:48:49,800 --> 02:48:51,560
I want to have that of ads.
That's what I want to have.

3207
02:48:51,560 --> 02:48:54,650
But when I've had on a chart and I don't
want to have somebody take my podcast

3208
02:48:54,651 --> 02:48:58,160
and, and have advertising around it
and that type of shit and make money,

3209
02:48:58,280 --> 02:49:01,550
not tell me they take on my podcast, earn
money and not give me any of the money.

3210
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:04,300
That's all I'm saying. I don't
have any problem. I, I'm,

3211
02:49:04,520 --> 02:49:06,920
I would love to be in business
with those guys. Like if they just,

3212
02:49:06,921 --> 02:49:09,810
if they fucking did it the right way,
they didn't.

3213
02:49:09,811 --> 02:49:14,430
So I just had them take it down. I
mean it's just normal business. Yeah.

3214
02:49:14,610 --> 02:49:16,270
I mean I think eventually that there's,

3215
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:20,130
everybody has got saying that eventually
I won't be back up on stitcher cause

3216
02:49:20,131 --> 02:49:22,200
they already offered me something.
But what I'm saying,

3217
02:49:22,201 --> 02:49:24,840
the reason why I took it down
because what they did was not right.

3218
02:49:25,590 --> 02:49:28,230
That's just not how you do business.
It's stealing.

3219
02:49:28,300 --> 02:49:31,840
I agree. I agree. Our situation's
totally different. I, uh,

3220
02:49:31,841 --> 02:49:34,660
agreed to be on stitcher cause my, my, uh,

3221
02:49:34,690 --> 02:49:38,410
my way of looking at it is I just want
more people to get the podcast and are

3222
02:49:38,680 --> 02:49:43,000
only advertisement that we have is by the
fleshlight. And I have no idea. I mean,

3223
02:49:43,120 --> 02:49:44,830
having them on Stitcher,
in my opinion,

3224
02:49:44,831 --> 02:49:46,210
that's good for the
fleshlight is good for that.

3225
02:49:47,080 --> 02:49:52,080
Then people who want to read or they
what they want to sell advertising and on

3226
02:49:52,611 --> 02:49:55,850
my podcast and they want to
do a 50, 50 split. And I'm
like, dude, that sounds cool.

3227
02:49:55,880 --> 02:49:57,420
My feeling is that I'm going to happen,

3228
02:49:57,860 --> 02:49:59,900
bring in my own advertisers,
you know,

3229
02:49:59,901 --> 02:50:02,510
and I've got some other people that
I'm looking at as far as advertisers.

3230
02:50:02,511 --> 02:50:04,760
It's gotta be something
that I think is valid some,

3231
02:50:05,180 --> 02:50:08,420
and I'm just going to have him just
advertise the podcast and you can put it

3232
02:50:08,421 --> 02:50:10,490
wherever the fuck you want, man.
Put it anywhere. I don't care.

3233
02:50:10,940 --> 02:50:12,500
What's important to me is
that it gets out there,

3234
02:50:12,501 --> 02:50:17,270
which is exactly how I did these shows in
Gotham, in uh, in New York this weekend.

3235
02:50:17,420 --> 02:50:20,120
And I had fucking four hours
sleep in two days. I mean,

3236
02:50:20,121 --> 02:50:24,320
I was exhausted and I had to do two shows,
but the fucking crowds were so good.

3237
02:50:24,321 --> 02:50:27,350
It was so intense, man.
And when I asked them like,

3238
02:50:27,351 --> 02:50:32,240
how many you guys listen to the podcast?
It was like fucking 99% it was crazy.

3239
02:50:32,470 --> 02:50:36,680
Like it's, it's an audience of
podcast fans now. It's, it's,

3240
02:50:36,681 --> 02:50:38,180
it's a totally different audience,

3241
02:50:38,210 --> 02:50:42,560
which it's not just stand up fans or
not just fans of, of, of, you know,

3242
02:50:42,561 --> 02:50:47,510
of um, MMA, UFC fans. It's people
that are fucking fans of the podcast.

3243
02:50:47,780 --> 02:50:48,441
And so it's,

3244
02:50:48,441 --> 02:50:51,950
to me it's invaluable and the most
important thing is that the most people

3245
02:50:51,951 --> 02:50:53,270
possible can get it for free.

3246
02:50:53,390 --> 02:50:57,230
But I completely see your argument and
I think you're absolutely right to be

3247
02:50:57,231 --> 02:50:58,940
upset that someone downloaded your stuff.

3248
02:50:58,941 --> 02:51:02,000
And even if it's just a little pop up
banner, if you're making money off that,

3249
02:51:02,001 --> 02:51:04,040
it's the same as the youtube
argument. You know, you have to,

3250
02:51:04,130 --> 02:51:08,970
well, and this is the thing about it was
unless somebody told me it was on there,

3251
02:51:09,060 --> 02:51:12,300
I was never going to know. Right.
Because they didn't come to me.

3252
02:51:12,390 --> 02:51:14,550
Right. Yeah. That's
not cool. It's just be,

3253
02:51:14,551 --> 02:51:16,350
it would be just as if
youtube came and sorted,

3254
02:51:16,351 --> 02:51:19,350
download your stuff off TV and putting
it online. Well, Hey, he was on TV.

3255
02:51:19,351 --> 02:51:21,920
It was free. But no, it
had ads on TV and you know,

3256
02:51:21,950 --> 02:51:22,970
now you're just putting it in this list.

3257
02:51:23,220 --> 02:51:24,530
It does. The thing that the, the,

3258
02:51:24,531 --> 02:51:27,740
the big hurdle is when you start
making money off of my shit. Yeah.

3259
02:51:27,780 --> 02:51:30,880
That's the thing. But it's like if
people see me on TV and they download,

3260
02:51:30,881 --> 02:51:31,441
they put it up there.

3261
02:51:31,441 --> 02:51:33,960
I don't give a fuck if you don't make
time players and make some money off

3262
02:51:34,380 --> 02:51:37,920
windows media player makes money off
your shirt just by playing your stuff.

3263
02:51:37,921 --> 02:51:38,910
You know all this crap.

3264
02:51:38,911 --> 02:51:43,911
Is this like just how the Internet works
and how the Internet works ads while

3265
02:51:45,180 --> 02:51:48,330
you're stepping up in Windows Media
Player, there's advertising all evidence.

3266
02:51:48,331 --> 02:51:52,400
Windows Media Player, it's banners was
playing and stuff. No, no, no. You,

3267
02:51:52,401 --> 02:51:54,720
you windows media player can
only download some. Yeah.

3268
02:51:54,740 --> 02:51:57,980
That's readily available for free
and you play it from somewhere.

3269
02:51:57,981 --> 02:52:00,350
You have to download a file
and then play it on windows

3270
02:52:00,470 --> 02:52:03,830
and it's providing a service. Like I can
already have people listen to my shit.

3271
02:52:04,150 --> 02:52:05,860
Don't stop on on stitcher.

3272
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:10,280
They can listen to what Brian let him
know and he had a can't explain RSS feeds

3273
02:52:10,281 --> 02:52:12,710
thought you explained it 100,000 times.
We know exactly.

3274
02:52:12,720 --> 02:52:15,520
You're saying do it and you
don't understand that you
should get paid for your

3275
02:52:15,521 --> 02:52:19,230
work. You don't get that for some
reason. You feel like like when I,

3276
02:52:19,310 --> 02:52:22,150
when I give it out for free
now that you shouldn't Brian,

3277
02:52:22,151 --> 02:52:25,810
they're making money off something that's
available for free. You can't do that.

3278
02:52:25,811 --> 02:52:30,760
You can't make money off. Someone's
constantly got money. Let's go,

3279
02:52:30,761 --> 02:52:31,870
let's go. Let's go this route. I mean,

3280
02:52:31,871 --> 02:52:36,871
why are you [inaudible] I'm trying
not to [inaudible] up attitude man.

3281
02:52:39,190 --> 02:52:43,690
I understand that NFL football on
fucking NBC, I watch NFL football.

3282
02:52:43,691 --> 02:52:47,380
I'm not allowed to record that and then
go send the fucking game up to other

3283
02:52:47,381 --> 02:52:48,860
people and make money off of it,

3284
02:52:48,861 --> 02:52:53,500
out for free and then the that they do
give it out for features of player is a

3285
02:52:53,501 --> 02:52:58,501
player player RSS feeds and advice.

3286
02:52:58,541 --> 02:53:02,090
Stop repeating yourself. That's why
I'm trying to fucking stop talking.

3287
02:53:02,470 --> 02:53:05,260
What you say has already
been refuted by both of us.

3288
02:53:05,261 --> 02:53:07,930
We both know what an RSS feed is.

3289
02:53:07,990 --> 02:53:12,940
We both know football is free on
network teachers not selling stitcher.

3290
02:53:12,941 --> 02:53:15,700
Listen to bill. Birds get come
here and listen to his podcast.

3291
02:53:15,701 --> 02:53:20,140
The Fuck Day are there selling gaming
God player out that collects RSS feed in

3292
02:53:20,141 --> 02:53:24,040
place and making money. No reason
why Adam Carolla Greg Fitzsimmons.

3293
02:53:24,041 --> 02:53:25,690
Everybody wants to pull
their shit off of it.

3294
02:53:25,750 --> 02:53:29,260
There's no reason if everyone's crazy
because everyone's crazy that they're

3295
02:53:29,261 --> 02:53:30,880
making my iTunes numbers.

3296
02:53:31,240 --> 02:53:33,670
It hurts their iTunes numbers would
cost them money and advertisement.

3297
02:53:33,671 --> 02:53:35,710
That's a big deal.
You're telling us what we're thinking.

3298
02:53:35,740 --> 02:53:38,590
I've been telling you for
45 bucks why I take it off,

3299
02:53:38,750 --> 02:53:42,910
but it's not like stitcher is making
money off of your podcast and selling you

3300
02:53:43,330 --> 02:53:47,130
into their their servers. They're giving
a free player out and that's all it is.

3301
02:53:47,140 --> 02:53:49,720
A free player sell Brian. Huh?
What does a free player have on it?

3302
02:53:49,960 --> 02:53:54,730
A collects RSS feeds off the Internet.
Stop, stop, stop. This RSS talk,

3303
02:53:54,731 --> 02:53:58,840
what is it like a podcast,
podcasts and his podcasts.

3304
02:53:58,890 --> 02:54:02,020
Flex arts as feet but as
podcast and it sells ads.

3305
02:54:02,730 --> 02:54:06,220
It sells ads. It has a banner
that pops up in the player.

3306
02:54:06,860 --> 02:54:09,880
Yes and sells. It, sells
their services, is collect,

3307
02:54:09,930 --> 02:54:13,800
see that they want to listen to Joe
Rogan reflect, stop repeating yourself.

3308
02:54:14,230 --> 02:54:17,610
[inaudible]
first of all,

3309
02:54:17,620 --> 02:54:22,390
understand you're yelling like a
little child [inaudible] me and saying,

3310
02:54:22,391 --> 02:54:25,950
we just disagree with you and we're using
logic and you're not getting angry out.

3311
02:54:26,380 --> 02:54:30,490
I think the best example is when a
baseball game or a football game,

3312
02:54:30,491 --> 02:54:35,320
it's on network TV. That's free. Not going
to fucking TV. Network TV is free. Okay.

3313
02:54:35,710 --> 02:54:39,760
You're not allowed to record
it and then start selling it.

3314
02:54:39,970 --> 02:54:44,260
Putting it on a player that they
had at the end of every single,

3315
02:54:44,261 --> 02:54:47,320
even if you include the advertisements,
you're not allowed to do that.

3316
02:54:47,321 --> 02:54:50,860
You can't just have your own TV thing.
It's a new format.

3317
02:54:51,190 --> 02:54:53,920
I can record the thing and have some
friends come over and watch the fucking

3318
02:54:53,921 --> 02:54:54,850
thing.
That's no big deal,

3319
02:54:54,940 --> 02:54:59,050
but the second I start charging people
to come through the door to watch this

3320
02:54:59,051 --> 02:55:03,040
game didn't provided, you know, all my
friends didn't have TVs. Then it's, yeah,

3321
02:55:03,320 --> 02:55:03,980
it's like,
no,

3322
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:05,330
you're making money off our shore.

3323
02:55:05,331 --> 02:55:10,331
Taking that show and like playing it
at a bar on a VHS tape and causing,

3324
02:55:10,401 --> 02:55:14,310
you know, costing people do judge
and charging them to get in trouble.

3325
02:55:14,520 --> 02:55:17,240
I see your point and I see
where Brian's coming from.

3326
02:55:17,241 --> 02:55:18,470
I know what you're trying to say,
Brian.

3327
02:55:18,500 --> 02:55:22,970
I think you're just a little emotionally
tied up in this argument anyway. Okay,

3328
02:55:23,060 --> 02:55:23,661
well I'm just,

3329
02:55:23,661 --> 02:55:26,750
I'm trying to pursue things over and
not have you be a little child here.

3330
02:55:26,780 --> 02:55:28,700
I'm not seeing it now.
I'm considered a child.

3331
02:55:28,760 --> 02:55:32,410
I'm a considerate chow now you guys,
you guys, I can't talk about it though.

3332
02:55:32,450 --> 02:55:32,990
I can't be,

3333
02:55:32,990 --> 02:55:36,710
can't talk about him and just like I'm
talking to my mom about email right now.

3334
02:55:36,740 --> 02:55:39,440
No, it's not. It's like
we're talking to a challenge.

3335
02:55:39,450 --> 02:55:42,530
Just getting condescending attitude,
not ascending man.

3336
02:55:42,560 --> 02:55:45,980
Like you're talking to your
mom about email. You clearly
are being condescending.

3337
02:55:46,010 --> 02:55:46,843
Look,
you could be,

3338
02:55:47,270 --> 02:55:52,100
the fourth hour will be the best
fucking hours or minutes until it,

3339
02:55:52,150 --> 02:55:55,760
let's read this bitch, ride this
bitch right into the rocks and no,

3340
02:55:55,761 --> 02:55:57,800
I didn't think I was going to prom
with rush hour traffic. Well we were,

3341
02:55:57,801 --> 02:56:02,060
we started to stopping an hour ago and
somehow we've been talking about stitcher

3342
02:56:02,061 --> 02:56:06,710
and internet. Use your illusion
one and two podcast. Listen,

3343
02:56:07,190 --> 02:56:10,040
it's all good folks. You
know, to spicy Brian's point.

3344
02:56:10,080 --> 02:56:13,250
I know Brian Likes stitcher and he
loves the APP and I see what he's saying

3345
02:56:13,251 --> 02:56:15,350
about if you put something out there,
people are going to take it.

3346
02:56:15,530 --> 02:56:18,280
But I also absolutely see bill's point.

3347
02:56:18,310 --> 02:56:20,660
You can't just download
the stuff and then use it.

3348
02:56:21,260 --> 02:56:24,920
Limewire why wouldn't you love limewire?
It's sell free fucking shit. Exactly.

3349
02:56:24,990 --> 02:56:28,310
Yeah. At the end of the
day, the service is corrupt.

3350
02:56:28,370 --> 02:56:31,790
The beautiful thing about the Internet
is that you can put things out there and

3351
02:56:31,791 --> 02:56:33,830
you can use, uh, use, you know,

3352
02:56:33,831 --> 02:56:38,120
this format to get more people to
watch your shows and get more people.

3353
02:56:38,270 --> 02:56:40,730
But if you're going to sell ads, I agree
with you. You gotta, you gotta get paid.

3354
02:56:40,930 --> 02:56:43,720
I mean, it's no different than radio.
It's no different than television.

3355
02:56:43,721 --> 02:56:46,250
It's no different than any other service
that you're providing that people

3356
02:56:46,251 --> 02:56:48,920
profiting off. And that was my thing.
As long as they just came to me.

3357
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,980
And just said, listen, we want to put
it on him. You provide this service.

3358
02:56:51,981 --> 02:56:54,590
We're going to sell the advertising.
We'll give you a little piece of it. Yeah,

3359
02:56:54,620 --> 02:56:57,350
because we know people aren't
coming here stare at our website.

3360
02:56:57,351 --> 02:57:00,110
They're actually coming here to listen
to your show that you produce and you

3361
02:57:00,111 --> 02:57:04,400
create, but I agree with Brian
Lapointe, money as an internet realist.

3362
02:57:04,401 --> 02:57:08,240
I totally agree with Brian's point
that you put something on an RSS feed.

3363
02:57:08,241 --> 02:57:11,360
You're just allowing people to download
it for free and they can probably pretty

3364
02:57:11,361 --> 02:57:13,360
much do whatever the fuck they
want with it, but they don't know.

3365
02:57:13,430 --> 02:57:15,920
Short of trying to make money out of it.
Yeah,

3366
02:57:18,420 --> 02:57:21,530
we got three minutes, but people sell
heroin. That doesn't mean it's legal.

3367
02:57:21,860 --> 02:57:26,210
All right, three minutes.
Yeah, we heard you bro.

3368
02:57:26,840 --> 02:57:29,570
We're going to have three minutes
of silence and see if you can cry.

3369
02:57:30,930 --> 02:57:34,130
I know that cry. It's just, it never,
I can't even talk about it. Yeah,

3370
02:57:34,131 --> 02:57:35,870
you can't talk to us.
I started getting,

3371
02:57:35,871 --> 02:57:39,170
I says we don't agree with your point
of view. There's a lot of that upset.

3372
02:57:39,171 --> 02:57:42,080
You don't understand. My point of view
and then every time I tried to explain it,

3373
02:57:42,081 --> 02:57:44,960
you say you're repeating yourself. Let
me tell you a point of view. Right?

3374
02:57:45,020 --> 02:57:47,660
Right now you're saying it's my
fault for putting it out there.

3375
02:57:48,110 --> 02:57:52,280
I put it out there and I put it on on
this they RSS feed and that gives it out

3376
02:57:52,281 --> 02:57:54,650
to anybody. It's your fault. I'm
saying if you want to stop it,

3377
02:57:54,680 --> 02:57:57,980
then don't have an RSS feed out there
because that's what it's for. Hey,

3378
02:57:57,981 --> 02:58:00,110
if you don't want to get shot in the head,
don't go out of the house.

3379
02:58:02,730 --> 02:58:06,880
