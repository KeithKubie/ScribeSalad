00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:19.210
[ Silence ]

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.510
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.810
Welcome, gentleman.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.110
My name is Todd Harvey,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.410
I'm a curator at the
American Folk Life Center

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.710
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.440
I want to thank you for
joining us this afternoon

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.790
after your concert,
after your lunch.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.870
You're all refreshed.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.670
I'd first like to introduce John
Cohen and the Down Hill Strugglers

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.270
so that we in the future
know who everyone is.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.970
This is, from left to right, Eli
Smith; John Cohen in the jacket;

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.880
Jackson Lynch in the white shirt;
and Walker Shephard on the end.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.080
These are the Down Hill Strugglers.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.180
Today September 25, 2015.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.480
And we're here in the
Coolidge Auditorium

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.560
in the lovely Jefferson building.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.670 position:56%
I want to thank you for the concert.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.270
I want to thank you for agreeing
to move your concert to today

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.500
to accommodate the Pope's visit.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.910
John, I understand the Holy
Father himself reached out to you

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.660
to ask you if you would change
the date of your concert.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.870
He's a big [inaudible]
fan, I know that.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.000
&gt;&gt; He's from Latin America.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.540
&gt;&gt; They didn't want members of
Congress to have to make a choice,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.030
and so we graciously moved aside.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.510
And what an amazing
concert you all gave today.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.810
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.480
&gt;&gt; I just wonder how you found the
acoustics in the room today, Eli?

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, thank you.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.680
It was a really fun concert.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.590
And the Coolidge Auditorium
has amazing acoustics.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.280
It's one of the best places
I've ever played I think.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.510
&gt;&gt; What about you, Jackson?

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.870
You've got a loud kind
of fiddle style,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.160
and I wonder if you
could hear yourself.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.460
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.510
I wish I could play in here
with nobody else in here.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.810
It sounded really good.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry about that, man.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.110
&gt;&gt; Sorry, we exist, yeah.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.540
&gt;&gt; But you're talking
about the audience,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.870
with the audience being gone?

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.870
&gt;&gt; Oh, I just mean I could
sit in here for hours

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.960
and just play by myself, you know.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.010
&gt;&gt; What does it compare
to in different halls?

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.840
Well, can you think of any
halls that it compares to?

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.830
&gt;&gt; It kind of sounds like a
dance hall, a big dance hall

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:58.620
where the room sound travels really
well and everyone can hear it like,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.700
in the back the same
as in the front.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.700
&gt;&gt; We've played in
some old halls touring.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.930
&gt;&gt; And I guess it does in a way,
it reminds me of that a little bit.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.680
I remember that opera house in
Upstate New York a few years ago.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It just has
a big sound like that.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.230
&gt;&gt; Didn't we play in
a GA [inaudible]

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.950
in Southern Illinois or Ohio?

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was in Ohio.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.240 position:56%
It was something like that, although
this place is much more finely tuned

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.540
than that.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.870
&gt;&gt; Don't really need a
microphone to play in this room.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.170
&gt;&gt; No, I didn't think so.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.090
Yeah, I think you could have
done just fine without it.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; No, but there's something about
the sound that makes that everything

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.670
that you do very present.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.450
And I was interested that when
we played before the sound test,

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.370
I thought the sound would get
deadened when the audience came.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.290
But the audience came and the
sound didn't get deadened.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.510
Maybe the audience got deadened.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.150
[ Laughter ]

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Do you often do daytime concerts?

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah. When we can
wake up in time.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.040
[ Laughter ]

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what do you
mean by daytime?

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.640
&gt;&gt; Well, it was a noontime concert.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.940
&gt;&gt; In the crack of noon we play.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.240
Man.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.540
[ Laughter ]

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.840
&gt;&gt; How was the Millennium Stage
last night, how was your gig there?

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.140
&gt;&gt; It was great.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.440
&gt;&gt; It was really good.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.340
&gt;&gt; Great fun.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.640
Yeah.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.940
&gt;&gt; Strange auditorium and
there was no back wall.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.540
&gt;&gt; It just goes.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.840
&gt;&gt; There were all of
the people waiting

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.990
and drinking cocktails before
going to see Carmen at the opera.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.570
And I think they were pretty
confused about what we were doing.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.870
&gt;&gt; You know, they got
a little taste of opry.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.470
&gt;&gt; We gave them some
opry before the opera.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.160
&gt;&gt; Right. Different sound.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.860
I mean, you really do need kind

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.100
of reinforcement I think
in that [inaudible].

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But the sound
was great there too.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:57.280
&gt;&gt; Was your setlist today the
same as what you played last week?

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.110
&gt;&gt; It overlapped.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.410
It certainly overlapped.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.340
&gt;&gt; But there's several things
that we had never done before,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.950
or never done them that way.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.990
&gt;&gt; Well, I can go through
the set real quickly,

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.930
because I have some questions
to fill in the blank spots.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.020
I really love it that you all talk
about the songs and introduce them,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.950
and give some background,
which really works for us here

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.250
at the Library of Congress.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.720
&gt;&gt; That's a big point of the show,
is to give a context to do that.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.980
And my idea of the show was
to create a space for that.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.280
&gt;&gt; You mean the roadshow?

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the roadshow.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.300
The Treasures from
the Archive Roadshow.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.130
&gt;&gt; Well, that's kind of a New
Lost City Ramblers things too

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.070
as well, isn't it?

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.370
&gt;&gt; I think so.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.670
Do you think so?

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.090
To some extent.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.750
&gt;&gt; We had to do it to
cover Tom's tuning.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.950
&gt;&gt; Cold Aristocracy, where
did y'all learn that one?

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.900
&gt;&gt; Partly from the New
Lost City Ramblers.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.570
Well, that's the first
time I heard it.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.970
And then partly from
where you guys learned it.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.360
&gt;&gt; Gantt Family.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Gantt Family.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.130
&gt;&gt; No, no.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.170
&gt;&gt; Charles Sieger [assumed
spelling].

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what is the name of
the family that recorded --

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.280
it's embarrassingly
escaping me at this moment.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.410
But yeah, I first heard it from the
New Lost City Ramblers recording.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.070
And then subsequently heard
the original field recording

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.370
that Charles Sieger made.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.800
&gt;&gt; And I think on the last
record, the Ramblers that we did,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.630
two or three or versions of it.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.500
Our early version with
Tom, and then later

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.330
with Tracy, and then the original.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.950
And they're all not the same.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.800 position:56%
But the strange thing about it is
that at some point, it left Ramblers

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.570
and became part of
Contra dance movement.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.630
And so it's played
everywhere at Contra dances.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.540
And it's probably different
from the one we play it now.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.380
&gt;&gt; Taj Mahal plays it on the
banjo on one of his records.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.680
It's real nice.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.320
&gt;&gt; He has a nice version.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.620
Yeah.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.620
&gt;&gt; Just solo banjo piece.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.990
&gt;&gt; Why did you choose
it to open the set?

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.620
&gt;&gt; Oh, I thought because
this is where it came from.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.850
It's not the irony, the fact

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.520
that bringing it back
to where we got it from.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.120
&gt;&gt; Although, you guys
never issued it.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.430
&gt;&gt; No, you issued it.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.030
&gt;&gt; It came from you.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but how did we get it?

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.890
We got it because Mike
had it in his family.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.550
So it's all very --
what's the word --

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.220
not introverted, intro
-- incestuous, that's it.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.520
&gt;&gt; Incestuous.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.820
[ Laughter ]

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike got a bootlegged
version of it and away we go, right?

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.490
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.250
&gt;&gt; I thought it was nice to
open with that in a sense

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.290
because of the connection
with the Ramblers also.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's just a
great blastoff, you know.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.740
It's such a great turn.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.040
&gt;&gt; That's a tremendous tune.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.500
When you hear the old
field recording,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.840
you can't really hear
what's going on.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.480
The recording is not clear,
but it's very powerful.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.080
With a lot of old field recordings,
the recording is very powerful,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.270
but it's not clear, you can't
hear everything that's going on,

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:24.020 position:56%
so you have to make some choices if
you're going to play it live or now,

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.320
what are you going to do?

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.980
And that accounts in some
ways for the variations

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.060
that the New Lost City
Ramblers made or that we made.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.670
We tried to record it a few years
ago and it's on one of our CDs.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:38.090
And we tried to somehow
get at the sound

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.040
of the original field recording.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.450
You know, and you start doing
some weird stuff sometimes to get

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.430
at the sound, but maybe
they were doing weird stuff.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:51.770
&gt;&gt; Well, when the Ramblers did
it, we'd go to the relative minor,

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.040
a certain huge amount, or too much.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.500
And that's what got picked up
in the Contra dance movement.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.100
So then I just got the mandolin
and just -- don't change chords,

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.950
just stay on the one chords.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.250
And it adds a lot of tension.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah, without going
into the [inaudible].

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.850
&gt;&gt; The fiddle is going
into the minor.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.870
&gt;&gt; But the accompaniment is not.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.650
&gt;&gt; So what's it like when --

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.900
I assume you guys are
playing by yourselves.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.900
And then you have to make room
for the guy who just wants

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.650
to play one chord on the
mandolin over and over again.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.060
How do you do that?

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.910
In rehearsal, do you work it out or
you just make it happen on stage,

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.360
or how do you make
room for John Cohen?

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.700
&gt;&gt; They don't listen.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.080
That's the best way.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, a lot of
people maybe people think

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:42.420
that old-time string bands don't
rehearse or something, but we do.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.810
I mean, we make arrangements
of our songs.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.050
I think all old-time
string bands did.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:52.080 position:56%
I mean, of course there's
spontaneity or maybe you just arrive

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.460
at a gig without having
rehearsed and just go for it.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.760
Obviously that happens.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.750
But it's important to remember that
there is like, arrangements going

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.840
on and conscious choices.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.570
&gt;&gt; Well, I think in a lot of ways,
the guitar part carries that tune.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.680
Maybe I'm hearing the
field recording,

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.970
but I was really listening
-- you were playing guitar.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.270
Yeah.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.570
&gt;&gt; I don't think you
can hear the guitar

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.140
on the original field
recording, if there is one.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know
if there is one.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.740
&gt;&gt; Do you recall?

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.040
&gt;&gt; I think there's a
mandolin that carries it.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can maybe hear
something like a mandolin.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.800
It's pretty obscure.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.100
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.400
&gt;&gt; But it's nice with guitar.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.640
No, but the guitar adds so
much, so it's interesting.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.450
&gt;&gt; So Oh, Mary, Don't
You Weep, Don't You Moan;

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.500
where did you get that one?

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.720
&gt;&gt; I've heard different
versions of it.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.460
&gt;&gt; The version that we do,
there's numbers of versions of it

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.440
in your collection,
including some nice ones

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.100
from Newport Folk Festival.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.690
But our version actually
is a version of a version

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.490
that we got off a 78
somewhere I think, right?

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:01.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Georgia
Yellow Hammers do it, right?

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.520
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a band from Georgia
called the Yellow Hammers.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:10.400
And they did like, a lot of like,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.060
string band arrangements
of old songs.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:18.700 position:56%
They seem like less of a dance band,
they don't really play dance tunes

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.000
as much, but they do kind

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.500
of old minstrel songs
really, and just have --

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.920
&gt;&gt; Interracial band.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they pull music from --

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.450
&gt;&gt; Were they an interracial band?

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they played with a
duo called the Baxter Brothers,

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:42.160
who was an older man
playing the fiddle

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.970
and his nephew; Andrew
and Jim Baxter.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.270
And they were Black.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:50.810
And they recorded a dance
tune with the Yellow Hammers,

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.980
though it just says the
Georgia Yellow Hammers

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.680
because the recording industry
didn't like integration.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.840
But you can hear that
integrated sound in a lot

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.770
of the Yellow Hammers' music.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.190
And I'm drawn to that a lot.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.770
And we like to do that
kind of stuff.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.630
&gt;&gt; And for me, it's fascinating

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.770
because Lead Belly
recorded it as well.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:21.480
And I think when I first heard
folk songs, which would be 1948,

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.330
at Woodstock, New York, and
this guy Rod Hill sang Oh, Mary,

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.500
Don't You Weep as part of
the group singing thing.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.790
And then you'd hear it
sung at summer camps.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:33.500
I was going to ask the audience,
how many of you folks heard this

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.360
at a singalong at a
campfire with marshmallows?

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.710
[ Laughter ]

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.200
&gt;&gt; I don't know where
that video comes --

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:46.890
there's a really early video from
maybe the 20s or 30s of like,

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:54.260
some guys, like five people
sitting out in the field.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.560
Do you know the one
I'm talking about?

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.230
One guy is just playing tenor
banjo, and they all sing.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.530
&gt;&gt; It may be a [inaudible] short

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.200
that they would have played
before a feature in the 20s.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] released a collection

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.970
that has some incredible footage
including this band that's like,

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.660
a real string band.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.960
&gt;&gt; They sang the song?

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it was great.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.790 position:56%
That's the first time I think I
heard an old recording of that song.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.390
Saw it on YouTube.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.690
&gt;&gt; Saw it on YouTube.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.890
How about Justice Begley
[assumed spelling]?

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:27.430
That was nice pulling that
out from 1937 Kentucky.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I love that recording.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:37.910
I kind of came up with my own
version based on that recording.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:43.610
And the lyrics to that song
have always intrigued me.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:48.540
So I just kind of wanted
to make it my own.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.880
&gt;&gt; Can you talk about
how you do that,

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.180
how would you make it your own?

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.550
What's different about
yours and his?

00:13:53.550 --> 00:14:00.490
&gt;&gt; I guess because he does a
picking style on that recording,

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:05.960
and I changed it just
to claw hammer.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:13.000
So that's one way that I arrive
at new versions sometimes,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.970
is just translating
a different style

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:22.210
of picking or something to a song.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:28.260 position:56%
And then it just becomes totally
different from the original version.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.300
&gt;&gt; I remember I once
pursued Alan Lomax.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.600
I mean, I didn't I run after him.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.080
But he had all of these
wonderful recordings

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.730
from Kentucky '37 and '39 maybe.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:44.590
I said, "But I don't know
anything more about the musicians.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.520
You never interviewed them,
you didn't write about them."

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.290
He says, "Because I was under
pressure from the Library

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.730
of Congress to make more, they
wanted more and more recordings.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.210
So I didn't have time to."

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.300
Which is fascinating because
some of those recordings,

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.500
the ones that stimulate us the
most, have some of the most active,

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.680
lively stuff from Kentucky.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.690
And the bureaucratic
decisions that had the pressure

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.490
on the Alan not to spend more time.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.820
So we don't know anything
more about Justice Begley.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.560
So how do you know
that he was a sheriff?

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.860
&gt;&gt; You told me.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.160
&gt;&gt; Oh, OK.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.460
[ Laughter ]

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I must have read it in the notes.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.060
&gt;&gt; Oh, there's a great
picture of him where he's --

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.370
&gt;&gt; There's some information about
him, but yeah, it's not a lot.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.670
&gt;&gt; We have a folder on him.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.610
You're welcome to check it out.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:32.910
And I'll say with this,

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:37.290
the '37 Kentucky stuff
is about to go up online.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.920
We're working with Berea
College and University

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.220
of Kentucky to put it all up.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.480 position:56%
And so pretty soon you'll be able to
stream all of your Justice Begley.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.510
&gt;&gt; Are you trying to
put us out of business?

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:55.040
[ Laughter ]

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.640
&gt;&gt; So a little clear rock.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.940
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.240
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.540
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.840
&gt;&gt; Sugarland.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.140
I think he was at Sugarland.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.440
&gt;&gt; Right. Yeah.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.530
He says it, I think,
at the beginning.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:16.820
&gt;&gt; Do you know where you got
a hold of that recording?

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.120
&gt;&gt; It was --

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.090
&gt;&gt; Don't say document records.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.280
&gt;&gt; I don't know if it was.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.120
[Inaudible] like the
Black Texicans thing.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.720
&gt;&gt; So it was the Rounders.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Rounders.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.730 position:56%
Yeah, the Black Texican compilation.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.160
&gt;&gt; Did Alan ever sing that song?

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.990
I've got a hunch he did.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.290
&gt;&gt; Alan Lomax?

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:37.890
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.730
&gt;&gt; Every once in while he'd try
to sing from the Texas sessions.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:44.030
It was both really
exciting and kind of scary.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.040
[ Laughter ]

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love those songs.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:55.810
I think he also recorded that
I heard, what song was it?

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.360
Oh, yeah. He also recorded
Barbara Allen,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.090
which I thought was
really interesting.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.520
Right? I think he does it.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.480
Yeah. He recorded a
version of Barbara Allen,

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.320
which I thought was
really interesting.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.890
I don't know.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:15.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I guess between
he and Ironhead Baker,

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.100
there was a big repertoire there

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.770
that the Lomaxes recorded
again and again.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:27.300
&gt;&gt; I'm interested in
this Stone's Rag.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.600
&gt;&gt; Stones Rag.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.200
&gt;&gt; That was a new one for me.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.110
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.550
&gt;&gt; Where did that one come from?

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.830
&gt;&gt; That's another one
off an old commercial 78,

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:44.480
but it got into the library through
the Ramblers, as far as I know.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.780
Who did that?

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.080
Do you recall?

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.380
Where did we get that?

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:53.090
&gt;&gt; Paul Womack and his string band.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.510
&gt;&gt; I don't think they recorded
very much, maybe only one record.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.030
&gt;&gt; Where would you
have got that, John?

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.570
Where did the Ramblers get that?

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.230
You would have heard it from
a collector or something?

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we collected
from collectors.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:11.210
But I remember when the Ramblers
did it, it was a big show tune

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:15.300
because Mike was playing harmonica
and autoharp at the same time,

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.440
and they were all driving
it very hard.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.400
Because we had used it to break
up the monotony of our set.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:29.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, you all did that
to an extent in the instrument swap,

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:34.870
which could be a comedy routine,
as I'm sure it is sometimes.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:36.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.040
&gt;&gt; But that also seemed to be
a hallmark of the Ramblers,

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.720
the changing instruments.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.650
Is that something you've
always done?

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We all play
a few instruments

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.970
and we all play them a
little bit differently.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.540
Or you might come in to our
rehearsal or band practice

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.720
with an arrangement in mind and
you want to play instrument,

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.770 position:56%
which forces somebody else to play
a different instrument or something.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:02.180
However it shakes out, end
up switching instruments.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.480
&gt;&gt; I've been fascinated
with the idea

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.860
of each chair has an instrument,

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.030
then we have to move
around chair to chair.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.040
[ Laughter ]

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would do that.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.880
&gt;&gt; John, where did
you [inaudible] that?

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.860
Was that just a function
of your own musicianship

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.090
or is that a string
band tradition as well?

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.290
&gt;&gt; No, I think because
essentially, in a way,

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.580
these guys have been more
themselves the Ramblers.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.440
They're like a library.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:38.900
So we couldn't separate the song
from the sound that we heard.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.490
And so to make it come
into existence,

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.180
it was like you had
to get to the sound.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:50.640
It wasn't just another tune, it was
this instrument with that quality.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:56.330
The same group of us, if
we do a Charlie Poole song,

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.520
we all change our style a little
bit, and it fits together.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.580
But those guys in the old
days on the old record,

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.040 position:56%
they didn't switch styles like this.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:09.070
&gt;&gt; I think also part of
us does do that, though.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:15.470
Because we'll take, yeah, and
old song that is from a record

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.860
and sounds a certain way,

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:23.760
and sometimes we'll just play
it a little more like we play.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.770
I think there's both.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.240
&gt;&gt; Well, I've been a bad
influence on you guys.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.540
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.850
&gt;&gt; Well, even before you were here,
you know, they just played tunes

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.430
and they sounded like --
what did we call them?

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:37.730
The Dustbusters.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.030
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.330
&gt;&gt; It sounded like the Dustbusters.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.130 position:56%
And then I came along, now they
sound like the Down Hill Strugglers.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:47.670
&gt;&gt; Well, on the other hand, the New
Lost City Ramblers always sounded

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:51.470
like the New Lost City
Ramblers, despite --

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.030
&gt;&gt; That's not an insult.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.040
[ Laughter ]

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.140
&gt;&gt; Well, just for the record,
whose instrument was whose?

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.440
I'm trying to figure out.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.740
I couldn't figure it out.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.210
You know, obviously you're
playing your fiddle, I get that.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.380
That was probably your little --
was it a [inaudible] or something?

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:11.000
&gt;&gt; A lot of the instruments are
mine, the guitar and the banjo,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.950
and the mandolin, and the
banjo ukulele were mine.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.090
&gt;&gt; If he left the band,
we'd be in serious trouble.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.160
[ Laughter ]

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.670
&gt;&gt; Or you could just
leave instruments

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.210
in different cities and --

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:24.510
&gt;&gt; That would be nice.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.340
&gt;&gt; -- you wouldn't have to travel.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.890
&gt;&gt; Like Chuck Berry.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:31.060
&gt;&gt; Then we could hitch.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:36.550
&gt;&gt; Buffalo Skinners, that's
a pretty straightforward one.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:43.690
I want to talk about
Rolling Mills a little bit.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:47.880
And you suggested, John,
when you made the field,

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.620
this is a John Cohen
field recording, right?

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:51.920
You learned from it.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.630
And I think you said that you
hadn't heard any other recording

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:56.930
of that particular song.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:01.870
&gt;&gt; Right. And until I had been
singing it, most people said

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:03.910
that they never heard
any other versions of it.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.660
At lunch just now, we were talking
about other songs that have mention

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.360
of Rolling Mills, but none of
them had that strange story.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:17.400
Actually, somebody after
the show asked me about was

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.500
that a metaphor, or
how does that fit?

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.450
How does the Rolling Mills fit into
this guy wanting to blow his brains

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:28.120
and his girlfriend is
pregnant and all of that?

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.220
He sings about it, you know,
"Put a bullet through my head,"

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.720
and all of that kind of stuff.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.860
And then he sings, "The
rolling mills are burning down,

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.740
and they'll never bring
them back anymore."

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:43.070
So it's some really strange,
beautiful, poetic correspondence.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.950
But I really like the fact
that you can't pin it down.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.980
It's so good that you
can't pin it down.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.280
It's better that way.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.820
&gt;&gt; The tuning?

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.120
What was the tuning?

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.450
&gt;&gt; You take a regular old
D tuning, you run this --

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.450
&gt;&gt; You tuned it, didn't you?

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:06.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.840
&gt;&gt; Well, I can do it, but
I can't remember the names.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.350
&gt;&gt; Well, I can just say
quickly, yeah, that the tuning

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:18.450
for Rolling Mills is
the F sharp DEAD tuning.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:24.630
F Sharp, D-E-A-D from
fifth down to first.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:28.100
As John was saying,
it's like a D tuning

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.610
but with a third string
at E instead of F sharp.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.460
OK, that's all I've got to say.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.500
&gt;&gt; Is it the third string or the
second string that you run down?

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.240
&gt;&gt; It's the third string, I think.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.550
&gt;&gt; Whatever it is, you get a bass
note which you wouldn't otherwise.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.330
And you can also do a hammer on.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:52.640 position:56%
You hit that open string and you can
strike down on it so you get more --

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.490
I used to think that these guys
like George Landers' banjo tunings

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.270
and his tunes were some

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.770
of the strangest little
turns and twists in them.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.600
But the more I live with that and
listen to the way he sings them,

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.610
he's describing what he's singing.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.340
He's describing all of the
turns and twists in his voice.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:15.480
If you listen to his
Cumberland Gap, he plays it three

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.240
or four different ways,
and it makes sense.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:24.010
It's not like -- you know
what I'm talking about?

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:29.360 position:56%
It's like he takes the idea that's
within the song or within his voice,

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.880
and makes it come out on the banjo.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.180
It's a sound thing.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, have any of you
learned that song from John

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.300
and can play it yourselves?

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.900
&gt;&gt; Oh, I can't.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.200
&gt;&gt; I never heard that.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.680
&gt;&gt; I can.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.610
&gt;&gt; That would be cool
if we could all play it.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.140
&gt;&gt; Or just have it just play
simultaneously [inaudible] turned

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.940
away from each other.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.040
[ Laughter ]

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.440
&gt;&gt; Leather Britches.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.010
Nice quip on that one.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.310
[ Laughter ]

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.610
Let's move on.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:05.910
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:07.210
&gt;&gt; Moonshiner.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.510
Yeah, that's Daw Henson, right?

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:13.950
You're saying that really
low in your register.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.590
Have you always done it that way?

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.820
It's really low.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.270
&gt;&gt; I think back in the day when
I first was attracted to it.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.560
You know, I'm surrounded
by Mike and Tom and Tracy,

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.950
and they all have high voices.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.190
And Roscoe has a higher voice.

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.400
[Inaudible], hey, a low voice.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.700
&gt;&gt; Daw Henson.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.190
&gt;&gt; And I have a low voice.

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:41.770
But I haven't don't it for so many
years, and so I was very nervous.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:45.670
These guys were telling
me it sounded good,

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:49.030
so I might do it again.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.470
But it's even hard to remember
how I tuned it back then

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.370
or how -- it's retuning.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:26:00.810
And it's got an incessant,
insistent beat.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:07.590
It close to Daw Henson's, but I can
see where I don't do what he did.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.390
I found some other
thing to do with it.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:14.100
But it's totally in
respect to what he did,

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:20.850
which is like I can say I can't
do what he did, but I can try.

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:22.250
I said try.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:27.360
&gt;&gt; Similar to what you were
saying about George Landers,

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:32.720
how his vocalization and
everything reflected the song,

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:38.790
I felt like that was your
performance of Moonshiner,

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:42.890
it was right for -- I've
never heard it like that.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.190
It was right for the song.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.490
I thought it was great.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.710
&gt;&gt; I mean, years ago, I
think I said it on the stage

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:51.960
that Bob Dylan had told me how
much he liked my version of it.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.220
And I didn't remember
that I recorded it.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.890
Which means that in '62
when Bob came to New York,

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.630
and that's when I recorded it,

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.800
that he must have heard
our records from back then.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:10.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What about this fiddle
tune you got from Clay Walters?

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.560
Was that the Riding
Cowboy or something?

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.160
&gt;&gt; Is that the right name?

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, that's the name.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:19.110
I know it's an accurate name.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.050
&gt;&gt; OK. Because I couldn't quite
remember if it was Walters

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:24.270
or Williams, or Watson,
or something like that.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.570
I think it's Walters.

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:32.660
But yeah, he sings just on the
company, and it's a beautiful,

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.640
I mean, it's kind of a cowboy
song really, it's more just kind

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:44.650 position:56%
of a being away from home song, but
you know, with the cowboy all in it.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:49.260
And then Frank Jenkins, who was
a great banjo player and fiddler,

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.800
there's a record of him
fiddling that and singing.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.500
But Clay Walters has
some different words

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.800
that Frank Jenkins doesn't,
so I sing it like him.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.100
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.660
&gt;&gt; And some of those words enter

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.380
into Roscoe Hawkins'
[assumed spelling] song,

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.880
Cross the Rocky Mountain.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.080
"I'll never get my mother's looks.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.810
God bless her sweetly smile.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:13.910 position:56%
And even across the Rocky Mountains,
I walk from mile to mile."

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:15.210
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:16.510
&gt;&gt; So I'm getting a
hunch that Roscoe,

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:19.010
who said he wrote his version of
it, really picked it up from one

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:20.310
of these [inaudible] versions.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.610
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:23.480
&gt;&gt; It came from a ballad
or something that he heard.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.080
&gt;&gt; That's not surprising.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.560
You ever dig into the
Luther Strong recordings

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.480
from Kentucky as well
and [inaudible]?

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.900
There's some amazing fiddle music.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.580
I'm interested to hear the ones

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.970
that are being released are
Nathan Salsburg's Speed Corrected.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:45.710
So I think for the first time,
I'm going to hear some of those

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:51.520
in a different way because
the electricity was bad

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.820
[inaudible] recording.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:58.220
Maybe we'll learn whole new things
about [inaudible] or something.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.520
&gt;&gt; Wow

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.360
&gt;&gt; I mean, I just remember this.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.660
My brain retains things
in a strange way.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:09.450
Because when I in Kentucky in
1959 and recording people there,

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.750
I didn't know who was coming next.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:14.420
And there was this old guy, James
Crase who played the fiddle.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.380
And he played some
pretty interesting,

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.780
weird tunings and odd timing.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:26.190
Certainly in the back of my head,
the name Luther Strong came up,

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:31.080
and I had no idea why, because
I didn't look that carefully

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.590
at record labels back then.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:38.040
So I said to him, "Did you
ever hear of a Luther Strong?"

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:46.520
"Oh, we played a lot of fiddle
contests, me and Luther."

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.030
Suddenly it was connected.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:56.160 position:56%
And I didn't know how my brain could
remember this guy playing a sound

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.050
and my brain connected it to
the Library of Congress record.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:03.630
I don't know, to me, it's a wonder.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:09.410
&gt;&gt; The Battle on the Horseshoe.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:14.030
You played banjo.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.310
That was nice.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:21.680
You talked a lot about
where you got it.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.800
You gave a plug to Sidney
Robertson and that was nice.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.100
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.400
&gt;&gt; Because I think that
may have been the trip

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.610
where she was driving
for John A. Lomax.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:31.910
&gt;&gt; She was?

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.920
&gt;&gt; On one of those
trips, she was his driver.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:40.710
And two different people never
sat in a car for that long.

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:43.320 position:56%
So that would have been interesting.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.400
&gt;&gt; Should have made
field recordings of that.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.300
&gt;&gt; I almost interrupted,
but I thought the thread

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.530
of your thought was
much more interesting.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:56.450
But she married Henry Cowell, who
among other things, was the editor

00:30:56.450 --> 00:31:01.380
of the International Folk
-- material on folkways.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.030
But he's also a student
of Charlie Sieger's back

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.940
in Berkeley back in 1910.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.330
And he also became
John Cage's teacher

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:12.470
because he explored
banging on the piano.

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:15.450
So you have experimental music and
you have all of these things kind

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:19.860
of flowing together rather than
being in separate categories.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:25.730
I love that fact, you know,
how these things overlap.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:30.680
&gt;&gt; No, we shouldn't overlook that.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:37.070
And I mean, if one were to
describe your career, John,

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:42.550
I would say here's a man who
takes different disciplines

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:48.180 position:56%
and different aspects of disciplines
and somehow makes them one,

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:54.300
makes them -- you're a disruptive
force for positive change

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.050
in the world through your art.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:59.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I'm surrounded by
three other guys who are that way,

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.760
they just haven't let
it come out as much yet.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:08.480
&gt;&gt; No, I know Eli, and
I know he's the same.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.780
Oh, let's see.

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.590
Wait, he puts on a folk festival,
he works for the record label.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:14.890
&gt;&gt; True.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:16.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; He performs, he produces records.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:23.990 position:56%
I'm going to guess that you guys are
similarly diverse in your approach.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:25.580
And why is this?

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.110
What are you doing all of
this different stuff for?

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.410
Are you high?

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Good question.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.130
For the money.

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:37.160
[ Laughter ]

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:46.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I've always just
wanted to try to create change

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.200
in the culture of New York City.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.110
I always wanted to -- see, the
kind of stuff I do, I always wanted

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:55.170
to have a space for that and see

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.250
that happening, so I
just did it myself.

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:06.820 position:56%
And I've been working on it for
about ten or 15 years at this point.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:10.580
And during that period,
I have seen a change.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.110
When I was growing up,
there was not much going

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:18.830
on in the mid to late
90s/early 2000s.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.320
And now there's quite a nice quote,

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.030
folk music scene going
on in New York.

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:28.310
We have the Brooklyn Folk
Festival that I do with the people

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.680
at the Jalopy Theatre,
the main venue there

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.120
in New York there, the Jalopy.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.830 position:56%
And then I also put on the
Washington Square Park Folk Festival

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:41.270
when they expand up to Cambridge
and do a Cambridge Folk Festival.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:44.400
The Jalopy has its own record
label that I've kind of taken

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.130
over at least at this point,
Jalopy Records, and we're putting

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.580
out this Library of Congress album
that's going to be very nice,

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:54.520
that'll be out in a few months.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:58.520
Yeah, I mean, I have this band
and we go on tour and play.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.960
There's very few touring string
bands, even in this day and age.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:08.380 position:56%
I mean, there's a lot of string
bands that play locally or just play

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:12.370
at home, or people
that go to festivals

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:14.920
and have huge just
a moment sessions.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.530
But there's very few
touring string bands,

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:19.460
and there's very few
string bands that focus

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.830
on the songs to a large extent.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:26.560
But the fiddle tunes kind of
took over and also got kind

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.780
of bastardized in some ways.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.790
So that's part of what I
feel that we're trying to do,

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.990
is to bring the diversity
of the music,

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:39.160
and the songs also, out to people.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:43.170 position:56%
Because if you like music like this,

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.860
you don't get to see it
live really almost ever.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.920
&gt;&gt; And people do now have
a chance in New York,

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.510
and that's thanks to Eli here.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:56.500
There's a lot of people who play --
I mean, there are a lot more people

00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:00.450
that I was ever aware of,
there are lot more people

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:06.660
in the country playing great
American music nowadays,

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:10.380
or maybe I've just gotten to
meet them in the last few years.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.970
But you know, thanks to Eli,

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:19.800
people like them can get
work in New York at least.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:25.900 position:56%
So he's brought a lot of great
musicians to New York also traveling

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.200
for these folk festivals.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.090
&gt;&gt; If you play music like we do,

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.560
it's possible to know almost
everybody in the country

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:39.190
that does more or less what we
do, and we know them pretty much.

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:40.490
&gt;&gt; I think so.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:42.350
&gt;&gt; I hope there are more that
we don't, that would be great.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.650
&gt;&gt; I think there are.

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:45.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Well, because all of these people

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.530
that we're meeting
-- sorry, go ahead.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:51.460
&gt;&gt; I'm always meeting new
people, even now that play.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.760
&gt;&gt; And they're young.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.060
Well, that's the thing.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.120
&gt;&gt; There are people
coming up [inaudible].

00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:00.290
&gt;&gt; We keep meeting like, 19- and
20-year olds that are really great.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:01.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:04.120
&gt;&gt; But there's almost
no place to play.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.830
There's no radio play, there's no
record companies, there's no --

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.230
&gt;&gt; That's kind of good.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:14.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; -- festivals, there's no
infrastructure for the music at all.

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:15.830
Maybe that's good.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:17.190
It's a mixed bag.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.740
&gt;&gt; Well, the festivals is good.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:24.320
&gt;&gt; But you know, I mean, in a
sense, maybe it's good and right

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:29.200
that the music should exist
below the radar of anything.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:35.630
On the other hand, it's nice to
have it have some recognition

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:38.970
because without recognition,
people put it away or put it down.

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:42.170
&gt;&gt; Well, that's what so great
about today and yesterday.

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:43.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.490
&gt;&gt; Us and the Pope, I
mean, that's [inaudible].

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:49.190
&gt;&gt; And also to have, you know,
musicians want to play for people

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:56.810
and have access to playing at a
festival or something like that.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:37:01.090
So that's in a big way,
that's what I'm doing.

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:07.440
&gt;&gt; And another really interesting
really component of this, you know,

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.860
Eli can talk about what he does
and you can talk about what I do.

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:14.870 position:56%
But what these guy do, like after --

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:17.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Jackson, what
are you working on now?

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.620
&gt;&gt; Trying to learn a
bunch fiddle tunes.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:23.450
I mean, I'm just playing the music.

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:24.970
I love it.

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:30.940
And then I make a living a
little bit repairing instruments

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.970
at Jalopy in New York.

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:37.870
So I spend some days
in the workshop there.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:44.270
But yeah, just trying to keep
music at the center of my life.

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:49.160
&gt;&gt; Are you planning on
any recordings coming out

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.360
or anything people
can look forward to?

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.420
&gt;&gt; Well, it looks like we're
going to go spend some time

00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:00.070
in New Orleans this winter
and hopefully record.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:04.310
Just the three of us and
with some of our friends.

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:06.440
&gt;&gt; New Down Hill Strugglers
record will come out eventually.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:14.910
&gt;&gt; And I play in a few other bands
in New York, just playing parties

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:21.340
and shows here and there, and all
kinds of music, like jug band music

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.780
and blues, things like that.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.010
&gt;&gt; But Walker is also a
sculptor and a painter.

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:30.410
&gt;&gt; Used to be.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:31.710
&gt;&gt; What?

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.010
&gt;&gt; Used to be.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.310
&gt;&gt; Used to be.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.980
Well, used to be means
might be again.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.400
After we played in
Michigan recently,

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.570
I kind of did an ethnographic
study following these guys

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:48.010
around down the basement of a
video parlor, and all of those --

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:49.310
[ Laughter ]

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:51.660
&gt;&gt; -- pinball games and
all of the flashing lights.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.330
&gt;&gt; I thought we were
just hanging out.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.940
I didn't know you were up to that.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.730
&gt;&gt; No, we hung out further than
I could hang out because I'm old.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:04.710
But they're really
experts of hanging out.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.900
We're too busy doing things.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.980
They know how to hang out.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.280
&gt;&gt; We play pool a lot.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.580
&gt;&gt; You play pool.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:15.340
&gt;&gt; What did you think of
Walker's Lost Indian, John,

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.320
the performance today of --
that's what it was called?

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.620
&gt;&gt; I'll leave for a second.

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:20.920
&gt;&gt; No, no, no.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.220
[ Laughter ]

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.320
&gt;&gt; Oh, the one that
came from Wade Ward?

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.940
&gt;&gt; Well, it was beautiful.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:30.530
It was the only thing that
we played here that was soft.

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:34.270
In the whole set, it
was the only soft,

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.940
elegant music, and
I really liked that.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:41.920
It made me feel guilty about all
of the hard stuff we were doing.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.020
And it was a great honor to have
him pick up on that recording

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.190
that I had made of Wade Ward.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:54.820
And then there was this subtle
remark about the change of titles.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.120
&gt;&gt; I missed that.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.420
Tell me.

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.720
&gt;&gt; Good. Well, just miss it.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.260
[ Laughter ]

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.560
&gt;&gt; No.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.860
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:06.600
&gt;&gt; I don't know how it all
came about, but I was talking

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:12.440
to another great folklorist
and just amazing player,

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:16.730
Pat Conti, who lives in New York.

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:25.460
And he really digs deep when it
comes to finding out about sources

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:34.710
and just folklore basically
from back then.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:42.120
And he said that tune
that John recorded,

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:48.550
which John calls Half Shaved,
is actually Lost Indian,

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:53.300
and that there's another banjo
tune by the name of Half Shaved --

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.600
&gt;&gt; That Wade Ward does.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.900
&gt;&gt; -- that Wade Ward does.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.200
And he played it for me.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.340
I don't know where he heard
that, but it's in the same tune.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.960
&gt;&gt; And the only reason
I call it Half Shaved is

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.710
because that's what Wade called it.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:05.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.740
&gt;&gt; But Half Shaved is
only half the title.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:10.670
And we tried to say where did you
learn it, but that [inaudible].

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:13.910
He learned it from his
brother who had learned it

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:16.480
from a guy from West Virginia.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.230
So it's all over the map.

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:25.570
And I think it was Mike and
myself who reduced the title

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:29.100
to Half Shaved, and then
it took off as that.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.220
And then Pat came and
[inaudible] proved us

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:36.040
to be falsifiers or
liars [inaudible].

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.340
&gt;&gt; Corruptors.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.730
&gt;&gt; Corruptors, yeah.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:48.120
&gt;&gt; But that's been going on
since the beginning, where a tune

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:54.050
or a song gets turned
into something else.

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:59.160
It's like the game, Telephone,
where you hear something different

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.980
and then it changes slightly.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:10.910
I think that's like the folklore
tradition, as well as songwriting.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:19.190
People sort of overlook that
there wasn't songwriting going on.

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:27.080
And fiddle tune writing as
well as learning from someone,

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.670
people were also creating.

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:36.940
So the tradition is to create
new things, in my opinion.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.170
&gt;&gt; And you know, what's intriguing
about the tune is the way

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:42.070
that fifth string is tuned down.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:43.370
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:45.040
&gt;&gt; It puts in a sound, it's a sound

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.750
that goes every way,
everybody plays it.

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.860
Because I think people, we're
attracted to it for the sound.

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.300
And the title is just
stuff you can talk about.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.390
But the sound is what's special.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:59.050
&gt;&gt; What's the tuning?

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:03.840
&gt;&gt; It's C tuning with the drone
string down to E, I think.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.030
&gt;&gt; Run the strings for me.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:08.780
&gt;&gt; E high string.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:17.660
&gt;&gt; No, E, C, G, C, D. From
the fifth to the first, right?

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:18.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.260
&gt;&gt; OK. Nice.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.680
I wonder if, you know, you're
a multi-instrumentalist,

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:27.250
and John says that you're also
a multi-format kind of person.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:29.800
Does that help you be adaptable?

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:41.190
As you were saying, you're learning
new music, you're passing it on.

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:45.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The reason I brought
up songwriting and stuff,

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:52.200
I try to do that to like, write
new fiddle tunes and stuff

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.180
that comes directly
out of the tradition,

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:05.000
and have a totally new
song that sounds old.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.110
It's fun to do that.

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:10.140
&gt;&gt; And then you've got
to sneak that stuff in,

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:13.690
otherwise people are
like, "Oh, a new tune."

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:16.090
You've got to sneak
it in so then it gets

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:17.980
into the drinking water,
and then people learn.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:22.820
&gt;&gt; Well, I fear that we've
got our own momentum now,

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:27.020 position:56%
and it's burying some of the private
things that each of us is doing.

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.040
But that's just an endless dilemma.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.720
I know sometimes when Walker
plays his fiddle, [inaudible],

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.590
"Where did you learn
that," and he made it up.

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:38.850
And I say wow, that's just right.

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:41.970
I think there's a lot of
future with these guys

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:45.710
that hasn't been fully explored.

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:48.440
It will come out if
you last that long.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.230
If you last that long,
I don't have to.

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:56.090
&gt;&gt; Katy Hill to end the
show, big rousing number.

00:44:56.090 --> 00:45:00.830
[Inaudible] not quite
the same lineup

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:05.470
of instruments that
you started with.

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:11.670
So you've permuted to different
lineup from the beginning.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:13.560
What's the source of Katy Hill?

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:19.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; That's a major national fiddle
tune, but in terms of at the Library

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.320
of Congress, Marcus
Martin recorded it.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:26.540
&gt;&gt; There's another good
one that -- I'm sorry.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.350
Yeah. But there's a
number of versions.

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:30.630
&gt;&gt; Well, I guess I meant what's
your version, do you know,

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:32.380
or is it just something
you've known for a long time?

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:35.230
&gt;&gt; I actually, somebody taught
that to me at a square dance

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:38.360
that I was playing this summer.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.980
But I had heard the tune before.

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.800
&gt;&gt; And it's also known as --

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.410
&gt;&gt; It's also just like,
Sally Johnson.

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:46.710
&gt;&gt; Oh, Sally.

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:49.020
Yeah. And that's also in the
library under Sally Johnson.

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.320
&gt;&gt; The Reeds --

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.200
&gt;&gt; Henry Reed and Sally Johnson.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.500
Yeah.

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:56.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; But yeah, it's just one of the --

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:59.230
&gt;&gt; It's a different note in
there that makes it [inaudible].

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:00.530
&gt;&gt; They claim they're different.

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:01.830
They're different.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:04.000
&gt;&gt; The fiddlers will always
claim they're different tunes.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.080
And I could show you
why they're different.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:10.430
&gt;&gt; And the first time I ever heard
it was Mike [inaudible] was working

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:13.510
on his album [inaudible]
bluegrass style.

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:17.120
And just, "Come on, John, you
can play backup with this fiddler

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.730
in New Jersey, a guy
named Tex Logan."

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:21.970
And I had never heard
of bluegrass fiddling.

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:24.020
This was so fast, and
it was Katy Hill.

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:27.460
And Mike moving on the banjo,
and they were whirling.

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.480
"John, you play the
guitar behind it."

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.440
I didn't know what the
bluegrass licks were,

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:33.150
I didn't know any of that stuff.

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:35.530
So I was just winging
it on the guitar.

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:39.460
And I found myself doing
Riley Puckett runs,

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.000
which is from the Skillet Lickers.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.360
&gt;&gt; And they do Katy
Hill pretty well.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.660
&gt;&gt; Do they do it [inaudible]?

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.960
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.260
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah?

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.890
&gt;&gt; So they just figured you knew
a different version of it, right?

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:53.410
&gt;&gt; They say at the beginning
of the record, they say like,

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:56.610
"Some people call this Sally
Johnson, but down south,

00:46:56.610 --> 00:47:00.500
we call it Katy Hill," and
then they kick into it.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bill Monroe -- I'm not sure if he
recorded it, but he used to play it

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.390
on shows with a lot of drive.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:08.710
So as a matter of fact,
the way we did it today,

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:13.630
and also Leather Britches,
to me, these guys together

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:17.150
with so much force into my ear,

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:22.420
that it's a fair match
for any bluegrass band.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.960
The energy level that
we just get into.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.950
But that's also a thanks
to the good sound

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:29.890
and good vibes from the audience.

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:34.030
If it's wet blankets, we
give them soapy towels.

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:36.040
[ Laughter ]

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.440
&gt;&gt; And then to everyone's
great surprise,

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:42.190
you pulled out Emmett
Lundy as the encore.

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:43.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:45.050
&gt;&gt; It seemed surprising
to you as well.

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:49.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Because we had just played -- I
didn't know that these guys knew it,

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:50.470
and then we found it
out in the greenroom.

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:54.810
And it's a lovely, lovely tune,
and it's got great challenges,

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:57.510
all those beautiful
little notes in it.

00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:59.510
I think we're going to
play it some more and more.

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:01.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:04.210
&gt;&gt; Emmett Lundy recorded as a
part of the road research project

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:09.290
in 1941 My Mother's Down in Galax.

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:12.050
I think that's where he got it.

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:15.120
That's a great unknown
body of material,

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.520
so thanks for bringing it up.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.520
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, that's some
of my favorite stuff.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:25.120
&gt;&gt; A member of the Lundy family was
here last week or the week before

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:33.130 position:56%
as part of a symposium for Bell and
Reed, but I didn't get to meet them.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:34.640
So what was the song title?

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.940
&gt;&gt; Ducks on the Mill Pond.

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:37.740
&gt;&gt; Ducks on the Mill Pond.

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:44.040
[ Silence ]

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:48.140
&gt;&gt; So is the roadshow over?

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:49.440
&gt;&gt; Oh, no.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.380
&gt;&gt; I don't think so.

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:55.330
&gt;&gt; No, we'll be at Brooklyn
College on November 11th.

00:48:55.330 --> 00:49:00.570
And onward into the future,
there's no reason to stop.

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:03.040
I'd like to bring it to more
colleges and universities.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.500
It would be nice to reach
some college kids with this.

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:10.820
&gt;&gt; So you're happy
with a successful --

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.120
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.420
Yeah, it's been great.

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:14.720
And I credit you.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.220
I think we were talking
when we thought of it.

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.130
&gt;&gt; Well, my idea was
slightly different.

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:21.560
It was a rolling thunder tour.

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.040 position:56%
[Inaudible] get to play [inaudible].

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.070
[ Laughter ]

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:26.370
I'm not getting credit for it.

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:27.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, I didn't realize that.

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:28.970
I misinterpreted, man.

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:32.620
&gt;&gt; Now we've got to put the
Pope into this thing somehow.

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.960
&gt;&gt; When they asked us to move the
date of the show, I said, "Fine,

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.380
but where is the Pope," you know,

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.110
because I thought he
was going to be here.

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:45.180
&gt;&gt; They wanted him
to go to New York.

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:48.360
So when is your recording coming
out, the Jalopy recording?

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.970
&gt;&gt; It should be out early December.

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:55.900
I just sent it to the plant to
be pressed, so it'll be an LP.

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.740
&gt;&gt; Great. I look forward to that.

00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.340
&gt;&gt; I always love those
Jalopy covers.

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.800
They look just like a 1960s --

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.870
&gt;&gt; Not to disappoint, this
has a different style cover.

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:11.400
But it's nice though,
it's modeled on some

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:15.240
of the old ethnic folkways
covers actually, if we're going

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:18.330
to keep quoting old record covers.

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:22.170
But yeah, the first two Jalopy
records and maybe future ones,

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:24.110
we'll keep stealing your design.

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:26.210
[ Laughter ]

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:28.240
&gt;&gt; What's funny is to sit
here in front of a crowd

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.110
and suddenly remember the
first LP from the Library

00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:32.950
of Congress printed on red vinyl.

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:35.510
We used to hold it up to
the light and go, "Wow."

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:38.040
[ Laughter ]

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.400
&gt;&gt; You know, we have some of
those downstairs if you want

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:43.220
to have a look through them,
you know, anytime, John.

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:44.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.080
&gt;&gt; They can go to my house,
I've got them there also.

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.630
&gt;&gt; Walker, anything
coming up for you?

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:50.980
Are you doing any kind of --

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:52.850
&gt;&gt; Just the band.

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:55.580
We're getting more and more gigs.

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:59.530
&gt;&gt; How often do you guys play?

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:00.830
&gt;&gt; A lot.

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:03.440
&gt;&gt; It's been a busy summer for us.

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:07.960
&gt;&gt; So I got a part-time job
in the city that is good

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:11.020
because I can come and go.

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:15.190
Yeah, I think we're going
to go down to New Orleans

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:17.470
for a little bit, me and Jackson.

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:22.270
They've got that Black
Pot Festival in Lafayette.

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:25.060
&gt;&gt; Check out some Cajun
music and food.

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:28.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Josh Caffery is down
there doing some great work.

00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:30.300
Make sure you check in with him.

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:32.990
&gt;&gt; It's going to be good.

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:36.010
&gt;&gt; John, what's cooking
with [inaudible]?

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:38.010
[ Laughter ]

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:39.310
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:42.660
It's funny, while we were
driving down yesterday,

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.450
and old friend called up,

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:46.280
"I just got your new
[inaudible] book, it's wonderful."

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.670
The one about Bob Dylan
and [inaudible].

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:50.150 position:56%
I said, "Oh, no, that's the old one.

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:52.720
There's another one since then."

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:59.230 position:56%
And the next one after that is going
to be about those years that I was

00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:03.230
in Lower Manhattan in the
middle of the art world.

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:08.280
When I first came back from Peru,
I just settled on Third Avenue

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:11.710
between Ninth and Tenth
Street, because Robert Frank,

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:14.790
who wasn't that famous at
photography yet, he was a friend.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:16.310
So I moved in next door.

00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:17.610
And then you look around

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:20.280
and you find the whole
block is full of artists.

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.800
And then I looked into the history

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.750
of why there were so
many artists there.

00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:27.410
First of all, it was cheap
rent, and the other was

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:31.240
that Willem de Kooning's studio
was right on the same block.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:34.510
So the name of the new book
is Cheap Rents and de Kooning.

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:38.570
[ Laughter ]

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:40.710 position:56%
But that's pretty much in the can --

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:43.320
it's not in the can,
where do they put it?

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.620
&gt;&gt; In the works.

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:45.920
&gt;&gt; In the works.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.220
The works.

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:51.050
And I'm going to try to do a lot
of drawing and get into my studio.

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:54.080
And when I get old, I'll
have something to do.

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.150
[ Laughter ]

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:57.720
&gt;&gt; And maybe a [inaudible] book.

00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.850
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, and a book about
[inaudible] music in Peru.

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:03.890
I may go to Peru two weeks from now

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:06.470
for that film they're
making about me in France.

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:11.740
&gt;&gt; OK. Well, if you need
anybody to come along,

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:16.430
I'm sure you have other volunteers.

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:17.730
&gt;&gt; Get me a grant.

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:19.040
While you're out, get me a grant.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.040
[ Laughter ]

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.690
&gt;&gt; Look, guys, I don't
want to hold you

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:24.790
up because I know you have
had a busy couple of days.

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:28.530
I just want to say once again,
thank you from the Library

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:31.180
of Congress for coming to visit.

00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:35.160
And I hope this is just one
step along the way for us,

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:40.070
and that we'll continue to
influence each other and to build

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:43.320
on each other's work, because
it's a real exciting time.

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.620
And so thanks, guys.

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:45.920
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.830
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:51.490
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
