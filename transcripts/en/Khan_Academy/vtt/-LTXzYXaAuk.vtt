00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.180
In the last video we talked a
little bit about, at least

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.820
potentially, starting
a cupcake factory.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.800
But this is a major investment
that I'm thinking about

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.950
making, so at minimum, I made
a spreadsheet here in Excel

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.455
and it's available at
khanacademy.org/

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:16.705
downloads/cupcakes.xls.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.710
If you just click slash here,
you'll see everything in the

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.550
download directory, but I'm
going to start putting more

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.360
stuff there.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.860
So I encourage you
to play with it.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.760
But this is essentially-- it'll
do all the math for us

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.240
that we did in the
last video, --the

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.160
investment in the factory.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.590
Let's say in the real world,
once I actually got bids from

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.090
contractors and things
like that, it ends up

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.470
costing $1.1 million.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.450
The annual capacity is a million
cupcakes per year.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.290
The cost per cupcake is-- let's
say, I don't know, input

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.070
costs went up for
whatever reason.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.020
Now that I have a computer doing
the math for me, I can

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.440
deal with a little bit
funnier numbers.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.680
So let's say it's $1.05.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.740
The price charged per
cupcake is $2.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.820
Well, actually, it can
be anything, right?

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.470
And so this is going to
be an input field and

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.760
right now it says $2.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.100
Let's say this is what
we assume is how

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.400
many cupcakes we sell.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.680
In this scenario, this is the
income statement, at least as

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.630
far as we get to the operating
income line.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.090
And so it calculates that you
have $2 million of revenue.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.570
Notice what happens
when I change it.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.160
If I sell my cupcakes for a
$1.50 per cupcake, then I only

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.030
have $1.5 million.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.760
So it actually computes what
we need it to compute.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.340
It computes the cost
of goods sold.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.040
If I change the number of
cupcakes, let's see, if

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.150
instead of a million, I sell
five 500,000, it calculates

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.140
everything accordingly.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.040
And in all these scenarios it
tells me my operating income.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.380
And if you go a little bit
lower, it tells me capacity

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.880
utilization.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.740
That's just how many cupcakes I
sold, divided by how many I

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.650
could make.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.450
So it's 50% utilization and
then, my return on asset is my

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.960
operating income divided by my
initial investment, right?

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.300
So this is 275,000 divided by
1.1, it was a minus 25.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.610
So this is actually
a bad outcome.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.919
So in the last one, I touched on
a little bit that the real

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:16.080
lever that I, as the owner
of my cupcake factory,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.320
can change is price.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.230
And then, obviously, if I charge
a lower price more

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.110
people are going to want to
buy my cupcakes and if I

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.260
charge a higher price,
fewer people.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
Allthough, there are some things
that when you charge a

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.510
higher price people think it
must be better so maybe they

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.230
want it, or they want to show
off to their friends, and look

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.810
at this expensive cupcake that
I eat, and it's kind of a

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.410
status symbol.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.860
But for the most part
the lower the price,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.390
the more you sell.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.370
And now we can actually figure
out under what combinations am

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.720
I going to make certain
amounts of money.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.770
So if I charge $1.50 per cupcake
and I'm only able to

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.280
sell 500,000 cupcakes, I'm going
to take a loss per year

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.240
of $275,000.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.100
If I sell them for $1.75 and
if I sell, I don't know,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.570
700,000 cupcakes, I'm almost
at break-even.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.850
So, let's see, you
have to do $1.85.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.790
Here in this situation,
I actually make money.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.410
I have a 5% return on asset.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.760
And, just so you know, this is
a major investment that I'm

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.670
making, $1.1 million.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.400
I actually want to make sure
I understand all of the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.330
scenarios of price and sales.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.070
So what I did is actually
used Excel to do

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.180
a sensitivity study.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.960
So what I did here is I put all
of the-- let me just go to

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.680
that part of the spreadsheet.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.120
And I encourage you to play
with this, because it's

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.750
interesting.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.690
It shows you that even in a
fairly simple business, you

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.770
can do a lot of analysis.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.000
And, if you're in high school
or in middle school, this

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.860
could actually be a fun-- I
don't know if they allow this

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.140
type of thing for science
projects.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.160
But go to a local business and
kind of analyze the business

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.150
in a hundred different ways.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.270
And actually, if you watch the
probability videos, I do all

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.030
those things on [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.400
processes and things
like that.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.720
You can analyze the business and
do Excel spreadsheets and

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.520
you'll probably end up winning
soon. the state science fair.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.740
Call it a math project or
engineering project.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.130
But anyway, here I want
to figure, out what is

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.550
my return on asset?

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.080
So essentially my operating
profit divided by my initial

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.690
investment, depending on the
different prices I might

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.030
charge and the different
quantities.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.640
And here it's kind of hard to
visualize, so I graphed it as

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.800
a three dimensional surface.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.560
3D.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.900
So as you see here, if I charge
$2.80 and I only sell

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.950
300,000, then this is my return
on asset right here.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.070
This curve is actually the
zero curve, right?

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.900
So this is actually my
break-even right here.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.360
So any point along this curve
right here I'm at break-even.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.280
So if I'm at $2.80 per cupcake
and I only sell 300,000, I'm

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.550
at break-even.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.240
Let's see, what is
this right here?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.270
If I sell $1.60 per cupcake and
if I sell 900,000, then

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.870
I'm also at break-even.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.810
So this is my break-even
curve.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.490
This is what I want to avoid.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.850
Everything here is in the
negative, right, according to

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.870
the legend, minus 50% to
zero percent return.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.620
So here I'm losing money and I
would color it in if I wasn't

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.700
in Excel mode.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.520
If I charge $1.60 per cupcake
and I only sell 400,000

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.700
cupcakes, I'm going to have
a negative return.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.030
And we can figure it
out in that little

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.700
worksheet I just did.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.580
But anyway this is fun to look
at and I encourage you

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.040
to play with it.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.710
And it actually shows you that
it's a fairly interesting and

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.110
sophisticated thing, that
you have these two

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.020
variables that change.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.430
And this is about as simple
as a business can get.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.420
You can only imagine what
happens when you start varying

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.500
the other parameters, but these
are the two big ones.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.500
So let's say, when I come out
the gate, I want everyone in

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.380
town to taste my cupcakes.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.980
Because I think, once they taste
it, they'll realize that

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.790
they're delicious.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.800
And by the way, I've also
learned from the cigarette

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.220
companies and I put nicotine
in my cupcake, so I think

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.550
people will become
addicted to it.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.320
So what I do is, I want
to charge a relatively

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.110
low price for it.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.130
Let's say I do come out the gate
at, I don't know, $1.75.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.470
And that's a very cheap
price for cupcakes.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.740
There's actually no cupcake
producers in

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.560
this town right now.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.220
So I just sell out
one, two, three.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.930
I just sell out of cupcakes.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.550
And so I'm making $200,000
per year, that's an

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.190
18% return on asset.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.800
And a lot of people would be
happy with that, but I'm like,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.480
hey, I'm leaving money on the
table because I'm selling out

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.440
of my cupcakes.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.280
So what happens if I raise
my price a little bit?

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.950
I'm fully utilized, right?

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.430
I have 100% utilization.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.650
So it makes sense for me to
see if there's any-- maybe

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.300
there's some people who want
cupcakes, who can't get them

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.600
because I can't produce
that many.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.520
So let me raise my price
a little bit.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.580
Let me say I raise
it to $1.85.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.930
At $1.85 it still turns out
that I'm selling a million

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.850
cupcakes in a year.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.010
Now, I was right.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.490
I was leaving money
on the table.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.380
Now I'm making $300,000
a year.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.400
This seems like a good idea.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.730
I want to see how much people
are willing to pay.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.750
So, let's say, I raise
the price to $2.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.350
But, in that scenario, $2, it
starts to get a little pricey

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.810
for people.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:07.980
It's just kind of a little
sticker shock.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.050
Maybe I should have
done $1.99.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.030
And so I don't sell a million.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.930
I sell 950,000.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.580
There's maybe 50,000 thousand
people in the margin who said,

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.000
hey, you know, I'd buy it at
$1.85 but I'm not willing to

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.650
buy it at $2.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.950
But this still works
out, right?

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.000
I'm still making more money.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.550
Even though I'm selling fewer
cupcakes, because I'm charging

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.700
so much more per cupcake, and
I'm making a 37% return.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.360
Let's say I keep figuring
this out.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.310
And let's say I figured out
the optimal point is me

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.950
charging $3 per cupcake.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.460
And at $3 per cupcake,
I'm able to

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.110
sell you 750,000 cupcakes.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.770
And I make $962,000 a year
and I have a huge

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.180
return on asset, 88%.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.030
Imagine a business or some
investment where you get 88%

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.990
of your money every year.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:02.900
So that's all good and I'm
driving a Bentley and I have

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.600
the biggest house on a hill
in town and all of that.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.230
But other people say,
hey, all Sal's

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.910
doing is making cupcakes.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.840
I can make cupcakes too
and I have some

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.260
money to build a factory.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.720
This is a better return on
investment than the stock

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.350
market or anything else
that I know of.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:24.950
So I'm also going to get into
the cupcake factory business.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.000
And so, here, this is the
second worksheet in this

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.250
spreadsheet.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.250
So let's say, I was
at $1.3 million.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:38.799
I don't know if you
can see this.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.474
Maybe I should zoom
in a little bit.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.166
There you go.

00:08:45.166 --> 00:08:46.110
So this is the same thing.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:50.540
So I said $3 and, 750,000
cupcakes and

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.350
my cost was a $1.05.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.370
So I was making $962,000.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.020
But then Imran-- and just if
you're curious why I wasn't

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.700
recording videos for the last
two weeks, actually Imran is

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.350
the name of my son and he came
into the world two weeks ago,

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.470
and so, I think it makes
sense to name a

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.650
cupcake store after him.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.010
But let's say he comes in, and
he's like, I'm tired of

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.460
getting an allowance
from dad; I also

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.080
want to produce cupcakes.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.800
And he actually has more money
because his grandma gave him

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.550
more money because she likes
him more than her son.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.560
And so he has $1.5 million to
invest because he's like, wow,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.340
this is such a good investment,
let me put more

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.570
money into it. $1.5 million.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.090
He builds a factory that
can produce two

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.180
million cupcakes a year.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.450
And also, it's a more efficient
factory, so it

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.960
actually uses a little less
electricity, and wastes less

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.430
cream and frosting, and, I
guess, nicotine as well.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.660
So the cost per cupcake
is less.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:58.060
And he decides to undercut his
father, so he charges $2.90

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.360
per cupcake.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.210
And when he charges $2.90 per--
everyone just kind of

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.550
runs to him, because his
cupcakes are just as good.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.890
There really wasn't
much of a barrier.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:13.250
So, let's say, he sells
500,000 cupcakes.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:19.190
Then I'm only selling
250,000 at $3.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.510
There's just some people
who like my cupcakes.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:25.080
So I'm pretty much almost
break-even and I say, well,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.060
these are my die-hard fans.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.300
And so, to benefit them-- these
guys aren't going to go

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.150
anywhere else --I'm going to
raise my prices a little bit.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.180
Just because I know that
these guys like me.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.560
At least in that situation,
I'm cutting a profit.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.940
But then I say, well, you know,
this isn't a good state

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.490
of affairs.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.800
He took all my business.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.590
I actually want you to notice
something right here, what

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.240
happened immediately.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.620
I was making an 88% percent
return on my money, right?

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.920
And just when this Imran comes
in, and he enters into the

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.330
space, all of a sudden,
what is the return?

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.732
He's only running at
25% utilization.

00:10:58.732 --> 00:11:02.530
But his return on asset has gone
down to 20-- and, because

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.450
he's at that utilization,
his return on asset has

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.460
gone down to 20%.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.400
And then my return on asset
has gone down to 1%.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.890
So there's a general
theme here.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.410
When someone is doing really
well and getting a really

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.510
great return, it attracts
competition.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.250
It attracts capacity, right?

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.670
And if there's enough demand to
satiate that new capacity,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.320
maybe they will get
a better return.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.910
But in general, over time, if
there's a very favorable

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.510
return, more and more
competition

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.760
will enter the market.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.370
Actually I've run out of
time in the studio.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.620
In the next video, I'll talk
about more scenarios with

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.450
competition.
