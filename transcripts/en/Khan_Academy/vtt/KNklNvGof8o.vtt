00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.452
Voiceover: Teams A, B, and C

00:00:02.452 --> 00:00:04.222
are playing a game of strength.

00:00:04.222 --> 00:00:07.418
Each team has attached
a rope to a metal ring

00:00:07.418 --> 00:00:10.418
and is trying to pull the
ring into their own area.

00:00:10.418 --> 00:00:12.525
Team areas shown below.

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:14.145
Let's see what that's ...

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:15.628
We see that over here team A

00:00:15.628 --> 00:00:17.267
is pulling on the ring in that direction.

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:18.850
Team B is pulling on the
ring in that direction.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.516
Team C is pulling on the
ring in that direction.

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:22.944
They're each trying to get the ring

00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:26.455
into their respective areas,

00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:28.282
it's a three-way tug of war.

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:32.132
They tell us team A pulls
with a force vector a

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:35.462
of four times a unit vector i plus zero j.

00:00:35.462 --> 00:00:38.730
This is four times, there's
no vertical component here

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.103
so it's going straight in the positive,

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:42.931
I guess you can say x direction

00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:44.595
and we can see it right over there.

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:46.711
A is going straight in
the positive x direction

00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:49.146
so just a multiple of the unit vector i.

00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:53.621
Team B pulls with force
vector negative two i

00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:57.211
plus four j, so it's to the left and up.

00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:00.083
We see that negative two i plus four j

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:04.206
then we have team C
pulls with a force vector

00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:06.311
negative three i minus three j.

00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:10.722
Let's see, negative three i minus three j.

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:13.500
Yup that seems consistent
with the diagram.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.258
Forces are given in
kilo newtons, all right.

00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:19.642
Which team will win the game?

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:21.730
Think about which team will win the game

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.134
if you think about which one is pulling

00:01:23.134 --> 00:01:25.518
with the most magnitude
in their directions.

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:27.229
Let me get my little scratch pad out

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.829
and let's think about the magnitudes

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.325
of each of these vectors.

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:34.517
Let's first think about
the magnitude of vector a,

00:01:34.517 --> 00:01:36.355
what is that going to be?

00:01:36.355 --> 00:01:39.798
Well, it's four times the unit vector i,

00:01:39.798 --> 00:01:41.995
so it's just going to
have a magnitude of four.

00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:43.694
The unit vector i has a magnitude of one

00:01:43.694 --> 00:01:45.854
so it's magnitude is just four times that,

00:01:45.854 --> 00:01:47.700
it's magnitude is equal to four.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.984
Let's put the units there,
it's four kilo newtons.

00:01:50.984 --> 00:01:53.646
What about the magnitude of vector b?

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:58.498
We can use a Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:58.498 --> 00:02:03.989
It's negative two i plus four j

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:06.561
so the magnitude squared is going to be

00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:09.629
negative two squared plus four squared

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.961
which is really just coming
out of the Pythagorean theorem.

00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:16.614
The magnitude of vector b is going to be

00:02:16.614 --> 00:02:22.660
equal to the square root of
negative two squared plus four

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.179
or one way to think about this
is the Pythagorean theorem

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.285
or the distance formula between the origin

00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:28.864
and that point right over there.

00:02:28.864 --> 00:02:31.226
Plus four squared, that's four plus 16

00:02:31.226 --> 00:02:33.670
is the square root of 20.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.172
Let's see, this is
definitely greater than four.

00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:37.617
Four squared is just 16,

00:02:37.617 --> 00:02:39.692
this is some place between four and five.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:45.838
Let's see, team C, the
magnitude of vector c same logic

00:02:45.838 --> 00:02:49.239
is going to be the square
root of negative three squared

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.394
plus negative three squared
which is equal to ...

00:02:53.394 --> 00:02:57.643
Let's see this is square root
of 18, right nine plus nine.

00:02:57.643 --> 00:02:59.126
Square root of 18.

00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:01.844
Square root of 20 is clearly larger than

00:03:01.844 --> 00:03:02.780
square root of 18.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.553
We already said that square
root of 20 is larger than four.

00:03:07.506 --> 00:03:09.398
Team B is going to win.

00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:11.019
Which team will win the game?

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.211
Team B, and we can even, let's
just fill it out on our ...

00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.415
Team B is going to win the game.

00:03:18.415 --> 00:03:21.087
Now the next thing they ask us is

00:03:21.087 --> 00:03:23.894
what is the magnitude of
the teams combined forces

00:03:23.894 --> 00:03:25.405
acting on the ring?

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:28.934
To figure that out we can just
add up all of these vectors.

00:03:28.934 --> 00:03:32.379
The combined force, so let's write this.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.636
The force, let's say force
combined, this is a vector

00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:44.747
it's going to be the sum of
vectors a plus vector b plus c

00:03:47.054 --> 00:03:53.489
which is going to be equal
to four i plus zero j,

00:03:55.335 --> 00:04:07.594
minus two i plus four j,
minus three i minus three j.

00:04:07.594 --> 00:04:11.988
Now we can just add up the
i's and add up the j's.

00:04:11.988 --> 00:04:20.228
We have four i minus two i minus three i,

00:04:20.228 --> 00:04:21.652
so four of something minus two

00:04:21.652 --> 00:04:22.759
you're going to have two left.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:23.828
Then you subtract another three

00:04:23.828 --> 00:04:25.352
you're going to have negative one of that,

00:04:25.352 --> 00:04:27.365
so that's going to be equal to negative,

00:04:27.365 --> 00:04:30.650
I could write negative
one i or just negative i

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.427
and then we have zero j
plus four j minus three j

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:40.951
so that's was zero plus four minus three

00:04:40.951 --> 00:04:42.440
is just going to be one j.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.004
Or you can say just plus j.

00:04:45.004 --> 00:04:49.090
That's the resulting vector
here is negative i plus j.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.771
It might look something like this.

00:04:50.771 --> 00:05:00.248
Negative i plus a j, gets us
a vector that looks like that.

00:05:00.248 --> 00:05:02.298
Let me actually draw it
a little bit bigger here.

00:05:02.298 --> 00:05:06.688
If I were to draw our coordinate axis

00:05:06.688 --> 00:05:11.620
that's my y-axis, this is my x-axis.

00:05:14.143 --> 00:05:19.009
It's negative one times i, so
let's say it looks like that

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:20.162
that's negative i.

00:05:20.162 --> 00:05:22.627
That's negative i right over there.

00:05:22.627 --> 00:05:26.119
Negative i, let me write that

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:28.892
that is negative i plus j.

00:05:28.892 --> 00:05:33.910
Plus the j unit vector which
might look something like this

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.465
both of them have a magnitude of one,

00:05:36.465 --> 00:05:38.301
so that is the j unit vector.

00:05:38.301 --> 00:05:41.216
The sum of those two
is our combined force.

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:46.777
Our combined force is going to
be going into this direction.

00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:49.319
Hence this is its magnitude.

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:51.742
The length of it is this
magnitude, combined force

00:05:51.742 --> 00:05:53.242
and that goes in line with

00:05:53.242 --> 00:05:54.920
we're going to be going in that direction

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.998
which takes us to the zone of B.

00:05:56.998 --> 00:05:58.980
They ask us what is the magnitude

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.555
of the teams' combined force?

00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:04.666
Well the magnitude of this side is one,

00:06:04.666 --> 00:06:06.530
it's a unit vector where it's
going to the left direction.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.016
The magnitude of this side is one

00:06:09.016 --> 00:06:10.760
so the magnitude of this side

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.127
we just use a Pythagorean theorem,

00:06:12.127 --> 00:06:15.357
it's a square root of one
squared plus one squared

00:06:15.357 --> 00:06:19.619
which is just the square root of two.

00:06:20.388 --> 00:06:21.804
The magnitude here,

00:06:21.804 --> 00:06:25.907
what is the magnitude of
the teams combined forces

00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:27.330
is square root of two.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.750
In what direction is
the ring getting pulled?

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.774
Actually let me just fill out

00:06:30.774 --> 00:06:33.034
what they've already
asked us so we can ...

00:06:33.034 --> 00:06:35.788
What is the magnitude of
the teams' combined force

00:06:35.788 --> 00:06:36.643
acting on the ring?

00:06:36.643 --> 00:06:37.847
Round to the nearest tenth.

00:06:37.847 --> 00:06:39.647
Let's just write square root of two.

00:06:39.647 --> 00:06:43.175
Square root of two is equal to

00:06:43.175 --> 00:06:46.647
and round to the nearest
tenth 1.4 kilo newtons.

00:06:49.154 --> 00:06:51.873
In what direction is
the ring getting pulled

00:06:51.873 --> 00:06:53.178
and they want this is in radians.

00:06:53.178 --> 00:06:54.988
Round it to the nearest tenth,

00:06:54.988 --> 00:06:57.363
your answer should be between
zero and two pi radians.

00:06:57.363 --> 00:07:00.946
That, go back to our diagram,

00:07:00.946 --> 00:07:05.067
we need to figure out what
this angle is right over here.

00:07:05.067 --> 00:07:07.537
We need to figure out what
that angle is in radians

00:07:07.537 --> 00:07:10.771
and we know that this whole thing

00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:12.514
if we went from the positive x-axis

00:07:12.514 --> 00:07:15.913
all the way to the negative
x-axis that is pi radians.

00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:19.801
We also know what this
angle right over here is.

00:07:19.801 --> 00:07:20.938
How do we know that?

00:07:20.938 --> 00:07:22.449
Well, I've just constructed a ...

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:23.724
Notice this is a right angle

00:07:23.724 --> 00:07:25.690
and this is an isosceles triangle,

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.570
isosceles right triangle.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.467
It's going to be a 45, 45, 90 triangle

00:07:31.467 --> 00:07:33.392
but if you're thinking in terms of radians

00:07:33.392 --> 00:07:35.750
45 degrees is pi over four.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.457
This is pi over four, pi over four,

00:07:39.457 --> 00:07:41.959
pi over two triangle.

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:44.001
Same thing as 45, 45, 90.

00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:46.296
If this whole purple angle is pi

00:07:46.296 --> 00:07:47.494
and this is pi over four,

00:07:47.494 --> 00:07:49.227
you just subtract the
pi over four from the pi

00:07:49.227 --> 00:07:50.685
to get what theta is.

00:07:50.685 --> 00:07:54.168
Theta is going to be equal to ...

00:07:54.168 --> 00:07:58.227
Pi is the same thing as four pi over four

00:07:58.227 --> 00:08:00.441
minus pi over four.

00:08:02.393 --> 00:08:04.120
I just did that to get
a common denominator

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.973
which is equal to three pi over four.

00:08:06.973 --> 00:08:10.473
Three pi over four radians.

00:08:10.473 --> 00:08:12.731
Let's go back over here.

00:08:12.731 --> 00:08:15.170
Now they want us to round
it to the nearest tenth,

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:21.062
so let's take three
times pi divided by ...

00:08:21.062 --> 00:08:23.576
Just to make sure you can
see what I'm doing here

00:08:23.576 --> 00:08:26.075
so three times pi divided by four

00:08:26.075 --> 00:08:32.877
is equal to 2.356, round
it to the nearest tenth

00:08:32.877 --> 00:08:35.532
would be 2.4 radians.

00:08:35.532 --> 00:08:42.407
Approximately 2.4 radians
and we got it right.
