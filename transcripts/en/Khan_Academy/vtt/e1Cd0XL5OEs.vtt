00:00:00.626 --> 00:00:01.908
- [Instructor] In a video game,

00:00:01.908 --> 00:00:06.097
Val scored 30% fewer points than Peeta.

00:00:06.097 --> 00:00:08.264
Peeta scored 1,060 points.

00:00:09.553 --> 00:00:12.003
How many points did Val score?

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.148
Pause this video and see
if you can figure out

00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:16.398
how many points Val scored.

00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:19.381
Alright, now let's do this together.

00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:21.491
And there's a couple of ways
that you could think about it.

00:00:21.491 --> 00:00:25.874
One way to think about is
Peeta scored 1,060 points,

00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:28.236
and Val scored 30% fewer.

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:30.601
When we're saying 30% fewer,

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:33.751
we're saying essentially take 30% of 1060

00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:36.016
and subtract that from 1060.

00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:40.183
So 30%, so we could write
that as a decimal as 0.30.

00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:45.652
30/100 is the same thing as 30%,

00:00:45.652 --> 00:00:48.611
or we could even write this as .3.

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:51.944
And then we would want 30% of 1060.

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:55.076
So if you take Peeta's score

00:00:55.076 --> 00:00:57.702
and then subtract 30% of Peeta's score,

00:00:57.702 --> 00:00:59.469
then this would give you Val's score.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.486
So that's one way to calculate it.

00:01:01.486 --> 00:01:03.469
Another way to think about is

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.688
whatever you're starting
with, let's call that 100%,

00:01:06.688 --> 00:01:08.985
and if you were to take out 30% of it,

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:10.868
if you were to have 30% less,

00:01:10.868 --> 00:01:14.423
then you're going to have
70% of what you started with.

00:01:14.423 --> 00:01:15.765
So another way to think about it is

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:19.932
we could take Peeta's score of
1060 and multiply it by 70%.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.278
And multiplying it by
70% is the same thing

00:01:25.278 --> 00:01:27.445
as multiplying it by 0.70,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.529
which is the same thing as
multiplying it by 70/100,

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:35.065
is the same thing as 7/10.

00:01:35.065 --> 00:01:36.487
So let's just do this.

00:01:36.487 --> 00:01:39.904
So if I have 1060, and I multiply by 0.7,

00:01:42.097 --> 00:01:43.322
what do I get?

00:01:43.322 --> 00:01:44.975
Seven times zero is zero.

00:01:44.975 --> 00:01:46.808
Seven times six is 42.

00:01:48.163 --> 00:01:51.225
Seven times zero is
zero, plus four is four.

00:01:51.225 --> 00:01:53.187
Seven times one is seven.

00:01:53.187 --> 00:01:55.803
And I have one digit to
the right of the decimal.

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:58.470
So there you have it, it is 742.

00:02:00.778 --> 00:02:01.611
742.

00:02:03.234 --> 00:02:05.860
That is how many points Val scored.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.943
Let's do another example.

00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:13.238
So we're told there are 20% more goblins

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:15.951
than wizards in a magic club.

00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:20.118
There are 220 goblins and
wizards altogether in magic club.

00:02:21.263 --> 00:02:25.166
How many goblins are in the magic club?

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:26.833
So pause the video and see

00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:30.158
if you can work through this on your own.

00:02:30.158 --> 00:02:31.949
So this one is an interesting one.

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.853
It's gonna involve a
little bit of algebra here.

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:36.968
So what we wanna do is
let's set a variable.

00:02:36.968 --> 00:02:40.410
Let's say w is the number of wizards.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.533
So that's the number of wizards.

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:46.700
And then if we said g for
goblins, let's say g for goblins.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:49.967
So w plus g is equal to 220,

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:54.737
is equal to 220.

00:02:54.737 --> 00:02:56.479
And you're like, well,
how does that help me?

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:58.422
How does that help me actually figure out

00:02:58.422 --> 00:03:00.334
how many goblins are in the magic club?

00:03:00.334 --> 00:03:03.047
I have two variables
here with one equation.

00:03:03.047 --> 00:03:04.805
Well, one way to think about it is,

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:06.566
remember, they give us
some more information.

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:09.973
They tell us there are
20%, let me box that,

00:03:09.973 --> 00:03:13.770
there are 20% more goblins than wizards.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.900
So we also know one other thing.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.887
We know that the goblins,
we know that the goblins

00:03:19.887 --> 00:03:24.415
are equal to the number
of wizards plus 20%.

00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:27.165
So you could view this as wizards

00:03:28.014 --> 00:03:30.836
plus 20% of wizards.

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:32.609
And I'm writing that as 20/100,

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.751
or you could even write that as 2/10,

00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.793
plus 2/10 times the number of wizards.

00:03:37.793 --> 00:03:39.491
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:42.728
goblins are equal to, if
I have one of something

00:03:42.728 --> 00:03:44.964
and then I have another
2/10 of that something,

00:03:44.964 --> 00:03:48.297
then I'm gonna have 1.2 of that something.

00:03:48.297 --> 00:03:52.047
So goblins is equal to
1.2 times the wizards.

00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:57.754
And so we could use that
to substitute back in here,

00:03:57.754 --> 00:04:00.557
and then we could say
the number of wizards

00:04:00.557 --> 00:04:04.724
plus the number of goblins,
which happens to be 20% more

00:04:05.742 --> 00:04:09.909
than the number of wizards,
is going to be equal to 220.

00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:13.618
Let me do that in that same color.

00:04:13.618 --> 00:04:15.275
Is equal to 220.

00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:18.067
Now this is pretty
straightforward to solve.

00:04:18.067 --> 00:04:19.734
What is w plus 1.2w?

00:04:20.811 --> 00:04:24.373
Well, that is going to be 2.2w, 2.2w.

00:04:24.373 --> 00:04:27.793
You could view this as one w plus 1.2w

00:04:27.793 --> 00:04:29.793
is 2.2w is equal to 220.

00:04:32.547 --> 00:04:34.639
And so just divide both sides.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.005
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:38.505
Divide both sides by 2.2, 2.2,

00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:41.664
and what do you get?

00:04:41.664 --> 00:04:45.414
You get w, the number
of wizards is equal to,

00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:50.169
let's see, this is going
to be equal to 100.

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.384
The number of wizards is equal to 100.

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:53.887
Now is that our answer?

00:04:53.887 --> 00:04:58.600
No, they're asking how many
goblins are in the magic club?

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.370
Well, we know that goblins
are 1.2 times the wizards.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.537
So the number of goblins is
going to be 1.2 times 100,

00:05:08.246 --> 00:05:10.670
which is equal to 120.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.446
So there's 120 goblins,
does that make sense?

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:16.633
120 is 20% more than 100.

00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:19.457
And if you add the 100
wizards to the 120 goblins,

00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:23.627
you get 220 goblins
and wizards altogether.

00:05:23.627 --> 00:05:26.087
Let's do another example.

00:05:26.087 --> 00:05:30.486
Here we're told Cody
was 165 centimeters tall

00:05:30.486 --> 00:05:32.414
on the first day of school this year,

00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:34.506
which was 10% taller than he was

00:05:34.506 --> 00:05:37.362
on the first day of school last year.

00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:42.096
How tall was Cody on the
first day of school last year?

00:05:42.096 --> 00:05:46.206
Pause this video, see if
you can figure that out.

00:05:46.206 --> 00:05:47.930
So let's just define a variable here.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.877
Let's just say that his
height on the first day

00:05:50.877 --> 00:05:54.660
of school last year,
let's say that that is x.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.069
So his height on the first
day of school last year is x.

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.627
This year he is 10% taller,

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:04.368
so we would add 10%, which
we could say is 10/100,

00:06:04.368 --> 00:06:07.174
or we could even say that as 1/10.

00:06:07.174 --> 00:06:09.262
He's 1/10 taller.

00:06:09.262 --> 00:06:11.272
So whatever his height was last year,

00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:14.068
we're going to add 1/10
of that same height again

00:06:14.068 --> 00:06:15.710
to get to his height this year,

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.578
which they tell us is 165 centimeters.

00:06:19.578 --> 00:06:23.893
And so here we could say
well, one x plus 1/10 of an x

00:06:23.893 --> 00:06:28.060
is going to be one and
1/10x is equal to 165.

00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:31.265
And now to solve for x, which
remember, was his height

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:33.490
on the first day of school last year,

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.823
we divide both sides by 1.1.

00:06:36.693 --> 00:06:38.529
And so x is equal to,

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:40.402
well, let's see what this is going to be.

00:06:40.402 --> 00:06:43.485
If I were to take 165 divided by 1.1,

00:06:46.153 --> 00:06:48.580
the first thing I would wanna do

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.171
is multiply them both by 10.

00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:53.216
So that has the effect of moving

00:06:53.216 --> 00:06:55.786
this decimal place one to the right.

00:06:55.786 --> 00:06:57.632
So really, I am now trying to figure out

00:06:57.632 --> 00:06:59.882
what 11 goes into 1,650 is.

00:07:02.401 --> 00:07:05.230
And so let's see, let me
just do that step by step.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.080
11 goes into 16 one time.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.885
One times 11 is 11.

00:07:09.885 --> 00:07:13.860
Subtract, we get a five,
and we bring down a five.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.480
11 goes into 55 exactly five times.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.643
Five times 11 is 55.

00:07:18.643 --> 00:07:20.041
Subtract.

00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:22.691
We have no remainder, but
then we bring down this zero

00:07:22.691 --> 00:07:23.721
and we do it one more time.

00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:25.924
11 goes into zero zero times.

00:07:25.924 --> 00:07:28.459
Remember, the decimal
place is right over here.

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:31.455
Zero times 11 is zero, and
then we have no remainder.

00:07:31.455 --> 00:07:35.010
So last year he was 150 centimeters.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.027
And it's always good
to do a reality check.

00:07:37.027 --> 00:07:38.909
Make sure, if for example,
if I divided wrong

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:41.504
and I somehow got 15, or I got 1500,

00:07:41.504 --> 00:07:43.689
just to make sure that that
wouldn't make any sense.

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:46.539
150 centimeters, you add 10% of that.

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:49.467
10% of 150 is 15 centimeters.

00:07:49.467 --> 00:07:52.068
So you add 10% of that, you indeed do get

00:07:52.068 --> 00:07:56.235
to 165 centimeters for the
first day of school this year.
