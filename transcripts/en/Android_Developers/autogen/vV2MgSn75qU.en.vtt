so yeah I just wanted to spend a couple
minutes talking about partner developer

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959
minutes talking about partner developer
 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:11.629
minutes talking about partner developer
relations so we're are your developer

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639
relations so we're are your developer
 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.050
relations so we're are your developer
advocates and so we work with partners

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060
advocates and so we work with partners
 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.609
advocates and so we work with partners
hence the term partner developer

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
hence the term partner developer
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.830
hence the term partner developer
relations so partners meaning game

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
relations so partners meaning game
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.769
relations so partners meaning game

of contact for technical questions
another thing we do is to tell

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
another thing we do is to tell
 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.719
another thing we do is to tell
developers that events such as this

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
developers that events such as this
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.050
developers that events such as this
about new technology related to games

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
about new technology related to games
 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.320
about new technology related to games
from Google and one of the most

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330
from Google and one of the most
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.810
from Google and one of the most
important things that we do is gather

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
important things that we do is gather
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.929
important things that we do is gather
feedback from developers on how we can

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939

suggestions during the meetings today so
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.940
suggestions during the meetings today so
one of the things we've been doing

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
one of the things we've been doing
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.490
one of the things we've been doing
recently is focusing on high fidelity

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
recently is focusing on high fidelity
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.609
recently is focusing on high fidelity
games and this is because we're seeing

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619
games and this is because we're seeing
 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.219
games and this is because we're seeing
this trend because of the improvement in

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229
this trend because of the improvement in
 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.950
this trend because of the improvement in
mobile hardware that's capable of

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960
mobile hardware that's capable of
 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.300
mobile hardware that's capable of
running games that you know

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
running games that you know
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.940
running games that you know
traditionally are on consoles or pcs

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950
traditionally are on consoles or pcs
 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.199
traditionally are on consoles or pcs
and thing is it's this really stresses

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209
and thing is it's this really stresses
 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.150
and thing is it's this really stresses
the system it requires a lot of the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160
the system it requires a lot of the
 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.030
the system it requires a lot of the
system and so things like Vulcan are

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040
system and so things like Vulcan are
 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.760
system and so things like Vulcan are
important for rendering to get the most

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770
important for rendering to get the most
 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.010
important for rendering to get the most
performance and so one of the things I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020
performance and so one of the things I
 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.320
performance and so one of the things I
did was I looked and see saw how much

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330
did was I looked and see saw how much
 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.479
did was I looked and see saw how much
how many devices actually support Vulcan

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489
how many devices actually support Vulcan
 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.160
how many devices actually support Vulcan
and you can do this by going into the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170
and you can do this by going into the
 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.030
and you can do this by going into the
Play Store in the device catalog and you

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040
Play Store in the device catalog and you
 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.180
Play Store in the device catalog and you
can see this about 400 devices it's

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190
can see this about 400 devices it's
 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.839
can see this about 400 devices it's
probably more now and there's our device

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849
probably more now and there's our device
 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.110
probably more now and there's our device
models that support Vulcan and this

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120
models that support Vulcan and this
 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.220
models that support Vulcan and this
turns out to be about 427 million

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230
turns out to be about 427 million
 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.440
turns out to be about 427 million
getting close to half a billion devices

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450
getting close to half a billion devices
 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.160
getting close to half a billion devices
now that support Vulcan now this doesn't

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170
now that support Vulcan now this doesn't
 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.490
now that support Vulcan now this doesn't
mean all of those devices are capable of

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500
mean all of those devices are capable of
 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.289
mean all of those devices are capable of
running your game there could be

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299
running your game there could be
 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.140
running your game there could be
problems where the hardware isn't fast

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150
problems where the hardware isn't fast
 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.460
problems where the hardware isn't fast
enough or there could be problems with

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470
enough or there could be problems with
 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.920
enough or there could be problems with
the driver quality so this is something

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930
the driver quality so this is something
 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.630
the driver quality so this is something
that you would need to test so as I

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640
that you would need to test so as I
 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.120
that you would need to test so as I
mentioned it's these high fidelity games

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130
mentioned it's these high fidelity games
 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.130
mentioned it's these high fidelity games
are really pushing the limits and so we

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140
are really pushing the limits and so we
 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.780
are really pushing the limits and so we
are job is we want to improve that

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790
are job is we want to improve that
 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.650
are job is we want to improve that
ecosystem make things better for

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660
ecosystem make things better for
 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.440
ecosystem make things better for
developers of these types of games so

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450
developers of these types of games so
 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.870
developers of these types of games so
today for example in these sessions

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880
today for example in these sessions
 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.240
today for example in these sessions
we're going to be talking about Vulcan

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250
we're going to be talking about Vulcan
 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.039
we're going to be talking about Vulcan
Samsung and Crytek are going to be

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049
Samsung and Crytek are going to be
 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.370
Samsung and Crytek are going to be
talking about their experience of

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380
talking about their experience of
 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.660
talking about their experience of
working with Vulcan

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670
working with Vulcan
 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.789
working with Vulcan
and and trying to optimize and then

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799
and and trying to optimize and then
 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.069
and and trying to optimize and then
because these games are more complex and

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079
because these games are more complex and
 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.800
because these games are more complex and
like a casual game they require good

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810
like a casual game they require good
 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.030
like a casual game they require good
tools for debugging and profiling and so

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040
tools for debugging and profiling and so
 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.960
tools for debugging and profiling and so
we have sessions on Android studio and

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970
we have sessions on Android studio and
 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.330
we have sessions on Android studio and
kappa'd and systrace these are tools for

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340
kappa'd and systrace these are tools for
 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.390
kappa'd and systrace these are tools for
debugging and profiling we recognize

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400
debugging and profiling we recognize
 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.580
debugging and profiling we recognize
that these are important to have and

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590
that these are important to have and
 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.890
that these are important to have and
we're going to continue to improve these

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900
we're going to continue to improve these
 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.830
we're going to continue to improve these
tools also because they're of the wide

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840
tools also because they're of the wide
 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.940
tools also because they're of the wide
variety of devices out there and

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950
variety of devices out there and
 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.729
variety of devices out there and
capability of devices and driver quality

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739
capability of devices and driver quality
 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.580
capability of devices and driver quality
in testing is very important for these

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590
in testing is very important for these
 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.920
in testing is very important for these
types of games so we have a session on

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930
types of games so we have a session on
 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.840
types of games so we have a session on
automated testing

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850
automated testing
 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.450
automated testing
by Nettie's which should help improve or

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460
by Nettie's which should help improve or
 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.550
by Nettie's which should help improve or
improve the time required for testing

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560
improve the time required for testing
 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.540
improve the time required for testing
and also plural is going to talk about
