00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:01.000
Okay.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.990
That's about the state.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.042
What about the measurement?

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:05.760
Okay.
What about z?

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.605
All right.

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:10.350
Here's another picture
taken from that paper.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.432
And what they did was in fact,
if i go back to the hand thing,

00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:20.083
you'll see that the hand, what they want
to do is track this contour, all right?

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:21.830
So, I'll draw it on the hand part.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.926
Well, if you've got the right state,
then you would expect to

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:33.000
have an edge in the image at the edge of
where the state says the fingers are.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.117
That is there some relationship between
the edges of the fingers in your state

00:00:37.117 --> 00:00:40.280
and the edges that you
would see in your picture.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.333
And in fact, that's what they do.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.819
Okay?
What they do is and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:45.292
there's more derivation.

00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:50.372
Basically, they come up with a
probability distribution that says that

00:00:50.372 --> 00:00:55.380
the probability of getting a particular
measurement given the state.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.250
And remember, the state tells
me where the fingers are.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.208
Is essentially an exponential, so
like a Gaussian that is proportional

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:07.120
to the square of the distance
to the nearest strong edge.
