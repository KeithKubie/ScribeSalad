Hey guys, welcome back to the King of Random.

00:00:01.798 --> 00:00:03.330
Thanks for joining us today. Not too long ago,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.390
we showed you how to build your very own air vortex cannon.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.729
It's a fun toy that shoots out a ring of air that travels for a surprisingly long distance. Today,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.680
we're going to take what we've already built and we're gonna see what happens if we scale them both up and  down. Now, when I

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.520
say we're gonna scale it down,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.809
I mean we're going to get a lot smaller, and when I say we're gonna scale it up,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.810
I mean we're going to get a lot

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.399
bigger. Let's start by making the tiny air cannon. For this tiny air cannon, pretty much all the supplies

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.279
we need are a tiny plastic cup and a regular balloon. Now,

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.179
we want to make a hole in the bottom of our cup that leaves a little bit of a border around it. It would probably

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.980
be pretty simple to cut that out with a knife,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.770
but if you have a drill bit that makes nice big holes, why not use it?

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.029
With a hole cut in your cup, the next step is to cut your balloon.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.890
We want to cut off the neck of the balloon

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.509
and then a little bit more, so we have mostly just the widest part of the balloon. Now, with our balloon cut,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.360
we just need to stretch it over the open mouth of the cup.

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.779
That will actually hold itself on pretty well, but just to reinforce it,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.629
I'm gonna use a little bit of tape to ensure that it doesn't go anywhere.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.060
And believe it or not, just like that,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.019
you have a miniature air cannon. Most balloons will have a little bit of a dimple on the back,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.250
and so if you use that to grip, you can get a pretty good powerful shot out of your tiny cannon.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.739
Of course, this is shooting out very small rings of completely clear air, so it's hard to see what's going on.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.280
We're gonna set up a few different things to hopefully illustrate more clearly what's going on.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.720
I have this hanging mylar decoration which moves very easily with just a little bit of air current,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.309
so it's a great target to see if you're actually hitting it with these little rings of air.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.310
First, let's try it out with the normal sized air bazooka.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.459
There you go, our regular air bazooka works pretty well. You can see how much it moves the curtain.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.019
We're going to be dealing with a much lower volume of air with our tiny one, but I bet it will still work.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.380
I'm gonna try it from pretty up close just for the first couple shots, see how this works.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.269
It moves, doesn't move nearly as much as a bigger one, but it definitely moves. All right,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.119
I'm gonna try backing up from a little farther away, and see how it does.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.050
Oh,

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.050
there it is.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.399
Huh, it seems like it travels really fast too, like, like the instant after it snaps, making our mylar shake.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.839
I want to try and find a way that I can see the air coming out of this,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.560
so I'm going to start by just using a little bit of smoke from a match and see how well that works.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.190
Well, there we go, getting some good smoke rings coming out.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.569
You can probably see, instead of grabbing it and firing it out the way

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.789
I was, I'm just kind of tapping it on the back.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.830
I think it fires so quickly that any smoke rings would just dissipate before you could see them.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.729
I'll try one where I just shoot it out at full speed.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.179
I think it's just gonna be too hard to see anything, but we'll try it.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.619
Wow, yeah, like, there's a little bit of smoke that just disappeared almost immediately. It went way too fast.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.580
You couldn't see the shape of it, so I think you're trying to make visible smoke,

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.660
it works best to just tap on the back of it. That seems to work out pretty well. Let's try that again.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.870
There you go, it only takes a couple of minutes to make this tiny little air bazooka,

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.459
which has surprisingly good range and makes some really cool little rings if you add some smoke to it.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.619
We now know how to make our tiny air bazooka. Now, let's move on to making our giant air bazooka.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.809
This is something that has been done previously,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.459
and I want to give a shout-out to Steve Spangler who's done something very similar on The Ellen Show. To start off,

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.889
we've got our trash can and a thick sheet of painter's plastic.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.140
Let's place the mouth of our trash can face down on our painter's plastic, and then trace around it with a marker.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.850
All right, we've got our circle drawn. Let's cut it out.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.380
Before we attach it to the top,

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.150
let's cut a hole in the bottom of our trash can. Now, we want to cut a circle in the bottom of our bucket, leaving

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.760
a border of 2 or 3 inches. Our bucket full of tape has a bottom that's just the right size for our circle.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.820
You can see that the bottom of our trash can is not perfectly leveled,

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.999
but I'm hoping it's level enough that it won't cause any problems. Unfortunately,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.089
I don't have a hole saw this big, so I'm gonna be using a knife to cut this one.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.749
That knife was having a hard time getting through the thicker parts of the plastic, so I'm upgrading to a jigsaw.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.909
We now have a hole cut in the bottom of our trash can. Let's attach our painter's plastic to the top.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.229
All right. Now, with the plastic attached on the back the way I've done it,

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.579
it's pulled tight and it's not attached to a bungee like we did with our small air bazooka.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.070
But on this one, if you just hit the back like a drum, it will actually send out a wave of air from the front.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.620
One of the other advantages of an air bazooka this size is that it makes really large rings.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.340
So, let's try filling this one with smoke and see what kind of ring as we get out of it

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.000
There we go.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.589
A very simply activated giant air cannon. However, I do have one more thing

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.820
I want to try. Using the exact same design we used on our regular-sized air cannon,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.559
I went ahead and used a different trashcan and added the spring loaded back to it.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.080
So, let's see what difference that makes

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.240
in our souped-up cannon.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.350
Whoo, that was a way bigger ring.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.579
That just moves the curtain so much. Yeah, you can really just see the ring flying through the air

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.119
and blasting the curtain out of its way.

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.329
I have here a batch of some of our colored smoke powder, and last time

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.740
I was trying to light some of this stuff off,

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.440
I had in a paper bowl, and the bowls kept lighting on fire. So this time,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.440
I'm using a terracotta dish, pretty sure this is not going to burn.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.369
Instead of lighting the smoke out here and trying to draw it into our smoke bazooka,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.099
I'm going to try putting this entire terracotta dish

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:39.789
inside the trash can and light it up there, so all of the smoke that it produces will stay inside. We shouldn't lose any.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.150
Let's start with just a pretty small amount.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.419
I'm gonna light this off and as soon as it starts burning, I'm gonna start trying to fire this air bazooka.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.020
There we go, getting some good smoke there.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.420
I'm just gonna scoot it back a little bit farther.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.740
Let's see what kind of air ring we get out of this.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.520
Whoo!

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.820
And that just travels. Let's try that a second time.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.960
I'm trying to hit the trees.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.140
Three, two, one...

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.340
Nice.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.940
There you have it, now in addition to the regular air bazooka,

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:04.179
you now also know how to make the tiny and the large air bazookas, which comes in the normal and the spring-loaded variety.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.479
Thanks for joining us for this project today, and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to you then.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.570
Least efficient method of raking leaves ever.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.090
Hey guys,

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.560
I know there are so many great videos and great YouTubers out there that you could be watching instead of the King of Random.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.529
So, I just want to say how grateful I am that you choose to watch us.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:32.140
We're constantly doing everything in our power to bring you the best content we can make. So, truly, just want to say thanks.
