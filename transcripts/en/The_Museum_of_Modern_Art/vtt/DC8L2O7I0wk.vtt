00:00:01.651 --> 00:00:06.500
There's a wonderful description
of Degas by his friend Pissarro,

00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:09.958
and Pissarro
was very active politically.

00:00:10.375 --> 00:00:12.833
He describes Degas
in a letter to his son.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.250
He says, "Degas
is an anarchist, but in art."

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.291
Degas was introduced to the monotype
in the mid­ 1870s by his friend,

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:30.833
the artist and printmaker
Ludovic Lepic,

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:33.416
and they make
Degas' first monotype together.

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:36.333
And for Degas the process
is always the most interesting.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.750
Go into the print studio
and see what comes out of it.

00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:47.916
A monotype is a hybrid
of drawing and printmaking.

00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:51.125
The artist would draw on a plate,

00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.375
the plate would be sandwiched
with a piece of paper

00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:55.875
and run through a press.

00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.958
It goes through the press once

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:03.375
and then the image is pulled
off onto the sheet of paper.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.041
There’s always a kind of
wonderment of how it looks

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:12.750
and I think sometimes
one would be incredibly happy

00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:14.791
and sometimes probably the opposite.

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.208
The monotypes have been
divided into two types:

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:19.708
the dark field
and one called the light field.

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.500
And dark field is when Degas

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.750
would lay a curtain
of black ink on the plate.

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:27.916
It is reported that he used a dauber,

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:31.083
a piece of felt
which has been rolled up and tied

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.583
so it looks a little sausage.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.958
And then draws by removing the ink.

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:36.166
And so in those works,

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:39.375
you get the sense of an image
emerging out of darkness.

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.583
He would use his own hands,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.666
he might use a piece of fabric
to get a certain kind of texture,

00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:47.875
or a sponge, the back of a brush,

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:50.250
anything that he had
around the studios.

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:54.666
The light field is,
essentially, the opposite.

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:56.541
You start with
a totally unmarked plate

00:01:56.708 --> 00:01:58.041
and then you add ink

00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:00.875
but you would add it
with a brush or with a rag.

00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:03.583
If you’re using a cotton paper,

00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.083
the fibers of the paper
need to soften up

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.083
in order to accept the ink better.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:11.208
So the dampening of the paper
loosens the fibers up

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:15.500
so that all of the image can then
come up from the plate’s surface.

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:18.041
You get the sense that Degas
falls in love with this process,

00:02:18.416 --> 00:02:20.208
that he really goes crazy for it.

00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:23.333
Even one of his friends
has this description of Degas

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.708
saying that he's no longer a man,
he's a plate.

00:02:36.903 --> 00:02:39.875
When we think of a monotype,
even when you hear the word,

00:02:40.043 --> 00:02:41.625
it's “mono” - it’s one.

00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:44.883
But Degas used it
to create multiple impressions,

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.833
and what he would get
is a kind of ghost image,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.458
a degraded image
of the first impression.

00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:55.666
And he uses pastels sometimes
to enhance the image, to define it.

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:59.875
He’s very experimental,
especially in the landscape monotypes.

00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:02.500
And he’s using oil paint
instead of printer’s ink

00:03:02.668 --> 00:03:04.093
which is not typical.

00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:08.041
He lets the press kind of smoosh it,

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:11.125
and you get this kind of
smooshed field of color.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.375
One of the inspirations
for him making the work

00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:16.291
is seeing the landscape
through the door of a moving train.

00:03:16.708 --> 00:03:18.083
How do you express something

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.166
that you experience
as you move through it?

00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:25.958
Monotype encouraged that freedom,
encouraged a kind of looseness.

00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:29.083
The way you can
smudge the image in monotype

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.083
allows him to capture
the hustle and bustle of the city.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.500
Faces that Degas
might have passed by,

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:35.875
he’ll just smudge them out.

00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:37.791
Working strongly
against the conventions

00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.875
that he learned as a young artist.

00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:45.458
No matter how much
you work onto the plate,

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.041
how long it takes you,

00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:49.875
each time you print it,
when you pull it off,

00:03:50.083 --> 00:03:53.041
you just basically have to live
with what you got.

00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:55.333
That’s the beauty of it.

00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:59.333
It was the process that was important,
there was never a final picture.

00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:01.375
It was about endlessness,

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.208
always the possibility
of another image to be made.
