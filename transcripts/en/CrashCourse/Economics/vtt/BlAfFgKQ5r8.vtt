Adriene: Welcome to Crash Course Economics.
I’m Adriene Hill

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.509
Jacob: And I’m Jacob Clifford. Economics
is about choices, and how we use our scarce

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.000
resources. It’s not just about producing
and consuming, it can also be about conserving.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.370
Adriene: Maybe counterintuitively, economics
has a lot to add to discussions of how we

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.140
can balance our desire for prosperity and
growth, with the need to protect our natural

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.660
resources. Today we're going to look at environmental
economics and think about how economics can

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.380
help us keep our planet livable.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:38.280
[Theme Music]

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.160
Pollution is going to happen, it’s a by-product
of human existence and there is no way that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.380
we can get rid of it all. In fact, one of the ways
we know about earliest the societies is by

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.260
looking at their trash heap, something archaeologists
call middens, because it sounds better than “dumps.”

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.980
But the fact that humans produce all kinds
of waste doesn’t mean that we have to embrace

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.899
islands of trash floating in the oceans, a
layer of smog over industrial cities, and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.610
toxic chemicals in our rivers. For sake of
simplicity though, we’re going to focus

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.970
on one type of pollution: carbon dioxide emissions.
They’re one of the primary greenhouse gases.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.460
These greenhouse gases basically blanket the
earth and are causing climate change.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.720
CO2 levels are the highest they've been for
millions years which is why environmentalists

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.230
consider it a “planetary emergency.” There's
a lot of effort going into how to remove

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.220
greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, how
to make cities more resilient to climate change,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.000
but in the interest of time we’re going
to focus on efforts to reduce the amount of

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.440
new pollutants getting spewed into our atmosphere.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.760
Jacob: The economic solution is pretty simple.
Step one, identify the sources of the most

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.720
air pollution. Done. We know exactly what
it is. It’s factories that burn fossil fuels

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.320
for energy, industries that use oil and coal to produce
things, and vehicles with internal combustion engines.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.060
Step two, decrease the supply of these technologies
and products or decrease the demand for them.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.120
That’s it, it’s simple. But, the implementation
of these policies gets complicated.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.160
Let’s look at decreasing supply. As we mentioned
in the last video, one of the biggest problems

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.239
with having countries independently enforce
environmental regulations is the Tragedy of

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.840
the Commons. No one owns the atmosphere, so
there is very little incentive for countries

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.269
to keep it clean and switch to expensive green
technologies if no one else is going to. It’s

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.959
not like there is some global environmental
police punishing countries for polluting.

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.430
While a country like Trinidad and Tobago has
a huge carbon output per capita, its small

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.189
population means it’s only producing a small
fraction of global CO2.

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.569
The other option is to decrease the demand
for fossil fuels, possibly by finding alternate

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.329
green energy sources. But we’re already
very reliant on fossil fuels, and markets

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.150
have made the production of those fuels very
cheap. So, any new type of energy will have

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.200
a hard time beating the established system.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.749
So we can either wait patiently for new technologies
to develop and get cheaper, or we can speed

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:52.799
up the process by manipulating markets with
government subsidies, taxes, and regulations.

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.989
Adriene: In the case of pollution, there are
long-term side effects, like climate change,

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.859
that consumers often don’t take into account
when they buy products. Remember negative

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.079
externalities? When the full cost of a product
doesn’t line up with the costs that manufacturers

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:12.099
or consumers pay? Pollution represents a market
failure -- a situation where markets fail to

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.191
produce the amount that society wants.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.260
To address this, some economists argue that
government intervention is not only justified,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.459
but essential. There are all kinds of different
ways intervention can happen — all of them

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.339
meant to encourage producers and consumers
to choose to pollute less.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.560
One solution is for the government to come
out and set very specific rules about how

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.880
much specific industries can pollute. Forget
markets. You're gonna follow our pollution rules.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.940
Another way governments encourage people to
pollute less is by providing price incentives.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.320
Those incentives can encourage individuals
to make choices that are better for the environment.

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.700
The government could add taxes to gasoline
purchases, or, on the other hand, provide

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.400
subsidies for people who drive electric cars.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.660
Governments can also create permit markets
— basically setting a limit on how much

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:03.169
firms can pollute, and allowing those firms
to buy and sell pollution permits. You’ve

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.209
probably heard these called “cap and trade”.
Proponents of cap and trade argue that it

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:13.140
can successfully limit emissions, without creating
hard and fast rules that might hinder economic growth.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.900
And, governments can subsidize the development
of a specific technology or industry—in

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.979
an effort to make that technology more competitive
with the alternatives. A country might help

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.619
support the development of solar or wind energy.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.880
As of 2014, around 10% of the energy consumed
in the United States came from renewable sources,

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.009
which is pretty much in line with the global
average. Current predictions are that by 2040

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.370
15% of the world energy consumption will come
from renewable sources.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.220
But, alternative energy sources, for the most
part, just aren’t cheap enough yet, so the

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.780
majority of our energy is likely to continue to come
from non-renewable sources, at least for now.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.240
Jacob: We don’t have the time to sit back
and wait for new technologies to get cheaper,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.200
and there's no guarantee that the technologies
that the government picks will be cost effective.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.940
Perhaps the solution is not to get rid of fossil fuels,
but instead be more efficient with those fuels.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.820
But that has drawbacks, too. Some energy economists
argue that the expected gains from energy

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.120
saving technologies, are offset by something called
the rebound effect. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.289
Adriene: Let’s say Hank uses a gallon of
gas to drive to work everyday. Then, partially

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.599
to help the planet but mostly to help his
wallet, he buys a new fuel efficient car that

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.560
only takes half a gallon of gas for the same
commute.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.430
He saves money and there's less pollution.
It is a win-win. But the rebound effect says

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.770
that the benefits of energy efficiency might
be reduced as people change their behavior.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.110
With the money he saves, Hank might start
driving more than he normally would or he

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.000
might go on a vacation in Hawaii. That leads to
more consumption and possibly even more emissions.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.620
Also, if greater fuel-efficiency makes driving
less expensive it might encourage more people

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:53.470
to buy cars and increase the overall use of
gasoline. And even if people didn't increase

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.319
their driving, the new fuel efficiency could
decrease the demand for gas, making fossil

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.819
fuels cheaper and more readily available for
other uses.

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:06.119
The possibility of the rebound effect doesn’t
mean we shouldn’t invest in energy saving

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.420
technologies. It just means that we have to
keep in mind how consumers will behave. It’s

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.080
also the reason why it's important to have economists
involved in the discussion of environmental policy.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.400
The tools of economics can help analyze 
the incentives and figure out what might work best.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.460
Thanks Thought Bubble. Okay, so we’ve identified
another problem. But before you get so angry

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.330
that you kick over a barrel of oil and light
it on fire, keep in mind that there is hope.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.350
Most countries are actively trying to address
the problem of greenhouse gases.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.800
The international community has been trying
for decades to work together to protect the

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.599
environment with varying success. There are
international treaties that commit countries

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:48.470
to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. UN negotiations
are underway to create a new climate change

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.480
agreement — that could be adopted in December
2015.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.000
Private companies and governments are
also funding research into green technology.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.920
In the U.S. the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 allocated billions to fund renewable energy.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.430
China is also vowing to clean things up, and,
in fact, leads the world in renewable energy

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.150
investment. So, now that most countries recognize
there is a problem, the hope is that they’ll

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.449
figure out a way, or more likely a lot of
ways, to start addressing it. Environmental

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:19.870
economists say that is not just governments
and producers that need to change, it’s

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.860
also consumers. Conserving and consuming more
thoughtfully likely need to be a part of our

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.409
daily lives if we want to protect the environment.

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:31.819
But just bringing our reusable grocery bags
to the store isn’t going to save the planet,

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:36.930
even if it says it on the bag. Bigger and
more costly interventions like improving insulation

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:42.680
and changing thermostats might have more impact,
but we need to recognize individual action

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:48.439
alone isn’t going to be enough. Industries,
governments, and individuals; we’re in this

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:52.020
together. Thanks for watching, we’ll see
you next week.
