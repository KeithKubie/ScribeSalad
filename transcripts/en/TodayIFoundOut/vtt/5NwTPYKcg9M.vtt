00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.620
Hermann Göring was second only to Hitler
in the hierarchy of the Third Reich.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.360
Commander of the Luftwaffe, acting Prime Minister
of Prussia, President of the Reichstag, and

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.020
Hitler’s designated successor – Göring’s
Nazi resume was almost unparalleled.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.330
Born in Bavaria in 1893, Göring was the son
of a professional soldier and governor in

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.330
West Africa.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.820
He followed his father’s footsteps and joined
the military in 1912.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.100
He served in the Luftwaffe during World War
I, and took over the command of “The Red

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.930
Baron” Manfred von Richthofen’s old squadron.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.629
Although he won several awards for bravery
and his numerous victories, Göring wasn’t

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.350
popular with the other pilots, seemingly due
to his arrogance.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.140
After joining the fledgling Nazi party in
1922, Göring quickly became indispensable

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.610
and was instrumental in the Nazi take-over
of the German government.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.400
After Hitler became Chancellor, he appointed
Göring as Prussian Minister of the Interior,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.799
Commissioner for Aviation, and Commander-in-Chief
of the Prussian Police and Gestapo.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.390
Göring never hesitated to enjoy the perks
of his exalted position.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.640
He had a magnificent palace in Berlin as well
as a luxurious hunting lodge named in honor

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.380
of his late wife Carin, who died in 1931.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.439
He loved to play dress-up and would change
his uniforms several times a day, proudly

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:28.950
displaying all his medals.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.700
It was also joked among the press at the time
that he probably bathed in his uniform.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.539
Despite Göring’s own Godfather, Dr. Hermann
Epenstein Ritter von Mauternburg, having been

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.979
an exceptionally successful businessman of
Jewish ancestry (and a man who his mother

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.149
had a long lasting, open affair with, with
his elderly father turning a blind eye to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.579
it and allowing his young wife to live with
Epenstein), Göring was an advocate of the

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.119
elimination of the Jews from the German economy
and infamously ordered the “architect of

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.119
the Holocaust” Reinhard Heydrich to “carry
out all preparations with regard to . . . a

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.609
general solution [Gesamtlosung] of the Jewish
question in those territories of Europe which

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.509
are under German influence …”

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.210
In 1939, Göring had serious reservations
about his Luftwaffe being ready to face the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.930
Royal Air Force in battle, but Hitler pushed
for the acceleration of the war plans and

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.930
the war began anyway.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.680
At this point, Göring was at the peak of
his power and popularity, and Hitler trusted

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.090
him implicitly.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.390
But despite many early victories, the Germans
couldn’t maintain their momentum.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.650
As Germany’s fortunes grew dimmer, Göring’s
standing with Hitler and the German people

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.650
began to falter.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.010
At a time when most Germans were living hand-to-mouth,
Göring’s lifestyle of extreme excess was

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.330
no longer admired.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.560
His tendency to make bold claims to Hitler
and not produce results didn’t hold him

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.870
in good stead either.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.549
The final straw was on April 23, 1945, when
Berlin was close to falling.

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.430
Göring, who had been declared by Hitler to
be his successor if anything should happen

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.110
to him, met with other officials and decided
to take over as Hitler was trapped in Berlin.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.690
(Hitler would commit suicide just a week later.)

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.840
When Göring officially requested Hitler approve
the decision, Hitler was furious and charged

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.030
Göring with treason.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.599
He then ordered Göring’s arrest, and stripped
him of his rank and membership in the Nazi

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:13.599
party.

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.420
When Göring surrendered to the Allies in
Austria on May 8, 1945, he did it, at least

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.400
in theory, as a civilian.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.099
GöringDetentionReportTo his apparent surprise,
Göring was put on trial for war crimes at

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.099
Nuremberg.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.500
During his trial, according to American intelligence
officer and psychologist Captain Gustave Gilbert,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.220
when he interviewed him, Göring was “defensive
and deflated and not very happy over the turn

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.230
the trial was taking.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.970
He said that he had no control over the actions
or the defense of the others, and that he

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.189
had never been anti-Semitic himself, had not
believed these atrocities, and that several

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.360
Jews had offered to testify on his behalf.”

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.220
Despite being “deflated,” Göring defended
himself with great vigor and skill putting

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.879
his vaunted 138 IQ to work (tested while in
custody during the trial), occasionally outwitting

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:00.970
the prosecution.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.819
After watching the films that documented the
atrocities committed in the concentration

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.340
camps, Göring claimed he was shocked at what
was depicted and felt that the films had to

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.769
have been faked somehow.

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.090
Unsurprisingly given he was second only to
Hitler in the Nazi party, nobody believed

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.280
for a second that Göring hadn’t known about
what was happening in those camps.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.470
In the end, Göring was found guilty on all
four counts: conspiracy to wage war, crimes

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.140
against peace, war crimes and crimes against
humanity.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.300
The judgement read,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.700
There is nothing to be said in mitigation.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.850
For Göring was often, indeed almost always,
the moving force, second only to his leader.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.070
He was the leading war aggressor, both as
political and as military leader; he was the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.280
director of the slave labour programme and
the creator of the oppressive programme against

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.350
the Jews and other races, at home and abroad.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.990
All of these crimes he has frankly admitted.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.190
On some specific cases there may be conflict
of testimony, but in terms of the broad outline,

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.810
his own admissions are more than sufficiently
wide to be conclusive of his guilt.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.180
His guilt is unique in its enormity.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.120
The record discloses no excuses for this man.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.480
Hermann Göring was sentenced to die by hanging,
but requested to die in what he viewed as

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.570
a soldier’s death by firing squad; the court
insisted he be executed like a common criminal.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.880
Neither side got exactly what they wanted,
but Göring still ended up just as dead when

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.290
he ingested a cyanide tablet on this day in
history, October 15, 1946, mere hours before

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.760
his date with the hangman.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.300
albertUnlike Hermann, his little brother,
Albert, despised the Nazi party and did just

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.780
about everything in his power to oppose them,
frequently getting himself arrested, but getting

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.340
off each time due to who his older brother
was, and occasionally via direct intervention

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.340
from Hermann.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.720
According to the book Thirty Four, by William
Burke, Albert’s first known open act to

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.590
help the Jews was a small one.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.500
While in Vienna, he happened upon a group
of Jewish women who had a vicious mob around

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.240
them and were being forced to scrub the streets.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.280
When he saw this, he simply walked up to one
of the women, asked for a scrub brush from

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.850
her, and knelt down and began scrubbing the
street as well.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.690
This didn’t sit well with the officers who
were overseeing the whole thing.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.460
But when they realized who Albert’s brother
was, they quickly ordered the scrubbing to

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.520
stop and the mob to disperse.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.530
In a similar incident, this one which resulted
in his own arrest, he came upon a small mob

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.990
that was harassing an elderly Jewish woman,
putting a sign around her neck that stated,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.960
“I am a Jewish sow.”

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.370
Albert pushed his way through the crowd around
her and helped the woman escape the little

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.370
mob.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.110
In the process of doing so, he had to physically
attack two members of the Gestapo, for which

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.690
he was ultimately arrested.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.290
As before, once they realized who they’d
arrested, he was set free.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.310
More significantly, Albert is thought to have
helped numerous Jewish people by helping fund

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.500
an underground movement that helped Jews escape
to freedom; he also forged his brother’s

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.730
signature on several occasions to get Jews
and others released from concentration camps

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.880
and prison.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.070
Other times, he’d simply convince Hermann
to sign an order to let certain people go,

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.770
playing on his brother’s vanity and love
for displaying his power.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.320
In his most daring act, he drove up to a concentration
camp and simply demanded he be given Jews

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.780
for labor for the company Skoda Works, where
Albert worked at the time.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.680
Normally, as he had no official papers for
such a request, he would have been turned

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.680
away.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.080
But because he was the brother of Hermann
Göring, his request was granted.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.460
After loading his truck with as many Jews
as he could, he drove them off to a remote

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.340
area and let them go with instructions on
their best route to freedom.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.370
After that, though, the jig was up and an
order was sent from Berlin to have him shot.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.660
He managed to escape to a safe house, however,
and the war ended very soon after.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.740
However, upon presenting himself to Allied
soldiers, he was promptly arrested.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.680
Unlike his older brother, Albert was acquitted
during the Nuremberg trials, though not before

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.590
spending around a year and a half in prison,
with no one believing him that he had actually

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.660
spent the war actively working against the
Nazis and helping as many people as he could

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.880
escape their clutches.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.440
In fact, when he first told his story after
being arrested, Major Paul Kubala noted in

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.190
Albert’s file, “The results of the interrogation
of Albert Göring constitute as clever a piece

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.700
of whitewash as we have ever seen.”

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.390
However, Albert finally did find someone willing
to listen in Major Victor Parker.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:09.250
He had given Parker a list of 34 Jews he knew
the names of that he had personally helped

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.250
escape.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:14.220
Again, according to the book Thirty Four,
by an extraordinary coincidence, one of the

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.450
Jews on the list was Major Parker’s uncle.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.860
After verifying the claim with his uncle,
he pursued the other names on the list who

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.350
all testified in Albert’s defense and he
was finally set free.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.670
Unfortunately, after the war he found himself
largely shunned due to his association with

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.519
his brother and that few knew of Albert’s
real activities during the war.

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:37.469
As a result, he struggled to find work for
the remainder of his life and ultimately became

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:38.490
an alcoholic.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:43.370
As his health began to fail and death was
imminent in 1966 (he was dying of pancreatic

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.240
cancer), Albert decided to marry his housekeeper.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.649
This was not out of love, but simply because
by doing so, she would then be entitled to

00:08:50.649 --> 00:08:55.269
his government pension, making sure she would
be taken care of financially after her services

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:57.980
as his housekeeper were no longer required.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.690
He died a week later in December of 1966.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:07.399
Due to Albert’s strong resemblance to his
aforementioned Godfather, Dr. Hermann Epenstein;

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:11.129
the fact that it was shortly after Albert’s
birth that Epenstein declared he was going

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:15.589
to be the Godfather to all Albert’s mother’s
children; the fact that Albert’s sister

00:09:15.589 --> 00:09:19.930
claimed Albert was Epenstein’s favorite;
and that the affair between Epenstein and

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.089
Albert’s mother started well before Albert’s
birth, it is rumored that Albert was actually

00:09:24.089 --> 00:09:25.980
the son of Dr. Epenstein.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:31.370
However, this is generally discounted by most
historians because the dates just barely don’t

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.879
line up, given a lengthy trip Albert’s mother
took to Haiti ending in mid-1894.

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:56.279
For reference, Albert was born on March 9,
1895.
