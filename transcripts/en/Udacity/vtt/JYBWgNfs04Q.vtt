00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.100
Our genetic similarities can do more than just connect

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.150
individuals. The broader scope of ancestry is about populations

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.430
and evolution. For example, I know that I was

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.840
born in United States, but if I trace my

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.560
relatives back several generations, I would find that I

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.120
have a strong connection to Northern Europe. In fact,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.740
when I look at my 23andMe ancestry report, I

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.390
find that I'm 98% European. I can zoom in here.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.880
And I can see what percentage of Northern Europe

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.030
I am, and then it maps mainly to the British

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.370
and Irish isles. We can also look at the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.760
same information in Chromosome View. And what I notice is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.340
that even though me and my genes currently reside

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.230
in the United States. Apparently, my genes have traveled over

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.220
space and time all the way from Northern Europe,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.510
look how much of my genome is from Northern Europe.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.490
And specifically regions from Britain and Ireland. A much

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.710
smaller percent of my genome we can see is from

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.380
Sub Saharan African and a much even smaller region, a

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.230
teeny, tiny region right. Is from South Asia. When we

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.860
think about genes and alleles moving over time in

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.540
a geographic space, we get a new perspective on our

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.100
past. And it can also be a lot more meaningful

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.050
when you have somebody who doesn't have quite the homogenous

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.110
genetic background that I have. Here we're

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.000
looking at an example from someone named

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.752
Roy King. And we can see they have an amazing history, 51% from Sub-Saharan

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:30.780
Africa 43.3% European, about 1.8% East Asian

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.890
and Native American, and 0.2% South Asian. Wherever this individual is

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.950
currently living, their genes are truly from all over the world.
