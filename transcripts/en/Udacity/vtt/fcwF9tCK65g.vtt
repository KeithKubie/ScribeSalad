00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.540
Every time a cell divides, all the chromosomes line up at the center. All the

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.090
duplicated chromosomes. Then they separate. They split

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.270
up equally into the daughter cells. We can

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.120
imagine these chromosomes being pulled apart here

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.120
form the center and one piece One side

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.040
going to either daughter cell. Now if something

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.720
goes wrong, and one chromosome doesn't separate correctly,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.640
And so both chromatids end up going to one

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.650
daughter cell. So if one side gets one more chromosome

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.310
and one side gets one less chromosome, this is called

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.080
Aneuploidy. Obviously this can cause major problems. But imagine what

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.560
a big deal this would be if it happened in

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.350
one of your germ cells. And one of your gametes

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.720
ended up with more or less chromosomes. So that when

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.950
it fertilized an opposite sex gamete, you produced a whole

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.600
offspring, a whole child, another human. With

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.970
one more or less chromosome. So let's make

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.090
sure you're where I want you to be

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.700
with information about chromosomes. Tell me which of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.510
the following are examples of aneuploidy. 46 chromosomes

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.800
total, 47 chromosomes total, 3 of chromosome 21.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.530
45 chromosomes total, 1 X chromosome and no

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.665
Y. 47 chromosomes total, 2 x chromosomes, and

00:01:16.665 --> 00:01:20.160
1 y. Go ahead and pick any and all answers that you think apply.
