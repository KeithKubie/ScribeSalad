00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
Hey guys, what's up? It's Kim. Welcome back to Psych2Go.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.580
Today's video is going to get super, super crazy.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.040
So, let's just go right on into it.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.980
Also, sidenote, I've gotten so many comments about people being so annoyed that I don't make my bed.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.000
So, as a Christmas present to all of you I made my bed today.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.420
So, today's video, I'm going to be telling you all about five super crazy, super insane, not very common mental disorders.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.240
That most of you probably have never even heard about before.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.880
Starting at number one we have Cotard syndrome.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.600
Now, have you ever imagined what it would be like to just wake up dead?

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.480
but like, still be able to experience everything around you.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.580
Basically, that's exactly what people with this disorder go through every single day of their life.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.320
And although it's not technically classified in the DSM

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.440
it is still a mental disorder where the sufferers truly, completely believe that they are dead

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.980
or decomposing.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.400
They're going through their complete daily lives as they would normally but they think

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.940
that they are dead.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.720
And the possible causes for this vary from a simple to adverse drug reaction

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.540
to actual misfirings in the brain.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.420
Now, moving on to number two we have Capgras syndrome

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.020
This one is also known as impostor syndrome.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.260
This is the belief that a familiar person or place has been replaced with an impostor.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.980
An exact duplicate of this person or place.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.020
And even though it is usually, typically, seen with dementia

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.860
it can also come with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or in people with an injury or brain disease.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.960
Number three is body integrity disorder.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.520
Now, this disorder is the belief that one is disabled.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.000
Even though they are completely fine.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.380
Many of these people believe they're arms, legs or toes are foreign objects.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.200
And that they shouldn't be able to used them, and that they should not be on their body.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.680
Because they feel like they are not able to use them, they go to great lengths to actually amputate these limbs

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.760
that they believe are disabled.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.780
There are a number of different theories as to what causes this

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.420
but there are no actual supported proven facts as to why people experience this disorder.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.820
And, next, number four is called fugue state.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.600
This one is kind of more just a symptom rather than an actual whole disorder.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.100
It can appear in multiple different disorders

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.040
as a symptom.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.480
Basically what happens is this person completely blanks and forgets who they are.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.360
And becomes a completely, entirely different person.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.940
And, last but not least, number five is called Genital Retraction Syndrome.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.860
Now, this one is where a person holds the completely wrong belief that their genitals

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.980
will suddenly just retract into their body.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.940
This is a debilitating fear for those who suffer from it and interferes with their every day life.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.320
This belief also comes with the fear that they will die upon retraction of their genitals.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.625
There you guys go, those are the five craziest diseases that are really not that common

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.500
and most people don't know about.
