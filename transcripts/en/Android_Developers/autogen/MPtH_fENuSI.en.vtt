00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450
template that ships in Android studio
 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.620
template that ships in Android studio
and for me I've been building maps with

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630
and for me I've been building maps with
 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.750
and for me I've been building maps with
Google Maps for Android for like a year

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760
Google Maps for Android for like a year
 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.600
Google Maps for Android for like a year
two years and I got to the stage where I

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610
two years and I got to the stage where I
 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.850
two years and I got to the stage where I
always bypassed the the wizard and I

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860
always bypassed the the wizard and I
 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.890
always bypassed the the wizard and I
just rolled my own maps and I roll my

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900
just rolled my own maps and I roll my
 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.540
just rolled my own maps and I roll my
own apps that use maps and if you do

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550
own apps that use maps and if you do
 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.610
own apps that use maps and if you do
that you may remember that you got to go

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620
that you may remember that you got to go
 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.290
that you may remember that you got to go
to the developers console you got to

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300
to the developers console you got to
 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.699
to the developers console you got to
register your app you got to remember

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709
register your app you got to remember
 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.310
register your app you got to remember
the namespace for your Android app you

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320
the namespace for your Android app you
 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.380
the namespace for your Android app you
got to turn on the api's you got an 8

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390
got to turn on the api's you got an 8
 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.240
got to turn on the api's you got an 8
gotta get an API key for that oh sorry I

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250
gotta get an API key for that oh sorry I
 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.180
gotta get an API key for that oh sorry I
forgot you got to get the sha-1 key for

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190
forgot you got to get the sha-1 key for
 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.830
forgot you got to get the sha-1 key for
your development machine first right and

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840
your development machine first right and
 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.060
your development machine first right and
then you got to go back and there's all

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070
then you got to go back and there's all
 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.949
then you got to go back and there's all
these ugly steps that you got to go

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959
these ugly steps that you got to go
 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.630
these ugly steps that you got to go
through and all these hoops that you've

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640
through and all these hoops that you've
 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.460
through and all these hoops that you've
got to go through just to get an API key

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470
got to go through just to get an API key
 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.500
got to go through just to get an API key
so that you can build a mapping app and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510
so that you can build a mapping app and
 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.280
so that you can build a mapping app and
it's like that's it's not necessary it's

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290
it's like that's it's not necessary it's
 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.810
it's like that's it's not necessary it's
a lot of friction particularly for new

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820
a lot of friction particularly for new
 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.820
a lot of friction particularly for new
developers but it's one thing that we've

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830
developers but it's one thing that we've
 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.289
developers but it's one thing that we've
really improved I believe in the new

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299
really improved I believe in the new
 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.630
really improved I believe in the new
Android studio and the idea is like if

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640
Android studio and the idea is like if
 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.550
Android studio and the idea is like if
you use the Maps template you get an XML

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560
you use the Maps template you get an XML
 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.560
you use the Maps template you get an XML
file it's called like map activity dot

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570
file it's called like map activity dot
 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.090
file it's called like map activity dot
XML or something like that and it looks

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100
XML or something like that and it looks
 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.949
XML or something like that and it looks
a little bit like this and if you can

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959
a little bit like this and if you can
 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.479
a little bit like this and if you can

there's a URL and that URL is generated

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070
there's a URL and that URL is generated
 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.710
there's a URL and that URL is generated
dynamically for you based on your app

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720
dynamically for you based on your app
 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.590
dynamically for you based on your app
and it remembers the name space it gets

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600
and it remembers the name space it gets
 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.930
and it remembers the name space it gets
the sha-1 key all that kind of stuff you

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940
the sha-1 key all that kind of stuff you
 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.240
the sha-1 key all that kind of stuff you
paste that URL into your browser you get

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250
paste that URL into your browser you get
 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.010
paste that URL into your browser you get
your API key back and you paste your API

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020
your API key back and you paste your API
 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.290
your API key back and you paste your API
key into that and you're done so all

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300
key into that and you're done so all
 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.270
key into that and you're done so all
those ugly hoops that I was talking

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280
those ugly hoops that I was talking
 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.520
those ugly hoops that I was talking
about

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530
about
 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.080
about
all that you know all that stuff that

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090
all that you know all that stuff that
 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.360
all that you know all that stuff that
gave people like me a job teaching you

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370
gave people like me a job teaching you
 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.840
gave people like me a job teaching you

had three modules in it and like most of

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850
had three modules in it and like most of
 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.340
had three modules in it and like most of
the first module is teaching you how to

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350
the first module is teaching you how to
 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.170
the first module is teaching you how to
jump through all those hoops so it's a

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180
jump through all those hoops so it's a
 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.370
jump through all those hoops so it's a
lot of time that I had to spend

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380
lot of time that I had to spend
 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.200
lot of time that I had to spend
recording it but more importantly it's a

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210
recording it but more importantly it's a
 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.520
recording it but more importantly it's a
lot of time that you guys have to spend

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530
lot of time that you guys have to spend
 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.530
lot of time that you guys have to spend
watching it in order to like figure out

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540
watching it in order to like figure out
 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.610
watching it in order to like figure out
how to jump through these hoops but

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620
how to jump through these hoops but
 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.680
how to jump through these hoops but
thankfully this new template that ships

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690
thankfully this new template that ships
 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.659
thankfully this new template that ships
with Android studio takes all of that

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669
with Android studio takes all of that
 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.030
with Android studio takes all of that
complexity away from you and gets you

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040
complexity away from you and gets you
 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.340
complexity away from you and gets you
quicker at producing Maps and when I'm

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350
quicker at producing Maps and when I'm
 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.690
quicker at producing Maps and when I'm
talking about perf I'm not just talking

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700
talking about perf I'm not just talking
 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.210
talking about perf I'm not just talking
about run time perform developer perf as

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220
about run time perform developer perf as
 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.860
about run time perform developer perf as
well your own performance and hopefully

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870
well your own performance and hopefully
 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.390
well your own performance and hopefully
this will get you into using Maps a lot

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400
this will get you into using Maps a lot
 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.340
this will get you into using Maps a lot
more quickly a lot more easily and you

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350
more quickly a lot more easily and you
 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.570
more quickly a lot more easily and you
know a lot more friendly so that you can

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580
know a lot more friendly so that you can
 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.790
know a lot more friendly so that you can
focus on what you're doing okay tip

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800
focus on what you're doing okay tip
 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.040
focus on what you're doing okay tip
number two is to think about light mode

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050
number two is to think about light mode
 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.700
number two is to think about light mode
Maps

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710
Maps
 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.040
Maps
now it's all very easy to put a map into

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050
now it's all very easy to put a map into
 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.750
now it's all very easy to put a map into
your application but I've seen

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760
your application but I've seen
 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.550
your application but I've seen
applications I'll give one example it

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560
applications I'll give one example it
 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.370
applications I'll give one example it
was for Sports Complex near where I live

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380
was for Sports Complex near where I live
 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.650
was for Sports Complex near where I live
and they had this application and they

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660
and they had this application and they
 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.120
and they had this application and they
asked me to like how can they make this

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130
asked me to like how can they make this
 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.620
asked me to like how can they make this
application fast there are some of their

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630
application fast there are some of their
 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.000
application fast there are some of their
users have been complaining about it and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010
users have been complaining about it and
 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.680
users have been complaining about it and
they had a map in the application which

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690
they had a map in the application which
 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.540
they had a map in the application which
was directions to where they are and

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550
was directions to where they are and
 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.730
was directions to where they are and
that's all the map did but they had the

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740
that's all the map did but they had the
 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.529
that's all the map did but they had the
full map in there with all of the

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539
full map in there with all of the
 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:45.940
full map in there with all of the
controls and all the panning and zooming

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950
controls and all the panning and zooming
 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.680
controls and all the panning and zooming
and all that kind of stuff and they use

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690
and all that kind of stuff and they use
 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.090
and all that kind of stuff and they use
the full control and it took them time

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100
the full control and it took them time
 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.250
the full control and it took them time
to develop for that when most of the

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260
to develop for that when most of the
 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.080
to develop for that when most of the
functionality that that gives you for

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090
functionality that that gives you for
 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.779
functionality that that gives you for
all that extra weight they never used so

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789
all that extra weight they never used so
 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.180
all that extra weight they never used so
it's a common mistake that developers

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190
it's a common mistake that developers
 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.980
it's a common mistake that developers
make because they're not aware of light

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990
make because they're not aware of light
 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.050
make because they're not aware of light
mode maps and we have light mode Maps

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060
mode maps and we have light mode Maps
 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.670
mode maps and we have light mode Maps
now it shipped like a few months back

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680
now it shipped like a few months back
 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.150
now it shipped like a few months back
with what for Google Maps and if you

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160
with what for Google Maps and if you
 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.130
with what for Google Maps and if you
follow this you're awry or it'll you

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140
follow this you're awry or it'll you
 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.450
follow this you're awry or it'll you
know you can learn about it but the idea

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460
know you can learn about it but the idea
 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.700
know you can learn about it but the idea
is that you trade off a little bit of

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710
is that you trade off a little bit of
 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.560
is that you trade off a little bit of
the interaction in favor of having a

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570
the interaction in favor of having a
 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.450
the interaction in favor of having a
much lighter map within your application

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460
much lighter map within your application
 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.770
much lighter map within your application
and some of the things that are

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780
and some of the things that are
 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.320
and some of the things that are
available to you so I can't see my

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330
available to you so I can't see my
 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.270
available to you so I can't see my
slides because of my screen issue so I

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280
slides because of my screen issue so I
 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.130
slides because of my screen issue so I
have to keep turning back just for one

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140
have to keep turning back just for one
 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.650
have to keep turning back just for one
sec like some of the things that are

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660
sec like some of the things that are
 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.740
sec like some of the things that are
available to you is going back to this

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750
available to you is going back to this
 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.719

after that's talking about one thing

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960
after that's talking about one thing
 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.300
after that's talking about one thing
that they really wanted to do is okay

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310
that they really wanted to do is okay

well if you can touch on the map then

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.140
well if you can touch on the map then
 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.170
well if you can touch on the map then
can it navigate from where you are now

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180
can it navigate from where you are now
 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.480

get there so guess what lightmaps will

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240
get there so guess what lightmaps will
 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.850
get there so guess what lightmaps will
actually give that you can launch an

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860
actually give that you can launch an
 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.650
actually give that you can launch an
activity you can launch a view or

activity you can launch a view or
 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.210
activity you can launch a view or
directions request from that so you

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:49.220
directions request from that so you
 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.010
directions request from that so you
don't lose that by going to light maps

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020
don't lose that by going to light maps
 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.590

to draw on your map like maybe draw a
 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.810
to draw on your map like maybe draw a
circle around the area that you cover or

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820
circle around the area that you cover or
 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.420

in API maps and by that what I mean is

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440
in API maps and by that what I mean is
 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.870
in API maps and by that what I mean is
that's calculating the latitude and

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:13.880
that's calculating the latitude and
 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.300
that's calculating the latitude and
longitude offset based on the pixels on

marker support this is one of the
 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.870
marker support this is one of the
trade-offs if you build an application

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880
trade-offs if you build an application
 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.060

are static then you know you don't have
 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.390
are static then you know you don't have
to trade that off if you're gonna use

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400
to trade that off if you're gonna use
 

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.910

type of thing with light maps you'd

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:07.220
type of thing with light maps you'd
 

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.890
type of thing with light maps you'd
still need to have the full you know

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:08.900
still need to have the full you know
 

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.540

Google Maps experience to be able to

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:10.550
Google Maps experience to be able to
 

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.160
Google Maps experience to be able to
take advantage of that but if you're

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.170
take advantage of that but if you're
 

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.390
take advantage of that but if you're
thinking about your application if

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400
thinking about your application if
 

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.920
thinking about your application if
you're thinking about you know you just

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:14.930
you're thinking about you know you just
 

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.420
you're thinking about you know you just
need a basic map in your application

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:16.430
need a basic map in your application
 

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.950
need a basic map in your application
that maybe have some polylines maybe has

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:17.960
that maybe have some polylines maybe has
 

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.230
that maybe have some polylines maybe has
some markers you can but you still need

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240
some markers you can but you still need
 

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.180
some markers you can but you still need
to maybe launch out to navigation light

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:22.190
to maybe launch out to navigation light
 

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.590

mode maps will work for you and then

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:23.600
mode maps will work for you and then
 

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.150
mode maps will work for you and then
it's much much lighter and it'll perform

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:25.160
it's much much lighter and it'll perform
 

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.990
it's much much lighter and it'll perform
a lot better within your app okay so tip

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:29.000
a lot better within your app okay so tip
 

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.570
a lot better within your app okay so tip

task that I have as a developer to

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:12.260
task that I have as a developer to
 

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.870
task that I have as a developer to
actually build a map to plot that is

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880
actually build a map to plot that is
 

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.810
actually build a map to plot that is
insanely easy now consider that if

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:16.820
insanely easy now consider that if
 

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.130
insanely easy now consider that if
you're building an application that

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:18.140
you're building an application that
 

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.960
you're building an application that
maybe needs to plot a lot of pins on a

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:19.970
maybe needs to plot a lot of pins on a
 

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.230
maybe needs to plot a lot of pins on a
map how would you do that you might have

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.240
map how would you do that you might have
 

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.910
map how would you do that you might have
your server that's like generating these

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:24.920
your server that's like generating these
 

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.770
your server that's like generating these
pins dynamically and you've probably

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:26.780
pins dynamically and you've probably
 

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.810
pins dynamically and you've probably
rolled your own data format in order to

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:28.820
rolled your own data format in order to
 

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.060
rolled your own data format in order to
download that and then on the mobile

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:31.070
download that and then on the mobile
 

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.620
download that and then on the mobile
phone you have to write your own parser

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:32.630
phone you have to write your own parser
 

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.500
phone you have to write your own parser
to parse that and to plot them and we're

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:35.510
to parse that and to plot them and we're
 

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.850
to parse that and to plot them and we're
all smart developers that's something

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:36.860
all smart developers that's something
 

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.180
all smart developers that's something
that we can all do but have we optimized

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:40.190
that we can all do but have we optimized
 

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.890
that we can all do but have we optimized
that the first time we've built it have

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:41.900
that the first time we've built it have
 

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.110
that the first time we've built it have
we optimized the data transfer the very

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:44.120
we optimized the data transfer the very
 

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.490
we optimized the data transfer the very
first time we've done it have we

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:45.500
first time we've done it have we
 

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.500
first time we've done it have we
optimized the client for consuming that

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:47.510
optimized the client for consuming that
 

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.330
optimized the client for consuming that
and plotting those pins the very first

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:49.340
and plotting those pins the very first
 

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.590
and plotting those pins the very first
time we've done it the answer is

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:50.600
time we've done it the answer is
 

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.840
time we've done it the answer is
probably no and the answer is like we

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:52.850
probably no and the answer is like we
 

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.610
probably no and the answer is like we
may have a lot of work to do to actually

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:54.620
may have a lot of work to do to actually
 

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.230
may have a lot of work to do to actually
build a client to be able to plot these

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240
build a client to be able to plot these
 

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.170
build a client to be able to plot these
but if on your server side you encode

00:09:59.170 --> 00:09:59.180
but if on your server side you encode
 

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.120
but if on your server side you encode
these in geo JSON and it's a really

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:01.130
these in geo JSON and it's a really
 

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.190
these in geo JSON and it's a really
straightforward format and then on your

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200
straightforward format and then on your
 

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.800
straightforward format and then on your
client side if you use there's a set of

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:05.810
client side if you use there's a set of
 

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.590
client side if you use there's a set of
utility libraries they will decode the

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:08.600
utility libraries they will decode the
 

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.470
utility libraries they will decode the
geo JSON on your behalf and plot it for

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:11.480
geo JSON on your behalf and plot it for
 

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:11.740
geo JSON on your behalf and plot it for
you

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:11.750

and I'll show a quick demo of an
application that does that and then I'll

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:15.710
application that does that and then I'll
 

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.440

show you how much code and the client

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:17.450
show you how much code and the client
 

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.020
show you how much code and the client

now the pins are beginning to appear so

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:51.450
now the pins are beginning to appear so
 

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:55.340
now the pins are beginning to appear so
this is very simple application I got my

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:55.350
this is very simple application I got my
 

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.260
this is very simple application I got my
map I get my standard controls on my map

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:57.270
map I get my standard controls on my map
 

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.360
map I get my standard controls on my map
I can zoom into my map I see these pins

00:10:59.360 --> 00:10:59.370
I can zoom into my map I see these pins
 

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.550
I can zoom into my map I see these pins
these pins are colored based on the

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560
these pins are colored based on the
 

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.710
these pins are colored based on the
earthquake magnitude so we can see like

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720
earthquake magnitude so we can see like
 

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.560
earthquake magnitude so we can see like
a green pin here was a magnitude of 1.69

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:06.570
a green pin here was a magnitude of 1.69
 

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.620
a green pin here was a magnitude of 1.69
earthquake and this blue pin was like I

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:09.630
earthquake and this blue pin was like I
 

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.720
earthquake and this blue pin was like I
guess a magnitude of less than one so

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:11.730
guess a magnitude of less than one so
 

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.610
guess a magnitude of less than one so
the amount of lines of code to actually

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:13.620
the amount of lines of code to actually
 

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.670
the amount of lines of code to actually
do this where it's about two lines of

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680
do this where it's about two lines of
 

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.730
do this where it's about two lines of
code to consume the Geo JSON and to plot

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:19.740
code to consume the Geo JSON and to plot
 

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.650
code to consume the Geo JSON and to plot
it on a map I'll show that code in a

it on a map I'll show that code in a
 

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.500
it on a map I'll show that code in a
second but as you can see typical map

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:24.510
second but as you can see typical map
 

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.230

lots of pins very very easy to develop

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240
lots of pins very very easy to develop
 

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:34.400
lots of pins very very easy to develop
now the URL this is one of those Linux

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:34.410
now the URL this is one of those Linux
 

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.650
now the URL this is one of those Linux
laptops with a really large screen

but I would say also argue for
 

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.829
but I would say also argue for
performance of like if you need to plot

a lot of pins on your map and these pins

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:54.940
a lot of pins on your map and these pins
 

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.430
a lot of pins on your map and these pins
are something that your app you need to

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.440
are something that your app you need to
 

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.470
are something that your app you need to
generate server-side like one

application that I had written I had to
 

00:13:20.529 --> 00:13:22.139
application that I had written I had to
write a custom parser to parse that data

00:13:22.139 --> 00:13:22.149
write a custom parser to parse that data
 

00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:23.790

to plot it to pin it all that kind of

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:23.800
to plot it to pin it all that kind of

geo JSON and let me drag my geo JSON

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:28.390
geo JSON and let me drag my geo JSON
 

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:36.150
geo JSON and let me drag my geo JSON
over a full screen first and you can see

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160
over a full screen first and you can see
 

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.860
over a full screen first and you can see
a little bit what geo JSON looks like in

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:37.870
a little bit what geo JSON looks like in
 

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.569
a little bit what geo JSON looks like in
the browser it's pretty straightforward

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:39.579
the browser it's pretty straightforward
 

00:13:39.579 --> 00:13:42.300
the browser it's pretty straightforward
JSON code so this is the code that was

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:42.310
JSON code so this is the code that was
 

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.800
JSON code so this is the code that was
generated by the US government's

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:43.810
generated by the US government's
 

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:45.750
generated by the US government's
earthquake service and you can see it's

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760
earthquake service and you can see it's
 

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.430
earthquake service and you can see it's
you know you have JSON where you just

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440
you know you have JSON where you just
 

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.769
you know you have JSON where you just
say it's like it's been generated it's

00:13:49.769 --> 00:13:49.779
say it's like it's been generated it's
 

00:13:49.779 --> 00:13:51.480
say it's like it's been generated it's
there's a time there's a time that was

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:51.490
there's a time there's a time that was
 

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.280
there's a time there's a time that was
updated but ultimately there's a

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:53.290
updated but ultimately there's a
 

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.720
updated but ultimately there's a
latitude and there's a longitude and

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:54.730
latitude and there's a longitude and
 

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.150

there's metadata about the event and all

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160
there's metadata about the event and all

there's metadata about the event and all
I did load a JSON object with this code

00:14:00.259 --> 00:14:00.269
I did load a JSON object with this code
 

00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:03.569
I did load a JSON object with this code
created geo JSON layer add the geo JSON

00:14:03.569 --> 00:14:03.579
created geo JSON layer add the geo JSON
 

00:14:03.579 --> 00:14:05.189
created geo JSON layer add the geo JSON
layer to the map and I was done in

00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:05.199
layer to the map and I was done in
 

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:07.439
layer to the map and I was done in
creating that mobile application that we

00:14:07.439 --> 00:14:07.449
creating that mobile application that we
 

00:14:07.449 --> 00:14:08.880
creating that mobile application that we
saw earlier that was plotting these pins

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:08.890
saw earlier that was plotting these pins
 

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.759
saw earlier that was plotting these pins
I think it's pretty cool

00:14:10.759 --> 00:14:10.769
I think it's pretty cool
 

00:14:10.769 --> 00:14:21.290
I think it's pretty cool
okay in addition to that let me go back

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.300
 

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.910
so that was a code for using geo Jason

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920
so that was a code for using geo Jason
 

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.800
so that was a code for using geo Jason
in addition to that there's also KML

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:25.810
in addition to that there's also KML
 

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:29.069
in addition to that there's also KML
there's very similar context but KML is

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:29.079
there's very similar context but KML is
 

00:14:29.079 --> 00:14:30.930
there's very similar context but KML is
usually used for drawing like outlines

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:30.940
usually used for drawing like outlines
 

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.090
usually used for drawing like outlines
on a map so for example you may have

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:33.100
on a map so for example you may have
 

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.220
on a map so for example you may have
seen maps that show the Googleplex and

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:35.230
seen maps that show the Googleplex and
 

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.040
seen maps that show the Googleplex and
has outlines of the actual buildings and

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:38.050
has outlines of the actual buildings and
 

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:39.810
has outlines of the actual buildings and
the googolplex and when you go down to

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:39.820
the googolplex and when you go down to
 

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.160
the googolplex and when you go down to
them then you have different floors and

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:41.170
them then you have different floors and
 

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.630
them then you have different floors and
you can see like what's on different

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:42.640
you can see like what's on different
 

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.980
you can see like what's on different
floors or maybe you see that in shopping

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:43.990
floors or maybe you see that in shopping
 

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.900
floors or maybe you see that in shopping
malls there's a great one on a Google

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:45.910
malls there's a great one on a Google
 

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.329
malls there's a great one on a Google
Maps the language KML is a markup

00:14:48.329 --> 00:14:48.339
Maps the language KML is a markup
 

00:14:48.339 --> 00:14:50.250
Maps the language KML is a markup
language that's used to define that and

again if on your server side you need to
 

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.460
again if on your server side you need to
generate some type of dynamic floor or

generate some type of dynamic floor or
outlines on a map why not generate it as

00:14:59.069 --> 00:14:59.079
outlines on a map why not generate it as
 

00:14:59.079 --> 00:15:01.199

of the best restaurants in the city I'm

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:23.529
of the best restaurants in the city I'm
 

00:16:23.529 --> 00:16:25.470
of the best restaurants in the city I'm
gonna go visit it and what it is it's

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:25.480
gonna go visit it and what it is it's
 

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.180
gonna go visit it and what it is it's
for rehabilitating the prisoners they

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:27.190
for rehabilitating the prisoners they
 

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.519
for rehabilitating the prisoners they
give them jobs as chefs and it's you

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:29.529
give them jobs as chefs and it's you
 

00:16:29.529 --> 00:16:30.790
give them jobs as chefs and it's you
know waiters and all I can

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800
know waiters and all I can
 

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.320
know waiters and all I can
and people say it's one of the best

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:32.330
and people say it's one of the best
 

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.790
and people say it's one of the best
restaurants in the city I discovered it

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800
restaurants in the city I discovered it
 

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.350
restaurants in the city I discovered it
when I was you know looking for

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360
when I was you know looking for
 

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.090
when I was you know looking for
something that you know something

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:37.100
something that you know something
 

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.910
something that you know something
completely different but anyway so the

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920
completely different but anyway so the
 

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.500
completely different but anyway so the
problem with a map like this one and

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:41.510
problem with a map like this one and
 

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.180
problem with a map like this one and
when I took the screenshot I was using a

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:43.190
when I took the screenshot I was using a
 

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.430
when I took the screenshot I was using a
really cheap Chromebook when I was

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440
really cheap Chromebook when I was
 

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.720
really cheap Chromebook when I was
searching for this it's like a hundred

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:46.730
searching for this it's like a hundred
 

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.550
searching for this it's like a hundred
dollar Chromebook and when I have a map

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560
dollar Chromebook and when I have a map
 

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.350
dollar Chromebook and when I have a map
like this I can only see a limited part

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:50.360
like this I can only see a limited part
 

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.180
like this I can only see a limited part
of the city and I've got all these dots

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:52.190
of the city and I've got all these dots
 

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.730
of the city and I've got all these dots
on this map and if I pan this map around

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:54.740
on this map and if I pan this map around
 

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.190
on this map and if I pan this map around
there's several hundred dots here they

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:57.200
there's several hundred dots here they
 

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.410
there's several hundred dots here they
have to pan around as well if i zoom in

00:16:59.410 --> 00:16:59.420
have to pan around as well if i zoom in
 

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.329
have to pan around as well if i zoom in
and out the map has to plot where these

00:17:01.329 --> 00:17:01.339
and out the map has to plot where these
 

00:17:01.339 --> 00:17:03.190
and out the map has to plot where these
are and as you can imagine that can be

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:03.200
are and as you can imagine that can be
 

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.380
are and as you can imagine that can be
very very slow particularly on a really

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:05.390
very very slow particularly on a really
 

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:09.309
very very slow particularly on a really
cheap Chromebook and so you know it my

00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319
cheap Chromebook and so you know it my
 

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.740
cheap Chromebook and so you know it my
experience in using this was very very

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:11.750
experience in using this was very very
 

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.740
experience in using this was very very
poor but clustering and here's another

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:14.750
poor but clustering and here's another
 

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.919
poor but clustering and here's another
example of when you you can cluster pins

00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:17.929
example of when you you can cluster pins
 

00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:20.319
example of when you you can cluster pins
together so that the map is smart enough

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:20.329
together so that the map is smart enough
 

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:22.179
together so that the map is smart enough
that it determines that if there's a

00:17:22.179 --> 00:17:22.189
that it determines that if there's a
 

00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:24.819
that it determines that if there's a
over a certain number of pins in a

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:24.829
over a certain number of pins in a
 

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.010
over a certain number of pins in a
specific location instead of plotting

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:27.020
specific location instead of plotting
 

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.140
specific location instead of plotting
all of those pins it will gather those

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:29.150
all of those pins it will gather those
 

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.880
all of those pins it will gather those
pins together and plot one entity

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:30.890
pins together and plot one entity
 

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.560
pins together and plot one entity
instead and if you were looking this is

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:32.570
instead and if you were looking this is
 

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.480
instead and if you were looking this is
a map of London and if you look here I

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:34.490
a map of London and if you look here I
 

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.100
a map of London and if you look here I
believe there's about there's over a

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:36.110
believe there's about there's over a
 

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.740
believe there's about there's over a
thousand items actually plotted on this

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:38.750
thousand items actually plotted on this
 

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.990
thousand items actually plotted on this
map you can see there's four 200 there's

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000
map you can see there's four 200 there's
 

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.850
map you can see there's four 200 there's
a hundred there's a couple of 50s and as

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:42.860
a hundred there's a couple of 50s and as
 

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.650
a hundred there's a couple of 50s and as
well a thousand and seventy items

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:44.660
well a thousand and seventy items
 

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.020
well a thousand and seventy items
actually being plotted on this map but

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:47.030
actually being plotted on this map but
 

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.930
actually being plotted on this map but
the number of things being drawn on the

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:49.940
the number of things being drawn on the
 

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.490
the number of things being drawn on the
map is is it nine yeah

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:51.500
map is is it nine yeah
 

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.530
map is is it nine yeah
there's nine items so if I like zoom

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:53.540
there's nine items so if I like zoom
 

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.330
there's nine items so if I like zoom
this map around I'm only moving nine

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:55.340
this map around I'm only moving nine
 

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.940
this map around I'm only moving nine
items and if i zoom in then it will reap

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:57.950
items and if i zoom in then it will reap
 

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.070
items and if i zoom in then it will reap
lot this I mean I can show a live demo

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080
lot this I mean I can show a live demo
 

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.630
lot this I mean I can show a live demo
later if anybody wants to see it I'm

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:01.640
later if anybody wants to see it I'm
 

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.040
later if anybody wants to see it I'm
having troubles with this screen so I

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.050
having troubles with this screen so I
 

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.720
having troubles with this screen so I
won't show it now but if you've seen

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:04.730
won't show it now but if you've seen
 

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.310
won't show it now but if you've seen
clusters before if you zoom in then it

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320
clusters before if you zoom in then it
 

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.080
clusters before if you zoom in then it
will pick you know the location that

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:08.090
will pick you know the location that
 

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:09.250
will pick you know the location that
you're in and it will intelligently

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:09.260
you're in and it will intelligently
 

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.200
you're in and it will intelligently
cluster them but the idea behind that

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:11.210
cluster them but the idea behind that
 

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.909
cluster them but the idea behind that
first of all the great user experience

00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:12.919
first of all the great user experience
 

00:18:12.919 --> 00:18:15.190
first of all the great user experience
but second of all performance because as

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200
but second of all performance because as
 

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.560
but second of all performance because as
the user pans as the user zooms around

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:17.570
the user pans as the user zooms around
 

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.659
the user pans as the user zooms around
you're only moving eight nine ten

00:18:19.659 --> 00:18:19.669
you're only moving eight nine ten
 

00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:21.820
you're only moving eight nine ten
entities instead of a thousand entities

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:21.830
entities instead of a thousand entities
 

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.620

which I'd be moving if I tried to pan

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:23.630
which I'd be moving if I tried to pan
 

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.140

this map without clustering so

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:25.150
this map without clustering so
 

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.310
this map without clustering so
clustering not a bad word it's a good

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320
clustering not a bad word it's a good
 

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.960
clustering not a bad word it's a good
thing I'll skip over the demo for the

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:28.970
thing I'll skip over the demo for the
 

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.970
thing I'll skip over the demo for the
time being and I'll show the code again

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:30.980
time being and I'll show the code again
 

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.890
time being and I'll show the code again
the code is really really simple if

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:32.900
the code is really really simple if
 

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.919
the code is really really simple if
you're reading your clusters in so you

00:18:35.919 --> 00:18:35.929
you're reading your clusters in so you
 

00:18:35.929 --> 00:18:37.870
you're reading your clusters in so you
there's we provide an object in the

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880
there's we provide an object in the
 

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.790
there's we provide an object in the
utils library called a cluster manager

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:39.800
utils library called a cluster manager
 

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.460
utils library called a cluster manager
and you create a cluster manager for

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:42.470
and you create a cluster manager for
 

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.240
and you create a cluster manager for
your map as you can see here I have

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:44.250
your map as you can see here I have
 

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.070
your map as you can see here I have
cluster manager is new cluster manager

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080
cluster manager is new cluster manager
 

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.820
cluster manager is new cluster manager
of item and just this don't get map and

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:49.830
of item and just this don't get map and
 

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.430
of item and just this don't get map and
then I have cluster items and if I store

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440
then I have cluster items and if I store
 

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.399
then I have cluster items and if I store
my locations as a cluster item I'm sorry

00:18:55.399 --> 00:18:55.409
my locations as a cluster item I'm sorry
 

00:18:55.409 --> 00:18:57.620
my locations as a cluster item I'm sorry
if I store my like just general my I

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:57.630
if I store my like just general my I
 

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.960
if I store my like just general my I
have a collection of my locations if I

00:18:59.960 --> 00:18:59.970
have a collection of my locations if I
 

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.419
have a collection of my locations if I
create a cluster item from that location

00:19:02.419 --> 00:19:02.429
create a cluster item from that location
 

00:19:02.429 --> 00:19:05.570
create a cluster item from that location
and then add those cluster items to the

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:05.580
and then add those cluster items to the
 

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.520
and then add those cluster items to the
cluster manager and then render the map

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:07.530
cluster manager and then render the map
 

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.010
cluster manager and then render the map
all of that hard work of managing the

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020
all of that hard work of managing the
 

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.710
all of that hard work of managing the
clusters of drawing is it 200 in this

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720
clusters of drawing is it 200 in this
 

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.500
clusters of drawing is it 200 in this

this the data points that were collected
 

00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:24.139
this the data points that were collected
were like you know the longitude

00:21:24.139 --> 00:21:24.149
were like you know the longitude
 

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:26.419
were like you know the longitude

now to be fair on this service they have
a lot more data than just latitude and

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.500
a lot more data than just latitude and

you know when I'm drawing a line all I
 

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.779
you know when I'm drawing a line all I
want is latitude and longitude so a lot

00:21:47.779 --> 00:21:47.789
want is latitude and longitude so a lot
 

00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:49.669
want is latitude and longitude so a lot
of that data is also a lot of that size

00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679
of that data is also a lot of that size
 

00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:51.440
of that data is also a lot of that size
is because of really useful data like

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:51.450
is because of really useful data like
 

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.090
is because of really useful data like
speed and elevation excuse me and that

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:53.100
speed and elevation excuse me and that
 

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.519
speed and elevation excuse me and that
type of thing but when I take a look at

00:21:55.519 --> 00:21:55.529
type of thing but when I take a look at
 

00:21:55.529 --> 00:21:58.639
type of thing but when I take a look at
if I want to just draw a line like in my

or plots anything on a map and you need

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:22.950
or plots anything on a map and you need
 

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.950
or plots anything on a map and you need
to store that data consider polyline

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960
to store that data consider polyline
 

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.149

algorithm now it's quite an involved

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720
algorithm now it's quite an involved
 

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.169
algorithm now it's quite an involved
algorithm but it basically turns the

00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:30.179
algorithm but it basically turns the
 

00:22:30.179 --> 00:22:32.240
algorithm but it basically turns the
latitude and longitude numbers into its

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:32.250
latitude and longitude numbers into its
 

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.639

string encodes them ASCII encodes them

00:22:34.639 --> 00:22:34.649
string encodes them ASCII encodes them
 

00:22:34.649 --> 00:22:36.320
string encodes them ASCII encodes them
and it takes about eight to ten bytes

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:36.330
and it takes about eight to ten bytes
 

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.169

to do that and that's where I came with

00:22:40.519 --> 00:22:40.529
to do that and that's where I came with
 

00:22:40.529 --> 00:22:43.039
to do that and that's where I came with
like 30k for three thousand odd points

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:43.049
like 30k for three thousand odd points

to write it yourself because we've

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360
to write it yourself because we've
 

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.779
to write it yourself because we've
written it for you so if you want to get

00:22:59.779 --> 00:22:59.789
written it for you so if you want to get
 

00:22:59.789 --> 00:23:01.310
written it for you so if you want to get
it set of data and you want a polyline

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320
it set of data and you want a polyline
 

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.710
it set of data and you want a polyline
encode it you can do so so on your

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720
encode it you can do so so on your
 

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.510
encode it you can do so so on your
server for example you could polyline

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520
server for example you could polyline
 

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.600
server for example you could polyline
encoding like this so it's 30k instead

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:08.610

gonna download that 30k string and the
 

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.360
gonna download that 30k string and the
libraries will decode that for you into

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:15.370
libraries will decode that for you into
 

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:16.799
libraries will decode that for you into
a set of points that you can then plot

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:16.809
a set of points that you can then plot
 

00:23:16.809 --> 00:23:19.830
a set of points that you can then plot
on a map like this so again great parfum

they've taken of these restaurants but
for the user experience you can also use

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200
for the user experience you can also use
 

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.460
for the user experience you can also use
the places ID ID to call the places API

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:11.470
the places ID ID to call the places API
 

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.620

and to get back information that Google

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:13.630
and to get back information that Google
 

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.299
and to get back information that Google
provides about that place such as

00:25:15.299 --> 00:25:15.309
provides about that place such as
 

00:25:15.309 --> 00:25:17.730
provides about that place such as
reviews such as a street view so you can

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:17.740
reviews such as a street view so you can
 

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.960
reviews such as a street view so you can
see what the whole what the restaurant

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:18.970
see what the whole what the restaurant
 

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.480
see what the whole what the restaurant
looks like such as the online menu and

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:21.490
looks like such as the online menu and
 

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:22.840

flippantly a bad habit that people do is

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:53.860
flippantly a bad habit that people do is
 

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.549
flippantly a bad habit that people do is
to use overlays to segregate data and

00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559
to use overlays to segregate data and
 

00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:57.810
to use overlays to segregate data and
you've got to be really really careful

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:57.820
you've got to be really really careful
 

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.090
you've got to be really really careful
when using overlays so for example in

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:00.100
when using overlays so for example in
 

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.220
when using overlays so for example in
the earthquakes example that I showed

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:02.230
the earthquakes example that I showed
 

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.080
the earthquakes example that I showed
earlier on there were different colored

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:04.090
earlier on there were different colored
 

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:06.029
earlier on there were different colored
pins for different magnitude of

00:30:06.029 --> 00:30:06.039
pins for different magnitude of
 

00:30:06.039 --> 00:30:07.830
pins for different magnitude of
earthquake and there's an argument for

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840
earthquake and there's an argument for
 

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.600
earthquake and there's an argument for
you to put each of these on a different

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:09.610
you to put each of these on a different
 

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.850
you to put each of these on a different
layer so then from the user experience

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:11.860
layer so then from the user experience
 

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.430
layer so then from the user experience
point of view you could say okay turn

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.440
point of view you could say okay turn
 

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.320
point of view you could say okay turn
off the layer of low magnitude

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:16.330
off the layer of low magnitude
 

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:17.820
off the layer of low magnitude
earthquake so I can just see the high

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:17.830
earthquake so I can just see the high
 

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.070
earthquake so I can just see the high
magnitude ones or turn off the you know

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080
magnitude ones or turn off the you know
 

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.720
magnitude ones or turn off the you know
vice-versa that type of thing so the

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:21.730
vice-versa that type of thing so the
 

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:23.610
vice-versa that type of thing so the
user has this really nice experience and

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:23.620
user has this really nice experience and
 

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.259
user has this really nice experience and
it's very easy for you to develop

00:30:25.259 --> 00:30:25.269
it's very easy for you to develop
 

00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:27.389
it's very easy for you to develop
because you know turning layers on and

00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:27.399
because you know turning layers on and
 

00:30:27.399 --> 00:30:29.430
because you know turning layers on and
off is very very simple but you've got

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440
off is very very simple but you've got
 

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.840
off is very very simple but you've got
to be really really careful when using

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:30.850
to be really really careful when using
 

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:33.180
to be really really careful when using
layers and overlays like this because if

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:33.190
layers and overlays like this because if
 

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.100
layers and overlays like this because if
you think about there's say 20 different

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:35.110
you think about there's say 20 different
 

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:37.230
you think about there's say 20 different
types of earthquake magnitude and I now

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:37.240
types of earthquake magnitude and I now
 

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.360
types of earthquake magnitude and I now
have 20 different layers and I'm using a

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:39.370
have 20 different layers and I'm using a
 

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:41.789
have 20 different layers and I'm using a
low powered device if I start dragging

00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:41.799
low powered device if I start dragging
 

00:30:41.799 --> 00:30:44.250
low powered device if I start dragging
my map around I'm replating 20 different

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:44.260
my map around I'm replating 20 different
 

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.200
my map around I'm replating 20 different
layers and each of those pins on each of

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:46.210
layers and each of those pins on each of
 

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.180
layers and each of those pins on each of
those layers has to have its relative

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:48.190
those layers has to have its relative
 

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:49.710
those layers has to have its relative
coordinates plotted based on its

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:49.720
coordinates plotted based on its
 

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.659
coordinates plotted based on its
latitude and longitude and perf can be

00:30:51.659 --> 00:30:51.669
latitude and longitude and perf can be
 

00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:54.480
latitude and longitude and perf can be
killed as a result so my recommendation

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:54.490
killed as a result so my recommendation
 

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.009
killed as a result so my recommendation
would be unless you absolutely have to

00:30:56.009 --> 00:30:56.019
would be unless you absolutely have to
 

00:30:56.019 --> 00:30:58.409
would be unless you absolutely have to
use layers avoid using too many of them

00:30:58.409 --> 00:30:58.419
use layers avoid using too many of them
 

00:30:58.419 --> 00:31:00.360
use layers avoid using too many of them
great examples of layers you probably

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:00.370
great examples of layers you probably
 

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.799
great examples of layers you probably
see in Google Maps like traffic is a

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:01.809
see in Google Maps like traffic is a
 

00:31:01.809 --> 00:31:04.320
see in Google Maps like traffic is a
good layer so like I like when I'm using

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:04.330
good layer so like I like when I'm using
 

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.409
good layer so like I like when I'm using
Google Maps that I don't see traffic

00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419
Google Maps that I don't see traffic
 

00:31:06.419 --> 00:31:09.090
Google Maps that I don't see traffic
until I ask for it and then I turn on

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:09.100
until I ask for it and then I turn on
 

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.889
until I ask for it and then I turn on
the traffic layer and if I'm dragging my

00:31:10.889 --> 00:31:10.899
the traffic layer and if I'm dragging my
 

00:31:10.899 --> 00:31:13.139
the traffic layer and if I'm dragging my

map around to see my location say from
 

00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:16.080
map around to see my location say from
here to the airport then I understand

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:16.090
here to the airport then I understand
 

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:17.460
here to the airport then I understand
that I'm getting a perfect because of

that I'm getting a perfect because of
 

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.409
that I'm getting a perfect because of
all this extra data but I've asked for

00:31:19.409 --> 00:31:19.419
all this extra data but I've asked for
 

00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:20.970
all this extra data but I've asked for
this extra data so it definitely

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:20.980
this extra data so it definitely
 

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.259
this extra data so it definitely
recommend that when you're using

00:31:22.259 --> 00:31:22.269
recommend that when you're using
 

00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:24.840
recommend that when you're using
overlays you know just be very very

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:24.850
overlays you know just be very very
 

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.669
overlays you know just be very very
careful about using them design your

00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:26.679
careful about using them design your
 

00:31:26.679 --> 00:31:29.009
careful about using them design your
application sensibly so that the number

00:31:29.009 --> 00:31:29.019
application sensibly so that the number
 

00:31:29.019 --> 00:31:30.960
application sensibly so that the number
of overlays that you're using is really

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:30.970
of overlays that you're using is really
 

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:32.850
of overlays that you're using is really
based on what the user needs and don't

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:32.860
based on what the user needs and don't
 

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.649
based on what the user needs and don't
forget to give you users the option of

00:31:34.649 --> 00:31:34.659
forget to give you users the option of
 

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:35.909
forget to give you users the option of
course like in the case of the traffic

00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919
course like in the case of the traffic
 

00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:39.750
course like in the case of the traffic
one to turn overlays on and off ok tip 9

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760
one to turn overlays on and off ok tip 9
 

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.789
one to turn overlays on and off ok tip 9
using beacons and the demo gods haven't

00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799
using beacons and the demo gods haven't
 

00:31:41.799 --> 00:31:43.500
using beacons and the demo gods haven't
really been with me today so I can't

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:43.510
really been with me today so I can't
 

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.940
really been with me today so I can't
really demo this but how many of you

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:44.950
really demo this but how many of you
 

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:49.500
really demo this but how many of you
have used beacons oh wow are you cool so

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:49.510
have used beacons oh wow are you cool so
 

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:52.049
have used beacons oh wow are you cool so
beacons I find a lot of fun I have a few

00:31:52.049 --> 00:31:52.059
beacons I find a lot of fun I have a few
 

00:31:52.059 --> 00:31:54.029

samples that I've seen with beacons and

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:00.250
samples that I've seen with beacons and
 

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:01.769

what beacons are unless

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:03.220
what beacons are unless
 

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.640
what beacons are unless
thoroughly complicated and they can be

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:05.650
thoroughly complicated and they can be
 

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:07.680
thoroughly complicated and they can be
quite difficult for the user as well as

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:07.690
quite difficult for the user as well as
 

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.120
quite difficult for the user as well as
for the developer let me give an example

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:09.130
for the developer let me give an example
 

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.130
for the developer let me give an example
I've seen a scenario where beacons could

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:11.140
I've seen a scenario where beacons could
 

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.960
I've seen a scenario where beacons could
be used at at bus stop so you put a

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:12.970
be used at at bus stop so you put a
 

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:14.850
be used at at bus stop so you put a
beacon like this on a bus stop and you

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:14.860
beacon like this on a bus stop and you
 

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.950
beacon like this on a bus stop and you
write an application for your phone so

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960
write an application for your phone so
 

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.720
write an application for your phone so
that when your application is open and

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:18.730
that when your application is open and
 

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:20.039
that when your application is open and
it's sniffing for the beacons and

00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:20.049
it's sniffing for the beacons and
 

00:32:20.049 --> 00:32:22.110
it's sniffing for the beacons and
against the ID of this beacon and then

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120
against the ID of this beacon and then
 

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.730
against the ID of this beacon and then
it knows which bus stop that you're at

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:23.740
it knows which bus stop that you're at
 

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.950
it knows which bus stop that you're at
and it will give you a bus schedule for

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:25.960
and it will give you a bus schedule for
 

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.630
and it will give you a bus schedule for
buses at that bus stop great right

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:27.640
buses at that bus stop great right
 

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.700
buses at that bus stop great right
anybody see the drawback trick question

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:31.710
anybody see the drawback trick question
 

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.940
anybody see the drawback trick question
what's that I wasn't thinking in that

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:35.950
what's that I wasn't thinking in that
 

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.190
what's that I wasn't thinking in that
one but yeah that is a good one and the

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200
one but yeah that is a good one and the
 

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.659
one but yeah that is a good one and the
sticky on this isn't very good they keep

00:32:39.659 --> 00:32:39.669
sticky on this isn't very good they keep
 

00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:41.810
sticky on this isn't very good they keep
falling off but more it's a case if this

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:41.820
falling off but more it's a case if this
 

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.310
falling off but more it's a case if this
broadcasts a unique namespace an ID

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320
broadcasts a unique namespace an ID
 

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.490
broadcasts a unique namespace an ID
anyway so why do I need to register I

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:47.500
anyway so why do I need to register I
 

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.860
anyway so why do I need to register I
can just sniff that namespace an ID at

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:49.870
can just sniff that namespace an ID at
 

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.570
can just sniff that namespace an ID at
any points and I can build an

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:51.580
any points and I can build an
 

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.100
any points and I can build an
application that's based on sniffing

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:53.110
application that's based on sniffing
 

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:56.640
application that's based on sniffing
that namespace an ID and in Google a

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:56.650
that namespace an ID and in Google a
 

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:59.190

couple of few weeks back we actually ran

00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200
couple of few weeks back we actually ran
 

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.130
couple of few weeks back we actually ran
a competition for people to build

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:02.140
a competition for people to build
 

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.380
a competition for people to build
applications based on beacons and for

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:04.390
applications based on beacons and for
 

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.930
applications based on beacons and for
the competition I I won a prize in the

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:06.940
the competition I I won a prize in the
 

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.669
the competition I I won a prize in the
competition I came up with the idea of

00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679
competition I came up with the idea of
 

00:33:08.679 --> 00:33:11.010
competition I came up with the idea of
virtualizing these beacons so instead of

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:11.020
virtualizing these beacons so instead of
 

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.720
virtualizing these beacons so instead of
thinking of a beacon in terms of

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:12.730
thinking of a beacon in terms of
 

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:15.659
thinking of a beacon in terms of
absolute sense like this beacon is at

00:33:15.659 --> 00:33:15.669
absolute sense like this beacon is at
 

00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:17.399
absolute sense like this beacon is at
this particular bus stop and needing to

00:33:17.399 --> 00:33:17.409
this particular bus stop and needing to
 

00:33:17.409 --> 00:33:18.720
this particular bus stop and needing to
register and having that kind of thing

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:18.730
register and having that kind of thing
 

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:22.399
register and having that kind of thing
there are scenarios where you want

00:33:22.399 --> 00:33:22.409
there are scenarios where you want
 

00:33:22.409 --> 00:33:25.620
there are scenarios where you want
beacons anywhere to be used to be able

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:25.630
beacons anywhere to be used to be able
 

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.419
beacons anywhere to be used to be able
to do something now that sounds very

00:33:27.419 --> 00:33:27.429
to do something now that sounds very
 

00:33:27.429 --> 00:33:28.980
to do something now that sounds very
vague so let me give an example what I

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:28.990
vague so let me give an example what I
 

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:31.909
vague so let me give an example what I
wrote was a game and my game was a

00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919
wrote was a game and my game was a
 

00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:35.039
wrote was a game and my game was a
virtual tour around some locations so I

00:33:35.039 --> 00:33:35.049
virtual tour around some locations so I
 

00:33:35.049 --> 00:33:36.990
virtual tour around some locations so I
had these three locations I work in

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.000
had these three locations I work in
 

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.669
had these three locations I work in
Google Kirkland I had these three

00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679
Google Kirkland I had these three
 

00:33:38.679 --> 00:33:40.710
Google Kirkland I had these three
beacons around Google Kirkland and I

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720
beacons around Google Kirkland and I
 

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.370
beacons around Google Kirkland and I
knew the ID of these beacons and I built

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:44.380
knew the ID of these beacons and I built
 

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.350
knew the ID of these beacons and I built
a little server-side application that

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360
a little server-side application that
 

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.840
a little server-side application that
said the beacon with this ID is in the

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:48.850
said the beacon with this ID is in the
 

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:51.450
said the beacon with this ID is in the
barista cafe the beacon with this ID is

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:51.460
barista cafe the beacon with this ID is
 

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.039
barista cafe the beacon with this ID is
in a Cara member was in like

00:33:53.039 --> 00:33:53.049
in a Cara member was in like
 

00:33:53.049 --> 00:33:54.750
in a Cara member was in like
registration and the beacon with this ID

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:54.760
registration and the beacon with this ID
 

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.430
registration and the beacon with this ID
is like in such-and-such a meeting room

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440
is like in such-and-such a meeting room
 

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.649
is like in such-and-such a meeting room
and then when somebody played the game

00:33:58.649 --> 00:33:58.659
and then when somebody played the game
 

00:33:58.659 --> 00:34:00.810
and then when somebody played the game
the idea the game was that does this

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:00.820
the idea the game was that does this
 

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.669
the idea the game was that does this
like animate a character who talks to

00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:02.679
like animate a character who talks to
 

00:34:02.679 --> 00:34:04.649
like animate a character who talks to
you through cyberspace I have a picture

00:34:04.649 --> 00:34:04.659
you through cyberspace I have a picture
 

00:34:04.659 --> 00:34:08.099
you through cyberspace I have a picture
of her here this you know or there's a

00:34:08.099 --> 00:34:08.109
of her here this you know or there's a
 

00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:10.050
of her here this you know or there's a
bunch of videos these CGI videos that

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:10.060
bunch of videos these CGI videos that
 

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.849
bunch of videos these CGI videos that
are on YouTube of her talking to you and

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:11.859
are on YouTube of her talking to you and
 

00:34:11.859 --> 00:34:13.980
are on YouTube of her talking to you and
she's guiding in you saying can you go

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:13.990
she's guiding in you saying can you go
 

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:16.200
she's guiding in you saying can you go
to this location and in the location is

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:16.210
to this location and in the location is
 

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:16.600
to this location and in the location is
what

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:16.610
what
 

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:17.770
what
at the bottom in this case it was

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:17.780
at the bottom in this case it was
 

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:19.570
at the bottom in this case it was
building be barista and then you got to

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:19.580
building be barista and then you got to
 

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:20.890
building be barista and then you got to
go there and play a game and then she

00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:20.900
go there and play a game and then she
 

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.510
go there and play a game and then she
tells you to go to the next one and you

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:22.520
tells you to go to the next one and you
 

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.220
tells you to go to the next one and you
go there and play a game but the idea is

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:24.230
go there and play a game but the idea is
 

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:27.070
go there and play a game but the idea is
then by virtualizing the beacons anybody

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:27.080
then by virtualizing the beacons anybody
 

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.190
then by virtualizing the beacons anybody
could take any set of three beacons

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200
could take any set of three beacons
 

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.400
could take any set of three beacons
anywhere

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:30.410
anywhere
 

00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:32.650
anywhere
maybe bus stop beacons or maybe beacons

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:32.660
maybe bus stop beacons or maybe beacons
 

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.150
maybe bus stop beacons or maybe beacons
around the conference centre here and

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:34.160
around the conference centre here and
 

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.000
around the conference centre here and
turn that into the same game you didn't

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.010
turn that into the same game you didn't
 

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:38.800
turn that into the same game you didn't
have to be playing it in Google Kirkland

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:38.810
have to be playing it in Google Kirkland
 

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.540

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800
of the same sound and play it poor dog
 

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.420
of the same sound and play it poor dog
went nuts

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:49.430
went nuts
 

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:51.760
went nuts
Mehcad my daughter wasn't home I open

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:51.770
Mehcad my daughter wasn't home I open
 

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:52.840
Mehcad my daughter wasn't home I open
the garage she had to run out to the

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:52.850
the garage she had to run out to the
 

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:54.460
the garage she had to run out to the
garage he had to run around the garage

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:54.470
garage he had to run around the garage
 

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:55.310
garage he had to run around the garage
that kind of thing and

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:55.320
that kind of thing and
 

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.270
that kind of thing and
took a little while for him to be

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280
took a little while for him to be
 

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.620
took a little while for him to be
satisfied that she wasn't actually there

00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:57.630
satisfied that she wasn't actually there
 

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.180
satisfied that she wasn't actually there
at that point I was tempted to play the

00:40:59.180 --> 00:40:59.190
at that point I was tempted to play the
 

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.820
at that point I was tempted to play the
sound again but I'm not that girl you

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:01.830
sound again but I'm not that girl you
 

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:03.710
sound again but I'm not that girl you
know but it's just it's some of the

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720
know but it's just it's some of the
 

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.940
know but it's just it's some of the
scenarios that can be enabled by

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:04.950
scenarios that can be enabled by
 

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:06.260
scenarios that can be enabled by
geofencing I just think are really

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:06.270
geofencing I just think are really
 

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.760
geofencing I just think are really
really cool you can you can trick your

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:07.770
really cool you can you can trick your
 

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:09.680
really cool you can you can trick your
dog with it or you can you know you can

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:09.690
dog with it or you can you know you can
 

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:11.060
dog with it or you can you know you can
build applications that are good for

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:11.070
build applications that are good for
 

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:12.800
build applications that are good for
families or whatever using geofencing

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:12.810
families or whatever using geofencing
 

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:15.290
families or whatever using geofencing
and one thing that I actually built once

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:15.300
and one thing that I actually built once
 

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.830
and one thing that I actually built once
was a like a the virtual reality game

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:18.840
was a like a the virtual reality game
 

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.660
was a like a the virtual reality game
that used geofencing so once you ran

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:20.670
that used geofencing so once you ran
 

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.400
that used geofencing so once you ran
into a particular area then you have

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:22.410
into a particular area then you have
 

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.620
into a particular area then you have
augmented reality in that area and then

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:24.630
augmented reality in that area and then
 

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:26.180
augmented reality in that area and then
you have to do things with an augmented

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:26.190
you have to do things with an augmented
 

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.800
you have to do things with an augmented
reality it was all a lot of fun and then

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:27.810
reality it was all a lot of fun and then
 

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:29.360
reality it was all a lot of fun and then
finally the activity recognition that I

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:29.370
finally the activity recognition that I
 

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:30.920
finally the activity recognition that I
mentioned you know the activity

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:30.930
mentioned you know the activity
 

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:32.510
mentioned you know the activity
recognition API is they will give you

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520
recognition API is they will give you
 

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.970
recognition API is they will give you
back a percentage likelihood that you're

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980
back a percentage likelihood that you're
 

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.310
back a percentage likelihood that you're
doing something they're not entirely 100

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:37.320
doing something they're not entirely 100
 

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.630
doing something they're not entirely 100
percent accurate they will say hey at

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640
percent accurate they will say hey at
 

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.190
percent accurate they will say hey at
this moment in time you're you know

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200
this moment in time you're you know
 

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.630
this moment in time you're you know
there's a 20% chance that you're running

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640
there's a 20% chance that you're running
 

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.310
there's a 20% chance that you're running
but you're probably standing still that

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:43.320
but you're probably standing still that
 

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.080
but you're probably standing still that
type of thing so you know it takes a

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:45.090
type of thing so you know it takes a
 

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:47.480
type of thing so you know it takes a
little bit of work working with them and

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:47.490
little bit of work working with them and
 

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.220
little bit of work working with them and
a little bit of intelligence to be able

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:49.230
a little bit of intelligence to be able
 

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:50.960
a little bit of intelligence to be able
to use them very very accurately but

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:50.970
to use them very very accurately but
 

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:52.540
to use them very very accurately but
they are pretty good

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:52.550
they are pretty good
 

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:56.000
they are pretty good
