00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:14.663
When I was four years old,

00:00:14.687 --> 00:00:17.582
my dad taught me
the Taos Pueblo Hoop Dance,

00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:21.737
a traditional dance born hundreds
of years ago in Southwestern USA.

00:00:22.508 --> 00:00:25.428
A series of hoops are created
out of willow wood,

00:00:25.452 --> 00:00:29.314
and they're threaded together
to create formations of the natural world,

00:00:29.338 --> 00:00:31.357
showing the many beauties of life.

00:00:31.923 --> 00:00:34.905
In this dance, you're circling
in a constant spin,

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:36.991
mimicking the movement of the Sun

00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:38.662
and the passage of time.

00:00:40.232 --> 00:00:43.491
Watching this dance was magic to me.

00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:44.873
Like with a time capsule,

00:00:44.897 --> 00:00:48.177
I was taking a look through
a cultural window to the past.

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:50.109
I felt a deeper connection

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.436
to how my ancestors used to look
at the world around them.

00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:57.795
Since then, I've always been
obsessed with time capsules.

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:59.447
They take on many forms,

00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:02.556
but the common thread
is that they're uncontrollably fascinating

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.702
to us as human beings,

00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:06.892
because they're portals to a memory,

00:01:06.916 --> 00:01:10.730
and they hold the important power
of keeping stories alive.

00:01:11.503 --> 00:01:13.612
As a filmmaker and composer,

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:16.215
it's been my journey to find my voice,

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:19.608
reclaim the stories
of my heritage and the past

00:01:19.632 --> 00:01:23.694
and infuse them into music and film
time capsules to share.

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:27.164
To tell you a bit about
how I found my voice,

00:01:27.188 --> 00:01:29.458
I'd like to share a bit
about how I grew up.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.272
In Southern California, I grew up
in a multigenerational home,

00:01:33.296 --> 00:01:35.186
meaning I lived under the same roof

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.492
as my parents, aunts,
uncles and grandparents.

00:01:38.936 --> 00:01:43.559
My mother is Dutch-Indonesian and Chinese
with immigrant parents,

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:45.569
and my father is Ojibwe

00:01:45.593 --> 00:01:47.197
and an enrolled tribal member

00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:50.611
of the Prairie Band's Potawatomi Tribe
in Northeastern Kansas.

00:01:51.238 --> 00:01:54.218
So one weekend I'd be learning
how to fold dumplings,

00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:56.547
and the next, I'd be
traditional-style dancing

00:01:56.571 --> 00:01:57.768
at a powwow,

00:01:57.792 --> 00:02:01.170
immersed in the powerful sounds
of drums and singers.

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:05.011
Being surrounded by many
cultures was the norm,

00:02:05.035 --> 00:02:07.902
but also a very confusing experience.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.689
It was really hard for me
to find my voice,

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:12.955
because I never felt I was enough --

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:16.822
never Chinese, Dutch-Indonesian
or Native enough.

00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:20.432
Because I never felt I was a part
of any community,

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:23.889
I sought to learn
the stories of my heritage

00:02:23.913 --> 00:02:26.682
and connect them together
to rediscover my own.

00:02:27.254 --> 00:02:30.965
The first medium I felt
gave me a voice was music.

00:02:32.043 --> 00:02:35.225
With layers of sounds
and multiple instruments,

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:38.907
I could create soundscapes and worlds
that were much bigger than my own.

00:02:39.556 --> 00:02:42.436
Through music, I'm inviting you
into a sonic portal

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.462
of my memories and emotions,

00:02:44.486 --> 00:02:46.669
and I'm holding up a mirror to yours.

00:02:47.538 --> 00:02:50.738
One of my favorite instruments to play
is the guzheng zither,

00:02:50.762 --> 00:02:52.716
a Chinese harp-like instrument.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.494
While the hoop dance
is hundreds of years old,

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:59.313
the guzheng has more
than 2,000 years of history.

00:02:59.337 --> 00:03:02.012
I'm playing the styles that greatly
influence me today,

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:03.673
like electronic music,

00:03:03.697 --> 00:03:07.679
with an instrument that was used
to play traditional folk music long ago.

00:03:08.235 --> 00:03:11.053
And I noticed an interesting connection:

00:03:11.077 --> 00:03:13.508
the zither is tuned
to the pentatonic scale,

00:03:13.532 --> 00:03:17.084
a scale that is universally known
in so many parts of music

00:03:17.108 --> 00:03:18.293
around the world,

00:03:18.317 --> 00:03:21.130
including Native American folk songs.

00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:23.703
In both Chinese and Native folk,

00:03:23.727 --> 00:03:27.984
I sense this inherent sound of longing
and holding onto the past,

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:31.403
an emotion that greatly drives
the music I create today.

00:03:32.603 --> 00:03:36.141
At the time, I wondered if I could make
this feeling of immersion

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:37.323
even more powerful,

00:03:37.347 --> 00:03:39.559
by layering visuals and music --

00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:42.330
visuals and images on top of the music.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.448
So I turned to internet tutorials
to learn editing software,

00:03:46.472 --> 00:03:48.569
went to community college to save money

00:03:48.593 --> 00:03:49.913
and created films.

00:03:51.012 --> 00:03:52.751
After a few years experimenting,

00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:56.173
I was 17 and had something
I wanted to tell and preserve.

00:03:56.197 --> 00:03:57.825
It started with a question:

00:03:58.692 --> 00:04:01.762
What happens when a story is forgotten?

00:04:02.985 --> 00:04:05.655
I lead with this in my latest
documentary film,

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:07.196
"Smoke That Travels,"

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.505
which immerses people into the world
of music, song, color and dance,

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:17.841
as I explore my fear that a part
of my identity, my Native heritage,

00:04:17.865 --> 00:04:19.870
will be forgotten in time.

00:04:20.728 --> 00:04:25.217
Many indigenous languages are dying
due to historically forced assimilation.

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:29.237
From the late 1800s to the early 1970s,

00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:31.696
Natives were forced into boarding schools,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.316
where they were violently punished
if they practiced traditional ways

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.062
or spoke their native language,

00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:39.317
most of which were orally passed down.

00:04:39.892 --> 00:04:45.567
As of now, there are 567 federally
recognized tribes in the United States,

00:04:45.591 --> 00:04:47.452
when there used to be countless more.

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:49.779
In my father's words,

00:04:49.803 --> 00:04:53.362
"Being Native is not about
wearing long hair in braids.

00:04:53.386 --> 00:04:55.802
It's not about feathers or beadwork.

00:04:56.244 --> 00:05:00.634
It's about the way we all center ourselves
in the world as human beings."

00:05:01.776 --> 00:05:04.075
After traveling with this film
for over a year,

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.500
I met indigenous people
from around the world,

00:05:06.524 --> 00:05:08.153
from the Ainu of Japan,

00:05:08.177 --> 00:05:09.627
Sami of Scandinavia,

00:05:09.651 --> 00:05:10.826
the Maori

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.084
and many more.

00:05:12.108 --> 00:05:15.967
And they were all dealing
with the exact same struggle

00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:18.051
to preserve their language and culture.

00:05:19.168 --> 00:05:22.758
At this moment, I not only realize
the power storytelling has

00:05:22.782 --> 00:05:25.174
to connect all of us as human beings

00:05:25.198 --> 00:05:28.003
but the responsibility
that comes with this power.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.778
It can become incredibly dangerous
when our stories are rewritten or ignored,

00:05:32.802 --> 00:05:34.788
because when we are denied identity,

00:05:34.812 --> 00:05:36.353
we become invisible.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.043
We're all storytellers.

00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:44.341
Reclaiming our narratives
and just listening to each other's

00:05:44.365 --> 00:05:47.817
can create a portal
that can transcend time itself.

00:05:48.397 --> 00:05:49.580
Thank you.

00:05:49.604 --> 00:05:52.952
(Applause)
