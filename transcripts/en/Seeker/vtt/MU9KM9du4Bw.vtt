00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.080
Apparently, bacteria have started to become
resistant to antibiotics, so I guess no more

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.080
sewer diving for me!

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.440
Antibiotic resistance is scary.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.869
When bacteria stop responding to antibiotics,
diseases that used to be easily treatable

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:18.939
can become deadly.

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.750
Each year in the United States alone, at least
23,000 people get infected and die from antibiotic-resistant

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.769
bacteria.

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.539
On previous episodes of DNews we’ve talked
about some of the most threatening types,

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.320
including certain strains of E. coli, MRSA,
which causes staph infections, and Gonorrhea.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.610
Yes, gonorrhea is becoming resistant to medications.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.340
Clearly antibiotic resistance is a huge problem,
so scientists have been seeking out better,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.100
more effective treatments to deal with bacteria
that are already resistant.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.310
To dive into this story, DNews teamed up with
our friends at Seeker Stories to look for

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:58.040
treatment solutions where we least expect
them: the bottom of the ocean.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.530
Off the coast of California, scientists from
UC-Santa Cruz are scouring the ocean for what

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.549
they hope is the key to fighting a new breed
of drug-resistant superbugs.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.799
Bryson: So right here in Monterey Bay looking
for the next potential medical breakthrough,

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.360
but how we going to do that?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.860
Roger: So the first thing we need to do is
make our scuba dive and collect the samples,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.930
and we’re going to make pairs of duplicate
samples during the dive in as many discrete

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.680
locations as we can, and then take these samples
back to the lab for work up.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.680
Interviewer: How cold is the water?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.680
Roger: Oh, the water’s 55.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.690
Interviewer: You’ve got a dry suit, and
I’ve got…

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:42.030
Roger: I’ve got my dry suit, you have a
wet suit, we’ll see how we fare.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.979
According to the CDC, at least 2 million people
in the U.S. become infected with drug resistant

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:44.979
bacteria and at least 23,000 die each year
as a result of these infections.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.409
Roger: So there hasn’t been a new antibiotic
developed in about 20 years, and the rate

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.829
of resistance to existing antibiotics in hospitals
can run upwards of 40% to 60%.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:55.829
Bryson: Wow.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.600
Given that it takes about 15 years to bring
a drug to market, there is a real pressing

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.630
crisis in the antibiotic discovery arena.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:15.560
Bryson: So you say it’s a crisis; I mean,
if you had to write on a scale of 1 to 10,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.650
where are we at on the antibiotic crisis?

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.650
Roger: Eleven.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.650
It’s very serious.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.870
We are about to return to a pre-antibiotic
era where even basic surgeries and other medical

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.930
procedures can lead to death by septicemia
or another untreatable bacterial pathogens.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.099
The history of antibiotics is relatively short.

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.500
In 1928, Scottish Scientist Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin, capable of killing

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.790
bacteria.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.990
Scientists Howard Florey and Ernst Chain then
mass produced it in time for the use on Allied

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.710
Forces during World War two - the first example.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.010
in which more soldier died in battle than
from infection.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.950
It drastically changed the world of modern
medicine and extended the average human lifespan

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.220
significantly.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.730
Not many more antibiotics were developed since
then.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.480
Bryson: Now, why has the discovery of new
antibiotics kind of fallen by the wayside

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.990
for the past 30 or 40 years?

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.010
Roger: Developing new antibiotics is not the
most effective way to make a steady profit.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.090
If you make a new drug for asthma or diabetes,
that’s a drug which patients will take likely,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.820
every day for the rest of their lives.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.409
So from an economic perspective, drug companies
don’t have much incentive to develop new

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:27.590
antibiotic drugs.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.370
As Fleming accepted his Nobel Prize in 1945,
he warned that the misuse and overuse of antibiotics

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.560
could result in drug resistant bacteria and
he was right.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.810
Roger: if you put antibiotics into heavy use,
then eventually, bacteria will find a way

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.330
to become resistant to those drugs.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.510
It hasn’t been helped by the poor use of
antibiotics.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.360
For example, for people with flu-like symptoms,
if you have a viral infection, antibiotics

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.879
don’t help, and the more you take antibiotics,
the more you are helping to sort of build

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.019
that pool of resistance range.

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.251
Bryson: It’s kind of like the boy who cried
wolf; like, if you cry wolf all the time,

00:03:59.251 --> 00:04:00.870
and then when you actually have a wolf, then
it doesn’t work?

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.870
Roger: Right.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.870
Exactly.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.879
So it’s a combination of factors that have
led to this.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.739
Roger's team of diver collect sand from the
sea floor, a relatively understudied environment

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.840
for medical research, but one that is rich
with unknown chemistry.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.470
The scientists hope that the microbes within
the sand could lead to new and powerful drugs

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.470
to fight bacteria.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.470
The scientists hope that the microbes within
the sand could lead to new and powerful drugs

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.470
to fight bacteria.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.310
However, the search area is large and it might
take years to determine if these samples hold

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.310
a cure.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.730
Bryson: So let’s see the samples.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:28.730
Roger: Okay.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.130
So here we are, so this what we managed to
get on this dive.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.420
And although they may look pretty similar
to the naked eye, at the microbial level,

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.870
every one of these is a completely different
population.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.470
Bryson: And I mean, it’s literally just
sand.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.470
Roger: It’s just sand.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.720
So this is very low impact science on the
environment, but the potential applications

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.850
are huge.//
Roger: So what happens next is // we will

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.470
take the sand, put it on Petri dishes, and
allow those microorganisms to grow, and then

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.570
a microbiologist will look at those and select
specific species for study for chemistry.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.150
Bryson: So this could come from this?

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.150
Roger: Absolutely.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.300
Roger: It’s possible that the microorganisms
in this sample may one day make compounds

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.450
which we can add to tablets like this to treat
diseases, including Malaria, and of course,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.450
antibiotics.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.450
Bryson: That’s amazing.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.700
Bryson: I mean, the cure to what we’re looking
for could be anywhere, in the oceans, in the

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.880
mountains, in the sky.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.880
Roger: Right.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.690
And if you tried to do that discovery in a
random way where you went into the environment

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.030
at random you would fail.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.590
There are many Millions of sequences that
we have not yet investigated; deciding how

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.790
to do that in an ordered way is the challenge
for the next generation of natural product

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:48.820
scientists.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.490
Misusing antibiotics can lead to drug resistance
and disease, as it did for Ryan Schneider.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.770
He was diagnosed with C.diff and tried a revolutionary
treatment in this episode of Seeker Stories.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.770
Check it out here.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.370
Trace: Do you feel weird about having somebody
else's fecal material put into your body?

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.500
Ryan: It was weird at first but I don't even
think about that at all anymore because the

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.870
way I feel now is weird.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.870
You know?

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.870
I want to feel back to normal.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.840
I don't really care about what it takes to
get that.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.320
I just want to feel normal again.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.680
What do you think?

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.740
Are you worried about resistant bacteria?

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.210
