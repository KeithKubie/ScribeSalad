01:43:13.730 --> 01:43:15.640
is the role of battery storage is at
generation is it distribution can the

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:15.650
generation is it distribution can the
 

01:43:15.650 --> 01:43:17.350
generation is it distribution can the
utility own it we're a restructured

01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360
utility own it we're a restructured
 

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:19.300
utility own it we're a restructured
state so the question of generation

01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:19.310
state so the question of generation
 

01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:22.270
state so the question of generation
ownership is always there so it's you

01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:22.280
ownership is always there so it's you
 

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:23.980
ownership is always there so it's you
know probably a twenty five million

01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:23.990
know probably a twenty five million
 

01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:26.050
know probably a twenty five million
dollar project at the end of the day and

01:43:26.050 --> 01:43:26.060
dollar project at the end of the day and
 

01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:28.810
dollar project at the end of the day and
the question is are you willing to place

01:43:28.810 --> 01:43:28.820
the question is are you willing to place
 

01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:32.350
the question is are you willing to place
that bet without knowing that you'll

01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.360
that bet without knowing that you'll
 

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:34.300
that bet without knowing that you'll
actually recover those cost when you go

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:34.310
actually recover those cost when you go
 

01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:36.670
actually recover those cost when you go
into the regulatory agency with your

01:43:36.670 --> 01:43:36.680
into the regulatory agency with your
 

01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:41.050
into the regulatory agency with your
rate case or do you want to sort of

01:43:41.050 --> 01:43:41.060
rate case or do you want to sort of
 

01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:44.230
rate case or do you want to sort of
carve a regulatory path to get some sort

01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:44.240
carve a regulatory path to get some sort
 

01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:46.450
carve a regulatory path to get some sort
of pre-approval that will very much slow

01:43:46.450 --> 01:43:46.460
of pre-approval that will very much slow
 

01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:48.700
of pre-approval that will very much slow
you down so this micro grid we've been

01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:48.710
you down so this micro grid we've been
 

01:43:48.710 --> 01:43:51.310
you down so this micro grid we've been
working on for about three years

01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:51.320
working on for about three years
 

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.130
working on for about three years
we made an attempt to set up legislation

01:43:54.130 --> 01:43:54.140
we made an attempt to set up legislation
 

01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:56.170
we made an attempt to set up legislation
that would allow us to build micro grids

01:43:56.170 --> 01:43:56.180
that would allow us to build micro grids
 

01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:58.840
that would allow us to build micro grids
that did work so we went to the

01:43:58.840 --> 01:43:58.850
that did work so we went to the
 

01:43:58.850 --> 01:44:01.210
that did work so we went to the
regulator and we actually got approval

01:44:01.210 --> 01:44:01.220
regulator and we actually got approval
 

01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:04.090
regulator and we actually got approval
for this just in February so you know

01:44:04.090 --> 01:44:04.100
for this just in February so you know
 

01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:05.020
for this just in February so you know
one of the hurdles

01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:05.030
one of the hurdles
 

01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:08.620
one of the hurdles
is how do you till ''tis engage in

01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:08.630
is how do you till ''tis engage in
 

01:44:08.630 --> 01:44:11.919
is how do you till ''tis engage in
innovative and experimental projects

01:44:11.919 --> 01:44:11.929
innovative and experimental projects
 

01:44:11.929 --> 01:44:14.589
innovative and experimental projects
when the law is not designed to

01:44:14.589 --> 01:44:14.599
when the law is not designed to
 

01:44:14.599 --> 01:44:16.359
when the law is not designed to
accommodate that and you're always doing

01:44:16.359 --> 01:44:16.369
accommodate that and you're always doing
 

01:44:16.369 --> 01:44:18.430
accommodate that and you're always doing
that at risk and I think you know we

01:44:18.430 --> 01:44:18.440
that at risk and I think you know we
 

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:19.959
that at risk and I think you know we
understand that we're pushing the

01:44:19.959 --> 01:44:19.969
understand that we're pushing the
 

01:44:19.969 --> 01:44:21.370
understand that we're pushing the
envelope and there's a certain amount of

01:44:21.370 --> 01:44:21.380
envelope and there's a certain amount of
 

01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:24.069
envelope and there's a certain amount of
risk that we're willing to take but many

01:44:24.069 --> 01:44:24.079
risk that we're willing to take but many
 

01:44:24.079 --> 01:44:25.720
risk that we're willing to take but many
of these projects are going to be quite

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:25.730
of these projects are going to be quite
 

01:44:25.730 --> 01:44:27.370
of these projects are going to be quite
expensive we just have a very expensive

01:44:27.370 --> 01:44:27.380
expensive we just have a very expensive
 

01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:29.169
expensive we just have a very expensive
business the infrastructure is not cheap

01:44:29.169 --> 01:44:29.179
business the infrastructure is not cheap
 

01:44:29.179 --> 01:44:31.450
business the infrastructure is not cheap
and so how much risk are you willing to

01:44:31.450 --> 01:44:31.460
and so how much risk are you willing to
 

01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:34.089
and so how much risk are you willing to
take is you know is always a question

01:44:34.089 --> 01:44:34.099
take is you know is always a question
 

01:44:34.099 --> 01:44:36.609
take is you know is always a question
and so that's one of the ways we've

01:44:36.609 --> 01:44:36.619
and so that's one of the ways we've
 

01:44:36.619 --> 01:44:39.520
and so that's one of the ways we've
tried to solve it we one of the things

01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:39.530
tried to solve it we one of the things
 

01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:42.729
tried to solve it we one of the things
we were able to do about a year ago at

01:44:42.729 --> 01:44:42.739
we were able to do about a year ago at
 

01:44:42.739 --> 01:44:44.799
we were able to do about a year ago at
the legislature was we took energy

01:44:44.799 --> 01:44:44.809
the legislature was we took energy
 

01:44:44.809 --> 01:44:48.600
the legislature was we took energy
efficiency and rather than write it

01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:48.610
efficiency and rather than write it
 

01:44:48.610 --> 01:44:50.919
efficiency and rather than write it
traditionally has been a pass-through

01:44:50.919 --> 01:44:50.929
traditionally has been a pass-through
 

01:44:50.929 --> 01:44:54.040
traditionally has been a pass-through
basically if we spend a dollar on energy

01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:54.050
basically if we spend a dollar on energy
 

01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:56.049
basically if we spend a dollar on energy
efficiency we recover a dollar so it's

01:44:56.049 --> 01:44:56.059
efficiency we recover a dollar so it's
 

01:44:56.059 --> 01:44:58.359
efficiency we recover a dollar so it's
just a pass-through we turned it into an

01:44:58.359 --> 01:44:58.369
just a pass-through we turned it into an
 

01:44:58.369 --> 01:45:01.629
just a pass-through we turned it into an
earnings opportunity which in cents you

01:45:01.629 --> 01:45:01.639
earnings opportunity which in cents you
 

01:45:01.639 --> 01:45:04.450
earnings opportunity which in cents you
creates incentives in the utility in our

business it becomes a part of our
business so we're incentive to want to

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:07.730
business so we're incentive to want to
 

01:45:07.730 --> 01:45:09.879
business so we're incentive to want to
do that the other thing we did with

do that the other thing we did with
 

01:45:09.889 --> 01:45:12.069
do that the other thing we did with
energy efficiency to turn to change it

01:45:12.069 --> 01:45:12.079
energy efficiency to turn to change it
 

01:45:12.079 --> 01:45:14.979
energy efficiency to turn to change it
is we created a an RD bucket around

01:45:14.979 --> 01:45:14.989
is we created a an RD bucket around
 

01:45:14.989 --> 01:45:17.319
is we created a an RD bucket around
energy efficiency now it's limited

energy efficiency now it's limited
 

01:45:17.329 --> 01:45:20.350
energy efficiency now it's limited
toward energy efficiency but it is you

when I look at energy transformation I

01:47:14.330 --> 01:47:14.340
when I look at energy transformation I
 

01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:16.280
when I look at energy transformation I
mean there is nothing I think you can

electrification yeah we are working on
 

01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:32.870
electrification yeah we are working on
that I would say we're you know there

01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880
that I would say we're you know there
 

01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:35.209
that I would say we're you know there
are probably places and utilities around

01:49:35.209 --> 01:49:35.219
are probably places and utilities around
 

01:49:35.219 --> 01:49:36.620
are probably places and utilities around
the country that are a little bit ahead

01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:36.630
the country that are a little bit ahead
 

01:49:36.630 --> 01:49:38.840
the country that are a little bit ahead
of us on that I think California has a

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:38.850
of us on that I think California has a
 

01:49:38.850 --> 01:49:41.390
of us on that I think California has a
lot going on with charging stations the

01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.400
lot going on with charging stations the
 

01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:43.100
lot going on with charging stations the
utilities in general have been very

01:49:43.100 --> 01:49:43.110
utilities in general have been very
 

01:49:43.110 --> 01:49:44.990
utilities in general have been very
focused on building charging stations

01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000
focused on building charging stations
 

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.300
focused on building charging stations
and the reason for that is the way we

01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:47.310
and the reason for that is the way we
 

01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:49.760
and the reason for that is the way we
make money is by building infrastructure

01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:49.770
make money is by building infrastructure
 

01:49:49.770 --> 01:49:52.070
make money is by building infrastructure
we put iron in the ground we go to the

01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080
we put iron in the ground we go to the
 

01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:53.900
we put iron in the ground we go to the
regulator we pass it through a rate case

01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:53.910
regulator we pass it through a rate case
 

01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:55.700
regulator we pass it through a rate case
and we earn a return on it so anytime

01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:55.710
and we earn a return on it so anytime
 

01:49:55.710 --> 01:49:57.560
and we earn a return on it so anytime
you can put iron in the ground and your

01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:57.570
you can put iron in the ground and your
 

01:49:57.570 --> 01:50:00.080
you can put iron in the ground and your
utility it's a good thing I frankly

01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:00.090
utility it's a good thing I frankly
 

01:50:00.090 --> 01:50:02.060
utility it's a good thing I frankly
don't think that charging infrastructure

01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:02.070
don't think that charging infrastructure
 

01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:04.790
don't think that charging infrastructure
is where where the game is at on

01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800
is where where the game is at on
 

01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:07.070
is where where the game is at on
electric transportation I think there's

01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:07.080
electric transportation I think there's
 

01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:10.640
electric transportation I think there's
so many more interesting questions in

01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:10.650
so many more interesting questions in
 

01:50:10.650 --> 01:50:14.390
so many more interesting questions in
you know the network aspects of it both

01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400
you know the network aspects of it both
 

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:16.970
you know the network aspects of it both
in terms of how does a person from

01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:16.980
in terms of how does a person from
 

01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:18.560
in terms of how does a person from
California who's driving across the

01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:18.570
California who's driving across the
 

01:50:18.570 --> 01:50:20.300
California who's driving across the
country and gets into your service

01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:20.310
country and gets into your service
 

01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:24.500
country and gets into your service
territory get charged and you know it's

01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:24.510
territory get charged and you know it's
 

01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:26.959
territory get charged and you know it's
almost like an ATM network how does that

01:50:26.959 --> 01:50:26.969
almost like an ATM network how does that
 

01:50:26.969 --> 01:50:28.910
almost like an ATM network how does that
work so I think that's a question that

01:50:28.910 --> 01:50:28.920
work so I think that's a question that
 

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:30.260
work so I think that's a question that
we have to solve that's very interesting

01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:30.270
we have to solve that's very interesting
 

01:50:30.270 --> 01:50:32.630
we have to solve that's very interesting
and will require both competitive

01:50:32.630 --> 01:50:32.640
and will require both competitive
 

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:36.470
and will require both competitive
companies and the utility and then I

01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480
companies and the utility and then I
 

01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:37.670
companies and the utility and then I
think the other really interesting

01:50:37.670 --> 01:50:37.680
think the other really interesting
 

01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:39.030
think the other really interesting

01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040
question around Elektra
 

01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:41.580
question around Elektra
transportation is when you've got when

01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:41.590
transportation is when you've got when
 

01:50:41.590 --> 01:50:43.920
transportation is when you've got when
you're managing a distribution grid and

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:43.930
you're managing a distribution grid and
 

01:50:43.930 --> 01:50:45.750
you're managing a distribution grid and
you've got generation inside the

01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760
you've got generation inside the
 

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:48.360
you've got generation inside the
distribution grid and it's very volatile

01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:48.370
distribution grid and it's very volatile
 

01:50:48.370 --> 01:50:50.460
distribution grid and it's very volatile
and you've got people buying and selling

01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:50.470
and you've got people buying and selling
 

01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:53.130
and you've got people buying and selling
and you're really managing a much more

01:50:53.130 --> 01:50:53.140
and you're really managing a much more
 

01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:58.320
and you're really managing a much more
dynamic grid the questions of how you

01:50:58.320 --> 01:50:58.330
dynamic grid the questions of how you
 

01:50:58.330 --> 01:51:00.590
dynamic grid the questions of how you
the contracts that you create with

01:51:00.590 --> 01:51:00.600
the contracts that you create with
 

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:04.140
the contracts that you create with
vehicle owners how you draw on their

01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:04.150
vehicle owners how you draw on their
 

01:51:04.150 --> 01:51:06.840
vehicle owners how you draw on their
energy or ask them to back off and pay

01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:06.850
energy or ask them to back off and pay
 

01:51:06.850 --> 01:51:08.400
energy or ask them to back off and pay
them for demand management all those

01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:08.410
them for demand management all those
 

01:51:08.410 --> 01:51:11.160
them for demand management all those
questions of how you manage the system

01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:11.170
questions of how you manage the system
 

01:51:11.170 --> 01:51:14.310
questions of how you manage the system
in that in that kind of scenario a lot

01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320
in that in that kind of scenario a lot
 

01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:16.440
in that in that kind of scenario a lot
of which will be automated are are

01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:16.450
of which will be automated are are
 

01:51:16.450 --> 01:51:18.750
of which will be automated are are
interesting questions in my mind we're

01:51:18.750 --> 01:51:18.760
interesting questions in my mind we're
 

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:20.400
interesting questions in my mind we're
working with environmental groups in

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:20.410
working with environmental groups in
 

01:51:20.410 --> 01:51:23.760
working with environmental groups in
Illinois right now to to try to look at

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:23.770
Illinois right now to to try to look at
 

01:51:23.770 --> 01:51:26.220
Illinois right now to to try to look at
electric transportation and think about

01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:26.230
electric transportation and think about
 

01:51:26.230 --> 01:51:28.470
electric transportation and think about
how we can jumpstart that for the future

01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480
how we can jumpstart that for the future
 

01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:29.910
how we can jumpstart that for the future
but I think we're probably a couple

01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920
but I think we're probably a couple
 

01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:32.870
but I think we're probably a couple
steps behind some other places on that

01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880
steps behind some other places on that
 

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:36.950
steps behind some other places on that
so a good question from a university

01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960
so a good question from a university
 

01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:41.700
so a good question from a university
what kind of skills are you looking for

01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:41.710
what kind of skills are you looking for
 

01:51:41.710 --> 01:51:45.960
what kind of skills are you looking for
in your future employees yeah that's a

01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:45.970
in your future employees yeah that's a
 

01:51:45.970 --> 01:51:49.110
in your future employees yeah that's a
great question so we definitely need

01:51:49.110 --> 01:51:49.120
great question so we definitely need
 

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:51.450
great question so we definitely need
technical skills obviously there's a lot

01:51:51.450 --> 01:51:51.460
technical skills obviously there's a lot
 

01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:54.330
technical skills obviously there's a lot
of technology here but we need people

01:51:54.330 --> 01:51:54.340
of technology here but we need people
 

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:58.260
of technology here but we need people
who can combine that with you know sort

01:51:58.260 --> 01:51:58.270
who can combine that with you know sort
 

01:51:58.270 --> 01:52:00.660
who can combine that with you know sort
of creative thinking skills I mean you

01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:00.670
of creative thinking skills I mean you
 

01:52:00.670 --> 01:52:02.310
of creative thinking skills I mean you
almost want a little bit of liberal arts

01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.320
almost want a little bit of liberal arts
 

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:04.380
almost want a little bit of liberal arts
and a little bit of Technology you know

01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:04.390
and a little bit of Technology you know
 

01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:07.110
and a little bit of Technology you know
blend it in I need people who can be

01:52:07.110 --> 01:52:07.120
blend it in I need people who can be
 

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.630
blend it in I need people who can be
agile and nimble who can think about you

01:52:09.630 --> 01:52:09.640
agile and nimble who can think about you
 

01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:12.150
agile and nimble who can think about you
know playing a role on one team one day

01:52:12.150 --> 01:52:12.160
know playing a role on one team one day
 

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:14.040
know playing a role on one team one day
and then you know a couple months later

01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:14.050
and then you know a couple months later
 

01:52:14.050 --> 01:52:16.620
and then you know a couple months later
shifting to another team and playing a

01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:16.630
shifting to another team and playing a
 

01:52:16.630 --> 01:52:18.780
shifting to another team and playing a
different kind of role and so people who

01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:18.790
different kind of role and so people who
 

01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:20.670
different kind of role and so people who
know how to be collaborators and

01:52:20.670 --> 01:52:20.680
know how to be collaborators and
 

01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:23.280
know how to be collaborators and
followers and leaders when needed people

01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:23.290
followers and leaders when needed people
 

01:52:23.290 --> 01:52:26.310
followers and leaders when needed people
who can be technical but also can be you

01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320
who can be technical but also can be you
 

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:29.190
who can be technical but also can be you
know creative and see the you know human

01:52:29.190 --> 01:52:29.200
know creative and see the you know human
 

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:32.670
know creative and see the you know human
and you know community side of things as

01:52:32.670 --> 01:52:32.680
and you know community side of things as
 

01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:34.650
and you know community side of things as
well and the impacts of their technology

01:52:34.650 --> 01:52:34.660
well and the impacts of their technology
 

01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:37.050
well and the impacts of their technology
so it's really interdisciplinary and

01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:37.060
so it's really interdisciplinary and
 

01:52:37.060 --> 01:52:39.720
so it's really interdisciplinary and
again you know I give you know Laurie

01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:39.730
again you know I give you know Laurie
 

01:52:39.730 --> 01:52:41.580
again you know I give you know Laurie
and Carnegie Mellon a lot of credit for

01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:41.590
and Carnegie Mellon a lot of credit for
 

01:52:41.590 --> 01:52:44.550
and Carnegie Mellon a lot of credit for
you know looking at this question cross

01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560
you know looking at this question cross
 

01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:45.900
you know looking at this question cross
functionally because that's the way

01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:45.910
functionally because that's the way
 

01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:48.000
functionally because that's the way
we're trying to solve it I'm actually at

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:48.010
we're trying to solve it I'm actually at
 

01:52:48.010 --> 01:52:49.860
we're trying to solve it I'm actually at
a conversation with Laurie earlier today

01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:49.870
a conversation with Laurie earlier today
 

01:52:49.870 --> 01:52:52.610
a conversation with Laurie earlier today
about inside the company

01:52:52.610 --> 01:52:52.620
about inside the company
 

01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:55.200
about inside the company
utilities a really really hierarchical

01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:55.210
utilities a really really hierarchical
 

01:52:55.210 --> 01:52:59.610
utilities a really really hierarchical
and they're very structured very

01:52:59.610 --> 01:52:59.620
and they're very structured very
 

01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:01.860
and they're very structured very
linearly so you have your engineering

01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:01.870
linearly so you have your engineering
 

01:53:01.870 --> 01:53:03.840
linearly so you have your engineering
Lane and you have your economists and

01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:03.850
Lane and you have your economists and
 

01:53:03.850 --> 01:53:05.400
Lane and you have your economists and
you have your lawyers and you have your

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:05.410
you have your lawyers and you have your
 

01:53:05.410 --> 01:53:07.230
you have your lawyers and you have your
finance people and they haven't

01:53:07.230 --> 01:53:07.240
finance people and they haven't
 

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:09.360
finance people and they haven't
traditionally talked much to each other

01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:09.370
traditionally talked much to each other
 

01:53:09.370 --> 01:53:11.790
traditionally talked much to each other
and so I'm throwing them all into the

01:53:11.790 --> 01:53:11.800
and so I'm throwing them all into the
 

01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:13.230
and so I'm throwing them all into the
same room and telling them that they got

01:53:13.230 --> 01:53:13.240
same room and telling them that they got
 

01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:14.520
same room and telling them that they got
to figure this out together

01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:14.530
to figure this out together
 

01:53:14.530 --> 01:53:17.610
to figure this out together
and it's very interesting it's very

01:53:17.610 --> 01:53:17.620
and it's very interesting it's very
 

01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:20.390
and it's very interesting it's very
interesting but I need people who can

01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400
interesting but I need people who can
 

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:24.210
interesting but I need people who can
talk across different functions and can

01:53:24.210 --> 01:53:24.220
talk across different functions and can
 

01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:25.590
talk across different functions and can
kind of work in those kind of teams

01:53:25.590 --> 01:53:25.600
kind of work in those kind of teams
 

01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:28.110
kind of work in those kind of teams
because a team I am together today in a

01:53:28.110 --> 01:53:28.120
because a team I am together today in a
 

01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:30.180
because a team I am together today in a
couple months it'll be a different team

01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:30.190
couple months it'll be a different team
 

01:53:30.190 --> 01:53:31.530
couple months it'll be a different team
some of them will be the same but I'll

01:53:31.530 --> 01:53:31.540
some of them will be the same but I'll
 

01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:33.270
some of them will be the same but I'll
throw some new people in there so this

01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:33.280
throw some new people in there so this
 

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:36.390
throw some new people in there so this
ability to kind of shape-shift and morph

01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400
ability to kind of shape-shift and morph
 

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.520
ability to kind of shape-shift and morph
and evolve and you know play different

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:38.530
and evolve and you know play different
 

01:53:38.530 --> 01:53:42.120
and evolve and you know play different
roles is is is is a big piece of what

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:42.130
roles is is is is a big piece of what
 

01:53:42.130 --> 01:53:43.830
roles is is is is a big piece of what
the future will require I think in our

01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840
the future will require I think in our
 

01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:51.080
the future will require I think in our
companies we always need good engineers

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:51.090
 
 

01:53:51.090 --> 01:53:53.790
 
with the law limiting your business in

01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:53.800
with the law limiting your business in
 

01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:54.390
with the law limiting your business in
some ways

01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400
some ways
 

01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:56.910
some ways
how can startups engage with you are you

01:53:56.910 --> 01:53:56.920
how can startups engage with you are you
 

01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:01.490
how can startups engage with you are you
able to invest in innovative startups

01:54:01.490 --> 01:54:01.500
able to invest in innovative startups
 

01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:03.630
able to invest in innovative startups
yeah so I'll come at that question a

01:54:03.630 --> 01:54:03.640
yeah so I'll come at that question a
 

01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:05.550
yeah so I'll come at that question a
couple different ways one is so we're

01:54:05.550 --> 01:54:05.560
couple different ways one is so we're
 

01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:08.270
couple different ways one is so we're
part of a larger holding company exelon

01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280
part of a larger holding company exelon
 

01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:12.570
part of a larger holding company exelon
exelon has five utilities and in a very

01:54:12.570 --> 01:54:12.580
exelon has five utilities and in a very
 

01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:14.820
exelon has five utilities and in a very
large generation company and so there's

01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:14.830
large generation company and so there's
 

01:54:14.830 --> 01:54:17.310
large generation company and so there's
exelon actually which has more of a

01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:17.320
exelon actually which has more of a
 

01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:19.230
exelon actually which has more of a
competitive side as well as a regulated

01:54:19.230 --> 01:54:19.240
competitive side as well as a regulated
 

01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:23.640
competitive side as well as a regulated
side actually does invest in in in

01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:23.650
side actually does invest in in in
 

01:54:23.650 --> 01:54:25.380
side actually does invest in in in
start-up companies so that usually that

01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:25.390
start-up companies so that usually that
 

01:54:25.390 --> 01:54:27.810
start-up companies so that usually that
comes through the exelon realm not so

01:54:27.810 --> 01:54:27.820
comes through the exelon realm not so
 

01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:30.150
comes through the exelon realm not so
much the regulated utility realm but

01:54:30.150 --> 01:54:30.160
much the regulated utility realm but
 

01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:31.860
much the regulated utility realm but
here's how I think we we think about

01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:31.870
here's how I think we we think about
 

01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:34.110
here's how I think we we think about
engaging with startups and third-party

01:54:34.110 --> 01:54:34.120
engaging with startups and third-party
 

01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:36.120
engaging with startups and third-party
companies I talked about the platform

01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:36.130
companies I talked about the platform
 

01:54:36.130 --> 01:54:38.340
companies I talked about the platform
model in the four layers that we've kind

01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:38.350
model in the four layers that we've kind
 

01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:41.580
model in the four layers that we've kind
of you know identified that we're trying

01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:41.590
of you know identified that we're trying
 

01:54:41.590 --> 01:54:43.530
of you know identified that we're trying
to work through and when I talked about

01:54:43.530 --> 01:54:43.540
to work through and when I talked about
 

01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:45.750
to work through and when I talked about
it I talked about the first layer being

01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760
it I talked about the first layer being
 

01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:47.370
it I talked about the first layer being
really the infrastructure layer that's

01:54:47.370 --> 01:54:47.380
really the infrastructure layer that's
 

01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:49.200
really the infrastructure layer that's
kind of where we live today and that's

01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:49.210
kind of where we live today and that's
 

01:54:49.210 --> 01:54:51.420
kind of where we live today and that's
probably where I think the utility lives

01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:51.430
probably where I think the utility lives
 

01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:53.280
probably where I think the utility lives
for a long time in the future planning

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:53.290
for a long time in the future planning
 

01:54:53.290 --> 01:54:56.640
for a long time in the future planning
and operating similarly I think you know

01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:56.650
and operating similarly I think you know
 

01:54:56.650 --> 01:54:58.380
and operating similarly I think you know
you probably want your utility to do

01:54:58.380 --> 01:54:58.390
you probably want your utility to do
 

01:54:58.390 --> 01:55:00.270
you probably want your utility to do
that when you get to layer 3 and you

01:55:00.270 --> 01:55:00.280
that when you get to layer 3 and you
 

01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:02.340
that when you get to layer 3 and you
start thinking about energy transactions

01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:02.350
start thinking about energy transactions
 

01:55:02.350 --> 01:55:04.580
start thinking about energy transactions
and you get to layer 4 and you start

01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:04.590
and you get to layer 4 and you start
 

01:55:04.590 --> 01:55:06.970
and you get to layer 4 and you start
thinking about services transactions

01:55:06.970 --> 01:55:06.980
thinking about services transactions
 

01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:09.979
thinking about services transactions
then I think you start to bring in third

01:55:09.979 --> 01:55:09.989
then I think you start to bring in third
 

01:55:09.989 --> 01:55:12.169
then I think you start to bring in third
parties because that's not especially in

01:55:12.169 --> 01:55:12.179
parties because that's not especially in
 

01:55:12.179 --> 01:55:14.300
parties because that's not especially in
a restructured state like Illinois we

01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:14.310
a restructured state like Illinois we
 

01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:16.160
a restructured state like Illinois we
run wires and poles we don't run

01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:16.170
run wires and poles we don't run
 

01:55:16.170 --> 01:55:18.320
run wires and poles we don't run
generation we're not going to be

01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:18.330
generation we're not going to be
 

01:55:18.330 --> 01:55:20.629
generation we're not going to be
involved in most of those transactions

01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639
involved in most of those transactions
 

01:55:20.639 --> 01:55:22.520
involved in most of those transactions
it's queer going to facilitate them as a

01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:22.530
it's queer going to facilitate them as a
 

01:55:22.530 --> 01:55:24.830
it's queer going to facilitate them as a
platform kind of an eBay we connect

01:55:24.830 --> 01:55:24.840
platform kind of an eBay we connect
 

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:27.680
platform kind of an eBay we connect
buyers and sellers but we're not the

01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:27.690
buyers and sellers but we're not the
 

01:55:27.690 --> 01:55:30.620
buyers and sellers but we're not the
buyer or the seller for the most part

01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:30.630
buyer or the seller for the most part
 

01:55:30.630 --> 01:55:32.209
buyer or the seller for the most part
and so I think that's how we think about

01:55:32.209 --> 01:55:32.219
and so I think that's how we think about
 

01:55:32.219 --> 01:55:34.760
and so I think that's how we think about
bringing in the innovation that small

01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:34.770
bringing in the innovation that small
 

01:55:34.770 --> 01:55:37.669
bringing in the innovation that small
companies that startups that new you

01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679
companies that startups that new you
 

01:55:37.679 --> 01:55:39.410
companies that startups that new you
know fresh views of the industry can

01:55:39.410 --> 01:55:39.420
know fresh views of the industry can
 

01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:42.379
know fresh views of the industry can
bring as well as sort of maintaining the

01:55:42.379 --> 01:55:42.389
bring as well as sort of maintaining the
 

01:55:42.389 --> 01:55:45.439
bring as well as sort of maintaining the
stability and and doing what we do best

01:55:45.439 --> 01:55:45.449
stability and and doing what we do best
 

01:55:45.449 --> 01:55:48.859
stability and and doing what we do best
we have a marketplace right now it's

01:55:48.859 --> 01:55:48.869
we have a marketplace right now it's
 

01:55:48.869 --> 01:55:51.439
we have a marketplace right now it's
basically an internet marketplace but

01:55:51.439 --> 01:55:51.449
basically an internet marketplace but
 

01:55:51.449 --> 01:55:52.970
basically an internet marketplace but
it's a little bit of an experiment that

01:55:52.970 --> 01:55:52.980
it's a little bit of an experiment that
 

01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:55.010
it's a little bit of an experiment that
we're doing we've had it up maybe a year

01:55:55.010 --> 01:55:55.020
we're doing we've had it up maybe a year
 

01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:56.839
we're doing we've had it up maybe a year
and a half now we've got smart

01:55:56.839 --> 01:55:56.849
and a half now we've got smart
 

01:55:56.849 --> 01:55:58.700
and a half now we've got smart
thermostats that we sell on it again

01:55:58.700 --> 01:55:58.710
thermostats that we sell on it again
 

01:55:58.710 --> 01:56:01.100
thermostats that we sell on it again
it's not we don't make smart thermostats

01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:01.110
it's not we don't make smart thermostats
 

01:56:01.110 --> 01:56:04.189
it's not we don't make smart thermostats
but nest does and others do ecobee and

01:56:04.189 --> 01:56:04.199
but nest does and others do ecobee and
 

01:56:04.199 --> 01:56:08.060
but nest does and others do ecobee and
so we sell those smart thermostats

01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:08.070
so we sell those smart thermostats
 

01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:10.100
so we sell those smart thermostats
across the marketplace we're evolving

01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:10.110
across the marketplace we're evolving
 

01:56:10.110 --> 01:56:12.189
across the marketplace we're evolving
the marketplace we expect to see solar

01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:12.199
the marketplace we expect to see solar
 

01:56:12.199 --> 01:56:15.350
the marketplace we expect to see solar
start to emerge in numbers probably

01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360
start to emerge in numbers probably
 

01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:18.320
start to emerge in numbers probably
fourth quarter this year and we're

01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:18.330
fourth quarter this year and we're
 

01:56:18.330 --> 01:56:20.510
fourth quarter this year and we're
putting together a solar services

01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:20.520
putting together a solar services
 

01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:23.149
putting together a solar services
platform so if you're thinking about

01:56:23.149 --> 01:56:23.159
platform so if you're thinking about
 

01:56:23.159 --> 01:56:25.490
platform so if you're thinking about
purchasing solar you can come onto our

01:56:25.490 --> 01:56:25.500
purchasing solar you can come onto our
 

01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:27.140
purchasing solar you can come onto our
platform we'll pull down your usage

01:56:27.140 --> 01:56:27.150
platform we'll pull down your usage
 

01:56:27.150 --> 01:56:29.149
platform we'll pull down your usage
we'll take a google shot of your home

01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159
we'll take a google shot of your home
 

01:56:29.159 --> 01:56:32.359
we'll take a google shot of your home
we'll give you the economics of running

01:56:32.359 --> 01:56:32.369
we'll give you the economics of running
 

01:56:32.369 --> 01:56:34.490
we'll give you the economics of running
solar off of your home if that's not

01:56:34.490 --> 01:56:34.500
solar off of your home if that's not
 

01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:36.260
solar off of your home if that's not
feasible we can give you the economics

01:56:36.260 --> 01:56:36.270
feasible we can give you the economics
 

01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:38.180
feasible we can give you the economics
of a share and a community solar program

01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:38.190
of a share and a community solar program
 

01:56:38.190 --> 01:56:40.700
of a share and a community solar program
and where you might find that similarly

01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:40.710
and where you might find that similarly
 

01:56:40.710 --> 01:56:42.080
and where you might find that similarly
once you make the investment in solar

01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:42.090
once you make the investment in solar
 

01:56:42.090 --> 01:56:43.700
once you make the investment in solar
we'll have a tracker that allows you to

01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:43.710
we'll have a tracker that allows you to
 

01:56:43.710 --> 01:56:46.760
we'll have a tracker that allows you to
track the economics the payback etc so

01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:46.770
track the economics the payback etc so
 

01:56:46.770 --> 01:56:49.010
track the economics the payback etc so
this is you know sort of the the

01:56:49.010 --> 01:56:49.020
this is you know sort of the the
 

01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:51.470
this is you know sort of the the
services platform again some of which I

01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:51.480
services platform again some of which I
 

01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:53.180
services platform again some of which I
think we can provide because we can do

01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:53.190
think we can provide because we can do
 

01:56:53.190 --> 01:56:55.820
think we can provide because we can do
that efficiently and some of which will

01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:55.830
that efficiently and some of which will
 

01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:57.320
that efficiently and some of which will
have third parties brought in and that's

01:56:57.320 --> 01:56:57.330
have third parties brought in and that's
 

01:56:57.330 --> 01:56:59.030
have third parties brought in and that's
how I think will connect at the utility

01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040
how I think will connect at the utility
 

01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:02.780
how I think will connect at the utility
level the next question how can

01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:02.790
level the next question how can
 

01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:05.930
level the next question how can
universities help utilities the most to

01:57:05.930 --> 01:57:05.940
universities help utilities the most to
 

01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:11.770
universities help utilities the most to
advance innovation beyond research

01:57:11.770 --> 01:57:11.780
 
 

01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:15.620
 
well I we have I think you know part

01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:15.630
well I we have I think you know part
 

01:57:15.630 --> 01:57:18.440
well I we have I think you know part
partnerships and partnering in you know

01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:18.450
partnerships and partnering in you know
 

01:57:18.450 --> 01:57:21.800
partnerships and partnering in you know
very specific projects you know

01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:21.810
very specific projects you know
 

01:57:21.810 --> 01:57:23.990
very specific projects you know
obviously the research that comes out of

01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000
obviously the research that comes out of
 

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.150
obviously the research that comes out of
universities are tremendously helpful

01:57:26.150 --> 01:57:26.160
universities are tremendously helpful
 

01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:29.090
universities are tremendously helpful
and we you know rely on that quite a bit

01:57:29.090 --> 01:57:29.100
and we you know rely on that quite a bit
 

01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:32.690
and we you know rely on that quite a bit
and watch that I think that you know

01:57:32.690 --> 01:57:32.700
and watch that I think that you know
 

01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:35.240
and watch that I think that you know
coming in and being part of specific you

01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:35.250
coming in and being part of specific you
 

01:57:35.250 --> 01:57:38.240
coming in and being part of specific you
know projects and really helping to make

01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:38.250
know projects and really helping to make
 

01:57:38.250 --> 01:57:41.180
know projects and really helping to make
this work on the ground is I think sort

01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:41.190
this work on the ground is I think sort
 

01:57:41.190 --> 01:57:43.520
this work on the ground is I think sort
of a next phase of engagement where I

01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:43.530
of a next phase of engagement where I
 

01:57:43.530 --> 01:57:48.200
of a next phase of engagement where I
think there's lots of opportunity to

01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:48.210
think there's lots of opportunity to
 

01:57:48.210 --> 01:57:50.420
think there's lots of opportunity to
more questions is that okay sure okay as

01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:50.430
more questions is that okay sure okay as
 

01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:54.980
more questions is that okay sure okay as
long as you - tail so what made you want

01:57:54.980 --> 01:57:54.990
long as you - tail so what made you want
 

01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:59.090
long as you - tail so what made you want
to work in the utility industry we're

01:57:59.090 --> 01:57:59.100
to work in the utility industry we're
 

01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:03.830
to work in the utility industry we're
getting personal um so I practice an

01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840
getting personal um so I practice an
 

01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:06.860
getting personal um so I practice an
antitrust lawyer for about ten years and

01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:06.870
antitrust lawyer for about ten years and
 

01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:09.560
antitrust lawyer for about ten years and
I got a call from a headhunter about the

01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:09.570
I got a call from a headhunter about the
 

01:58:09.570 --> 01:58:11.630
I got a call from a headhunter about the
time that the restructuring law was

01:58:11.630 --> 01:58:11.640
time that the restructuring law was
 

01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:14.840
time that the restructuring law was
passed in Illinois late 90s and what the

01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:14.850
passed in Illinois late 90s and what the
 

01:58:14.850 --> 01:58:16.490
passed in Illinois late 90s and what the
restructuring law in Illinois did was

01:58:16.490 --> 01:58:16.500
restructuring law in Illinois did was
 

01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:17.720
restructuring law in Illinois did was
was one of the first states to

01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:17.730
was one of the first states to
 

01:58:17.730 --> 01:58:19.490
was one of the first states to
restructure as they pulled generation

01:58:19.490 --> 01:58:19.500
restructure as they pulled generation
 

01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:21.530
restructure as they pulled generation
away from the transmission and

01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:21.540
away from the transmission and
 

01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:23.230
away from the transmission and
distribution network set him up

01:58:23.230 --> 01:58:23.240
distribution network set him up
 

01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:25.430
distribution network set him up

separates ultimately separate
subsidiaries and the company was looking

01:58:28.190 --> 01:58:28.200
subsidiaries and the company was looking
 

01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:29.750
subsidiaries and the company was looking
for lawyers who understood markets

01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760
for lawyers who understood markets

for lawyers who understood markets
because they didn't have anybody or

monopoly for a hundred years they didn't
 

01:58:32.970 --> 01:58:34.670
monopoly for a hundred years they didn't
have anybody really internally who

have anybody really internally who
understood markets and the legal

01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:37.310
understood markets and the legal
 

01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:41.240
understood markets and the legal
entanglements of regulation and you know

01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:41.250
entanglements of regulation and you know
 

01:58:41.250 --> 01:58:42.860
entanglements of regulation and you know
when I got the headhunter call I liked

01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:42.870
when I got the headhunter call I liked
 

01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:44.540
when I got the headhunter call I liked
practicing antitrust law I thought it

01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:44.550
practicing antitrust law I thought it
 

01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:46.460
practicing antitrust law I thought it
was great but I thought this is really

01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:46.470
was great but I thought this is really
 

01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:49.970
was great but I thought this is really
the last sort of fully economically

01:58:49.970 --> 01:58:49.980
the last sort of fully economically
 

01:58:49.980 --> 01:58:52.190
the last sort of fully economically
regulated industry obviously regulation

01:58:52.190 --> 01:58:52.200
regulated industry obviously regulation
 

01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:53.900
regulated industry obviously regulation
hits most industries in many different

01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:53.910
hits most industries in many different
 

01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:57.200
hits most industries in many different
ways but fully economically regulated

01:58:57.200 --> 01:58:57.210
ways but fully economically regulated
 

01:58:57.210 --> 01:58:59.030
ways but fully economically regulated
industry this was the last one to go

01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040
industry this was the last one to go
 

01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:01.820
industry this was the last one to go
through restructuring you know Airlines

01:59:01.820 --> 01:59:01.830
through restructuring you know Airlines
 

01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:05.620
through restructuring you know Airlines
had gone telecommunications trucking and

01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:05.630
had gone telecommunications trucking and
 

01:59:05.630 --> 01:59:08.150
had gone telecommunications trucking and
and and you know you got you're sitting

01:59:08.150 --> 01:59:08.160
and and you know you got you're sitting
 

01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:09.440
and and you know you got you're sitting
here with the electric industry and

01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:09.450
here with the electric industry and
 

01:59:09.450 --> 01:59:11.000
here with the electric industry and
you're left with it and I thought it's

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:11.010
you're left with it and I thought it's
 

01:59:11.010 --> 01:59:13.940
you're left with it and I thought it's
just a great opportunity you know for an

01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:13.950
just a great opportunity you know for an
 

01:59:13.950 --> 01:59:15.920
just a great opportunity you know for an
intellectual challenge and I never ever

01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:15.930
intellectual challenge and I never ever
 

01:59:15.930 --> 01:59:18.980
intellectual challenge and I never ever
thought I'd end up here I just thought I

01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:18.990
thought I'd end up here I just thought I
 

01:59:18.990 --> 01:59:20.060
thought I'd end up here I just thought I
was going to have a great time

01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:20.070
was going to have a great time
 

01:59:20.070 --> 01:59:22.150
was going to have a great time
practicing law in this

01:59:22.150 --> 01:59:22.160
practicing law in this
 

01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:24.760
practicing law in this
realm of untangling you know a

01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:24.770
realm of untangling you know a
 

01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:27.610
realm of untangling you know a
hundred-year network of regulation in a

01:59:27.610 --> 01:59:27.620
hundred-year network of regulation in a
 

01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:30.160
hundred-year network of regulation in a
way that would allow markets to work and

01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:30.170
way that would allow markets to work and
 

01:59:30.170 --> 01:59:32.800
way that would allow markets to work and
provide benefits you know to consumers

01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:32.810
provide benefits you know to consumers
 

01:59:32.810 --> 01:59:34.960
provide benefits you know to consumers
at the end of the day so that's why I

01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:34.970
at the end of the day so that's why I
 

01:59:34.970 --> 01:59:39.850
at the end of the day so that's why I
jumped alright so the last question what

01:59:39.850 --> 01:59:39.860
jumped alright so the last question what
 

01:59:39.860 --> 01:59:41.770
jumped alright so the last question what
is your strategy for handling the data

01:59:41.770 --> 01:59:41.780
is your strategy for handling the data
 

01:59:41.780 --> 01:59:44.050
is your strategy for handling the data
coming from new technologies and what

01:59:44.050 --> 01:59:44.060
coming from new technologies and what
 

01:59:44.060 --> 01:59:46.150
coming from new technologies and what
role do you see machine learning

01:59:46.150 --> 01:59:46.160
role do you see machine learning
 

01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:48.970
role do you see machine learning
techniques playing for tackling Grid

01:59:48.970 --> 01:59:48.980
techniques playing for tackling Grid
 

01:59:48.980 --> 01:59:53.470
techniques playing for tackling Grid
problems yeah I think so yeah data is a

01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:53.480
problems yeah I think so yeah data is a
 

01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:55.750
problems yeah I think so yeah data is a
is a huge question that is really you

01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:55.760
is a huge question that is really you
 

01:59:55.760 --> 01:59:57.760
is a huge question that is really you
know sort of underlies everything here

01:59:57.760 --> 01:59:57.770
know sort of underlies everything here
 

01:59:57.770 --> 02:00:00.160
know sort of underlies everything here
and there's a lot of work to be done

02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:00.170
and there's a lot of work to be done
 

02:00:00.170 --> 02:00:03.700
and there's a lot of work to be done
there so on the one hand we need data we

02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:03.710
there so on the one hand we need data we
 

02:00:03.710 --> 02:00:07.570
there so on the one hand we need data we
need to figure out how we use data for

02:00:07.570 --> 02:00:07.580
need to figure out how we use data for
 

02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:09.970
need to figure out how we use data for
operational purposes there is so much

02:00:09.970 --> 02:00:09.980
operational purposes there is so much
 

02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:11.860
operational purposes there is so much
opportunity to more be more efficient

02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:11.870
opportunity to more be more efficient
 

02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:15.070
opportunity to more be more efficient
operationally I mean we literally still

02:00:15.070 --> 02:00:15.080
operationally I mean we literally still
 

02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:20.170
operationally I mean we literally still
do you know our maintenance you know you

02:00:20.170 --> 02:00:20.180
do you know our maintenance you know you
 

02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:22.210
do you know our maintenance you know you
know time base maintenance every couple

02:00:22.210 --> 02:00:22.220
know time base maintenance every couple
 

02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:24.370
know time base maintenance every couple
weeks we send somebody to the substation

02:00:24.370 --> 02:00:24.380
weeks we send somebody to the substation
 

02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:26.320
weeks we send somebody to the substation
to you know check the gasses on the

02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:26.330
to you know check the gasses on the
 

02:00:26.330 --> 02:00:29.620
to you know check the gasses on the
transformer and you know to be able to

02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:29.630
transformer and you know to be able to
 

02:00:29.630 --> 02:00:33.100
transformer and you know to be able to
do condition based maintenance the the

02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:33.110
do condition based maintenance the the
 

02:00:33.110 --> 02:00:35.650
do condition based maintenance the the
amount of cost that will pull out of our

02:00:35.650 --> 02:00:35.660
amount of cost that will pull out of our
 

02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:38.260
amount of cost that will pull out of our
system is tremendous so that's you know

02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:38.270
system is tremendous so that's you know
 

02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:43.570
system is tremendous so that's you know
one lane of using data in in our

02:00:43.570 --> 02:00:43.580
one lane of using data in in our
 

02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:46.770
one lane of using data in in our
operations I think you know automation

02:00:46.770 --> 02:00:46.780
operations I think you know automation
 

02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:50.500
operations I think you know automation
and you know intelligence and robotics

02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:50.510
and you know intelligence and robotics
 

02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:56.310
and you know intelligence and robotics
also has you know tremendous benefits I

02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320
also has you know tremendous benefits I
 

02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:00.370
also has you know tremendous benefits I
saw recently robotics that's used on we

02:01:00.370 --> 02:01:00.380
saw recently robotics that's used on we
 

02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:02.880
saw recently robotics that's used on we
use drones to fly our transmission lines

02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:02.890
use drones to fly our transmission lines
 

02:01:02.890 --> 02:01:06.520
use drones to fly our transmission lines
but I saw a robot that essentially you

02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:06.530
but I saw a robot that essentially you
 

02:01:06.530 --> 02:01:08.320
but I saw a robot that essentially you
know runs along transmission lines and

02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:08.330
know runs along transmission lines and
 

02:01:08.330 --> 02:01:10.210
know runs along transmission lines and
detects you know faults and when you

02:01:10.210 --> 02:01:10.220
detects you know faults and when you
 

02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:12.450
detects you know faults and when you
think about being able to do your

02:01:12.450 --> 02:01:12.460
think about being able to do your
 

02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:15.520
think about being able to do your
inspections and maintenance by virtue of

02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:15.530
inspections and maintenance by virtue of
 

02:01:15.530 --> 02:01:18.550
inspections and maintenance by virtue of
technology you know not only are you

02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560
technology you know not only are you
 

02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:20.230
technology you know not only are you
going to run a better and more reliable

02:01:20.230 --> 02:01:20.240
going to run a better and more reliable
 

02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:22.450
going to run a better and more reliable
system but you're going to take cost out

02:01:22.450 --> 02:01:22.460
system but you're going to take cost out
 

02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:24.970
system but you're going to take cost out
so there's a big piece of data in

02:01:24.970 --> 02:01:24.980
so there's a big piece of data in
 

02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:26.920
so there's a big piece of data in
running our system that we have not

02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:26.930
running our system that we have not
 

02:01:26.930 --> 02:01:28.690
running our system that we have not
figured out we have just scratched the

02:01:28.690 --> 02:01:28.700
figured out we have just scratched the
 

02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:30.580
figured out we have just scratched the
surface and we need an awful lot of help

02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:30.590
surface and we need an awful lot of help
 

02:01:30.590 --> 02:01:34.810
surface and we need an awful lot of help
because it's just not our bailiwick

02:01:34.810 --> 02:01:34.820
because it's just not our bailiwick
 

02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:36.970
because it's just not our bailiwick
the second area is the data that you

02:01:36.970 --> 02:01:36.980
the second area is the data that you
 

02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:41.740
the second area is the data that you
need to animate markets and there's

02:01:41.740 --> 02:01:41.750
need to animate markets and there's
 

02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:43.780
need to animate markets and there's
always a push and pull there there are

02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:43.790
always a push and pull there there are
 

02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:45.850
always a push and pull there there are
you know third parties who tend to want

02:01:45.850 --> 02:01:45.860
you know third parties who tend to want
 

02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:47.920
you know third parties who tend to want
more of the information than we want to

02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:47.930
more of the information than we want to
 

02:01:47.930 --> 02:01:50.320
more of the information than we want to
give we're a little concerned because

02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:50.330
give we're a little concerned because
 

02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:52.330
give we're a little concerned because
obviously security interests in this

02:01:52.330 --> 02:01:52.340
obviously security interests in this
 

02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:56.260
obviously security interests in this
industry are significant and and so

02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:56.270
industry are significant and and so
 

02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:58.150
industry are significant and and so
we're very careful about what kind of

02:01:58.150 --> 02:01:58.160
we're very careful about what kind of
 

02:01:58.160 --> 02:01:59.920
we're very careful about what kind of
data gets out there about you know

02:01:59.920 --> 02:01:59.930
data gets out there about you know
 

02:01:59.930 --> 02:02:01.900
data gets out there about you know
system configuration and that sort of

02:02:01.900 --> 02:02:01.910
system configuration and that sort of
 

02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:03.880
system configuration and that sort of
thing so there's a big push pull on that

02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:03.890
thing so there's a big push pull on that
 

02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:05.380
thing so there's a big push pull on that
and I think that will continue for some

02:02:05.380 --> 02:02:05.390
and I think that will continue for some
 

02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:07.450
and I think that will continue for some
time and you know we'll find the right

02:02:07.450 --> 02:02:07.460
time and you know we'll find the right
 

02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:09.280
time and you know we'll find the right
balance but we are cognizant of the fact

02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:09.290
balance but we are cognizant of the fact
 

02:02:09.290 --> 02:02:11.620
balance but we are cognizant of the fact
that we're going to have to share more

02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:11.630
that we're going to have to share more
 

02:02:11.630 --> 02:02:13.540
that we're going to have to share more
and that it's important to have it out

02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:13.550
and that it's important to have it out
 

02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:16.600
and that it's important to have it out
there in order to animate markets create

02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:16.610
there in order to animate markets create
 

02:02:16.610 --> 02:02:19.690
there in order to animate markets create
benefits for for consumers and then I'd

02:02:19.690 --> 02:02:19.700
benefits for for consumers and then I'd
 

02:02:19.700 --> 02:02:21.250
benefits for for consumers and then I'd
say the third bucket is really data

02:02:21.250 --> 02:02:21.260
say the third bucket is really data
 

02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:23.320
say the third bucket is really data
privacy and and you know maintaining

02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:23.330
privacy and and you know maintaining
 

02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:26.320
privacy and and you know maintaining
that and that is very parallel to what

02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:26.330
that and that is very parallel to what
 

02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:28.480
that and that is very parallel to what
we see in other commercial entities and

02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:28.490
