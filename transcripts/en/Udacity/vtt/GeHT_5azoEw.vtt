00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.530
Our next important
concept is the matching.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.670
Given a graph,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.670
a subset of the edges is a matching
if no two edges share a vertex.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.670
Note that the graph doesn't
have to be bipartite.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.120
Take for example, this graph here.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.770
These two edges here
constitute a matching.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.950
By the way, we'll refer to an edge
in a matching as a matched edge so

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.140
these two edges are matched.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.280
And we'll refer to a vertex in
a matched edge as a matched vertex.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.330
So these four vertices
here are matched vertices.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.840
A maximum matching or

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.610
max matching, for short is
a matching of maximum cardinality.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.880
Note that a maximal matching
is not a maximum matching.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.130
For instance,
this matching here is maximal

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.220
because I can't add any more edges and
still have it be a matching.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.000
On the other hand,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.560
it's not maximum because there's
a matching of greater cardinality.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.870
For instance, this one here.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.410
This happens in bipartite graphs too.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.340
Here is a maximal matching but

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.900
it's not maximum because
there is a greater matching.
