00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
With the help of this analogy between gravity and water

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
analyse this case -- a huge spherical object of constant density

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in which we drill a hole that's half the radius deep.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now we put a test mass on the surface, blue position,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and in that hole, red position.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What's the ratio of the force of gravity in the blue position

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to the force of gravity in the red position.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Are these two forces equal?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Do we have twice the force at the surface or do we have twice the force at the inner point?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Or is it four times on the outside or four times at this inner position?
