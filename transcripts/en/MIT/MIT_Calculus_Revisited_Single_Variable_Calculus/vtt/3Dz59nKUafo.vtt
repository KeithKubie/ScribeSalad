00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:32.820
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.490
Today is the day we've
all been waiting for.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.080
We've come to the last lecture
of our course, and it's, I

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.600
think, a rather satisfying
lecture today, not just

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.450
because it is the last one,
but content-wise too.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.540
Today we're going to
talk about uniform

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.550
convergence of series.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.850
Remember, a series can be
viewed as a sequence of

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.790
partial sums, and consequently
our discussion on uniform

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.580
convergence applies here.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.050
And what we're going to do--

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.200
you see, again, it's
the same old story.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.200
Now that we know what the
concept means, is there an

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.110
easy way to tell when we
have the property?

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.870
And I figure again that, this
being the last lecture, I

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.220
should give you some big
names to remember.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.330
And name-dropping-wise, I come
to our first concept today,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.400
which I call--

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.470
I don't call it that.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.390
It's named the Weierstrauss
M-test.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.080
The Weierstrauss M-test is a
very, very convenient method

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.390
for determining whether a
given series converges

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.780
uniformly or not.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.170
By the way, let me just
make one little aside.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.030
Instead of saying the sequence
of partial sums converges

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.440
uniformly to the infinite
series, we usually abbreviate

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.400
that simply by saying, the
infinite series is uniformly

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.610
convergent.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.880
Let me just say that
one more time.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.440
If I say that the series is
uniformly convergent, that's

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.890
an abbreviation for saying that
the sequence of partial

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.950
sums converges uniformly
to the series.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.880
But at any rate, let me now
go over the so-called

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.780
Weierstrauss M-test with you.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.250
It's a rather simple test.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.950
I will give you both the proof
of the test and some

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.450
applications of it.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.160
The test simply says this--

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.990
and this is where the name
M-test comes from.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.570
See, because you put an
'M' in over here.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.530
If I put a 'C' over here, they
probably would have called it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.040
the Weierstrass C-test.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.400
But the idea is this.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.790
Suppose that the series,
summation 'n' goes from 1 to

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.740
infinity, capital
'M sub n', is a

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.190
positive convergent series--

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.540
this is going to be sort of
like the comparison test--

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.010
and that the absolute value of
''f sub n' of x' is less than

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.300
or equal to 'M sub n' for each
'n' and for each 'x' in some

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.540
interval from 'a' to 'b'.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.860
Then if this condition is
obeyed, the sequence of

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.760
partial sums--

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.980
some 'k' goes from 1 to 'n',
of ''f sub k' of x'--

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.720
converges uniformly to its limit
function, namely what we

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.065
call the series 'n' goes from
1 to infinity, ''f sub n' of

00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:06.990
x', on the interval
from 'a' to 'b'.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.670
See, in other words, if I can
get this kind of a bound on

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.110
what's going on, where these
form the terms of a positive

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.250
convergent series, then this
series converges uniformly.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.820
Now, again, let me outline
the proof.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.340
Once again, let me remind you
all of these proofs are done

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.340
rigorously and also with
supplementary wording in the

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.480
notes, so that you can pick this
up again if you missed

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.580
the high points in
the lecture.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.310
You see, to prove convergence
in the first place, I

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.460
have to show what?

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.760
That the sequence of partial
sums can be made to differ

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.510
from this limit, which I call
'f of x', by as small an

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.030
amount as I want, just by taking
'n' sufficiently large.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.680
And the way I work this thing
is I say, OK, let's take a

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.350
look at this difference.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.660
Well, remembering that another
name for 'f of x' is the limit

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.700
of this thing as 'k' goes from
one to infinity, I just

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.070
substitute this in place
of 'f of x'.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.570
I then get this.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.670
And now you see, if I subtract
the first 'n' terms from this

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.300
infinite series, what's left
is all the terms in the 'n

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.280
plus first' on.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.450
In other words, that this is in
turn equal to the absolute

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.880
value of the summation, 'k'
goes from 'n plus 1' to

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.610
infinity, ''f sub k' of x'.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.590
Again, don't be upset by the
'k's replacing the 'n'.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.070
Remember that 'k' is
a dummy variable.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.390
The hardship would be that if
I use the subscript 'n' over

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.720
here, I would have a logical
contradiction.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.020
How can you say 'n' goes from
'n plus 1' to infinity? 'n'

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.510
can't equal 'n plus 1',
so I just change

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.600
the subscript here.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.600
At any rate, if I now invoke
the triangle inequality for

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.680
absolute values--

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.020
namely, that the absolute value
of a sum is less than or

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.300
equal to the sum of the
absolute values--

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.530
I then get that the thing that
I'm investigating is less than

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.490
or equal to the sum, 'k' goes
from 'n plus 1' to infinity,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.530
absolute value ''f
sub k' of x'.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.260
Now, remember what the
Weierstrass condition was.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.920
It was that for each 'k', the
absolute value of ''f sub k'

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.810
of x', for all 'x' in my
interval, was less than or

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.230
equal to 'M sub k'.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.020
So I can now go from
here to here.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.600
But what do I know about the
series summation, 'M sub k'?

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.650
I know that that's a positive
convergent series.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.630
In particular, because it's
convergent, that means that

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.550
the tail end-- meaning from
'n plus 1' to infinity--

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.920
that sum can be made smaller
than any prescribed epsilon,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.780
smaller than any given epsilon,
simply by picking 'n'

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.220
sufficiently large.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.040
See, in other words, I can make
this difference less than

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.790
epsilon for 'n' sufficiently
large.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.180
And here's the key step.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:06.520
Since 'M sub k' does not depend
on 'x', this inequality

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.460
was done independently
of the choice of 'x'.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.640
You see, in other words, not
only do I have that this

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.730
converges to this, but since
this was done independently of

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.790
the choice of 'x', this is
uniform convergence.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.500
And maybe I should write that
down, because that's important

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.710
to remember, that this is
independently of 'x'.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.880
That's what makes the
convergence uniform.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.030
Well, let's continue on, I
think, by means of an example

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.900
might come in handy now.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.450
I think after you do any of
these abstract things, I think

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.890
a nice example shows what's
coming off very nicely.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.480
And so I very creatively
call this 'An Example'.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.670
Let's look at the following
series.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:56.600
'cosine x' plus 'cosine '4x over
4' plus et cetera 'cosine

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.270
''n squared x' over 'n
squared'', where 'n' is the

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.730
number of the term over here.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.450
For example, the third
term would be 'cosine

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.250
9x' over 9, et cetera.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.520
And I now want to look at
the limit function here.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.210
See, is this a convergent
series?

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.860
Is it absolutely convergent?

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.330
Is it uniformly convergent?

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.630
What is it?

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.870
And here's how the Weierstrauss
M-test works.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.180
We look at the absolute value
of the term making up this

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.670
particular series.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.760
See, the absolute value of
''cosine 'n squared x'' over

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.380
'n squared''.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.610
Now, let's take a
look at this.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.910
Since 'n' is an integer, 'n
squared' is positive, so the

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.460
absolute value of 'n squared'
is still in squared.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.810
Since the cosine has to be
between minus 1 and 1, the

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.850
magnitude of the cosine,
regardless of the value of 'n

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.280
squared x', is less than
or equal to 1.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.340
In particular, then, the
absolute value of ''cosine 'n

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.400
squared x'' over 'n squared''
is less than or equal to '1

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.990
over 'n squared''
for each 'n'.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:09.610
And I might add, and all 'x',
because no matter what 'x' is

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.790
and no matter what 'n' is,
'cosine 'n squared x'' in

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.170
magnitude cannot exceed 1.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.070
On the other hand, we already
know, in particular by the

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.360
integral test, that summation
'n' goes from 1 to infinity or

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.980
0 to infinity is a positive
convergent series.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.410
Consequently, by the
Weierstrauss M-test, this

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.360
series here is uniformly
convergent,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.970
which again means what?

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:39.500
That the sequence of partial
sums, namely sum 'k' goes from

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.380
1 to 'n', ''cosine 'k squared
x'' over 'k squared'',

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.280
converges uniformly to summation
'n' goes from 1 to

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.120
infinity ''cosine 'n squared
x'' over 'n squared''.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.410
That's how the test works.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.440
But now, from an engineering
point, the

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.850
more important question--

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.240
what does it mean?

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.870
How can we use it?

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.790
Well, for example, let's suppose
that in working some

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:07.470
particular applied problem,
one had to integrate this

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.510
particular series, 'cosine x'
plus ''cosine 4x' over 4' plus

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.140
''cosine 9x' over 9', et cetera,
the infinite series

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.440
from 0 to some value 't'.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.410
Now here's the key point.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.500
And by the way, I just
write it this way--

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.570
to get used to the ominous
notation, notice that what

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.120
looks a little bit ominous here
is just another way of

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.760
writing out, longhand, what
the terms inside the

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.250
parentheses are.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.500
The idea is this.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.070
Notice what this says--

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:40.060
this says first compute the
sum and then integrate.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.020
For example, we might not
know what limit this sum

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.150
approaches.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.270
Or if we do know it, it may be
a particularly complicated

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.880
thing to write down.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.640
You see, in other words, if we
follow the problem in the

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.830
order that the operations are
given, we must first sum this

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.510
series and then integrate it.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.370
But what have we
already shown?

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.300
We've already shown that this
series is uniformly

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.160
convergent, but for a uniform
convergent series, we saw last

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.720
time that you can interchange
the order of summation and

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.060
integration.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.200
In other words, by uniform
convergence, what I can now do

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.370
is integrate this thing
here, term by term.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.960
See, 'sine x' plus ''sine
4x' over 16'.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.530
Just the usual technique
of integration.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.740
And now you see I can integrate
first and then

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:31.890
compute the limit.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.170
In other words, I can say, look,
this integral is just

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.920
'sine t' plus ''sine 4t'
over 16' plus et

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.720
cetera, and so forth.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.520
Again, if you want to see this
from the abstract point of

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.020
view, what I'm saying is that by
uniform convergence, I can

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.170
switch these two symbols.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.460
Now, the important point is that
to integrate ''cosine 'n

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.440
squared x'' over
'n squared''--

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.660
remember, 'n' is a
constant here.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.600
This is a very easy thing
to integrate.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.270
In fact, it comes
out to be what?

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.470
''Sine 'n squared x'' over
'n to the fourth''.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.960
You see the 'n squared' comes
down as an 'n to the fourth'.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.450
And when I evaluate that between
0 and 1, all I wind up

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:12.400
with is summation 'n' goes from
one to infinity, ''sine

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.910
'n squared t'' over 'n
to the fourth''.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:19.050
And this is a perfectly good,
bona fide convergent series.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.320
And, in real life, you see I
can approximate this to any

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.790
degree of accuracy that I want
just by going out far enough

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.490
before I chop off the
remaining terms.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.860
In other words, the beauty in
this case with series is that

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.920
when they converge uniformly and
you have to integrate the

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.840
limit function, you can
integrate the individual

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.940
member of the sequence first and
then take the limit as n

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.630
goes to infinity.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.380
OK.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.720
So far so good.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.640
Let's apply this now, in
particular, to power series.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.400
And again, let me keep reminding
you, all of this

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.240
stuff is done much more slowly
in the supplementary notes.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.350
My main reason for repeating
what's in the supplementary

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:04.140
notes is I think this material
is both difficult enough and

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.770
new enough so I think you should
hear parts of it before

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.470
you're sent out on your
own to read it.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.680
Hopefully my words will sound
familiar to you as you hear

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.335
them repeated in the
supplementary notes.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:22.520
Let's suppose that a power
series summation, 'a n', 'x to

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.550
the n', as 'n' goes from 0 to
infinity, converges for the

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.570
absolute value of 'x'
less than 'R'.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.850
And let me pick a couple of
values of 'x', 'x sub 0' and

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:36.410
'x sub 1', such that 'x sub 0'
in magnitude is less than 'x

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.340
sub 1' in magnitude,
which in turn is

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.190
less than 'R' in magnitude.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.370
To give you a hint as to what
I'm going to be driving at,

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.590
I'm going to try to prove that
this series converges

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:47.800
uniformly within 'R'.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.650
And I'm going to try to prove
it by setting up the

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.920
Weierstrauss M-test.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.640
And I'm going to have to compare
this with a positive

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.610
convergent series, and the
positive convergent series

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.980
that I have in mind is going to
make use of the fact that

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.360
the magnitude of 'x0' divided by
the magnitude of 'x1' is a

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.960
positive constant less than 1.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.160
And I'm going to set this thing
up so that I can use a

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.940
geometric series on it.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.610
And if that sounds confusing,
let me just go through this

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.940
now in slow motion and show you
what I'm driving at here.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.230
See, first of all, since 'x1'
is within the radius of

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:27.450
convergence, that means in
particular that summation 'a n

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.980
''x sub 1' to the n'',
as 'n' goes from 0

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.450
to infinity, converges.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.390
Since this converges, in
particular-- the very first

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.410
test that we learned--

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.990
in particular, the n-th
term must go to 0.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.060
Remember, for a convergent
series, the n-th

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.770
term goes to 0.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:49.310
Now, since the limit of 'a n 'x1
to the n-th'' is 0, that

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:53.170
means that for n large enough,
this will get smaller than any

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.110
positive constant.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.700
Otherwise it couldn't
converge on 0.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:57.580
All right?

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.470
So all I'm saying there, I
guess, is if this is 0 and

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.940
this is 'M', if I can't make
this thing less than 'M', how

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.110
can the limit ever be 0?

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.440
In other words, if these things
can't get past 'M', how

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.170
could the limit be 0?

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.490
So all I'm saying is that, given
a positive 'M', I can

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.735
always find an 'n' such that
when I go out far enough-- in

00:14:16.735 --> 00:14:18.570
other words, when the subscript
'n' is greater than

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:23.340
capital 'N', the magnitude of
'a n 'x1 to the n'' is less

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.180
than capital 'M'.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.910
Now the key idea is this.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:31.910
What I'm going to do is look at
summation 'a n 'x0 to the

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.790
n'' where 'x0' is as
given over here.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.240
Now what I'm going to try to
do is set this up for the

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.720
Weierstrauss M-test, and
the way I'm going to

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.160
do that is as follows.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.060
I look at the absolute value
of 'a n 'x0 to the n''.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.590
Somehow or other, the thing I
have control over is not 'a n

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:56.580
'x0 to the n'', but rather
'a n 'x1 to the n''.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.590
And now I use that very common
mathematical trick that gets

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.940
us out of all sorts of binds,
and that is that, since I

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.010
would like 'a n 'x1 to the n''
over here, I just put it in.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.470
And then I must cancel
it out again.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:15.460
In other words, all I do is I
rewrite 'a n 'x0 to the n'' as

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:20.820
'a n' times 'x0' over 'x1 to the
n', times 'x1 to the n'.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.970
In other words, notice that this
just cancels and I have

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.730
what I started with over here.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.830
The point is that the magnitude
of 'a n 'x1 to the

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.350
n'' is less than 'M'.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:31.550
We already saw that.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.240
So what I do is I split
this thing up.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.730
Remember, the absolute value of
a product is the product of

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.020
the absolute values.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.550
So I write it as what?

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.530
The magnitude of this times
this, times the magnitude of

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.770
''x0 over x1' to the n'.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:50.310
In other words, I guess what
I should have over here--

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:51.840
this is still an equality.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.660
This is just rewriting.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.420
The absolute value of a product
is a product of the

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.510
absolute values.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:59.620
Consequently, this is the
absolute value of 'a n 'x1 to

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.400
the n'' times the absolute
value of ''x0

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.770
over x1' to the n'.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.840
And the key point is that the
absolute value of 'a n 'x1 to

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.780
the n'' is less than 'M' for
'n' sufficiently large.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.720
In other words, for 'n'
sufficiently large, the

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.220
magnitude of 'a n 'x0 to the n''
is less than or equal to

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.670
this expression here.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.510
But what is this expression?

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:26.690
My claim is that this is the
n-th term of a convergent

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.850
positive series, namely a
convergent geometric series.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.700
I'm going to to show you
this in more detail.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:37.620
All I'm saying is observe that
the magnitude of 'x0 over x1',

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.860
since 'x0' is less than 'x1'
in magnitude, is a positive

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.090
constant less than 1.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.750
Therefore, this is what?

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:50.680
This is a geometric series whose
ratio is 'x0 over x1'.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.300
In other words, as you pass from
the n-th term to the 'n

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.190
plus first' term, in each case
you just multiply by 'x0 over

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.590
x1', which is a constant.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:04.290
Therefore, by the Weierstrauss
M-test, this given series is

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:08.970
uniformly convergent inside the
interval of convergence.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.170
You see?

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.680
In other words, what this now
means is that we can replace

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.200
the condition that the series
was absolutely convergent

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.910
inside the radius of convergence
by, it's uniformly

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.540
convergent inside the radius
of convergence.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.930
And now you see the question is,
what does that help us do?

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.200
And again, this is left in
great detail for the

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.170
supplementary notes and the
exercises, but I thought that

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.360
for a finale, we should do
a rather nice practical

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.330
application.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:42.160
In particular, a problem that
we haven't tackled at all.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.760
We wern't able to tackle it, but
a problem that we've used

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:49.130
as a scapegoat many times to
show, for example, why the

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.570
First Fundamental Theorem of
integral calculus was not the

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:54.700
cure-all it was supposed
to be, for example.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.280
Let me show you what example
I have in mind.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.120
I'm thinking of this example.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.130
Find the area of the region 'R',
where 'R' is the region

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.020
bounded above by our old friend
'y' equals 'e to the

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.590
minus 'x squared'', below by the
x-axis, on the left by the

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.790
y-axis, and on the right by
the line 'x' equals 1.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.790
You see, what we used to
say before was what?

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.830
We know by the definition of a
definite integral that the

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.170
area of the region 'R' is the
integral from 0 to 1, 'e to

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.070
the minus 'x squared'', 'dx'.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:30.230
But what we do not know
explicitly is a function, 'G

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.670
of x', for which 'G prime
of x' is 'e to

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.220
the minus 'x squared''.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.520
Remember, we could solve this
problem by trapezoidal

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.380
approximations and things
of this type.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.490
We could approximate it, but we
couldn't get a good bound

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.270
on the answer very
conveniently.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.140
What I thought I'd like to show
you now is how one uses

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.950
power series to solve this
kind of a problem.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.310
If nothing else, this one
application should be enough

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.910
impetus to show you the
power of power series.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:02.170
They are a very, very important
and powerful

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:03.840
analytical technique.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.030
Let's see how we can
handle this.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:10.060
First of all, from our previous
material, we already

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:15.250
know that 'e to the u' is
represented by '1 plus u plus

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.930
''u squared' over '2 factorial''
plus' et cetera,

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.600
''u to the n' over 'n
factorial'', et cetera, for

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.540
all real numbers 'u'.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.450
OK, we already know that.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:28.270
In particular, if I now think
of-- see, since 'u' is

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:31.610
generically just a name for any
real number, since minus

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.690
'x squared' is a real number
also, I can replace 'u' by

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.150
minus 'x squared'.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.740
And replacing 'u' by minus 'x
squared' leads to what? 'e to

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:44.570
the minus 'x squared'' is
1, minus 'x squared'.

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:47.440
Now minus 'x squared', squared,
is 'x to the fourth',

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.060
over 2 factorial.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:54.990
And in general, we see when
I replace 'u' by minus 'x

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.440
squared', this becomes plus or
minus 'x to the 2n' over 'n

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.610
factorial'.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.980
And to handle the plus or minus,
I simply put in my sign

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.040
alternator-- that's minus
1 to the n-th power.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.980
And the reason I use 'n' here,
rather than, say, 'n plus 1',

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.200
is to keep in mind that in power
series, this is called

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.200
the 0-th term.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.910
In other words, when 'n' is 0,
minus 1 to the 0 would be

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.280
positive, and I want the first
term to be positive.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.360
At any rate, to make a
long story short--

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.440
shorter--

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.820
another way of writing this
is that 'e to the minus 'x

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.740
squared'' is summation 'n' goes
from 0 to infinity, minus

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.920
'1 to the n', 'x to the 2n'
over 'n factorial'.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.810
Consequently, since these two
are synonyms, to compute the

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.570
integral from 0 to 1, ''e to the
minus 'x squared'' dx', I

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:50.610
can replace 'e to the minus 'x
squared'' by the power series

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:54.850
which converges to
it uniformly.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.920
Namely, I can now write
this as what?

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.640
Integral from 0 to 1, summation
'n' goes from 0 to

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.770
infinity, minus '1 to the n',
'x to the 2n' over 'n

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.090
factorial' times 'dx'.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.510
Now notice what this says.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:13.250
This says, in the order of the
given operations, that I must

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.890
form the sum of this series
first, which is not an easy

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.840
job, and then integrate
that from 0 to 1.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:24.760
But the beauty is that, by the
Weierstrauss M-test, I know

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.380
that this converges uniformly
wherever it converges

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.400
absolutely.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.540
I already know that it does
converge absolutely

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.540
for all real 'x'.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.150
At any rate, then, I now know
that it's uniformly

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:36.100
convergent.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.750
One of the beauties of the fact
that this is uniformly

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.430
convergent is I can interchange
the order of

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.860
summation and integration,
which I do over here.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.380
But this is crucial.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.200
Let me make sure I
underline that.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.990
You see, if there wasn't uniform
convergence here,

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.670
mechanically I can change the
order, but I may get a

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.020
different answer.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.790
But since this is uniformly
convergent, these are still

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:02.100
synonyms, and the beauty is, if
I just look at the typical

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.620
term that I'm trying to
integrate here, that's a very

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.020
easy thing to integrate.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.250
Namely, I just do what?

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.290
Replace this by an exponent
one larger--

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.830
that's '2n plus 1'.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.890
Divide through by '2n plus 1'.

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:17.030
In other words, the integral
from 0 to 1, ''e to the minus

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:20.180
'x squared'' dx', is just this
particular power series,

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:24.790
namely summation 'n' goes from 0
to infinity, minus '1 to the

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:30.190
n', 'x to the '2n plus 1'' over
''2n plus 1' times 'n

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:31.300
factorial''.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.560
That must be evaluated
between 0 and 1.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.800
Since the lower limit gives me
0 and the upper limit here

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.500
just gives me a 1, rewriting
this-- this is just what?

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.840
Summation 'n' goes from 0 to
infinity, minus '1 to the n'

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.430
over ''2n plus 1' times
'n factorial''.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.790
In other words--

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:50.510
let's take a look at this.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.820
When 'n' is 0, this term is 1.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:59.440
When 'n' is 1, this is
minus 1 over what?

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.910
3 times 1 is 3.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:08.350
When 'n' is 2, this is 5 times
2 factorial, which is 10.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.250
When 'n' is 3, this is
minus 1 to the third

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.830
power, which is minus.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.200
This is 7 times 3 factorial.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.330
7 times 3 factorial is what?

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:22.600
7 times 6, which is
42, et cetera.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.900
In other words, what we now know
is that 'A sub R' is 1

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:31.330
minus 1/3 plus 1/10
minus 1/42.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:35.130
And if we keep on going this
way, the next term is 1/216,

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.540
which we can compute
very easily.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.840
What is this, by the way?

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.410
This is a convergent
alternating series.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.680
And as you recall from our
learning exercises and some of

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.190
the material in our
supplementary notes, not only

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:54.340
does this thing converge, but
in such a case the error is

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.380
never greater than the magnitude
of the next term.

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:02.820
So, you see, what I can do
over here is just take 1,

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:08.610
subtract 1/3, add 1/10, subtract
1/42, and know that

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:12.450
whatever answer I get when I
do this has to be exact to

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:16.470
within no more of an
error then 1/216.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.920
And in fact, if I now
add on the 1/216,

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.130
I think I get 0.748.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.620
And the next term is going to
be something like 1/1,300,

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.850
which means that this must be
correct to within three

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.750
decimal places.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.740
And this is the way the
so-called error function, the

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.510
table of error function,
is actually computed.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.450
Now I'm going to end the
material of the course right

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.280
at this particular point.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.260
In other words, I will leave the
remaining applications for

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.980
the exercises and the
supplementary notes.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:49.330
What I would like to do is to
become subjective for a moment

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:50.820
or so, if I may.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.450
And even though this course is
quite different from a regular

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.400
classroom course, I would like
to end it like a regular

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.230
classroom course.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:02.600
And that is to make a genuine
remark to the effect that this

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.000
course has been a pleasure
for me to teach.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.020
It has been very enlightening.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:11.000
It has been soul-searching to
both plan the lectures and the

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.390
supplementary notes and the
learning exercises, and I

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:17.880
myself, to coin a cliche, am a
much better person for having

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.650
gone through all of this.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:23.650
Many other people worked hard
with me on this also.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.620
And in particular, I would like
to single out three of my

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.000
colleagues for recognition.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.360
Professor Harold Mickley,
who was the

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.040
director of the center.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.200
My friend, John Fitch, who is
the manager of the self-study

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.730
projects and, in particular,
was the director of the

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.900
lectures, and also gave me
invaluable advice in many

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.220
places as to how to simplify
the lectures and make them

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.470
more meaningful.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:51.910
And finally, my friend Charles
Patton, who is our electronics

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.120
wizard here and kept everything
going from a

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.700
technological point of view,
and gave me, also, many

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:58.980
valuable pointers.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.210
Now, from your point of view,
I am hoping that you too can

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.510
sit back and feel content, now
that the course is over.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.090
I'm hoping that this long trip
back through Calculus

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:13.290
Revisited has given you a new
insight to sets, functions,

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.770
circular functions, hyperbolic
functions, differentiation and

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.850
integration, power series, so
that you can go back enriched,

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:25.510
revitalized, and tackle the
projects of your choice.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.930
I hate to see the course come to
an end, but in closing, it

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:32.640
was my pleasure and I hope that
we will have the pleasure

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.730
of getting together again soon
to tackle, together, Part Two

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:38.380
of Calculus Revisited.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.270
And so, until that
time, so long.
