[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.820
ZAINURA ZAINON NOOR:
trash, rubbish,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.340
or municipal solid
waste-- does not

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.430
make any difference
what we call it.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.670
The fact remains that same.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.150
We produce huge
amounts of it, and it

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.700
takes an enormous amount of
every community's resources

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.230
to deal with it.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.330
Cities are at the nexus
of a deeper threat

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.990
to the environment,
namely the production

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.090
of increasing quantity
and complexity of waste.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.840
In general, urban
residents generate

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.990
two to three times
more solid waste

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.440
than their fellow
rural citizens.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.380
Globally, the daily waste
generation in urban areas

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.320
is about 760,000
tons and is expected

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.190
to sharply increase to
1.8 million tons per day

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.530
by the year 2025.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.830
Municipal solid
waste especially,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.400
generated in the cities, is
the most complex solid waste

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.220
stream, as opposed
to more homogeneous

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.930
waste streams resulting from
industrial or agricultural

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.010
activities.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.190
The list of the top
10 countries that

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.140
generate the largest amount
of municipal solid waste

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.830
includes four developing
nations-- namely,

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.060
Brazil, China,
India, and Mexico.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.940
This is mainly due to
the size of their growing

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.389
urban population.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:14.260
Furthermore, their city dwellers
are prospering and adopting

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.560
high-consumption lifestyles.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.510
Urbanization and
income levels also

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.370
tend to determine the
type of waste generated.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.310
The share of inorganic
materials in the waste stream,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.470
such as plastics,
paper, and aluminum,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.280
also tends to increase
as people grow wealthier

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.160
and move to the cities.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.120
Cities' authorities which are
responsible for urban waste

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.150
management are struggling
with the accelerated

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.870
pace of waste production
in their jurisdiction.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.780
More than 50% of
the collected waste

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.640
is often disposed through
unsanitary land-filling,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.620
and about 15% is processed
through unsafe and informal

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.700
recycling.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.440
Improper solid waste
disposal in cities

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.040
impairs human health and
causes economy, environmental,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.020
and biological losses.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.930
In [INAUDIBLE] or
unsanitary landfills,

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.450
leachate, which is the fluid
emerges from the waste,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.240
can seep into the ground and
may contaminate both the soil

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.010
and the groundwater, posing
substantial health hazards

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.540
to any nearby communities.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.720
The common three R's are
reduce, reuse, and recycling.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.660
In order to be sustainable
in the long run,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.500
solid waste
management must start

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.540
with reducing consumption,
followed by reuse and lastly,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.680
recycle.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.320
Reducing consumption
will require

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.060
a dramatic cultural shift
and behavior change,

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.180
which may take a long time.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.900
Therefore, in addition to
presenting awareness campaigns

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.650
on the importance of consuming
less and re-using more,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.110
cities should also adopt
strong recycling programs.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.710
Recycling is a process
of turning materials

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.910
that would otherwise
become waste

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.640
into valuable resources of
financial, environmental, and

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.440
social returns.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.490
With emphasis on urban
and peri-urban areas,

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.240
recycling is viewed
as a sustainable means

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.300
of diverting maximum fractions
of municipal solid waste

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.710
from landfill disposal,
since the waste generated

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.760
in this area contains
substantially

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.670
less organic portion
compared to rural areas.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.380
The benefits of recycling
go far beyond just

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.480
saving landfill space.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.200
It provides a source of
valuable raw materials.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.120
Multiple markets exist for
papers, plastic, glass, metals,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.100
and other materials.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.150
Although collecting and
selling these materials

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.270
will not make a profit
for the community,

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.660
it may reduce the community's
waste management cost

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.600
by creating a revenue
stream from waste.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.950
Recycling undoubtedly
saves resources.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.840
One ton of recycled
newspaper saved

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.460
the equivalent of 17
trees, two barrels of oil,

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.340
and 41,000 kilowatt
hours of energy.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.400
One ton of recycled
plastic saved

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:35.090
5,774 kilowatt hours of energy
and 16.3 barrels of oil.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.870
And one ton of
recycled aluminum saved

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.365
14,000 kilowatt hours of
energy and 40 barrels of oil.

00:05:43.365 --> 00:05:47.560
Apart from conserving
resources and creating revenues

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.300
from waste stream,
recycling also

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.370
provides new jobs and economy
development potential.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.790
A well-managed recycling
program provides employment

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:03.020
for people who have difficulty
finding work in other places.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.500
In Malaysia, 64% of the
overall waste composition

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.160
is dominated by
municipal solid waste.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.670
Out of this, 80%
are recyclables.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.285
Plastics are probably the most
common recyclable material

00:06:19.285 --> 00:06:22.470
with high potential for
recycling in Malaysia,

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.250
since this material
is widely used

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.450
and part of a modern
lifestyle in urbanized areas.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.280
Growth rates in Malaysia
plastic industries

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.790
reached an average of 15%
for the past 11 years,

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.180
indicating a high demand for
this material in the country.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.960
Recycling should be
greatly emphasized,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.750
especially at the most
basic level of community,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.350
which is the household unit.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.090
Households are the
highest contributor

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.570
among the municipal solid
waste sources in Malaysia.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.250
Although households in Malaysia,
as well as around the world,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.070
will need to significantly
reduce the consumption

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.500
rate, and subsequently
their waste generation,

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.430
in the short-term
context, proper recycling

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.620
can lead to a substantial
reduction in terms

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.154
of waste sent to landfill.

00:07:15.154 --> 00:07:19.734
Malaysia aims to be a
developing country by year 2020,

00:07:19.734 --> 00:07:24.380
and among other measures has
set a target of achieving

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.170
a recycling rate of 22%.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:34.580
However, its recycling
rate was 5% in 2002

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:41.160
and only increased slightly
to 5.5% in 2006 and 2008.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.460
Compared to neighboring
countries in Southeast Asia,

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.870
this is far too low.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.430
Singapore, for example, has
a recycling rate of 56%,

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.530
and the Philippines is at 12%.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.710
So what are some of
the underlying reasons

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.340
for this shortfall?

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.750
In Malaysia,
municipal solid waste

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.490
is managed by the National Solid
Waste Management Department

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.660
under the Ministry of
Urban Well-Being, Housing,

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.550
and Local Government.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.120
Recently, the ministry
formulated the Solid Waste

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.930
and Public Cleansing
Management Act, SWPCM 2007,

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.320
which includes the promotion
of waste minimization

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.937
through the three
R's activities.

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:27.270
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.260
Although the enactment of
SWPCM Act 2007 has provided

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.090
legislative empowerment to
the Malaysian government,

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:03.120
it cannot be fully enforced
and implemented due to the lack

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.190
of other supporting regulation.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.510
In several major cities in
which the two-plus-one system

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:15.130
of collection has started,
implementation is not smooth.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:19.450
Majority of households are not
fully aware of the collection

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.140
schedule.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:26.550
Furthermore, separate bin for
recyclable is not provided.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.610
Due to these reasons,
many households

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.110
are quite reluctant to
actively participate

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.850
in the recycling program.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.690
Despite the
mandatory [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.510
of household waste
under the act,

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.280
the implementation
has been weak.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.920
Fines are yet to be imposed
on households that do not

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.140
separate their waste at source.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.630
Another major challenge in
promoting recycling activities

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.410
in Malaysia is related to
the lack of public support.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.350
Despite numerous
public awareness

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.070
and campaigns
throughout the years,

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.920
public responses to
recycling activities

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.550
are still at a very low stage.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.980
I think definitely it's
to do with awareness.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.365
We have done a lot of work--
I'm sure the government has

00:11:11.365 --> 00:11:13.560
done the same thing for local.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.330
But I think awareness
is critical,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:22.730
mainly because we are a society
that is so used to-- just let

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.390
somebody else deal with it.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.270
We do a lot of complaining.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:33.110
IE, when we see rubbish on
the ground in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.809
business like that, we complain.

00:11:35.809 --> 00:11:37.850
Why isn't the authority
doing something about it,

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:38.641
that kind of thing.

00:11:38.641 --> 00:11:41.530
But we never think that it
is our responsibility that we

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.240
should be doing ourselves.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.710
So it is a point where
being aware of it

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.440
and taking responsibility
and going in there

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.960
and digging it up and putting
it in a rubbish bin [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.890
So awareness is
critical to doing that.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.360
Although most
households understand

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.060
the need for
sustainable development,

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:07.030
this level of awareness does
not always translate to actions.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.920
In many cases, the
households that do recycle

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.730
are motivated by
financial gain rather

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.660
than feeling a sense
of responsibility

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.360
in reducing their waste in order
to conserve their resources

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.850
and environment.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.130
Several approaches
can be implemented

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.550
towards achieving the
desired goals of recycling

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.120
community in Malaysia's cities.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.050
Current scenario has
suggested that there

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.470
are policies and
facilities in place,

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.080
but they are not
comprehensive enough

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.120
to contribute to an
effective recycling program.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.120
Providing separate
bins for recyclables

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.070
and ensuring households are
aware of the two [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:55.380
schedule may prove to be among
the best, yet simple, approach

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.740
to encourage people to
participate actively

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.850
in the recycling activities.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:05.410
Moreover, proper collection
points, systematic collection,

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:09.080
and processing of recyclable
need to be established.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.520
For this to happen, all
relevant stakeholders-- namely,

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.920
the federal and
municipal governments,

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.520
concessionaires, traders,
recycling center operators,

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.640
and NGOs-- must
coordinate their efforts.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.300
Strong enforcement
of SWPCM Act 2007

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.270
is another critical factor.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:36.730
Strategies such as
imposing fees on households

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:41.840
that are not segregating their
waste should be considered.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.470
Households may find this
approach to be taxing at first,

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.530
but they will be
encouraged to recycle.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.650
At the same time, the
role of financial reward

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.350
among households should
not be overlooked.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.980
Rewards such as
rebates and incentives

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:05.860
should be utilized to encourage
recycling until the habit can

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.940
be sustained.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:13.990
However, despite having
financial and regulatory tools

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:18.840
as the principal instrument
for driving change in behavior,

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.700
the effectiveness
of the tools is

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.620
strongly dependent
on reflecting--

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.220
reshaping attitudes,
motivations,

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.120
and norms within a community.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.920
There is still a long
way towards achieving

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:38.110
the 22% recycling rate
by 2020 in Malaysia,

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.810
and it remains
unclear whether or not

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.770
the ambitious goal can be met.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.390
However, if the proposed
strategies addressing

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.710
the barriers can be
carried out effectively,

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:54.800
there is a high possibility
for successful implementation

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.450
of sustainable solid waste
management in the country.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:02.100
