00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.690
All right.
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.430
If I'm a little less energetic than
usual I just flew back from Taiwan and

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.280
boy are my arms tired.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.190
That's like a really,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.255
really, really, really old joke but
I really did just fly back from Taiwan.

00:00:13.255 --> 00:00:15.570
After spending just four days there and
back.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.750
So if I start talking,
if I start talking quietly,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.780
Megan'll remind me to wake up a little.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.770
All right, today and for
the next little bit,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.790
we're going to be talking
about segmentation.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.030
And it's going to follow our
color conversation because

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.590
it's important to think about spaces in
which you're describing your pixels and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.230
doing that and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.210
the fact that you guys now know about
color spaces will make this easier.
