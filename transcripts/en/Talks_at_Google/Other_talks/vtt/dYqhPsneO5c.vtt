00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.935
CHASE IRON EYES:
[SPEAKING LAKOTA]

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.070
That means that I consider
you all my friends.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.770
[SPEAKING LAKOTA]

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.440
I'm very happy and
honored to be here,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.250
and my name is Chase Iron Eyes.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.780
And I'm excited to be here.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.730
I really-- the
energy is great here.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.070
From the time that we arrived
here, I could feel the energy,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.800
and I really want to
thank those who took time

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.200
out of their schedules,
out of their days, those

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.410
amongst the Google
American Indian network,

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.120
to make this possible
from the time

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.082
we arrived at our parking spots.

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:56.540
You know, there's
little signs that

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.680
say, Parking Reserved or has
a little picture of Yoda that

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.450
says, Do Not Park.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.060
Park-- how does he say it?

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.000
How Yoda talks.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.010
We're reserving it
for Chase Iron Eyes.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.960
So I want to tell you
a little bit about--

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.190
I was born in the Black Hills
of what is now South Dakota.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.750
Some of you have
probably been there.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.410
It's where Mt.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.490
Rushmore is and so forth.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.420
And my mother moved us back
to the Standing Rock Nation

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.090
or the Standing
Rock Reservation,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.400
where I grew up there my
whole life, until I was 19.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.510
And then I went to college.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.820
So growing up on a reservation,
a modern American Indian

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:56.550
reservation at a time in this--

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.550
I was born in 1978,
and the reservations

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:08.850
were created kind of as
military forts and prison camps

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.820
during the late 1870s, when--

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.700
and it's important
to start there,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:24.330
because today, September 5th,
2017, it is now September 5th,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.840
1877, is about a year after
the Battle of Little Big Horn.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.900
It's popularly known
as Custer's Last Stand.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.410
We don't think Custer made
any kind of last stand,

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.650
but Crazy Horse
surrendered in 1877.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.260
And on this day in
1877, Crazy Horse

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.250
was assassinated by his
own people, by my people.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.900
And that ties right into
what Standing Rock, what

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.870
the water protected
movement was all about

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.070
and what it is all about.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.631
And that is our
path to liberation.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.240
I wanted to tell you
about Crazy Horse,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:23.140
because he would say things
like, people or a man

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.330
must have a vision,
and they have

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.690
to seek that vision to the
deepest blues of the skies.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.830
He would say things like,
it's a good day to die.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.830
And at first glance, those
seem quite shocking, maybe,

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.440
but when you study
divinity, or you're

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.610
trying to commune with
the divine consciousness

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.100
in any kind of ceremonial or
metaphysical or ritual way,

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.660
whether it's meditation
or whatever it is for you,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.090
you come to the
conclusion that any day,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.810
really, when you are united
with the divine consciousness--

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.170
God, Allah, or
whether it's the Hindu

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.170
tradition, the Yogic
tradition, whatever it is--

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.920
any day is a good day to die,
because death is not a death.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.610
Death is only a change.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.020
It's as much as part of
life, and people felt that

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.470
at Standing Rock.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.960
For us out there, it
wasn't a difficult choice

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.280
to have to say to
ourselves, we are

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.420
going-- we are being called
to risk our liberty, perhaps,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.800
our life, our earning
potential, our reputations,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.940
our professional reputations.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.940
Right now, my law
license is at risk.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.770
It's on the line.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.520
I'm being charged with a
felony, with inciting a riot,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.300
and I'm facing a five-year
maximum prison sentence

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.470
right now.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.250
But my story started on
the Standing Rock Nation,

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.460
the Standing Rock Reservation.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.690
And when you grow up in those
environments, where there

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.510
was a very premeditated
and deliberate attempt

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.250
to kind of erase the
original spiritual dignity,

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:40.300
self-determination,
self-reliance, self-esteem,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.330
and fortunately,
we are survivors.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.930
And we survived a
genocide, a Holocaust,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.370
all up and down the hemisphere.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.774
We survived slavery
and so forth.

00:05:50.774 --> 00:05:52.690
We know-- those of us
who are paying attention

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.630
know our history in
what we should now

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.120
be considering our homeland.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.120
It's not just our country.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.400
But I didn't--

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.000
I grew up inside that
environment, where

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.890
it's very much an
imposed poverty culture,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.830
and all of the quality
of life indicators

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.230
are kind of akin
to what would be

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.560
present in a third world
country like Haiti and so forth.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.550
There's a lot of challenges,
a lot of obstacles.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.020
There's also just what I like
to call unconquerable dignity

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.410
and unconquerable hope.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.220
And it's evident when the
poorest people in the world--

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.850
put some quotations
around the word, "poor--"

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:52.420
materially impoverished,
deliberately, we

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.820
made a choice to
stand up on behalf

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:01.090
of a universal element, a sacred
element that we call water.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.560
In our cosmology, in our
methodology, we have--

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.359
some of you have heard
the term, [LAKOTA]..

00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:10.400
Have you heard that term?

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.710
You've all heard
the term, [LAKOTA]..

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.620
So that's the Lakota language.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.760
And in order to say
something like [LAKOTA],,

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.980
or really to gain
an understanding

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.660
of the origin of
that phrase, you

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:32.350
have to go back to one of
our first creation stories.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.220
We have Lakota words for these
stories, what the West would

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.500
sometimes call myths.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.564
I mean it's not wrong
to call them myths,

00:07:40.564 --> 00:07:42.730
but that kind of has a
certain connotation like it's

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:47.410
a fairy tale, or it's
folklore, and so forth.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.890
It sounds like the opposite of
what the scientific method is

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.240
and what empiricism is.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.000
It sounds like a superstition.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.770
But for us, these
are called knowledge.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:05.020
They're called [LAKOTA],,
the first beginnings.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.380
These stories are
called [LAKOTA]..

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.860
These are things that I
learned from my elders.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.680
And there is a different
kind of story that's not--

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.480
it's not like creation stories.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.880
They're just
stories like fables.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.170
And those are called [LAKOTA].

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.650
And when you say
the words, [LAKOTA],,

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.539
you have to ask yourself,
where does water come from?

00:08:36.042 --> 00:08:37.500
Just think about
that for a second.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.789
Where does water come from?

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:45.170
We know it's composed of a
couple of hydrogen molecules

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.400
and an oxygen molecule.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.550
We know certain
things about water.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.460
We know that when
the spring comes,

00:08:53.460 --> 00:09:01.080
it thaws in the mountains,
and it creates its own path.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.830
It's being held in the
embrace of Mother Earth.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.270
And because the seasons
renew themselves,

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:12.410
this water is able
to find its way

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.520
through the mountains,
every spring, every freshet,

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:22.860
every creek, every stream,
even to raging rivers.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.530
They are all one water,
and all of that water

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.390
is flowing to every ocean.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:34.880
There is really only one
water in our universe.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.070
That includes even the rain
cycles, the evaporation cycle.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.460
It's all connected.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.170
But according to our--
just this one cosmology,

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.220
there was a time of--

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.840
the English word for it is
darkness, but our word for it

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.340
is han, H-A-N.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.090
I don't know the true
etymology of the word, han,

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.590
but I know from my son peppering
me with questions, because he

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:08.300
says, Dad, is han nothing?

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.650
And I said, no, han is
definitely not nothing.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.230
Darkness is not nothing.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.420
Dark matter, dark
energy, whatever

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.380
is holding the entire
incomprehensible,

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:29.740
infinite expansion that is our
known universe is not nothing.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:35.362
Eons ago, more than geologic
eons ago, there was han,

00:10:35.362 --> 00:10:40.600
and in that time, the
foremost spirit had a name.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.740
It still has a name,
and its name is Inyan.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.850
Now, Lakota cosmology
personifies Inyan

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.480
and calls him a he.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.550
Again, when I tell these
stories to my daughters,

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:58.890
they don't necessarily agree
with assigning a gender

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.990
to a spirit.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.510
So I use the word, "it," or
maybe just the name, Inyan,

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.460
because Inyan really
doesn't have a gender.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:12.040
We call it a he, traditionally.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:17.500
Inyan became lonely,
and Inyan begin to spin.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.460
And it spun so
violently that it caused

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:27.680
an intergalactic,
universal explosion.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.370
And in that explosion,
Inyan created

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:41.930
a disc, a globe, a sphere, and
Inyan sacrificed its own blood

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:47.420
to create this disc and
to cause this creation.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:55.770
But it had to create of itself,
and Inyan's blood is water.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.650
So Inyan, all of its
powers-- remember,

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.460
he's the foremost spirit--
flowed from him, or it,

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.320
into water and into this
plane, this disc now

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.490
that is Mother Earth.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.230
And Mother Earth
wasn't the Mother Earth

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.060
that we know right now.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.820
It was uninhabitable
at the time.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.630
But his powers flowed
into the water,

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.959
into the blue dome around
Mother Earth, the atmosphere,

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:23.500
and so forth.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:31.977
So when we say that water is
life, this is what we mean.

00:12:31.977 --> 00:12:32.810
These are the deep--

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.190
you know, deep connotations
that come from saying,

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:45.760
water is life, or [LAKOTA],,
or water is sacred.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.020
It brings into being, brings
forth our very cosmology.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.000
So we have a very real, a
sacred connection to water,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.760
and so do you.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:01.250
Everybody's walking around with
75% of their body is water.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:06.790
So one last note on
that cosmovision,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.450
because those things
are important,

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.530
especially in a
time like 2017, when

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.720
we have crossed certain
areas of the digital divide.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:23.160
And we're going to pursue
even more powerful areas

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.790
of the digital experience,
the digital divide.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:33.460
And we have to remember our own
sanctity, our own connection

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.360
to Mother Earth, to the
sacred sites, to the waters,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.270
to the cosmos.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.477
Now, some of you have
heard of a sweat lodge.

00:13:42.477 --> 00:13:43.810
Have you heard of a sweat lodge?

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:53.310
One last note about that,
and I tell you these things,

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.230
so you can get a
sense of who I am,

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.810
who we are, the blood
in the cosmovision

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:58.800
that I was born into.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.920
When we have a
sweat lodge, so when

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.580
Inyan sacrificed
itself and its power,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.160
he sacrificed his own place
as the foremost spirit

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.010
and its power flowing
into the waters

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.810
and into the blue dome
around Mother Earth.

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.600
Inyan shriveled up
and became a rock.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.630
He became a hard rock,
and you find-- you

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.450
see him all over the planet.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.792
Some people would
just see a rock.

00:14:28.792 --> 00:14:33.830
So it would see an
inanimate object,

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:37.030
would think that
human beings would

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.040
have some sort of
pretentious right

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.270
to a certain dominion
over these inanimate

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:48.090
objects, even the animate ones.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:54.310
But we see what we call
[LAKOTA],, or the oldest God.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.280
And when we go into a sweat
lodge, you take Inyan,

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.720
you take these rocks.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.800
[LAKOTA] is just
another name Inyan.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.120
And you heat them up.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.930
You combine them with fire, and
they become glowing, red hot.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.560
And you take them
into a sweat lodge

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:18.310
that is ceremonially and
symbolically appointed.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.290
This whole talk could
be about our cosmology,

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.280
but I just want to end on this.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:27.490
There are 16 entities that we
respect in Lakota cosmovision

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.710
or mythology or religion.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.980
Just like Joseph Campbell
says, everyone's--

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.970
mythology is just other
people's religions.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.320
So in ours, there's
these 16 deities.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:46.690
And Inyan used to be number
one, but now he's number four.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:50.730
But when we bring in Inyan,
the hot rocks, into the lodge,

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:54.310
and we bring in water,
that's Inyan's blood.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:58.330
And we reunite Inyan
with its blood,

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.160
and we pour the
water on the rocks.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.380
And you hear these
ancient, older

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:09.630
than time sounds,
universal sounds,

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:13.720
natural and elemental sounds.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.420
And that's on my journey
that I've been on

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.820
in trying to free the water
protectors and making sure

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.441
nobody does a single day
in prison or in jail.

00:16:25.441 --> 00:16:26.440
I've been talking a lot.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:33.180
I've been talking a lot about
the word, "colonization,"

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:38.160
and how those of us who are
reared in American education

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.200
systems or Canadian
education systems

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.480
or educational
institutions of the West,

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.930
we think of colonization
as something

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:50.820
that's now called white people
colonizing and enslaving

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.310
brown people and black people.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:55.100
It's OK.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.620
That's a trope.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.990
That's a way to think about it.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.520
That's a way to
experience that word.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.340
I know, because I grew
up on a reservation.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:08.470
But as I expanded my
horizons, put myself

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.780
in those educational
institutions, whether that

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.730
was undergraduate training or
law school or whatever it was,

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.494
I found out that white
people is not a real word.

00:17:19.494 --> 00:17:21.910
I found this out when I ran
for the United States Congress

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.160
as well.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.410
There's no such thing as that.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:29.570
There's a such thing
as Germans and Russians

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.490
and people of
Scandinavian descent,

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:39.540
Norwegians all over
North Dakota, Irish,

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.210
even though Irish don't
consider themselves

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:44.430
white in that demographic.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.040
But I began to explore
the word, "colonization,"

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.930
as it applied to
those demographics,

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:54.470
because what I found out is that
everybody had been separated.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.200
There was this process
of abstraction,

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:03.900
a separation, a division of
our mind from our spirit,

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:10.050
our heart from our intellect,
our human connection

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.180
to something so basic
as our food source.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.200
Who here among us has a sacred
relationship with their food

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.160
source right now?

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.252
That's right.

00:18:21.252 --> 00:18:22.710
There's people
raising their hands,

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:26.840
because we are seeking
that reconnection.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.670
That's why I think so many
people went to Standing Rock.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:37.870
That's why I think so many
people respond to song.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.450
They respond to the drum.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:44.440
They respond to what the West,
again, would call ritual,

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:49.030
but we just call it
ceremony or protocol.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:54.670
And some of these songs that
descend from our cosmologies,

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:55.900
they don't have words.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.220
They're older than literacy.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.590
Not even literacy, but
the oral tradition.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:10.770
And they're inspired by
the elements themselves,

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:17.230
by the wind, for instance, or
the birds, the winged nation.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.370
These songs are
inspired and gifted

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.920
from other groups of the
four-legged community,

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.120
whether that's wolves
or coyotes or what.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.670
For us, nature is our media.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.790
Truly, nature is our media.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:46.930
And I think that I'm here at
Google, the world's leader,

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:55.680
the harbinger, the harbinger
really laying the foundations,

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.360
the archetypes of
how we are going

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.400
to color our
personalities, how we

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:07.280
are going to perceive
our realities,

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.040
how we are going to
connect with each other,

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.060
with our surroundings,
how we are going

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:20.730
to interface with the universe.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:26.540
Very, very powerful concepts
and challenges are coming,

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:33.340
and what I know is that we are
sitting amongst each other,

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:38.760
and we are sitting amongst
people, who have the capacity

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:48.430
to appreciate a term like,
water is life, or [LAKOTA]..

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.770
I wanted to start
there, and then

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:55.450
talk a little bit about what
happened at Standing Rock.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.330
But before I start
there, how many people

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.718
had a chance to go out to
Standing Rock in the room?

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.730
That's pretty good.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.430
Like I said before, I had
finished law school sometime

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:18.070
in 2007, and we did not move
back to the Standing Rock

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:27.890
Reservation until 2014.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:32.870
And it was a strange experiment
to bring our kids back

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.120
to that environment,
because they had never

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.630
lived there before.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.090
And it was-- we're
thankful today

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:44.440
that we went back,
that we came back home.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.160
It wasn't until two years
later that I began my run

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.170
for the United States Congress.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:55.610
And actually, in some
synchronistic way,

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.740
it was April 1st,
and I was going

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.150
to seek the nomination, the
endorsement of the North Dakota

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.260
Democratic Party.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.150
And I ran into
this large caravan.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:13.630
We're talking 100
horses, runners,

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:18.340
like a caravan of cars
a couple miles long,

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.420
and I was in a hurry.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.880
Like I'm always running
late for things.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.427
I was in a hurry, and I
came up behind this caravan,

00:22:26.427 --> 00:22:28.010
and I thought, oh,
no, I'm going to be

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.800
late for the Democratic
Convention, where I've

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.510
got to receive the nomination.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:36.120
So we got to go through
this whole process.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.710
So I had to stop
what I was doing,

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:43.600
turn around, and go all the way
around a different route, which

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.220
was almost certain
to make me late.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.140
But I made it.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.540
But it was a sign
to me that I was not

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.700
going to be able to ignore this
Dakota Access Pipeline issue.

00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:04.060
And I remember thinking,
in the community,

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.820
we didn't quite know
how we were going

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.570
to deal with this pipeline or
how we were going to fight it.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:15.360
And if it wasn't for
technology, if it wasn't

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.760
for those platforms, that
kind of democratized media,

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.140
democratized journalism,
and just the ability

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.580
to get your story out in the way
that you wanted to get it out,

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.410
we would not have
been able to generate

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:35.820
the attention or the
effort, or we would not

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:41.530
have been able to spark
this international spiritual

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:46.210
monument is what one of
our elders refers to it as.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:51.160
It's a spiritual monument
that lives in our hearts

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.440
and in our minds.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:58.460
Everywhere I go, people know
what "water is life" means.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.130
But water is life--

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:05.100
it is more than just
a saying or a mantra.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.850
It calls into question
the very meaning of terms

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:15.900
like, "civilization," the
very meaning of terms like,

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:21.790
"progress," and how
those concepts have

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:25.940
been defined for us,
but for a long time,

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.709
by these processes
of separation.

00:24:28.709 --> 00:24:30.500
Before, when I was
talking about separating

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:34.310
our spirit from our mind,
and our human experience

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.500
with the sacred, whether
that's a food source

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.750
or sacred sites or the cosmos.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.700
I mean, if you go
back far enough

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.310
in any one of your
lineages, you will

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.280
find that you are descended
from original people,

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.660
original nations, who had
these sacred covenants.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.760
And now, today, we
think of those people

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.380
as indigenous people.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.120
And that's OK, because
indigenous people

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.000
is an international
legal term of art,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.616
kind of like tribal nation.

00:25:03.616 --> 00:25:04.990
But through my
journey, I've been

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:08.500
able to make the
connection that we weren't

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.810
the only ones colonized.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:17.010
Europe was colonized way before
they got to our continent,

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.890
and that separation
had occurred.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:23.490
And people are trying to
reconnect to that right

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:28.750
now, in our country,
in our homeland.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:33.830
I really-- I've been able to
find that out just in my last

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:38.380
few months of travel is
that we are yearning--

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:43.010
I like to say that our spirits
are grieving for ceremony,

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:48.350
because intrinsically, we
are spiritual beings that

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:52.490
are seeking this
liberation, that are seeking

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:56.450
to be able to transcend either
the limits we were born into,

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:59.450
our bodies, and our
language, and certainly,

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.290
seeking to liberate
from those labels

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:08.590
and other human constructs
like race, like religion,

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.000
and so forth.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.340
And I think those of us who
are in these circles, who

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.750
are part of this
spiritual evolution,

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:22.650
or certainly, a
social evolution,

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:27.820
those of us who are
on this trajectory

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.730
are seeing each other.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:35.110
That energy is resonating
with all of us,

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:38.900
and it's being challenged
right now politically.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:44.000
You can see the separation,
the hate, the division,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.550
and the fear that is
being perpetrated.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:53.690
It's being pushed out, and it
finds it homes in some places.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:27:00.570
But those of us who are guided
by love, guided by compassion,

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:09.330
guided by peace and prayer
and dignity and bravery,

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:16.430
we know that we cannot back
down from any injustice,

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.777
no matter what the odds are.

00:27:19.777 --> 00:27:21.360
And at Standing Rock,
right now, there

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:28.130
are 843 people, who are
facing criminalization,

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:33.410
facing criminalization, because
a private military contractor

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:39.080
was able to instigate
corporate-sponsored and

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.210
state-executed
violence and rights

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:49.440
violations against peaceful
and prayerful water protectors.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.380
Those of you who followed
the entire struggle know

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.590
that not once did we
instigate violence,

00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:03.200
did we instigate aggression,
did we do any kind of assault

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:10.630
or assert ourselves in that way.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:15.200
And it's a very conscious
and strategic choice

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:23.220
that those of us,
who can see that we

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:28.470
are at risk of being oppressed,
that we are at risk of having

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:33.450
our water poisoned
or privatized,

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:38.890
that what constitutes
law and order

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:40.870
and what constitutes
our jurisprudence

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:44.560
does not have a place
for sacred water

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.470
or even water as water quality.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:50.950
It doesn't have a place
for healthy ecosystems.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:54.670
And indeed, we are people
who believe and know

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:58.190
that these are natural rights.

00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:59.390
These are birth rights.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:02.960
These aren't rights that
descend from synthetic bodies

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:09.010
of man-made law, and
underline and score the man,

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:12.620
the patriarchy made law there.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:18.040
So we are really
on this front line,

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.150
and we were able to see
it at Standing Rock.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:24.770
We were able to see this
group called TigerSwan, which

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:29.790
called me and my
children jihadists,

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:35.940
because we were engaging prayer
and connections in spirit

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:41.220
to the land itself, and that
it was able to motivate people.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:44.760
It was able to activate
part of their consciousness.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:50.110
This same thing happened
during the ghost dance era.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:55.390
I've said that we are the
ghost dancers of our time,

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:58.930
but what has happened at
Standing Rock and what

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:03.520
continues to happen,
their foretelling of what

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:09.610
kind of human rights,
natural rights, civil rights,

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:13.360
constitutional rights,
what sort of rights

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.460
private military corporations
are willing to violate

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.130
in our own country.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.670
That's what's
extremely significant

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.790
and why we are asking people
to turn their attention back

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:31.120
to the water protectors,
especially those of us who

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.630
are being criminalized, those of
us who are facing prison time.

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:39.580
It's very important,
because you have

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.430
to think about there's
lawyers in the room here.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:46.660
And I'm a lawyer, and
when law enforcement

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:52.850
is able to say that they are
simply upholding law and order,

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:56.990
most people stop their
inquiry at that statement,

00:30:56.990 --> 00:31:02.450
because law and order carries
a weight of legitimacy to it.

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:06.040
But at Standing Rock, we
were really trying to pierce,

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.420
and sometimes in law,
we talk about piercing

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.260
the corporate veil.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:14.510
We were trying to pierce
this corporeal veil and ask,

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:19.460
who is defining and designing
the contours of law and order?

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:24.020
Who says that it's illegal for
somebody to stand and pray,

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.080
sometimes in a
public right of way?

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:33.930
Who says that it
is legal to force

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:37.080
one population at
gunpoint to bear

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.920
a risk, cancerous, poisonous
risks to their children's

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.060
water, while another
population is not

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.580
made to bear those risks?

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.550
That's exactly what happened.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:52.620
Who says that's law and order?

00:31:52.620 --> 00:32:00.490
And even Pope Francis,
the wokest pope ever,

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:02.950
would agree, because
in his encyclical,

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:06.460
he's saying things
like, it should

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.060
be a sin to poison a river.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:17.100
Maybe corporations
should be held liable,

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.060
and that's a very
powerful concept.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:25.640
That's going to take us down the
road of corporate personhood.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:30.330
And when we're talking about
piercing the corporate veil,

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:37.670
we, here in this room,
the leaders of our future,

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:44.570
the leaders of our digital
and spiritual evolution,

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:48.320
we have to take
responsibility and ownership

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.590
of what we are doing.

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:53.420
And Google is doing that.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.980
Energy Transfer Partners and
TigerSwan are not doing that.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:03.700
I say this all the time that
capital without compassion

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.920
is uncivilized.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.340
It truly is.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.040
And if we take a look
at Standing Rock,

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.410
we have to be
willing to sacrifice.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:19.000
We have to be willing to
step out of our comfort zones

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:26.770
and to really redefine what
progress is, what civilization

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:37.660
is, and what law and order
is, because we know that law

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:42.790
and order should serve people.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.770
Law and order should
serve Mother Earth.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:48.760
It should serve our
children's rights

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:53.660
to clean water and
healthy ecosystems.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.480
Currently, it doesn't.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.140
This is why there is a
pipeline at Standing Rock

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:06.620
right now, despite our
most valiant efforts.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.270
And the scope of
Standing Rock is immense.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:17.570
Just in this room right
here, probably 30%

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:23.520
of this room or better went
to Standing Rock personally.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:35.130
Not only that, but
on the internet

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:36.836
that Al Gore invented--

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.929
this is the only place where
people would get that--

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:54.429
tens of thousands of people gave
of their time, their energy,

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:58.050
their precious
time here on Earth,

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:01.200
and came out there in person.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.610
Truly amazing.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:05.610
It was just-- it was a
spiritual awakening out there.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:11.310
The water was calling, and
it's still calling to us.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:15.950
But online, millions
of people, hundreds

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:19.320
of millions of
people in our country

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:23.280
alone were able
to pay attention.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.270
They were able to
be there in spirit.

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:31.620
They contributed, they donated,
they ran food, blankets, water,

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:35.040
supplies, humanitarian
aid of all kinds

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:38.390
out to those at Standing Rock.

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:39.290
And I don't know--

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:41.750
I would dare to
say that billions

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:46.850
of people around the globe
were able to pay attention.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:50.940
They were able to be there
in spirit, because this

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:58.726
is the first time that
we were able to transcend

00:35:58.726 --> 00:35:59.475
those differences.

00:35:59.475 --> 00:36:01.850
There's sometimes those
phenotypic differences

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:05.630
of race, color, creed,
religion, all that stuff.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:16.580
And to be able to stand
up in truly a selfless act

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:21.670
of compassion, we are
willing to stand up and place

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:25.330
our bodies in
harm's way on behalf

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:30.000
of and in defense of water.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.190
That is powerful.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:37.060
That is unprecedented
that we were able to--

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.960
and I was very much
raised in a family that

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:46.440
was fully cognizant of the
civil rights struggles,

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:51.730
was very cognizant of
the systemic nature,

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:53.530
unjust nature of
some of our systems

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:57.480
that resulted in the Black Lives
Matter movement and so forth.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:05.600
But this time around, because
indigenous people still

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:11.300
kept alive their sacred
connections to the universe,

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:15.980
and we are still gifted
with those songs,

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.040
with those prayers,
with those ceremonies,

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:23.750
with that divine
awareness, we were

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:29.710
able to collectively elevate
global consciousness.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:33.040
We were able to
change our reality.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:40.357
And right now, the
state of North Dakota,

00:37:40.357 --> 00:37:41.190
who are good people.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.850
I ran for Congress here.

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:51.210
Morton County is maintaining
charges, criminal charges

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:54.560
against peaceful and
prayerful water protectors.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.600
And by doing that, by
maintaining those charges,

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.190
they are trying to
preempt and usurp

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:08.290
and to take, to seize the
legal and moral authority

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:13.420
to call somebody a criminal.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.630
It's very important that
we get to that point.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:21.790
This is why it's so important
that people help us compel.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:26.480
Put moral, spiritual,
and other pressure,

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:32.820
positive pressure on them
to drop all of these charges

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.350
that they are
currently maintaining

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:39.600
against peaceful and
prayerful water protectors.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.150
And I don't know if we're going
to put that up on the screen.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:46.950
You can either text
"Lakota" to 64336,

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:50.070
or log on to lakotalaw.org.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:55.280
We are doing-- we are making
tremendous progress, however.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:02.300
I think we're beyond 30,000
signatures, more than 20,000

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.246
of those coming
the old school way.

00:39:05.246 --> 00:39:06.620
They're going door
to door, going

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.530
to gathering to
gathering, reaching people

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:11.490
where they're at.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:14.340
And we-- it's
really-- it's an honor

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.820
to be able to spin
this little bit of time

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:21.060
with you to let
you know who I am,

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:25.950
the cosmology, and the culture,
the worldview, the way of life

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:28.320
that I was born
into, but still being

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.950
able to connect with
anybody, regardless

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:34.140
of what those
classifications are,

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:38.660
because our spirits
are universal.

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:43.460
And we are all spiritually
inclined to seek

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:49.960
those connections and really
to return to the sacred.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:55.100
And my little girl,
one of my daughters,

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.890
she's eight years old--

00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:03.160
I was speaking with some Google
folks, who, I understand,

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:08.790
are creating a Lakota
language translate or app

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:12.760
or some other tool.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:18.090
And I was completely encouraged
to hear that, because

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:21.310
in language is kind of--

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:23.730
we say language
has its own spirit.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:27.030
And again, we have
another story about how

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.790
we got language, received it.

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:35.900
In there is contained the
archetypes, the foundations,

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:40.580
the ways that human beings learn
to even perceive themselves

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.310
in the universe, how
they learned to color

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:47.132
their universe, how they learned
to imagine, how they think.

00:40:47.132 --> 00:40:49.340
So for Google to be doing
that, which they've already

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.580
done for the
Cherokee language, I

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:55.160
was completely
blown away that this

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.240
could be-- this is going to
be possible for my daughter

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:03.500
and those of us who are
second language learners.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.249
I was raised learning
English as a first language,

00:41:06.249 --> 00:41:07.790
and then it wasn't
until later that I

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:10.190
began to try to learn Lakota.

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:13.250
And when the immersion school
came to the Standing Rock

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:17.540
Nation, to my reservation,
we lived an hour away.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:22.760
And my little girl was four
years old, so she rode a bus.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.970
We had to take her to this
bus at 6:30 every morning,

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:28.250
and she rode 60 miles one way.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:30.500
She had a little commute,
little four-year-old,

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.120
she commuted with
one of our elders,

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.510
who was a teacher at the
Lakota immersion school,

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.140
but who was an original
language-- he was

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.330
born with the Lakota language.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:47.690
And so the possibilities
are endless with how we can

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:53.860
unite spirit and technology.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.620
It's part of our evolution.

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:03.330
And it's kind of scary.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:07.040
It's very, very serious.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.230
Virtual reality is already here.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:15.000
I have not experienced
it yet, but we

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.590
are sitting in a place, where
we are going to determine

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:25.290
our cultural reality.

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:30.650
We are going to do that
as a human species now.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:32.860
And so for those of
you who are out there,

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:40.260
I wanted to impart a little bit
of this spirit of liberation,

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:44.700
because we can't
forget who we are.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.260
We can't forget
where we come from.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:49.550
Those things are so important.

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:54.890
It's so important for us
to ask those questions

00:42:54.890 --> 00:43:02.270
that philosophers, theologians,
seers, and probably just

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:05.530
homeless people on the
street, poor, righteous

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:08.670
teachers have been
asking themselves

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:14.340
and have been seeking the truth
since the dawn of humanity.

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:20.160
We are truly on the precipice
of a significant time.

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:25.200
And for us at Standing Rock,
for us in the Lakota Nation,

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:29.990
we are fully ready to
embrace any change.

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:31.510
That's all we've ever done.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:33.450
We've adapted.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:34.275
We've survived.

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:40.250
And for us to put it
on the line out there

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:46.670
at Standing Rock on behalf of
and in defense of sacred water

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.630
wasn't even a question.

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.970
I'm looking forward to getting
my charges disposed of,

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:58.710
so I can join the next fight,
and in the process, continuing

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:03.840
to go wherever I'm blessed
to go, wherever people

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:09.420
are listening, wherever people
are seeking those connections.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.910
We're ready to make
those connections.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:15.780
This is our homeland, and
it's your homeland, too.

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:17.825
This is more than
just your country.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:23.720
Another thing at the front line
and during the Standing Rock

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:29.680
battle was the concepts
of patriots and terrorists

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:33.030
and who is defining the
contours of those terms

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:40.390
like "patriot" and
"terrorists" and "immigrant."

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:42.080
it's very-- it's powerful.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.640
Language is powerful.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.570
And for us, the
patriot is the mother,

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:53.470
who sacrificed everything
to go protect sacred water,

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:59.340
so her children could
have clean drinking water.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.310
She is not the terrorist.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:06.690
The patriot isn't
the person that

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:12.430
is extracting a common
resource, such as fossil fuels,

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:15.460
putting at dangerous
risk and peril

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:19.060
another common
resource like water

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:22.960
for the benefit of
their private profit.

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.860
That's not the patriot.

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:28.550
That might be the terrorist.

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:34.290
That might be somebody that's
putting us at unnecessary risk.

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:39.570
Standing Rock continues
to be powerful,

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:43.380
and I really want to engage you.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:49.860
I know I came to Google to
speak and to share and to give

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:53.370
a talk, but I also
came to learn.

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:56.160
I came to meet people.

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.690
I came to make connections.

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:05.280
We don't have very long here on
Earth, so we have to stay busy.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.690
We have to be
grateful every day,

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:12.060
whether that's greeting
the sun, or you

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:18.900
might hear the birds sing in
a certain way on your walk,

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.740
or you might look at--

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:24.160
you might be blinded by the way
the sun glints off the water

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.040
and just catches you.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.140
You might see the sunset.

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:33.820
In those tiny moments, you might
be able to make a connection.

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:35.500
You're able to transcend.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.810
You're able to
make yourself one.

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:42.000
We have another concept
called [LAKOTA]..

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.720
It literally means, everything
that is, is my relative.

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.460
These are some of
the ways that we

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:53.020
have to begin to partner,
to share our truths,

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:58.620
share our experiences, and
create the kind of reality,

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:03.290
the kind of evolutionary
process that we

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:05.945
want for us and for our
children, our progeny.

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:15.500
We are-- we're facing
existential crises right now,

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.710
whether that's the
hurricanes in Houston,

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:23.180
climate change, the whole
Midwest from Montana west

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:24.620
is burning up right now.

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:32.330
Drought-- we just got
over a drought out here.

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:38.540
We've got a nuclear potential
that's very, very real.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:39.540
Even though-- for some--

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.550
I mean, for some reason,
we're able to deal

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:43.930
with that effectively.

00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:46.230
We're able to put it
somewhere, and just

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:50.030
continue on with our day.

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:52.160
But I mean just
right now, they're

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.220
about to try to declare human
beings illegal, human beings

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:58.910
that have a prior and
original birth right to seek

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:03.990
their destiny here, where
we are at right now.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:06.800
Some of the original
civilizers of this hemisphere,

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.750
when they try to declare an
entire religion taboo and say,

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:13.820
you can log longer
enter our country--

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:18.200
those are the times that the
front line is everywhere.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:24.970
I know maybe it's hyperbole
to say that we are in a place

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:27.790
right now, where the
battle for the heart

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:32.140
and soul of our
homeland, of our country

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:35.320
is every single
day, every moment,

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:38.470
you have to choose to show up.

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:41.500
Standing Rock is just
one of those moments.

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:44.720
Standing Rock
demands a sacrifice.

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.310
I've got to be willing to
go to jail, to stand up,

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:53.020
so other people can
see that water is life.

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.270
Water is important.

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:58.450
And I know that that
inspires other people,

00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:01.900
because I'm inspired
by those others, who

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:07.120
are led by love and compassion
and bravery and peace

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.850
and dignity.

00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:13.850
But I wanted to share at
least that much with you,

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:16.460
and thank you all for listening.

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:21.220
Thank you for connecting with
us afterwards and continuing

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:27.520
to stay engaged in the work that
we are doing and the direction

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:33.290
that we want to compel
not only our homeland,

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:37.850
but to compel humanity.

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:44.120
This is the scale and the
scope of our vision now.

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.860
We're all part of
this same vision,

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:49.680
so I do want to leave
some time for questions.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.406
Thank you.

00:49:50.406 --> 00:49:54.374
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:55.266 --> 00:49:57.140
SPEAKER: We have two
questions from the Dory.

00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:58.610
So, Chase, the
first question is,

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:01.910
when we see and hear changes in
the current administration that

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:06.170
hint at rollbacks at the EPA and
other environmental programs,

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:09.170
how does this affect tribal
protections or agreements

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:14.090
between tribal lands and the US
government, and to what degree?

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:19.820
CHASE IRON EYES: Yes, the
United States currently

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:23.000
holds native nations
or tribal nations

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.480
in a state of tutelage
and oppression,

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.700
kind of like a
guardian to a ward.

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:31.107
You don't learn these things
when you grow up on the res,

00:50:31.107 --> 00:50:33.440
and they don't necessarily
even teach you at law school.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.815
They just teach
you that Congress

00:50:34.815 --> 00:50:38.760
has this superior and
plenary authority over you

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.780
as an Indian person
or as a tribal nation.

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.390
So when they are rolling
back federal laws,

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:49.400
it has a direct and immediate
impact upon native nations,

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.960
and that's why
native nations are

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:57.740
willing to push back and say,
look, this law and order that

00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:01.280
is being imposed upon
us that is causing us

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:06.060
undue risk is not right.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:09.300
It holds no legal
or moral authority

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:10.740
and should be challenged.

00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:13.230
But the only way to
challenge that right now

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:17.490
is through peace,
prayer, and standing up.

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:21.010
But that's just one thing.

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:23.000
That's just one challenge.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.880
So what happens at
the federal level

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:28.039
has a direct and immediate
impact at the tribal level.

00:51:28.039 --> 00:51:29.830
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for being here.

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:32.140
I have a question
for you, and that

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:35.470
comes from my own experience
of being at the WTO

00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:38.200
ministerial proceedings
back in 1999.

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.810
CHASE IRON EYES: Yes.

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:42.250
AUDIENCE: And that
was that I was

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:45.080
talking to a group of
activists, actually.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.930
I used to be an
environmental activist, too.

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:49.570
And it struck me
how you can break up

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:52.630
a mob of people, who think
single-mindedly about something

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:55.360
just through conversation.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:59.380
And I'm wondering if you or
any of the Standing Rock people

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:02.530
have had a chance to speak
individually one on one

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:07.090
with members of the police
forces or TigerSwan.

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:09.030
And have you seen any
of their humanity?

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:14.910
I mean, how can we break
through to them individually?

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:17.820
CHASE IRON EYES: That's
a very good question.

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:24.300
What was poignant, significant
was this juxtaposition.

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.039
When I was on the
front line, and I

00:52:26.039 --> 00:52:28.330
was running for the United
States Congress at the time,

00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:31.340
so I always wore a mask.

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:34.820
And later, we did that
to protect ourselves

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:40.100
from these private military
contractors that were snatching

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:42.320
your identity with
facial recognition

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:47.390
and lots of other kind of
crazy frontier-like things.

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:50.162
But when I was at
some of these actions,

00:52:50.162 --> 00:52:51.620
on the other side
of the front line

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:54.970
would be these
military-ready police.

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:58.650
I mean, they looked like they
were ready to roll into Iraq.

00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:03.210
And I looked through
the glass shield,

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:06.570
and I would see friends.

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:09.060
I would see my friends that
I had played basketball

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:13.200
with at the local YMCA,
the Young Men's Christian

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.000
Association.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.790
Every other day
at noon, we would

00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:18.970
go there to play basketball.

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:22.440
And I would see my friends
on that side of the line,

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.190
and I'm on this
side of the line.

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:28.920
And in that little moment,
we were both playing our part

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.580
in this drama.

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:34.940
But because I had run for
Congress in North Dakota,

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:37.670
I knew a whole lot of people.

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:41.480
And that was one of the
most important strategies

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:45.080
was to begin to try
to humanize everybody

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:48.065
on either side of this.

00:53:48.065 --> 00:53:53.280
struggle, because there is
a certain amount of cover

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.800
that people can claim when
they're saying they're

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.860
just following orders,
or they're just

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.830
upholding law and order.

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:04.430
So it was very important to--

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:09.180
for each side to
humanize each other.

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:14.400
And one way that I did that
was when I was in jail, the day

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.940
that I got arrested, the
correctional officers

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:21.060
had been there way too long.

00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:26.250
And what I did was I helped
kind of defuse tense situations

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:29.580
so that we weren't putting undue
burden on those people, who

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:33.520
were just doing their job.

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:40.820
And so we-- it's a struggle.

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:42.925
And that's the war
of the narrative

00:54:42.925 --> 00:54:44.050
out there on Standing Rock.

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:47.010
Very quickly, I'll
mention that TigerSwan

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:52.310
had begun to issue these media
strategies and these missives,

00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:54.740
these documents that
would say things like--

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:58.490
that would make it into local
mainstream news outlets,

00:54:58.490 --> 00:55:01.910
saying things like,
local ranchers--

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:06.860
cue the Germans and the
Americans or whatever--

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:11.120
local ranchers in
fear of their lives,

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:15.560
because protesters
are killing livestock.

00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:19.650
Like they try to hearken
back these old prejudices

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:23.370
on both sides, and
make it seem like it

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:26.220
was the 1800s out there again.

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:29.440
That's when I very first
started to say, look,

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:33.630
we need to cut through all this
Indian people and white people

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:38.280
dynamic that is being exploited
out here in North Dakota.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.510
And we have to start uniting.

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:42.480
We have to start finding
a way to cut through that

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.140
and to unite each other.

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:47.490
Otherwise, this is going
to be a card well played

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:51.000
by these operatives,
and that's kind

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.890
of where we're at right now.

00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:56.340
In our country, we saw
that whatever they're

00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.950
willing to do to
us, they're going

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:01.290
to be willing to do to
anybody who stands up

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:05.480
against a company that
wants to poison their water,

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:11.430
or put a nuclear frack waste
dump site wherever you might

00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:15.600
live, or destroy some other
aspect of our ecosystem

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:18.150
that doesn't have any legal
protections right now.

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:27.440
We are all going to be called
to stand up at some point.

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.320
So it's really, really
important that we

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:33.070
do that, that we come together,
that we humanize each other,

00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:35.950
and that's part of my
message is that we do.

00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:39.610
We have to liberate from
those differences, perceived

00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:42.490
differences, and
yeah, differences

00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:46.730
that we are born into as well.

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:47.654
Thank you.

00:56:47.654 --> 00:56:49.820
AUDIENCE: If you don't mind,
I've got just a couple.

00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:51.240
CHASE IRON EYES:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.320
AUDIENCE: First, thank
you for being here.

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.680
We appreciate it immensely.

00:56:55.680 --> 00:57:00.630
And just the first is
actually just a small example,

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:04.410
but I know that they steepened
the penalties for protest

00:57:04.410 --> 00:57:05.220
in North Dakota.

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.790
They were successful in that.

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:09.810
Do I also understand
that they almost

00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:14.880
passed a law that made it
legal to run over protesters

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.699
that were in public roadways?

00:57:16.699 --> 00:57:18.240
CHASE IRON EYES:
Yes, that's a very--

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:24.570
so that's why the
energy that we have,

00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:26.700
that progressive
people might have,

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:28.750
or those who are on this
trajectory of social

00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:32.850
and political evolution
and spiritual evolution--

00:57:32.850 --> 00:57:35.190
it's important for us to be
active on all these fronts,

00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:38.250
because legislators
create this policy.

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:44.370
And during the No DAPL struggle,
legislators created a policy.

00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:49.520
They introduced a law that
would waive tort liability

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:54.200
for motorists who happened to
run through and potentially

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:58.610
kill a protester in a
larger group of protesters,

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:02.440
like exactly what happened
at Charlottesville.

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.590
But that law was never passed.

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:07.240
They did pass other
laws that it's

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:14.450
illegal to conceal your identity
in furtherance of a protest,

00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:20.510
that any kind of property
damage to commercial activity

00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:24.820
would be a felony,
and they even tried

00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:28.890
to eliminate tribal gaming.

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:33.720
So when we say the
battle for the heart

00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:36.570
and soul of our
country is every day,

00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:40.620
we are being tested
right now as a country.

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:45.660
And that's why it's so important
for us to come together.

00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:47.760
I've been preaching that
everywhere that I go.

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.640
Even when I was running for
the United States Congress,

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:53.610
it was most important,
because that's when--

00:58:53.610 --> 00:58:57.210
and we obviously survived Trump.

00:58:57.210 --> 00:59:00.300
A lot of us thought
the sky was falling.

00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:02.785
But we know now that
we'll survive whatever.

00:59:02.785 --> 00:59:03.660
You know what I mean?

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:06.960
That's why we have a
representative democracy,

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:10.380
a republican form of
government, checks and balances,

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:14.240
and judicial supremacy,
and so forth.

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.850
We will survive as a
people, but we really

00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:22.310
need to concentrate our
efforts on all these aspects

00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:27.650
of what I call the front
line, because they have

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:31.270
very real impacts on our lives.

00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:33.040
I'm glad that law didn't pass.

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.850
There's another law on the
books up there in North Dakota

00:59:35.850 --> 00:59:38.020
that it is illegal for
more than, I think,

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:42.070
three Indians to
congregate so that you

00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:44.600
can consider them a war party.

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:48.200
And so this is me
in my sweater vest

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:50.450
and bow tie friends
at the coffee shop.

00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:52.149
You know what I mean?

00:59:52.149 --> 00:59:53.690
AUDIENCE: Second
question-- actually,

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:56.930
if I recall correctly,
and I'm hoping I'm wrong,

00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:59.510
and please fact check me, but
the vehicular manslaughter

00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:03.410
waiver law I think missed
by only five votes.

01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:05.090
Second question is,
have you considered

01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:07.430
skipping Congress altogether
and going straight

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:08.705
for the presidency?

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.100
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:10.963
I mean--

01:00:10.963 --> 01:00:13.330
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:18.560
CHASE IRON EYES: You know,
I have considered that.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.620
But I also-- anywhere
that I go, anywhere

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.670
that I'm blessed to be,
I can feel this energy.

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:31.830
I can feel that we are
all on the same path here.

01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:34.100
Running for the United States
Congress in North Dakota

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.920
was an eye-opener.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:42.630
I was made acutely aware of
how money and other interests

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:45.210
have kind of hijacked
our democracy.

01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:50.640
We don't have leaders anymore,
who are guided by conscience

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.300
or are seeking a
higher consciousness.

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:57.600
We have politicians that
are forced to raise money.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.930
I spent all of my time
dialing for dollars.

01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:05.520
So I know that we
are going to produce

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:11.550
the right kind of conviction
and values and truth seekers,

01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:16.190
and those who really are
trying to create a better

01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:19.280
planet, those who are guided
by compassion and love

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.490
and bravery, I really believe
that we are going to produce

01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:24.690
those kind of leaders.

01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:27.270
We're in a tough spot right now.

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.970
It's very hard.

01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:31.230
It's so easy to despair
and just kind of try

01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:35.040
to step away from it
and quit showing up.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:38.130
But we cannot do that.

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:39.990
Like for instance,
I'm flying out to DC

01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:44.430
to speak to a progressive
gathering about what

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:48.330
we are going to do about
this political system.

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:51.420
It's not serving
the people anymore.

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:54.030
And it's not serving
Mother Earth,

01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:56.790
and we don't have to get
tripped up in the labels.

01:01:56.790 --> 01:01:59.880
We just have to be truthful
about what kind of world

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.410
we want to create.

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:03.360
And I think we're on this path.

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:06.060
I believe that
anything good that I'm

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:10.080
able to impart that
comes from the substance

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:13.320
that I'm evolving into
that I was raised in,

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.720
that we are going
to be able to see

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.710
leadership that reflects any
good that I'm able to impart.

01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:22.210
I truly believe that.

01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:25.680
AUDIENCE: How do you
get past the anger?

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.700
CHASE IRON EYES: Yeah.

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:31.306
You mean from the entire
colonization experience

01:02:31.306 --> 01:02:32.180
or from the pipeline?

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:34.334
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:35.750
AUDIENCE: I'm sure,
like I do, you

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:38.965
have generations of
anger embedded in you.

01:02:38.965 --> 01:02:39.840
CHASE IRON EYES: Yes.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.140
AUDIENCE: How?

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:43.140
CHASE IRON EYES: So that's
a very good question.

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:47.210
And I think we are
a social experiment.

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:53.460
Our country is the greatest
experiment on the planet.

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.170
I believe in our country.

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:57.180
I believe in our homeland.

01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:00.720
I believe that we are
the true patriots--

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.670
anybody who is
willing to stand up

01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:06.820
for sacred water in
the lands and so forth.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:18.500
And it is true that native
people, the original civilizers

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.110
of this continent,
were subjected

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:23.540
to a different kind
of colonization,

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:28.150
the same kind that was
executed everywhere else.

01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:32.880
But that expropriation--
it does cause anger.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.020
And I think that's just a stage.

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:39.350
Maybe in pedagogy of the
oppressed or somewhere,

01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:42.896
you can learn more about the
stages of grief and coming

01:03:42.896 --> 01:03:43.395
to terms.

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.410
And I went through that.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.780
I'm not trying to
downplay that whatsoever.

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:56.170
I went through that very, very
heavily in my adolescent years

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:58.060
into my early adulthood
years, and I just

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.014
had to go on a journey
of self-discovery.

01:04:00.014 --> 01:04:01.430
I don't think
there's avoiding it.

01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:04.000
There's just dealing with
it, and you heal from it.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.370
You let the scars
or the wounds scar.

01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:12.700
And then, you're able
to evolve from that.

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:17.510
You go from anger to a place
of compassion and bravery,

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:20.549
and so it's very real.

01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:21.840
There's no way to deal with it.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.626
You just have to
let the tissue scar.

01:04:29.338 --> 01:04:31.718
AUDIENCE: Just one
quick question.

01:04:31.718 --> 01:04:33.740
What are the more
pressing issues

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:36.702
maybe for you
personally, and then

01:04:36.702 --> 01:04:37.992
more for the tribe as a whole?

01:04:37.992 --> 01:04:40.840
Like, obviously,
the criminal thing,

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:44.488
and then [INAUDIBLE] tribes
may be working [INAUDIBLE]??

01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:51.440
CHASE IRON EYES: Yes, the most
immediate and pressing issue

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.380
is for me to stay out of
prison, for me personally.

01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:57.530
I have three kids.

01:04:57.530 --> 01:05:00.490
I have a wife that
is a rock star.

01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:03.280
She runs the entire clinic
on the Standing Rock Nation.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:07.620
She's a Stanford grad, so
she's very partial and familiar

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.300
to the area here.

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:13.000
So I need to stay out of the
law's hands in that fashion.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.690
That's why we're out here trying
to raise as much awareness

01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:17.460
as we can.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:24.420
But for the tribal
nation, we just

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:28.530
need to renegotiate the
treaty relationship that we

01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:31.140
have with the United States.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:33.390
We are a tripartite citizens.

01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:38.220
We are descended from the
original and intrinsic

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:41.340
sovereign authorities
to determine our destiny

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.170
in our hemisphere.

01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:47.610
But we also have treaties
with the United States.

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:50.820
And now, there's also
the States of the Union,

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:57.720
so I mention those things,
because I want to--

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:01.320
we shouldn't be living in
the level of imposed poverty

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.570
that we are living in
on the reservation.

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:10.270
We have tremendous
gifts, knowledges,

01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:13.620
and worldviews to share.

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:18.830
We belong as dignified,
upstanding members

01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:21.700
of the world of nations.

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:25.930
And so it's part
of my life's work,

01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:29.650
part of the work that I was born
into, that my mother taught me

01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:33.590
about growing up on
the res by herself,

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:40.510
the single poor working mom, put
me on that path to seek that,

01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:44.050
but also to seek it
in a different way.

01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:50.940
Seek it in this-- we talk a
lot about peace and dignity.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.070
And we do it--

01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:53.990
and prayer.

01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:57.210
And we talk about it like
that, because seeking

01:06:57.210 --> 01:07:02.250
that prayer, that peace,
and that dignity to know

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:08.300
the power of peace
results in your avail,

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:15.680
your spiritually and morally
authorized, then, to stand up.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.700
And when I say not to back
down from any injustice,

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:30.100
I mean any action that threatens
peace, righteous peace.

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:34.120
So on the reservation,
this is part

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.960
of why I'm coming to
Google, because there

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.150
are many things that
we can do to change

01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:48.220
the realities of reservation
life, which is a struggle,

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:54.580
and institute a cultural
and moral dignity,

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:59.360
rather than a cultural
and moral poverty.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.030
Those are some of the--

01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:03.760
and it starts small
in whatever I can do.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.250
Whatever skills I have
as a lawyer, that's

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:08.600
part of my personal journey,
not just at Standing Rock,

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:16.149
but for Indian country
and for the United States.

01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:19.750
We can do it all, and
we are capable of it.

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:23.319
And we're just looking to take
our place wherever we can.

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:27.040
So I know it's a tall order.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:32.899
That's a long journey
to end poverty,

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:35.457
but we have to believe in it.

01:08:35.457 --> 01:08:37.040
It's kind of like
running for Congress

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.359
in a very, very red state as
a progressive brown Native

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:43.090
American guy.

01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:48.210
You have to convince yourself
that it's possible, that you

01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:52.160
can do it, that it's for real.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:56.680
And you have to show
up every single day.

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.380
But I believe that
it's possible.

01:08:58.380 --> 01:08:59.640
I believe it's real.

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.890
I believe we're going to do it.

01:09:01.890 --> 01:09:07.060
AUDIENCE: Chase, there are
people all over watching this

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.460
and listening to
you, who probably

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.770
want to know how they can help.

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:20.020
And if they go to lakotalaw.org,
we have an ongoing project,

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:24.100
which you are leading and
which others are leading.

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:29.380
And I just want to comment
that there are seven cities now

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:31.689
that have voted to
pull their money,

01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:35.109
divest their money from
the big banks, which

01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:39.580
include Wells Fargo, Bank of
America, Citicorp, US Bank.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:44.770
All of them are funding the
pipelines and funding DAPL.

01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:49.510
So there are cities
voting to divest

01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:51.670
and trying to figure
out how to set up

01:09:51.670 --> 01:09:56.380
public banks as alternatives
to these big banks

01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:58.480
or going into credit
unions, et cetera.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:02.260
And that information about
that program is on the site,

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.580
if people want to do that.

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.250
We've just voted
that in Santa Cruz.

01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:11.220
But also, the pressure
that we're putting on,

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:13.930
the thousands of people who
are sending this petition

01:10:13.930 --> 01:10:18.080
letter to North Dakota to get
them to drop all these charges

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:22.770
is really important, because the
water protectors are innocent.

01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:25.540
The guiltiness in
terms of violence

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:28.630
is on the side of
the energy transfers

01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:30.490
company and TigerSwan.

01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:33.820
This is really wrong
that they continue

01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:37.390
to prosecute innocent,
peaceful water protectors.

01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:39.550
And they need to dismiss
all these charges

01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:40.834
against everybody.

01:10:40.834 --> 01:10:42.250
I mean, there are
trials scheduled

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:44.230
right now for next May.

01:10:44.230 --> 01:10:51.010
This is an ongoing, ridiculous
legal aggressiveness

01:10:51.010 --> 01:10:52.880
against innocent people.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:56.110
So everybody should send
that letter to North Dakota.

01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:59.410
And can you tell us,
again, what the number

01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:00.700
is, if you want to go--

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:02.230
if you want to do
it on your phone,

01:11:02.230 --> 01:11:03.980
you do what you're
saying the number is.

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:07.410
Or you can go to lakotalaw.org,
and send the letter right away.

01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:09.102
It goes right to North Dakota.

01:11:09.102 --> 01:11:10.810
CHASE IRON EYES: Yes,
thank you for that.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:14.950
It is important.

01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:17.360
We have to take a stand.

01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:25.460
And how you help right now, the
water protector situation that

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:30.140
we find ourselves in, where we
are being criminalized right

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:38.990
now, what you do is you text
"Lakota," L-A-K-O-T-A to 64336,

01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:43.740
or just log onto our
website, lakotalaw.org.

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:48.474
And there's another
website, mazaskatalks.org.

01:11:48.474 --> 01:11:50.890
That might be confusing, because
it's another Lakota word,

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:54.110
M-A-Z-A-S-K-A, Talks.

01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:56.600
It means money talks.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:01.120
There is never a
time where you can't

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:06.370
contribute to the kind of
world that you want to create.

01:12:06.370 --> 01:12:11.927
Every dollar you spend is a
vote for what kind of world

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:12.760
you want to live in.

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:16.330
So if we want to
justly transition

01:12:16.330 --> 01:12:22.360
from extractive industry
coupled with big finance

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:27.750
and endless wars and so
forth into something that's

01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:32.820
more renewable and regenerative
and kind of evolved,

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:33.720
we can do that.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.970
It's up to us.

01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:39.150
It's on us to compel our
leadership, our policymakers,

01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:42.290
and so forth to take us there.

01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:46.040
And one way you can do
that is to move your money.

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:51.260
You have tremendous
power and ability

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:55.904
to impact our path,
our trajectory.

01:12:55.904 --> 01:12:58.070
So those are the ways that
you can continue to help.

01:12:58.070 --> 01:13:00.570
And just link with us.

01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:03.730
When you send us that
text, if you want,

01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:06.040
you can give us your number.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:08.530
And we won't blow up your texts.

01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:10.030
We're only going
to text you when

01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:12.790
we have something extremely
important that we think

01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:15.680
is worth your time.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.490
And each of you have networks
in here, hundreds and thousands

01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:24.360
of people that have
very real voting power,

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.390
economic power, and so forth.

01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:31.990
Like, we should be
determining our destiny.

01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:33.220
Yes.

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:36.060
AUDIENCE: I know you're having
an event in Sunnyvale tomorrow.

01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:38.860
Will you tell people how
they can come and meet

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.170
you and participate?

01:13:41.170 --> 01:13:42.880
CHASE IRON EYES: That's right.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:49.640
So tomorrow, which is
Wednesday, September 6th,

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:56.820
it looks like it starts at 7:30
PM local time, Pacific time.

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:57.614
No, tomorrow--

01:13:57.614 --> 01:13:58.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:00.790
CHASE IRON EYES: Yeah,
tomorrow's Wednesday.

01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:03.150
September 6th, and it's
at the Congregational

01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:05.610
Church of Sunnyvale.

01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:08.130
You can log onto our
website to get an address,

01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:15.960
but 1112 South Bernardo
Avenue, Sunnyvale.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:21.820
Myself and my counsel,
Daniel Sheehan,

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:28.060
will be there to give you
more in-depth legal updates

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:31.240
and kind of just contextualize
the entire history

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.460
of this struggle.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.750
Like this struggle is not new.

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:39.640
We've been fighting for our
humanity and our birth rights

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.130
and our spirits, not
just as native people.

01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:44.470
I'm talking about human beings.

01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:48.880
We have been fighting for
our rights for a long time.

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:52.120
And just now, because
of Standing Rock,

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:56.500
we were able to share
that, to share that vision.

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:57.700
And it's real.

01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:00.650
It's very, very real.

01:15:00.650 --> 01:15:03.100
And I know that
we are seeking it,

01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:06.540
and we'll continue
to seek it together.

01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:08.190
AUDIENCE: Just a
quick question, Chase.

01:15:08.190 --> 01:15:11.700
In closing, could
you give the people

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:16.110
that are listening
the larger context

01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:20.400
in which this is occurring
with regard to the elephant

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:24.180
in the middle of the living room
of Donald Trump now ascending

01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:29.130
to the presidency, and 180
countries around the world

01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:32.430
having joined together
in Paris to cut back

01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:36.030
on the use of fossil
fuels and the resolution

01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:40.050
that this particular
administration has

01:15:40.050 --> 01:15:45.240
come to to push forward with
the production of petroleum?

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.620
And touch upon the
entrance into this dynamic

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:52.410
of calling home
troops, basically,

01:15:52.410 --> 01:15:56.550
from the Middle East in
the form of TigerSwan,

01:15:56.550 --> 01:16:01.230
and bringing them in as
the military protection

01:16:01.230 --> 01:16:04.920
of this administration
that is pushing forward

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:09.574
with the increasing of the
production of petroleum.

01:16:09.574 --> 01:16:11.240
CHASE IRON EYES: Those
are great points.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:18.650
I think we have to, again,
mention fear and hate

01:16:18.650 --> 01:16:24.560
and division, and wherever those
concepts are being perpetrated

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:29.750
on us, wherever we are told
that this is your enemy, that we

01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:37.410
need to be very, very careful,
because since the advent

01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:41.880
of currency, since the
creation of the concept

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:50.100
of nation-states, since the
advent of other concepts

01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:57.230
like private property and
so forth, we have those, who

01:16:57.230 --> 01:17:02.950
are able to, for instance, lend
money to both sides of a war.

01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:07.060
Those have kind of
been the determiners

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:09.730
of what our policy
looks like and who

01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:13.450
we are supposed to call an
enemy, who we are supposed

01:17:13.450 --> 01:17:17.740
to vilify, who we should
be willing to send

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:23.200
our sons and our
daughters to die for.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.420
And what we are
witnessing right now,

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:27.730
what we will witness
in our country,

01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:34.800
in America, where there is and
where there was a low level oil

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:39.940
war in the heartland
of our country,

01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:43.880
where a private
military corporation was

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.480
able to bring to bear
the force of the arms

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:53.540
and institutions of the state,
a state of the union, who enjoys

01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:57.870
the air of objectivity
and legitimacy,

01:17:57.870 --> 01:18:03.860
they were able to instigate
them to create a boogieman.

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:07.230
They were able to call
us jihadists out there.

01:18:07.230 --> 01:18:14.010
And they were able to create
this battle, this low level oil

01:18:14.010 --> 01:18:16.930
war, and they called
it a battlefield.

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:23.940
They were able to make a lot
of money off of the taxpayers'

01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:27.420
dime in North Dakota.

01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:31.710
And what we are seeing is that
our constitutional rights,

01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:36.770
our rights to speak freely,
our rights to peaceably

01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:40.500
assemble, our rights
to avail ourselves

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.600
of interstate
commerce, our rights

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:48.120
to privacy, our rights to be
free from illegal searches

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:52.620
and seizures, our rights
to tell the truth,

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:55.500
our rights to be
whistleblowers--

01:18:55.500 --> 01:19:03.760
those are all at risk if
the current modus operandi

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:09.010
of this encroachment
upon our natural birth

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:11.650
and constitutional
and other rights

01:19:11.650 --> 01:19:16.930
continues in the name
of unchecked greed.

01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:21.370
This is why I say,
capital without compassion

01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:24.240
is uncivilized.

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:27.050
We have to-- this is
another play on the dynamics

01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:28.890
they try to force.

01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:30.610
Oh, if you're
against corporations,

01:19:30.610 --> 01:19:32.280
you're anti-capitalists.

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:33.600
Well, no.

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:37.200
We're 100% pro-entrepreneur.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.440
But capital without
compassion is savage.

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:46.080
We have to change our ethos,
because for us, it's very real.

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.940
This is a real thing.

01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:49.500
This is not--

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:52.950
I could go to prison here.

01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:54.520
And we can't let that happen.

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:59.432
We can't let a single water
protector serve a day in jail,

01:19:59.432 --> 01:20:01.140
because right now,
they're coming for us.

01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:05.090
But soon, they're going to
be coming for everybody.

01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:07.730
We just have to be
truthful and be ready.

01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:10.600
We don't have to engage
propaganda or hyperbole.

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:14.200
Let's just get the facts
out there, and make

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.090
our own informed
decisions, kind of

01:20:16.090 --> 01:20:18.580
be our own leaders, so to speak.

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:19.480
Thank you.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:23.430
[APPLAUSE]
