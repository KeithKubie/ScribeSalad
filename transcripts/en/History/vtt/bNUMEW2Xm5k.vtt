00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:02.877
MAN: Oh, my god.

00:00:02.877 --> 00:00:04.546
WOMAN: It seems to
be like illuminating.

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:07.424
MAN: It's actually morphing
shape and rotating as well.

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:10.593
This is phenomenal.

00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:14.264
Australia is certainly a
hotspot for UFO sightings.

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:18.560
We've had a phenomenal growth in
the reporting of UFO sightings

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.062
by the general public,
especially since the advent

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:24.315
of the internet.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.943
But all evidence
shows that UFOs have

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:29.571
definitely been visiting
Australia for tens of thousands

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:30.905
of years.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:34.325
We've had records
engraved on cave artwork

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.618
by the Australian
Aborigines, which

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:36.911
goes back thousands of years.

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:45.086
Australia is one of the
most mysterious continents.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:49.841
And the Aboriginals have
all kinds of ancient stories

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:53.470
of sky gods coming down.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.472
These are probably
some of the oldest

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.850
stories of extraterrestrial
intervention

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.893
that we have on planet Earth.

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:05.231
Australia was something
of a last frontier

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:09.068
long after America was settled.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:14.199
Well, it was 1770 that the
British explorer Captain Cook

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:17.118
actually came across Australia.

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:20.580
And it wasn't until 1788
that it was really settled.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.750
That was the east coast of
Australia settled by convicts.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.169
That's what the British
brought from their prisons.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:34.135
NARRATOR: Today, the area of
Sydney that the British first

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:39.808
settled is a bustling
metropolis and Australia

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:43.311
has become one of the most
popular tourist destinations

00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:46.189
on Earth.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.526
But hidden behind
this modern facade

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.779
is nearly 2.5
million square miles

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.490
of undeveloped and
sparsely populated

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.575
land, known as the Outback.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:03.164
And while Australia is
a relatively new land

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:07.877
to the Western world, for the
nearly 700,000 people that

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:11.005
call the continent
their ancestral home,

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:15.093
it has a history that dates
back tens of thousands of years.

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:21.891
There's something very,
very special about Australia.

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:25.061
Here, we have a situation where
this huge landmass has been

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:26.229
pretty much cut
off from the rest

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.982
of the world for 40,000 years.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:33.778
And we don't really find that in
many other places in the world.

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:36.573
NARRATOR: But what was happening
on this island continent

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:38.783
for the tens of
thousands of years

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:42.745
that it existed in isolation?

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:45.790
When the first
Europeans arrived here,

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.836
they didn't have much knowledge
in regards to the sky world,

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:53.798
where our people had
much ancient knowledge

00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:57.468
of the star system and the
constellation of the stars.

00:02:57.468 --> 00:03:00.430
Our knowledge and
wisdom is so old.

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:07.645
NARRATOR: Anthropologists
have dated the existence

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:12.483
of the Australian Aboriginal
people back 60,000 years,

00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:15.361
making it the most
ancient continuous culture

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.405
in the world.

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:19.490
The Aboriginal
peoples of Australia

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.952
are one of the world's
very, very oldest cultures.

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:25.163
No other cultures in
the world can compare

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:27.040
with the Australian cultures.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.250
They have knowledge that's
been around for a lot longer

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.210
than really any of our
knowledge has been around.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.884
NARRATOR: The
aboriginal people have

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:40.595
no official written language.

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:43.556
Art, music, and
oral storytelling

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:46.476
are how they pass their
histories and sacred knowledge

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:49.145
to future generations.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:52.523
Their past is encoded
on various rock walls

00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:54.192
scattered across the continent.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:00.615
Our oral traditions or
stories that are passed down

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:04.327
from generation to
generation, the wisdom

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:08.957
and knowledge that have been
given to us by our god--

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:13.962
they're 10,000 or more years
older than the Stonehenge

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.213
in England.

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:17.465
They're 20,000 or
30,000 years older

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:18.967
than the pyramids of Egypt.

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:25.556
NARRATOR: These ancient
traditions are all strongly

00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:28.977
tied to Australia's
connection with the stars

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.770
and with the beings
that are said

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.938
to have come down from them.

00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:37.860
As evidence, ancient
astronaut theorists

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.572
point to the caves of the
northwest Kimberley region

00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:45.702
that contain depictions of
visitors called the Wandjina--

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:50.289
the sky heroes of one of
Australia's indigenous clans.
