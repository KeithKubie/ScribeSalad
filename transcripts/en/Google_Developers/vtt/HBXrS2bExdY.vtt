SOWMYA SUBRAMANIAN: All right.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.020
So everyone ready for
our afternoon session?

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.021
[AUDIENCE CHEERS WEAKLY]

00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:14.728
SOWMYA SUBRAMANIAN:
It's not loud enough.

00:00:14.728 --> 00:00:15.925
I know there's more energy.

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:16.460
[AUDIENCE CHEERS LOUDER]

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.250
SOWMYA SUBRAMANIAN: Good.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.780
OK.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.860
Before we get started, I seem
to be always pointing out

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.560
where the restrooms are,
but that's my job as the MC.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.080
The restrooms are out the door
and down the hall, that way.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.970
And I think there
are signs there.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.950
And there will be
Google volunteers

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.570
who can help escort
you if you need help.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.310
And we will be taking a
break between each session,

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.640
each speaker, in this afternoon.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.790
So if you do want to switch
to the other track, that

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.310
would be the time to do it.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.650
And the other one is also
happening down the hall.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.310
And one of the
Google volunteers can

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.770
help you get to that other room.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.220
So our first speaker is
the Head of Localization

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.380
and International
Product at Jawbone.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.830
Her focus areas are
product marketing,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.930
business development, user
experience, technical account

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.130
management, and ad operations.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.210
Laura was named one of the 40
Most Powerful Women in 2013

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.170
by "Forbes Mexico."

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.170
And was also recognized
by the Department

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.290
of State and Secretary
of State Hillary

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.290
Clinton for her involvement in
the Tech Woman Program, where

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.490
she was only female leader from
Twitter to participate in 2012.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.929

welcoming Laura.

Can you hear me?

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.850
Yes?

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.890
Great.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.590
I just want to take
a sort of a poll of--

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.250
and maybe you can
raise your hand.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.320
How many students
do we have in here?

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.660
Great.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.740
Hi, student.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.000
People who work in
the industry here?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.740
I'm guessing at Google?

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.310
Great.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.330
Google representing the front.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.449
Other tech companies?

Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.384
Who does not work in
sort of what I've called.

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:16.550
I think I was talking to a
woman here, a young lady,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.420
that she actually
works in health care.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.430
Are there other
industries-- there you

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.950
are-- that are not represented
or I have not said?

LAURA GOMEZ: NASA.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.790
Great.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.320
So I'm very honored to be here
on International Women's Day,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.740
speaking in front of all of you.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.730
Also, let's take a moment
to realize how honored

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.549
and how privileged we
are to actually be here.

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.840
On this day, there is many
women that don't have access

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.420
to either attending
these sessions

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.250
or around the world that
actually don't have access

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.430
to technology.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.119
So let's make sure that
we understand where we are

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:58.660
and how privileged
we are to actually

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.340
be in an area in Silicon
Valley, and where

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.440
we're meeting and being next
to all these amazing women

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.600
that I've met so far.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.940
I'm going to just speak on
behalf of just being a woman.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.460
Zora Neale Hurston, does
anyone know who this author is?

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.990
OK.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.920
I read a book in
high school that

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.400
said that the black woman
is the mule of the world.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.650
Saying that the white male
oppresses the black male,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.140
and the black male then
turns around and immediately

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.890
oppresses-- and this talks
about gender and race.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.300
And I'm not here to really
talk about gender and race.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.420
But as you know, my
presenter just said,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.180
really it's those unconscious
bias that we don't speak of.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.190
My accent, how I look
like, where I was born,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.530
what is my background.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.660
In Silicon Valley,
we tend to number

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.520
ourselves by what employee or
what team we're working on.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.690
And it's just really being
honest about our privileges

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.670
that we have being here.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.780
So I'm going to talk about
my resistance to technology

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.990
and being in the tech field.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.230
And how I ended up here,
and now how I feel about it.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.250
And I want to go over
who am I. Why am I

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.570
speaking in front of you,
besides my LinkedIn bio

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.097
or my Twitter
profile or something

00:04:19.097 --> 00:04:20.180
that you can Google on me.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.010
But who am I?

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.520
I'm really going to go
deep into giving you

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.170
sort of a look at Laura.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.160
Not just the brand or image
of me or the idea of me,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.830
but really who am I.
And searching for a job

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.670
after college for
all those students

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.640
and then finding a career.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.930
And also the loyalty
that men and women

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.550
have shown for me
throughout my whole career,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.080
throughout my whole life.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.080
And then of course,
the next steps and what

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.180
I want to do as far as taking
everything that I've learned.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.591
OK.

00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:54.590
Here is some background.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.710
Throughout my travels,
I've traveled a lot,

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.500
I was actually very lucky
and either fortunate or lucky

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.920
to be at the right time
at the right place.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.180
I was in Brazil at one
time, and I ended up

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.280
going to an after party with
a very famous soccer player

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.720
while traveling in Brazil.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.280
I would do something else and
then come home three days later

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.440
and my roommate was
like, where were you?

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.410
And I was like, well, then I
met this famous samba player.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.660
And then we went and partied
with these other people.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.950
And it just ended
up that she said,

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.950
you were born with your
butt to the moon, Laura.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.790
And I couldn't understand what
that saying was in Portuguese.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.550
I was learning, and I had to
ask people what that meant.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.290
And they said, that
you were born lucky.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.400
And I do think I was born lucky.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.490
But I also feel
like the moon has

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.300
come to me because I
have worked hard for it

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.940
and because I have sought the
right opportunities as well.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.170
So obviously when you see the
moon when you-- one day I'll

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.770
write a book and it'll be
called "Ass to the Moon"

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.190
because I think it'll be
titled exactly not just

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.769
because I'm lucky or fortunate.

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:02.310
But I was lucky,
and you'll see where

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.380
my luck came in, but with my
hard work and opportunities.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.520
That's me as a child,
three years old.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.790
You can follow me on Twitter.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.080
My user name is @Laura.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.030
I can go into detail why
I have that username,

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.150
but you can figure it out it.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.483
I was an early Twitter employee.

00:06:17.483 --> 00:06:20.120
So that's how I got it.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.300
That's my sister next to me.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.710
I was born in Leon,
Guanajuato, Mexico,

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.380
which is central Mexico.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.550
I thought it was a happy
childhood up until I

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.280
came to United States, and
I compared that childhood

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.040
to the childhood that people
had here and the accessibility

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.961
and abundance that the
United States brought

00:06:39.961 --> 00:06:41.210
in comparison to my childhood.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.680
But I grew up happy.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.960
And my great-grandma's
ranch every summer,

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.310
running through the cornfields.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.570
Everything you could possibly
think of with my sisters.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.510
Around the age of eight or
nine, and I don't really

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.930
disclose this-- my
mom was a young mom.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:56.890
My mom had me at 20.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:02.924
So when she was only
27, 28, she got cancer.

00:07:02.924 --> 00:07:04.590
And so she was here
in the United States

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.410
visiting family
member, and so she

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.740
decided to actually go ahead
and get treatment here.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.030
Luckily, our family all
lived in the Bay Area.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.810
So at the age of around
10-- that's my hometown

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.720
It's just for everyone
to know Guanajuato.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.636
It's really beautiful.

00:07:20.636 --> 00:07:21.762
You should visit.

00:07:21.762 --> 00:07:22.970
Tell me if you have any tips.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.290
I'll give you a lot of tips.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.095
It's colonial, and
it was a happy place

00:07:28.095 --> 00:07:31.329
to actually grow up.

00:07:31.329 --> 00:07:33.620
I think that's the first
picture in the first apartment

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.140
that we took after
we came from Mexico.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.780
Obviously, my
brother looks scared.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.320
My sister looks confused.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.110
But then, my older
sister and I look happy,

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.220
because we knew we were now
here in el norte, the north.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.250
You know, this place that
I remember my cousins

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:55.200
going to Mexico and telling me
that my eyes would turn blue

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.910
and my hair would
turn blonde once I

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.550
migrated to the United States.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.580
And I was like, I
like my brown hair.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.960
I like my brown eyes.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.120
And as an immigrant, I
learned-- and I promised her

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.370
I wouldn't cry-- but
I learned English.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:09.960
Who is here?

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.120
My fifth grade teacher.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.830
On her 64th birthday she's here.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:20.470
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.130
LAURA GOMEZ: She's actually on
the State Board of Technology

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:27.670
and Education, so everything
comes full circle.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.106
Ms. Paradise, that's her name.

00:08:29.106 --> 00:08:30.480
So I was like,
this is the reason

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.539
that the United States
is so successful.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:36.460
All the teachers
have amazing names.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.770
The teacher after her
was called Ms Bright.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.850
I was just like, United States.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:42.950
It's amazing.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.680
Later did I learn
that not all teachers

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.030
had really amazing names.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.950
But Ms Paradise, she
was just telling me

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.970
that she knew how adept I was
to math, in spite of my language

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.550
barriers.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.584
I convinced her.

00:08:55.584 --> 00:08:57.000
I said, let me
stay in your class.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.280
I know I don't speak
a lot of English,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.756
but I will at the
end of the year.

00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:02.505
And I think she still
has this essay where

00:09:02.505 --> 00:09:03.560
I wrote a whole
essay, and then there

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.370
was a little heart
with a Mexican flag

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.004
and the US flag at the end.

00:09:08.004 --> 00:09:09.670
But she believed in
me, and she believed

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.960
that-- I knew that
at fifth grade,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.255
if I stayed in ESL, or English
as a second language, course

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:16.880
then in sixth grade
that would happen--

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.546
that in the middle
school, I would still

00:09:18.546 --> 00:09:21.450
be tracked into that track.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.530
And then in high
school, I would not

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.786
have access to the AP courses.

00:09:25.786 --> 00:09:27.160
I didn't know that
when I was 10,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.951
but I knew that I wanted
to learn English--

00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:34.160
so that I could insult my
cousins, but also get ahead.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.050
And now I see the
decisions that were made.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.810
And so I discuss this, and I
call it horizontal loyalty.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:44.470
From the time you're born to
the time you actually move on,

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.780
all of that-- your
faces when you're young

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.980
or when you're studying.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.600
Or when you choose a career
or when you personally

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.920
choose marriage and children.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.830
And move on and then retire.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.780
There will be people
that will follow you

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.520
throughout the whole horizontal
journey of your life,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.110
and that's called
horizontal loyalty.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.490
And I think I'm here through
this horizontal loyalty.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.200
And I know that I
will be supported,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.340
finding that community, as
the speaker said this morning,

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.381
finding that community of
people that support you

00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:13.810
through your path of life.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:18.170
At 17, although I was
keen to math and science,

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:19.969
I didn't really have
a lot of educators,

00:10:19.969 --> 00:10:22.010
besides Ms Paradise, that
really pushed me to it.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.320
I was natural, but I
also got good grades.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.400
I learned English, and I even--
my prom date at that time,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.480
I got a better AP score, an
AP English score, than he did.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.830
I got a five; he got a two.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.288
And I was like,
you were born here.

00:10:35.288 --> 00:10:36.040
What happened?

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.800
I learned English
four years ago.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.000
So I got my first internship
at Hewlett Packard.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.820
I grew up.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.340
My mom was a nanny to a
CEO of a big tech firm.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.080
And for me at that time,
the late '90s was just,

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.970
this is tech?

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.980
This is software?

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.887
I had an internship, at 17,
software technology department,

00:10:55.887 --> 00:10:57.220
right before I entered Berkeley.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.390
I got a full ride to Berkeley
by an engineering company

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.360
called [? Raychem, ?] now Tyco
Electronics, at that time.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.120
And I was on my
track to actually

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.940
be in tech and
engineering and science.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.390
And I resisted.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:11.440
I got that internship.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.900
I said, I don't
want to work here.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.750
It wasn't something
that I felt--

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.770
that was the beginning
of when I decided

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.240
not to be in engineering.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.550
And I went to UC Berkeley.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.040
Who here is a Cal Bear?

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.920
I went to the dean.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.150
I'd be like, I don't think
I want to be an engineer.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.941
They were like, OK.

00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:32.170
Choose another thing.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.970
There wasn't a lot
of support for me

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.490
to maintain on that track.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.800
That's the same year
that Google was born.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.520
And now that you think
about it, I'm here 15,

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.280
what 17 years later?

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.010
Yes?

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.420
If I would have chosen a
track, where would I have been?

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.440
But obviously I didn't.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.120
I chose economics development
studies, languages.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.812
I was keen to
languages early on.

00:11:56.812 --> 00:11:58.520
And now professionally,
that's what I do.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.650
Localization's all about
languages, and international.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.524
So by the time I
reached college,

00:12:04.524 --> 00:12:06.940
I was learning my third language
in less than eight years.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.870
So I had learned English.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.286
Then I took French
in high school,

00:12:09.286 --> 00:12:11.640
then I took
Portuguese in college.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.764
And that was my
passion, languages.

00:12:13.764 --> 00:12:15.430
My passion was also
to change the world,

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:21.880
like any liberal arts
Berkeley student can attest.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.670
And so I traveled.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.740
I studied abroad, as
I said, in Brazil.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.660
I had great adventures.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.660
That's actually called
[FOREIGN LANGUAGE], which

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.120
means-- you go to a church,
and then you grab one of those.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.890
And then you tie it three times.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.180
I have one right here.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.030
And you make three wishes.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.680
And when it falls
out, those wishes

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.150
are supposed to come true.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.501
So I made those wishes.

00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:46.000
I said, I want to
go to grad school.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.210
I want to graduate without debt.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.640
That was almost impossible,
but I almost made it there.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.560
And I want to find
fulfilling career in my '20s.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.320
I graduated Berkeley, and I
decided I wanted to give back.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.230
Having my mom had had
cancer, I went ahead

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.390
and did a lot of health
education with women--

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.490
bi-lingual woman, women of
lower incomes and resources--

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.170
to make sure that I had
access to the right prevention

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.100
programs as well as treatment
programs for breast cancer.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.470
But I decided I wanted to
go back to grad school.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.480
And I did.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.090
I went back to grad school.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.640
I graduated in sociology
in Latin American studies.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.000
I did my ethnography, my
research, in Northeast Brazil

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.160
on the concept of
street children.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.210
And I talked about how in a
very Afro-Brazilian region,

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:41.300
and I just looked at
how race and class were

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.610
portrayed for urban youth.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:46.110
You see youth here, that might
dress a different way, you

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:47.307
automatically classify them.

00:13:47.307 --> 00:13:48.890
And this is done
throughout the world.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.890
So I graduated with
very-- you know,

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.730
I wanted to work for UNICEF.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.980
Wanted to move somewhere.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.190
But then I came back
to the Bay Area.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.450
And my mom, actually, was like,
now you need to get a job.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.951
I did not come to this country
and raise you to be like,

00:14:05.951 --> 00:14:06.450
oh, yes.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.820
Let me travel some
more, and let me study.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.450
She was like, you
need to get a job.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.520
So I did a quick search.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.340
I went on Craigslist,
and I just put "jobs,"

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:21.000
and then I just put "near me."

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.960
Palo Alto.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.080
I found one in Palo Alto.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.180
He's still my good friend.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.275
He's a CEO.

00:14:26.275 --> 00:14:27.650
[? David ?]
[? Conasomes ?] said,

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:31.200
you're too over-qualified
to be doing this job.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.840
And I was like, I just need
to pay off some loans, please.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.400
And that's my first startup.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.920
The startup got acquired by
AKQA, the advertising agency.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:47.830
That's how I ended up in tech,
by doing a quick search near me

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.280
on Craigslist.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.600
That agency got
acquired by AKQA.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.780
And before you know it,
I was off to London.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.400
I was living in
London, setting up

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.700
the operations for
AKQA and [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.121
and having the time of my life.

00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:07.370
Once again, decided to take
the opportunity to travel.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.707
And if anyone here
is just-- traveling

00:15:09.707 --> 00:15:11.790
just opens up your eyes,
I was always [INAUDIBLE],

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.900
like Latin America.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.880
And then I went to Europe,
and I would go from London

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.520
and go to Prague or
go to Copenhagen.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.497
And during that time my
recruiter calling like,

00:15:21.497 --> 00:15:22.080
are you happy?

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.420
And I'm like, I'm
living in London.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:23.919
Yay!

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:24.890
I am.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.098
And they're like, how about
if you want to come back?

00:15:27.098 --> 00:15:29.910
And I like, I should come
back to the United States.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.460
And said, well, we're looking
for a contract position

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.840
at this company YouTube.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.280
Have you heard of it?

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:43.390
This was in 2007.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:46.360
I think it was a month or two
after it was acquired by Google

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.620
that I came onto the YouTube
family as a contractor.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.380
That send me off to Brazil
because of my language skills.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.080
And obviously my
language skills have

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.280
been a driving
force in my career.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.950
And there at Google Brazil,
I met this beautiful, tall

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.540
German woman that
I first did not

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.750
like because she's so beautiful.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.970
She was working at the
Google Hamburg office

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.095
and who's now one of my
best friends, [? Tompka. ?]

00:16:13.095 --> 00:16:15.110
She lives in Mexico City.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.000
She was actually, had been
with Google up until this year,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.140
and then she became a mom
about I think 9 years.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.470
And so [? Tompka, ?] and this
is a horizontal loyalty that I

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.619
speak about, [? Tompka ?]
never questions.

00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:28.160
I say, maybe I don't
want to do this.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:28.752
Or maybe I do.

00:16:28.752 --> 00:16:29.960
Or maybe I want to open this.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.870
And every time I see her, it
was like, what happened to that?

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.161
I was like, it didn't work out.

00:16:33.161 --> 00:16:34.080
Or it did, but look.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.040
And it's just never
questions, understands,

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.790
and she's like, whatever
you need from me.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:39.700
Understands my talent.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.575
Understands my drive.

00:16:40.575 --> 00:16:42.350
Understands the
positions I want to make.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.980
The 2008 was a hard time.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.640
I don't know if a lot of you can
recall here in Silicon Valley.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.460
There were layoffs,
left and right.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.790
What I wanted was
just stability,

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:58.470
and I didn't feel like
startup world offered me that.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.470
YouTube decided to
say, hey we were

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.400
going to bring this
position either in-country.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.859
Do you want to go there or not?

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:06.520
And I said, not now.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.450
I need to stay with my family.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.889
I went to other several
startups, people that I've met.

00:17:11.889 --> 00:17:13.180
They are still friends of mine.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:17.130
One is a Google designer
here for Search.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.170
I also have all these
friends that I worked--

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.540
that I met at all the startups
that we have followed.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.760
But there were layoffs.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.810
I got laid off,
[INAUDIBLE] to startup.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:27.949
Then I was like, OK.

00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:29.240
I'm laid off from this startup.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.170
What do I do?

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.030
I went on Twitter.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.240
At that time, when
another friend

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.950
of mine-- who's actually a
hacker here, Brad Fitzpatrick--

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.920
Brad's like, have
you heard of Twitter?

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.670
And I was like, why would I
want to post my breakfast?

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.350
Like no.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.020
And he was like, you
should, you know.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.230
And I joined.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.120
And quickly, there was
a very basic design.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:57.350
Five months later--
I call it mooning

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:03.810
because this is where
luck came in-- I saw this.

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.310
It was on the "Time Magazine."

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.627
And I was like, what are the
chances that I could apply?

00:18:08.627 --> 00:18:10.210
I was already working
another startup,

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.980
so I had gotten a new
job through Twitter.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.730
So I was working
another startup,

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:19.200
heading their Director of
Operations and Product.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.700
And I became quickly more
addicted to this tool.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.360
I read this, and I read about
the impact that Twitter had.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.720
Read the profile of Biz and Ev.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.870
At that point-- and I
think that's my phone.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:39.470
It's my sister--
and they did not

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.680
have any positions open
that weren't infrastructure,

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.180
engineering.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.400
Things like the reliability
and the [? failover ?]

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.230
at that time.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:51.280
And then, I think they had
one position open for that.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.640
And that position was a
contract position for someone

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.665
that spoke Spanish
and Portuguese.

00:18:57.665 --> 00:18:59.510
So I was like, hmm, it's for me.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.970
Let me apply.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:05.110
I would have thought that
the sheer number of resumes

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.680
they probably got after being
on the cover of "Time Magazine"

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.680
and the Iran
Revolution probably--

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.920
don't know how my
resume stuck out.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.910
At that point, the first
Twitter employee ever, Crystal,

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:17.810
calls me.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:21.240
And Crystal hung up on
me after five minutes.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.804
And I was like, I
just screwed that.

00:19:23.804 --> 00:19:25.470
And then, when I asked
her later on when

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.030
I was hired why,
she was like, I knew

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.330
you were qualified
in five minutes.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.670
And I knew this
would be, you know,

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.270
contract for [INAUDIBLE]
would take longer.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.389
I took a severe pay cut.

00:19:35.389 --> 00:19:36.930
I remember my
boyfriend at that time.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.160
I went and got a manicure.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.868
I was like, I think
this is the last time

00:19:39.868 --> 00:19:43.170
I can get one that is nice
manicure because I just

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.820
took a pay cut to join this
company, who at that time

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:51.480
had just gotten hacked and
all of the internal memos

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.660
had been leaked.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.714
There was a stability
with "Fail Whale."

00:19:54.714 --> 00:19:56.380
The mainstream media
thought it was just

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.710
a tool to post
breakfast pictures.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.280
There wasn't a
lot of credibility

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.260
to this over-hyped-- and
when sometimes I read things

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.980
around new products,
Snapchat and everything.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.940
And the same criticisms
repeat themselves,

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.720
and you just know what the
value could be in the long run.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.550
You wait and see on
what that happens.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:15.341
And so I was hired.

00:20:15.341 --> 00:20:19.059
I was the first Latina,
the first woman,

00:20:19.059 --> 00:20:20.350
to join the international team.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.170
I was one of the
founding team members.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.753
The other woman was
[? Ukari, ?] who's

00:20:23.753 --> 00:20:25.500
also an immigrant
from Japan who has

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.582
a similar story--
came as a child.

00:20:27.582 --> 00:20:29.540
She was director of
international at that time,

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.700
and we launched.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.020
I came in to launch
Twitter in espanol.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.710
I was in Mexico for my
cousin's quinceanera

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.210
when we launched
Twitter in espanol.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.240
And I was like, yay!

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.900
And everyone was
like, what is that?

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:45.330
We don't know what this tool is.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:48.784
Even my mom-- like now, my
mom sees Mexican soap operas.

00:20:48.784 --> 00:20:49.950
And she's like, oh, Twitter.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.300
Yeah.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.171
You have that.

00:20:53.171 --> 00:20:53.670
So, yeah.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.480
I came in doing
Twitter in espanol.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.450
And it was really
amazing, because they just

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.330
pretty much-- Ev
and Biz were like,

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:00.670
do whatever you want with this.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:01.670
And I was like, OK.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.920
So it was like product,
[? BD, ?] support--

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.680
I was answering
tickets for people that

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.209
lost their passwords in Spanish.

00:21:09.209 --> 00:21:10.250
Everything under the sun.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.041
When you're an early
employee at a company,

00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:13.040
you wear so many hats.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.200
And anyone who was a startup
here understands your work.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.110
I mean, you start up
within a bigger company.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.380
I wear all these hats,
and they're like,

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.940
I've got full-time.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.860
Six months later, team lead.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.640
Two months later, manager.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.610
Another six months later,
head of localization.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.090
Things moved fast.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:35.220
I tell people I think I was
40, but then-- the company's

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.810
all hands fit in one
couch at that point.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.630
And the first all
hand that I-- it

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.220
was called Tea Time
that I attended--

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:48.280
was 3 and 1/2 hours on why
the "Fail Whale" was failing.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.860
And so that's where
the adventure started.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.750
And I say that was luck.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:57.670
If I hadn't applied--
but it was my hard work

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.800
that got me into the
interview, into the door.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.370
And it was the opportunity to
sell myself within the company.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:06.610
I saw an opportunity
for localization

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:10.770
that international users--
when my team translated,

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.820
with the help of really
talented product, program

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:20.190
and engineering managers,
we launched right to left.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.990
The impact that that had in the
Middle East, that was amazing.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.820
So all of these
things are really

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.530
taking that opportunity
within that work to make sure

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:28.270
and chatting.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.959
And during this time, I
created a lot of loyalties.

00:22:30.959 --> 00:22:32.500
I would go as a
woman-- and I'm going

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.110
to say not having a
technical degree--

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.470
I would ask my
engineering managers,

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:40.790
when we were having a product
meeting, to repeat what I said

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.140
or to say it first
and I can agree, just

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.270
because I knew
that they would be

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.730
heard slightly
more than I would.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:51.100
So [? Nico ?] and
Matt know that.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.700
That I would be like, hey,
can you back me up on this?

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.300
I would say in a way, that
they didn't feel like they had.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.190
But I think it was the
hidden rule between us--

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:05.310
that I had to go in there with
them so that I could be heard.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:08.674
I don't think this is endemic to
just Twitter or to other ones.

00:23:08.674 --> 00:23:10.090
And I don't think
it was a culture

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.360
within a certain organization.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.860
I think it's just women
in tech in general.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.820
My personality itself
is very outspoken,

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.770
so I want to be
heard the loudest.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:24.319
Maybe it is because of who I
am, or maybe because of the fact

00:23:24.319 --> 00:23:26.110
that I know that's the
only way I can get--

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.180
but you learn along the way.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.804
Sometimes you learn
to not say anything

00:23:28.804 --> 00:23:30.960
and to just understand.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.030
And to also know that-- when I
was questioned by another woman

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.750
that I wasn't
technical enough, I

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.770
went and asked the engineer
managers on my end.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:41.290
They're like, yes,
that it was technical.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.930
Having built a whole tool
from going from scratch

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:49.280
of 1,200 volunteer translators,
crowd-sourcing translation

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.960
at Twitter to one million
by the time I left.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.110
And having all of this
crowd-sourced languages

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:58.360
being translated--
simplified Chinese

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.660
was translating in
a day and a half--

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.230
by volunteer translators.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:05.697
In Iran, when we
translate into Farsi,

00:24:05.697 --> 00:24:07.530
translators actually
wrote [INAUDIBLE] says,

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.630
I cannot disclose
my actual identity,

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.940
or I could be imprisoned
or killed in Iran.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.780
So given that impact
back and being inspired

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.054
by what I was doing, really I
didn't focus on the being woman

00:24:20.054 --> 00:24:20.720
or being Latina.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.053
I think I focused a little
bit more on the being Latina.

00:24:23.053 --> 00:24:28.440
If I get called feisty too
many times, I will get feisty.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.240
But that-- an
unconscious [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.770
Going back into what inspires
me, what makes me drive

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:40.530
is that we believed early on--
and I quote this to Biz Stone--

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.790
that we weren't just a
triumph of technology

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:44.130
and the triumph of humanity.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.560
So like as you go
back, and you think how

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.290
your technology's-- going
back and making sure that that

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.500
triumph, that
technology's triumph.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.950
But more importantly, how is
it helping humanity in general?

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.200
I'm going to put it out there.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.490
Sometimes if I see
one more First World,

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.970
San Francisco-problem
startup fund--

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:07.630
I think like, this is great.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.460
But you know where are those?

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.690
I knew about WhatsApp,
five, four years ago

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:15.440
because everyone uses that.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.470
I use it to communicate with
my friends around the world.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:21.310
And there are a lot of great
startups in Silicon Valley,

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:22.410
creating great products.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:27.510
But they could also be, to a
certain extent, giving back.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.750
And now I'm going to talk
about the loyalty component

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.916
and where this comes from
in the horizontal loyalty.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.600
Robert Krulwich, and I
think I said it right,

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.840
is actually a journalist.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:44.600
And he gave the commencement
speech at Berkeley in 2011

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.620
at the School of Journalism.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.400
And he discusses this.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.940
He discussed about thinking
about horizontal loyalty.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.160
"Think about turning to
people you already know,

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.210
who are your friends, or
friends of their friends

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:58.880
and making something that
makes sense to you together--

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.733
both of you or all of you--
that is as beautiful or as true

00:26:01.733 --> 00:26:03.510
as you can make it."

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:05.867
And that horizontal
loyalty is actually

00:26:05.867 --> 00:26:07.200
what people can call networking.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.741
I don't call it
networking, because I

00:26:08.741 --> 00:26:11.360
don't go to network
events to meet people.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.810
I go to connect people or
understand how I can help them.

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:17.930
I'm a mentor to several startups
from all over the world,

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.510
from Israel all the
way from Argentina.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.455
And I tell them how can I open?

00:26:22.455 --> 00:26:24.200
How can I make this connection?

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.719
How can I show you my loyalty?

00:26:25.719 --> 00:26:27.760
Because I believe in your
product and your spirit

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.801
to be such an entrepreneur
that you're moving on.

00:26:29.801 --> 00:26:31.960
A lot of entrepreneurs
come here,

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.570
and this is the region that's
paved of gold for them.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:38.830
It's just they feel like
Sand Hill Road is, aah,

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.242
like the final point.

00:26:40.242 --> 00:26:42.450
And the same, you know, if
you're an actor somewhere,

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:43.770
you think Hollywood is the same.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.645
So I like just being
given that opportunities

00:26:45.645 --> 00:26:47.760
and that horizontal loyalty.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.960
I know several women.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.580
And a friend of mine, I
interviewed her for a position

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.612
on my team.

00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:54.570
Didn't get to hire her.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.600
I added her on LinkedIn.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.080
I said, I thought
you were amazing.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:02.060
You were probably too badass
for us, and let's keep in touch.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.030
And now she's one
of my close friends.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:08.660
She's leading international,
very prominent firm,

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:13.560
and she talks to me about
her challenges as a new mom.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.852
And so that loyalty that we
have together to make sure,

00:27:15.852 --> 00:27:16.351
you know.

00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:18.020
When I'm having
doubts professionally,

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.460
I don't think I have all
the answers in the world.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.120
I turn to them, too, as
much as they turn to me.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.950
And I've made mistakes,
many mistakes.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.760
And so I tell them,
learn from my mistakes,

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.480
because I wouldn't want you
to go through those mistakes.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.580
And those mistakes are the
politics at the office.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.360
Or those mistakes as
not saying something

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.818
just because you feel passionate
without actually filtering

00:27:36.818 --> 00:27:39.760
out, creating a filter that is
appropriate for that situation.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.960
Or those mistakes that I feel
like I failed, and I turn

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.860
around and I understand
that each one of my failures

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.810
is actually a success
in the long run.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.460
And there is a
quote that I always

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.870
say that success and
failure, treat them

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:59.010
with the same indifference,
meaning don't be too defined

00:27:59.010 --> 00:27:59.720
by success.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.274
When "Forbes" called
me and I was actually

00:28:02.274 --> 00:28:04.565
moderating the Forbes panel
on the future of technology

00:28:04.565 --> 00:28:09.510
in Mexico and I was in the
magazine, people were like,

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.260
how do you feel about
being so successful?

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.550
Or this or that.

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:14.450
And I said, you know what?

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:18.310
In 10, 15 years, you might
find me in a little magazine.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:21.000
And I'll have a
little hut in Mexico,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
putting up a restaurant.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.750
And I'll be happy.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:26.440
Probably that is my happiness,
to cook and live next

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.890
to the beach.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:31.916
So don't define so much by the
success because it can go down;

00:28:31.916 --> 00:28:32.509
it can go up.

00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:33.550
And as well as a failure.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:36.490
Define yourself by
how you handle both.

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:39.740
Definitely something that
I've learned along the way.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.690
I put this flags
because I have friends

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:43.505
from all over the
world, men and women.

00:28:43.505 --> 00:28:45.880
And I talk about the men that
have supported me and shown

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.940
horizontal loyalty
all over the world.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.390
Everything from France, Israel.

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:52.590
My co-founder
building something,

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:56.030
he's actually
Palestinian-Canadian.

00:28:56.030 --> 00:29:00.460
And [? Mo, ?] I met him
through the TechWomen Program.

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.700
TechWoman [? Ezra ?]
is from Egypt.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.420
And when I advocated,
I was like, we

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.670
need to be part of TechWomen.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.128
It was the most
amazing experience.

00:29:07.128 --> 00:29:09.650
Now I'm going to select to
be part of that program.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.785
The only person that
I want at Twitter

00:29:12.785 --> 00:29:14.160
at that time to
make sure that we

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.556
were involved in
this amazing program.

00:29:16.556 --> 00:29:18.180
And when [? Ezra ?]
came to me, I said,

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.638
[? Ezra, ?] you're
smarter than me.

00:29:19.638 --> 00:29:21.860
I mean she runs
Research and Development

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.120
at Orange, a mobile company.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:24.730
Engineer.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.890
And I said, obviously you
know I can not teach you

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.306
anything on the
engineering front.

00:29:28.306 --> 00:29:29.790
But what can I provide for you?

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.205
And she was like, I
want to be a startup.

00:29:31.205 --> 00:29:32.621
I want to start a
startup one day.

00:29:32.621 --> 00:29:33.650
And so say I said OK.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:36.990
I'm going to give you meetings
with at least 30 people

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.400
around the company,
from business

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:44.950
to HR to marketing to market
development to engineering

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.200
to people operations
that you know.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.290
So I display these
flags because--

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:51.640
and actually, you don't see
it because I have my boots.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.820
But I have a tattoo that
I got of the world, long

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.210
before I came in here.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:02.536
And everybody's like, you
really love the world.

00:30:02.536 --> 00:30:04.910
Even on my phone case, I got
that as a Christmas present.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:05.409
But it is.

00:30:05.409 --> 00:30:07.650
It is the fact that, like
the horizontal loyalty

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:11.170
has shown throughout countries,
has shown throughout regions.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:14.112
My friends in Brazil,
all my friends--

00:30:14.112 --> 00:30:15.570
some of my closest
friends all live

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.980
in Monaco, Brazil,
Mexico City, Miami.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.269
So it is that
horizontal loyalty.

00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:23.060
And I always feel like
when I doubt myself,

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.768
I just see their little
flags and knowing

00:30:24.768 --> 00:30:27.190
that they will cheer me on
regardless of the next step

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.690
happens.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:31.910
Some people wait.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:32.520
I don't.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.840
I'm very impatient,
which is a bad thing.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.990
But I'm trying to be a
little bit more patient.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:38.190
There are just some
people that don't.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.220
I am one of those people.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.678
Like, you tell me
to kick the ball,

00:30:40.678 --> 00:30:43.940
I kick it the farthest
and probably the fastest

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:44.900
than anyone can.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.440
But it is.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.070
Not waiting doesn't mean not
waiting for things to change.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:50.590
And so I give back.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:54.310
Some of my close friends are
MIT engineers, women, Latinas,

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:59.050
immigrants, that
are Latinas in STEM,

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:02.770
and so I drive to Central
Valley and help out

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.920
with whatever initiative
they have going.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.340
So I don't wait in other
things that I want change.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.120
Showing more women
in math and science

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.261
is definitely
creating that support

00:31:13.261 --> 00:31:14.760
and stating, if
you're good at that,

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.430
maybe they will stick around.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.479
I didn't, but I
still ended up here.

00:31:18.479 --> 00:31:20.020
I'm working now a
job, [? when ?] I'm

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:23.450
sort of localizing the
internet of things.

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:27.060
It's a challenging position
to understand how technology

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:30.060
is going to relate to you as
a person, but not only to you

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.110
in your language in your locale.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:36.630
The things are more personal
to you are those things.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:40.850
If I decide to wear this around
my wrist or carry my phone,

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:43.560
that's-- you know, localization
isn't bad everywhere you see.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.595
But you don't understand
that that's actually

00:31:45.595 --> 00:31:47.720
very important to understanding
and your connection

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.210
to technology.

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:52.580
I also, as I said
[? Mo, ?] my co-founder,

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.980
I'm also want to at least
attempt at entrepreneurship.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.920
This is some, the source
from "Mother Jones"

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.504
with a lot of the funding
that is being said.

00:32:01.504 --> 00:32:02.920
And a lot of my
good, good friends

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.050
are [? VCs ?] and so nothing.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.430
And I think that is
that shifting trend now

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:11.950
on what the demographics
are-- all males, 89%; mix, 8%;

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:16.180
an all-female founding
group is only 3%.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.800
And then you have, of
course the race bias.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.560
But I don't focus on as
much on the race, I think.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.750
I focus on gender
because I believe

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.940
that, regardless of race,
women will put forward.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.860
And you will see more
founders, more women.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.290
I think there was a conference
around just female founders

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:32.790
recently.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:41.610
This is a proverb that I
do-- and to my startup,

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.950
if you want to know, is
just about involving people

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:47.330
in technology in a way
through all the information

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:49.302
that we have available online.

00:32:49.302 --> 00:32:51.510
And it's a Chinese proverb.
"Tell me and I'll forget;

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:53.180
show me and I may
remember; involve me

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.580
and I may understand."

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.240
So it's definitely key
to what's driving me,

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.650
my passion to build something
that will have people--

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:04.410
right now, we have a very
one-sided conversation

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:06.680
with technology or
within the internet.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.860
And if you improve
people and involve them,

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.110
they will actually understand.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.520
Finally, this is it.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:21.040
I have had a lot of doubts
in my career, and in my life.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.590
I'm really good friends
with all my ex-boyfriends,

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:25.340
and people are like,
how is that possible?

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.510
And I said they made me the
woman I am for whoever I date.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:31.520
And so I think those are
my mistakes, whether-- they

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.510
weren't mistakes, but my
mistakes professional.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:34.530
Don't tell them.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:37.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:40.500
LAURA GOMEZ: They weren't, but
it's the same with the careers,

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.716
right?

00:33:41.716 --> 00:33:43.090
I don't think I
compromise myself

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:44.531
on a personal/professional
matter.

00:33:44.531 --> 00:33:46.655
And when I did and I felt
my integrity and who I am

00:33:46.655 --> 00:33:48.071
as [? this ?]
[? essence ?] Laura.

00:33:48.071 --> 00:33:49.580
I was compromised.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.030
I've decided to get up.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.327
It was hard to leave Twitter.

00:33:53.327 --> 00:33:54.660
It was hard to leave other jobs.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.284
It was hard to leave
this relationship,

00:33:56.284 --> 00:33:59.140
but it was-- I didn't
compromise myself.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.760
I didn't compromise
the deep Laura--

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.120
the essential,
authentic person I am.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.090
I make compromises
every day into things,

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.360
not everything will fit me.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.170
And not all things,
I will fit them.

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:11.889
So obviously there's
little compromise.

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:13.730
But the essential
compromise of yourself,

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:16.909
who you are, your identity as a
person and what you believe in.

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:18.737
And I talk to my
friends at Coursera,

00:34:18.737 --> 00:34:21.320
and I think they're building the
greatest thing in the world--

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.100
accessibility to education.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:27.340
I talk to Luis von Ahn who's
the founder of Duolingo.

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.960
He is just brilliant,
and the way

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.739
he's giving back
as far as language

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:37.820
learning, toppling down
all the institutions that

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:41.909
come with language learning and
making sure that you do that.

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:44.664
I see there's a lot of
people don't comprise

00:34:44.664 --> 00:34:47.080
of [INAUDIBLE], that are still
passionate about technology

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.100
that they're putting
it back to that.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.489
I feel that whatever
you do, whether you're

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:56.230
making a change your
life or in your product

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:59.160
or in the end result,
always just keep the center.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.830
Don't compromise
[INAUDIBLE] yourself.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:04.470
We are so lucky to live in
the land of opportunities.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.900
And I was so lucky
that somehow the moon

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:10.980
decided to shift my mom and
my family into this region.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.850
So here I am.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:15.750
This is me, and I give
this thing to you.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:16.900
Don't compromise.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.700
I know because people
will follow you

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.370
throughout your whole life
and do the horizontal loyalty

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.270
if they know that
you are in tech

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:26.090
and that you're
true to yourself.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:27.842
That's it thank you.

00:35:27.842 --> 00:35:31.286
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:31.286 --> 00:35:34.365
LAURA GOMEZ: I think I
have time for questions.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:45.910
AUDIENCE: So in
your story, you talk

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.130
a lot about horizontal
loyalty and kind

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:52.010
of using these people in
your life to help your career

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.650
and help you keep going.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:56.180
Do you have any tips on how
to find people like that?

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.420
Because I find as
a junior engineer,

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.020
I'm trying to
figure out how do I

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.840
position myself to
be in leadership?

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.050
What's the next step?

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:07.425
It's hard to find people
who are at that next step

00:36:07.425 --> 00:36:09.180
to ask about those things.

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.180
LAURA GOMEZ: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.870
No, I think it's important
to either ask-- you know,

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:16.580
I asked myself a question when
I started off managing people

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:20.260
and then managing a group
of very large organization.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.500
And the same questions
like, who can I help?

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.210
And a lot of people use a
mentor group, the mentorship.

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:29.590
But I use much more sort
of community of people.

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:33.810
Like if I'm having doubts in
a certain area, I go and ask.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:37.140
And I think most people are
really friendly, especially

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:37.700
in here.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.870
They're so willing to take
the time for that coffee

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:42.630
or take time for those things.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.210
Or to keep in contact.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:53.120
If it wasn't-- where is she?--
if it wasn't for Sabrina--

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.400
if it wasn't for Sabrina who
heard my talk a couple of years

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.400
ago, I wouldn't be here.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.710
And so there are those
times where you actually

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:04.580
want to make those connections
and or like follow up

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:05.300
with people.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.500
I think like as a
junior engineer,

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.180
you don't probably
necessarily need

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.400
to talk to another woman
engineer or more female.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.300
You could talk to someone
that has that leadership, that

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:19.257
experience on how to
handle career growth.

00:37:19.257 --> 00:37:20.840
Not necessarily--
like we always look,

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.464
I was like can I find
a Latina in tech.

00:37:22.464 --> 00:37:24.170
And can she be my mentor?

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:27.010
No, my mentors have been all
shapes and sizes, all colors

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:29.570
and all genders, in different
stages of my career.

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.380
So you don't have to
just look, you know.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.240
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.310
You've been a part
of a lot of companies

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:47.700
that paved the way for tech.

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.690
Coming from a
non-technical background,

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.770
how did you bridge
that gap in leading

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:56.050
the way in these high
profile tech companies,

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:57.910
coming from a
non-technical background?

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:00.070
LAURA GOMEZ: What I had
for me was my language,

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:04.039
was my ambition--
not ambition, drive.

00:38:04.039 --> 00:38:05.830
Because ambition means
you compare yourself

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:06.538
to somebody else.

00:38:06.538 --> 00:38:08.180
But I had an internal drive.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:12.170
I had my intelligence, my
experience, my background.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:13.030
And my passion.

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:15.910
Like time and time again, if I
hear about more person describe

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:19.230
me as passionate,
I will be like, OK.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.325
Yes.

00:38:20.325 --> 00:38:20.825
It was that.

00:38:20.825 --> 00:38:23.060
It was that my commitment
to learn, be a fast learner

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:27.050
and to think and to make sure
that I was able to demonstrate

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:30.170
the business needs, the product
needs and implement that.

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:32.760
And I think coming from a
non-technical background

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.505
shouldn't inhibit
any of your pursuit--

00:38:35.505 --> 00:38:36.880
I know a lot of
product managers.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.460
I know-- for
example, even people

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:40.250
with technical background.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:41.800
I was at [? Square ?]
the other day,

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.220
just chatting with some people.

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.470
And they told me a story
about an engineer that

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:47.275
was an industrial
mechanical engineer that

00:38:47.275 --> 00:38:48.650
wanted to be a
software engineer.

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:51.250
And so he took
courses with Coursera

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:55.557
and got a job now doing software
engineering at [? Square. ?]

00:38:55.557 --> 00:38:57.890
So I think it's not even the
technical background, where

00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:58.806
you want to be headed.

00:38:58.806 --> 00:39:00.611
It

00:39:00.611 --> 00:39:03.210
There is such a
diversity on [? back-- ?]

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:06.490
but in such a diversity
in technology right now,

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:09.460
but it's much more about
what are your assets?

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.750
What are your strengths
that you can show early on?

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:18.310
Languages for me was that door
opening and taking that door

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:19.190
into technology.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.230
So that was for me.

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.460
I don't know what it
is for you, but you

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.668
might want to just look at
where those strengths are.

00:39:23.668 --> 00:39:25.842
And there's also not
working on the tech.

00:39:25.842 --> 00:39:27.050
You can do product marketing.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:28.740
Marketing, there's just so rich.

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.200
I started off in the ad
operations sales organization

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.040
and made my way more
into the product

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.840
because that's where
my passion lied.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.656
Not necessarily in the
coding but much more shaping

00:39:37.656 --> 00:39:39.280
the product, the
international product.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.290
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:43.900
LAURA GOMEZ: Hi.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.400
AUDIENCE: I just
wanted to thank you

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.940
for quoting Zora Neale Hurston.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.470
That was a really powerful
and controversial quote.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:58.600
And I wanted to know, what
else can we discuss or can

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:03.600
we think about black women's
position, and Latino women's

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.710
position, in the tech field.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.520
And even thinking
about this conference

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:12.750
and the very few numbers
of black women here today.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:16.880
What can we do as a
community of women

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.964
to support those
who we don't see?

00:40:19.964 --> 00:40:21.630
LAURA GOMEZ: So I
think the one problem,

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:23.490
and I'm not thinking
it's this, is

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:26.420
that I know a lot of
black tech groups.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.600
I know a lot of
Hispanic tech groups.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.809
They're all still fragmented.

00:40:29.809 --> 00:40:31.641
And I believe if we
would just come together

00:40:31.641 --> 00:40:33.960
into-- this is why I was real
excited about this event.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.335
I was like, this
is the one event

00:40:35.335 --> 00:40:37.690
that I'm not seeing the same
people over and over again.

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:40.940
And I love all my Latinos
in tech and Hispanic.

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:44.140
But obviously, I see
them more than my mom.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.510
It's just like coming in
and meeting new people,

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:47.510
meeting new faces.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.510
The young women that
were sitting at my table

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:52.610
while we were doing the
prototyping were so exciting,

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:54.460
and it was just
like going outside.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.760
And I think seeing
that and inviting more.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.519
I was honored to be here
and to speak of my story,

00:41:00.519 --> 00:41:01.810
but not really focused in that.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:04.610
And then just making sure
that it's not just-- we

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.886
isolate ourselves.

00:41:06.886 --> 00:41:11.640
This is about just diversity
in general in tech.

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:15.309
You see a lot of prominent
women in technology,

00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:16.350
discussing their stories.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:18.670
I have a friend that's an
African American woman that

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:20.000
said, that's a great story.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.320
But that's not my story.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.200
But it still, it's a story
around a certain thing.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.950
So just talking about diversity
and not making-- sure,

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:29.200
I've made jokes at the end
of meetings where like, oh,

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.390
I'm the only girl here.

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:33.890
Or I'm the only woman here,
just so that people can open up

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:36.440
and talking about just
diversity in general.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:40.870
And making sure that as girls
are learning how to code,

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:43.780
also the girls that may
not have had that support

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.070
to learn how to code
have access to being

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:51.150
in this amazing industry that is
changing, literally, the world.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.310
And we get to live here.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:56.940
And I that's where the
moon comes into my life.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:01.250
Anything else?

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.750
Great.

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:03.140
Thank you so much.

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:10.600

SOWMYA SUBRAMANIAN:
Thanks, Laura.

00:42:12.785 --> 00:42:15.030
It was great hearing your story.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.430
We were chatting a little
bit before the talk started,

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:19.820
and it was just really great.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.260
Thank you.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:22.760
All right.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.780
So before we move
to the next session,

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.750
we'll take a 10 minute break.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:30.550
And please check what the other
talk you want to go to is.

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:33.570
And if you want to go
to the different room,

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:37.030
there are volunteers in the
back with the [? cute ?] card

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.246
that you can follow.

00:42:39.246 --> 00:42:44.211
And then we meet back here in
10 minutes, for the next talk.

00:42:44.211 --> 00:42:45.960
