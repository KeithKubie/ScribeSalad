00:00:03.595 --> 00:00:04.970
MARTIN OMANDER:
My guest today is

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.130
Pascal Jaillon, who
leads the developer

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.500
program at the startup Magnet.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.247
Welcome on the show, Pascal.

00:00:11.247 --> 00:00:12.330
PASCAL JAILLON: Thank you.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.460
MARTIN OMANDER: So could you
tell us a bit about Magnet--

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.670
what you guys are doing?

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.545
PASCAL JAILLON: Yeah.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:18.870
Magnet offers developers
a suite of products

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.690
to build great
mobile applications,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.214
meaning apps that have a great
experience online or offline.

00:00:24.214 --> 00:00:25.130
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.710
So your customers
are not consumers

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.220
of apps-- individual users.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.300
You are targeting
the developers.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.120
That requires quite a different
kind of marketing, right?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.864
How do you market
to these developers?

00:00:42.864 --> 00:00:45.030
PASCAL JAILLON: We don't
really market to developers

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.510
as much as we start
conversations with them.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.190
Developers nowadays have a lot
of choices in terms of product

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.860
to use.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.590
And they need to see
that what you offer

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.640
will add value to their mobile
app, to their architecture,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.739
to their development process,
or their operational process.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.920
Long gone is the time when
management will actually

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.430
have a list of approved product
that developers will be using.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.350
Now developers,
architects-- they

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.990
all have a lot of choices
of open source projects,

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.010
and they really
will pick whatever

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.750
makes the most sense for
their mobile application,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.780
their mobile project.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.540
MARTIN OMANDER: So you're saying
that individual developers are

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.420
in the driver's
seat, and those are

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.740
the people you want to
talk with rather than

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.592
their bosses and people
who are running companies?

00:01:35.592 --> 00:01:36.800
PASCAL JAILLON: That's right.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.920
Developers, they really
pick their tools.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.520
So you really need to provide
something that adds something

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.255
to their toolbox, that really
adds value to the process they

00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:51.880
are doing every day.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.120
MARTIN OMANDER: So how do
you build such a product?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.750
If it's not aimed at the
bosses, and you're not

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.620
talking about
return on investment

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.430
and that sort of marketing, but
you're targeting developers,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.530
that requires you have to build
the product in a different way

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.780
too, right?

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.160
PASCAL JAILLON: Yes, and
getting the developers really

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.550
early on in the process
of building a product

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.710
is actually key.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.484
So you need to reach
out to them super-early,

00:02:22.484 --> 00:02:24.400
before you even start
developing your product.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.170
And you can reach out to
developers online or offline.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.870
If you are looking at
the online communities,

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.580
you will go directly to Twitter,
Stack Overflow, Reddit-- Google

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.210
communities.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.430
For us, that was a great
source of feedback.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.280
We engage earlier--

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280
MARTIN OMANDER: Google+?

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.570
PASCAL JAILLON: Yeah,
Google+ communities, sorry.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.940
Early on, we engaged
with developers.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.760
We got great feedback.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.152
And that was very important
to iterate with our product.

00:02:54.152 --> 00:02:55.610
MARTIN OMANDER:
OK, so that's where

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.640
you meet them and
start the conversations

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.090
and get their feedback online.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.730
Where do you go to meet
the developers offline?

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.080
PASCAL JAILLON: Offline?

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.080
Those days your best bet
is really the meet-ups.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.663
Especially here in
the Silicon Valley,

00:03:08.663 --> 00:03:11.120
there are a lot of groups
talking on a regular basis

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.160
about different topics.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.620
So you pick the ones
that are close to what

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.460
you are doing-- the
problems you are addressing

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.400
with your product.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.500
And you try first
to attend, to listen

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.020
to what's going on there.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.640
And, hopefully,
at some point you

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.560
can have a spot to speak
and to present and to,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.949
again, get feedback from
developers about your product.

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:31.490
MARTIN OMANDER: But
when you stand up

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.510
there at the meet-up and talk to
developers about your product,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.167
how do you make it
not be a sales pitch?

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:38.750
I mean, you want to
sell your product,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.930
but developers are
allergic to sales pitches.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.100
Even if you provide free pizza,
if there's a sales pitch,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.230
they'll stop coming, right?

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.082
How do you thread that needle?

00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:49.290
PASCAL JAILLON: That's right.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.697
So you don't want to
be in a sales mode.

00:03:52.697 --> 00:03:54.280
You're there, really,
to get feedback.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.321
So the last thing you need
at this point, really,

00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:58.446
is dollars-- just feedback.

00:03:58.446 --> 00:03:59.820
And there are a
few prerequisites

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.300
to get the right feedback
from those developers.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.290
So before you even go there,
make sure that, again, you're

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.470
building a strong product,
addressing pain points

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.020
that they have, and
then do something

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.320
with great experience.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.770
That's key in 2015
to build products

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.010
that offer a great
experience for developers.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.230
We're talking about the
developer experience.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.950
It's very important.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.810
MARTIN OMANDER: What do you need
to put in front of developers

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.450
at that point for them to be
able to provide this feedback?

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.670
PASCAL JAILLON: So you need to
show them APIs, sample code.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.110
You need to show them videos.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.400
Early on, we built some
videos to show them

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.570
how to use the product, even
if it was a very early stage

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.830
version of the product.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.840
And that's, again,
the best way for them

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.210
to quickly learn and adopt it,
and again, provide feedback

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.870
to you, which is so
crucial at the early phase.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.860
MARTIN OMANDER: And what
do you do beyond meet-ups?

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.950
PASCAL JAILLON: So you can
attend meet-ups, as we did.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.655
But ultimately,
at some point, we

00:04:58.655 --> 00:05:00.620
decided also to organize
our own meet-up.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.520
And we focused on the
developer experience

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.360
for mobile developers.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.600
And there, again, the best
way to run your own meet-ups

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.690
is to not just talk
always about your product.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.170
You have to invite partners.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.050
You have to invite
other developers

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.720
to talk about their products.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.990
And, again, at the
end, you end up

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.120
sharing about what you're doing.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.290
But it's not just about you.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.579
You also share with
a larger community.

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:26.620
MARTIN OMANDER: So you're
giving more than you're

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.710
getting at this point.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.380
PASCAL JAILLON: That's right.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.640
You give a lot.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.940
It's kind of like give,
give, give, and then get.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.220
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, is that
about the ratio-- 1 to 3?

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.434
PASCAL JAILLON: You need a bit
more gives today in the recipe.

00:05:37.434 --> 00:05:38.350
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.742
Where does the social media
fit into this whole process?

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:43.200
PASCAL JAILLON: So
the social media

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.440
is definitely important
to get feedback

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.550
as well because you can
target the local groups here.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.920
But when you build for a niche
market or a smaller audience

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.580
that's very targeted,
the social media

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.850
allows you to reach out to
developers that you would not

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.340
be able to get locally.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:11.160
So we want the typical Twitter,
Facebook-- Google+ community,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.620
again, was great here.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.330
And what you get is this
ripple effect as well.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.316
While we were still reaching
out to local developers,

00:06:20.316 --> 00:06:21.940
at the same time,
for the social media,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.590
we were getting feedback
from Russia, from Australia,

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.586
or people in Spain and Italy
finding bugs on GitHub.

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:30.960
Again, so that was really
priceless for us at this point.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.085
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, right,
because a small startup,

00:06:33.085 --> 00:06:35.130
you don't have the
resources to start

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.922
physical meet-ups in Spain and
Russia and all these places.

00:06:37.922 --> 00:06:39.130
PASCAL JAILLON: That's right.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.236
And the social media
gives you this reach.

00:06:41.236 --> 00:06:42.110
MARTIN OMANDER: Yeah.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.690
Did you approach the Android
and the iOS communities

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:47.200
differently?

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.152
I understand your
product works on both.

00:06:49.152 --> 00:06:50.610
PASCAL JAILLON: So
we really wanted

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.110
to have a product that
offers the same features

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.950
for both platforms.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.240
We also realized that
it was much harder

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.800
to build this plug-in.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.080
We went with a plug-in
architecture on Xcode and iOS

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.110
because it was more like
a closed environment.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.651
So we had to work with
other projects on GitHub

00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:11.150
and learn from other
developers that

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.550
were doing something similar.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.050
On Android, that
was a bit easier

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.380
because it's more documented.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.227
And, also, there are
many more plugins

00:07:17.227 --> 00:07:18.310
that we already developed.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.212
So it was an easier process.

00:07:20.212 --> 00:07:21.170
MARTIN OMANDER: Got it.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.190
All right, great.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.330
Thank you very much for coming
in and sharing your experiences

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.119
with us, Pascal.

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:27.410
PASCAL JAILLON: You're welcome.

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:32.480
MARTIN OMANDER: We hope
you found something

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.030
you can use in your startup.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.190
Your input matters.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.020
Please leave your
comments below.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.700
We read everything you write.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.980
To learn how Google
can help your startup,

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.260
go to
developers.google.com/startups.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.580
If you would like to
be a guest on the show,

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.420
go to bit.ly/applyrootaccess.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.570
That's it for now.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.680
See you next time.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.030
