philosophical problems and then we think
 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.800
philosophical problems and then we think

so it's not that sexuality has changed

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:24.790
so it's not that sexuality has changed
 

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.650
so it's not that sexuality has changed
right it's that we must define the

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:28.660
right it's that we must define the
 

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.410
right it's that we must define the
sexuality by a series of changes which

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:31.420
sexuality by a series of changes which
 

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.850
sexuality by a series of changes which
constituted as a product as an object so

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:35.860
constituted as a product as an object so
 

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.549
constituted as a product as an object so
that means that the very notion of

00:10:38.549 --> 00:10:38.559
that means that the very notion of
 

00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:42.629
that means that the very notion of
sexuality must become a very so just one

00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:42.639
sexuality must become a very so just one
 

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:44.280

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:03.100
 

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.970
okay now this I did decided that there

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:05.980
okay now this I did decided that there
 

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.340
okay now this I did decided that there
is that thing but rather that there are

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:08.350
is that thing but rather that there are

underneath this idea actually and it's
 

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.350
underneath this idea actually and it's
like it's a very odd idea which goes

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:22.360
like it's a very odd idea which goes
 

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.480
like it's a very odd idea which goes

maybe that's not enough state the film

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:02.540
maybe that's not enough state the film

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:02.970
 

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.400
so in other words the point of this

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:05.410
so in other words the point of this

historical film is not to teach us

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120
historical film is not to teach us
 

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.210
historical film is not to teach us
anything about the past but rather to

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:09.220
anything about the past but rather to

to our own minds unsettle our relation

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:15.430
to our own minds unsettle our relation
 

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.450
to our own minds unsettle our relation
to ourself now so the math disturbing

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:18.460

to ourself now so the math disturbing
are in relation to that the present

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:21.370
are in relation to that the present

it's not a path is something which no
which can't be nerman actually so it's a

00:18:27.299 --> 00:18:27.309
which can't be nerman actually so it's a
 

00:18:27.309 --> 00:18:29.940
which can't be nerman actually so it's a
straight reversal actually if you think

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:29.950
straight reversal actually if you think
 

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:32.399
straight reversal actually if you think
about it in the notion of historical

00:18:32.399 --> 00:18:32.409
about it in the notion of historical
 

00:18:32.409 --> 00:18:45.149
about it in the notion of historical
knowledge it's so you have a very clear

00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:45.159
knowledge it's so you have a very clear
 

00:18:45.159 --> 00:18:47.369
knowledge it's so you have a very clear
example of that in the final scene maybe

00:18:47.369 --> 00:18:47.379
example of that in the final scene maybe
 

00:18:47.379 --> 00:18:49.830

the cab I think it's a block which is
the gas chamber

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:57.230
the gas chamber
 

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:00.190
the gas chamber
and you'd say that it is a strange

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200
and you'd say that it is a strange
 

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:07.899
and you'd say that it is a strange
observatory and in fact it means that

00:19:07.899 --> 00:19:07.909
observatory and in fact it means that
 

00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:10.810
observatory and in fact it means that

the colonial war against other people
 

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.529
the colonial war against other people
you know suspected that it was about the

00:19:38.529 --> 00:19:38.539
you know suspected that it was about the
 

00:19:38.539 --> 00:19:40.090
you know suspected that it was about the
caste the Soviet Union but actually

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:40.100
caste the Soviet Union but actually
 

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.279
caste the Soviet Union but actually
doesn't matter too much in the sense

00:19:42.279 --> 00:19:42.289
doesn't matter too much in the sense
 

00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:43.870
doesn't matter too much in the sense
that the point is more general than that

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:43.880
that the point is more general than that
 

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.289
that the point is more general than that
I think and we can still think about it

00:19:47.289 --> 00:19:47.299
I think and we can still think about it
 

00:19:47.299 --> 00:19:51.159
I think and we can still think about it
an example so the point of that we

00:19:51.159 --> 00:19:51.169
an example so the point of that we
 

00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:53.799
an example so the point of that we
communicate with the past not as with a

00:19:53.799 --> 00:19:53.809
communicate with the past not as with a
 

00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:57.190
communicate with the past not as with a
distant object but with as we the

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200
distant object but with as we the
 

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.039
distant object but with as we the
possibility of ourselves so I think you

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:00.049
possibility of ourselves so I think you
 

00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:04.289
possibility of ourselves so I think you
see how it resonates say it's a critical

critical relationship resolution task so
 

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.840
critical relationship resolution task so
the first one consists in creating the

shattered mirrors the only point I want
to stress is that it seems to me the

01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600
to stress is that it seems to me the
 

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.729
to stress is that it seems to me the
reason why the vs. uses this example or

01:13:45.729 --> 01:13:45.739
reason why the vs. uses this example or
 

01:13:45.739 --> 01:13:48.520
reason why the vs. uses this example or
refers to this film the main reason is

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:48.530
refers to this film the main reason is
 

01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:51.370
refers to this film the main reason is
that mirrors are obviously involved and

01:13:51.370 --> 01:13:51.380
that mirrors are obviously involved and
 

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:54.040
that mirrors are obviously involved and
that there is a very clear visual

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:54.050
that there is a very clear visual
 

01:13:54.050 --> 01:14:00.280
that there is a very clear visual

seems to give a literal literal

01:14:12.450 --> 01:14:12.460
 

01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:15.600
it may be too literal are any scenes of

it may be too literal are any scenes of

it may be too literal are any scenes of
this kind crystal image images is it

01:14:19.290 --> 01:14:19.300
this kind crystal image images is it
 

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.480
this kind crystal image images is it
enough to have mirror reflections and

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:21.490
enough to have mirror reflections and
 

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:25.980
enough to have mirror reflections and
this kind of many at least effects to

this kind of many at least effects to
 

01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:28.260
this kind of many at least effects to
have a crystal image probably not

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:28.270
have a crystal image probably not
 

01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:32.730
have a crystal image probably not
