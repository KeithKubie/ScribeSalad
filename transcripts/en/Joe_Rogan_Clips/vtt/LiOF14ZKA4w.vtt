1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.580
Happen.
The Joe Rogan experience,
they do that world,
don't forget.
Right.

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.090
Ilan could talk all the shit he wants.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.940
I remember he had a McLaren f one yes he did.

4
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.090
And he still has a Jaguar e type one of those really old ones.

5
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:15.800
Like a 69 with the wrong sharp.
No Long Hood.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's still,

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.410
he had malaria so he at heart,
he knows the deal.
You know what I mean?

7
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:24.300
But he didn't make that car that fast for a practicality.
No,
it makes no sense.

8
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.310
The same reason he made a fucking blow torch.
Exactly right.
It's a silly person.

9
00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:32.040
He's just not a flame thrower.
We know that.
It's not definitely,
definitely silly.

10
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:36.120
Super Genius.
So it is,
what do you think and all the best ways.
Yes.
Right.

11
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:39.120
Only good ways.
I never say anything bad about him,
of the guy.

12
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.530
He's glad he's alive.
I am.
I'm glad he's a real thing.
No,

13
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:45.060
honestly I and I hose and degree.

14
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:49.080
I get a lot of crap from people online saying like,
I'm an Eli moss cater.

15
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.960
I'm a Tesla hater.
I could be critical sometimes.
You know what I mean?

16
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.820
But it's like the guys of the cousin damn genius.
He's a damn genius.
Damn genius.

17
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.400
And critical is important,
guys.
Like you are important.

18
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.640
It's very important to hear what other people think.

19
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:05.130
If it's rezoned in intelligent,
right.

20
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.680
I can help you even if you don't like hearing it.
All right.
So I've got to keep,

21
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.160
I mean,
he's a genius,
but sometimes you gotta keep the company in check.

22
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:15.930
The cars are phenomenal cars.
They're phenomenal cars and they weren't always,
no,

23
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.280
absolutely not.
Yeah.
And what they were,
when they first came out,
like,
dude,

24
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.500
are you aware of the whole thing with top gear?
Yes.
That was crazy.
Yeah,

25
00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:25.610
they were being shady.
Yeah,
we're super shady.
Yeah.

26
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.530
They were running the car down.
The car died.
They wanted to bash the car,

27
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:31.530
but they could.
But like for stuff like that,
like I'll stick up and say,
Yo,
hey,

28
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.800
you can't keep doing that.
And he got pissed.
He loves it.
That's his baby.
Yeah.

29
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.730
He sues the baby.

30
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:40.650
I think he lost because I think the way there's show is structured that was,

31
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.700
it's entertainment,
it's entertainment.

32
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.220
It's incredibly damaging to the company because it made it look like,

33
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.960
I don't know why they did that.

34
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.810
There's a couple of things that they did the top gear did,
but I was like,

35
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:55.630
why would you do that?
Right.
That was the sound of,
some people remember they,

36
00:01:55.631 --> 00:01:59.560
their,
their focuses on petrol or gas powered cars.
Like when a,

37
00:01:59.561 --> 00:02:02.970
when an eevee comes along and it's actually pretty damn good,
and a lot of cases,

38
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:05.220
people are just like,
shit,
and like,
you can't let this thing win.

39
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.310
Especially back back in the day when that was going on.
Right.

40
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:12.150
And that was a long time ago.
That was in 2012 I think.
Yeah.
2013 yeah.
