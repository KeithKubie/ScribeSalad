00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For the first one, Python is fun, there is a space here and a space there.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There will be three elements in the return list--Python, is, and fun.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This next one reminds us that split only splits on spaces.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We might be tempted to break up July and August,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but the split function won't.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There are only two elements of the return list--"July-August" and "1842."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Finally, down here we might like to break this up into 6 times 9 equals 42,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but officially there are no spaces in this string.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We'll just get out a singleton list--a list containing one element, the original string.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
"July-August 1842" is probably within a year of when Ada Lovelace wrote

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the first computer program for the difference engine or analytic engine at the time.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It was to compute some mathematics.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Also, if you're not sure why 6 times 9 would be 42--don't panic.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.212
But you may want to check out the works of Douglas Adams.
