&gt;&gt; That's good David. Note that when we did this problem previously using means

00:00:32.613 --> 00:00:36.779
analysis and product reduction, we ran in to all kinds of problems, because

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:40.772
plans for property goals and we had no way of ordering these radius goals.

00:00:40.772 --> 00:00:44.420
Now we have a way, that's the power of partial [UNKNOWN].

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.910
Note also that this partial art of planning, this algorithm makes certain

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.810
things that are implicit in human reasoning, explicit. Presumably when you and

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.910
I reason about things we must be reasoning something like this, or

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.370
at least this is one hypothesis about how we might be reasoning. And we have

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.440
just made many of the operations of human reasoning so explicit and so precise.
