our study looked at the evolution of
 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.190
our study looked at the evolution of
African climate over the last fifteen

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200
African climate over the last fifteen
 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.589
African climate over the last fifteen
thousand years what we discovered in

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599
thousand years what we discovered in
 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.959
thousand years what we discovered in
this sediment core was that this

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969
this sediment core was that this
 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.150
this sediment core was that this
transition from Africa being completely

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160
transition from Africa being completely
 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.600
transition from Africa being completely
vegetated roughly between five and ten

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610
vegetated roughly between five and ten
 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.610
vegetated roughly between five and ten
thousand years ago to the desert that it

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:21.620
thousand years ago to the desert that it
 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.770
thousand years ago to the desert that it
is now that transition happened at

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:23.780
is now that transition happened at
 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.420
is now that transition happened at
almost at exactly five thousand years

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430
almost at exactly five thousand years
 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.220

ago one of the purposes of this paper
 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.220
ago one of the purposes of this paper
was to explore this particular area that

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230
was to explore this particular area that
 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.139
was to explore this particular area that
we were looking at and bring together

we were looking at and bring together
 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.209
we were looking at and bring together
evidence from other Lake records nearby

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219
evidence from other Lake records nearby
 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.209

the end of the African humid period of
 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.009
the end of the African humid period of
five thousand years ago occurred really

five thousand years ago occurred really
 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.229
five thousand years ago occurred really
quickly within centuries we know what

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239
quickly within centuries we know what
 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.410
quickly within centuries we know what
causes the the overall transition from

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420
causes the the overall transition from
 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.869
causes the the overall transition from
Africa becoming or having been much

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879
Africa becoming or having been much
 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.910
Africa becoming or having been much
wetter in the past to the very dry North

wetter in the past to the very dry North
 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.100
wetter in the past to the very dry North
Africa that exist today that's due to a

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110
Africa that exist today that's due to a
 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.510
Africa that exist today that's due to a
change in the Earth's orbit around the

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520
change in the Earth's orbit around the
 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.429
change in the Earth's orbit around the
Sun and that changes the amount of

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439
Sun and that changes the amount of
 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.109
Sun and that changes the amount of
sunlight that you get during a given

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119
sunlight that you get during a given
 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.480
sunlight that you get during a given
season let's a summer if we look through

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490
season let's a summer if we look through
 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.550
season let's a summer if we look through
geologic time and you sort of go back

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560
geologic time and you sort of go back
 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.889
geologic time and you sort of go back
through the eons there's just tons of

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899
through the eons there's just tons of
 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.609
through the eons there's just tons of
evidence that life responds to climate

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619
evidence that life responds to climate
 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.080
evidence that life responds to climate
there's no shortage of evidence that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090
there's no shortage of evidence that
 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.639
there's no shortage of evidence that
organisms large and small from bacteria

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649
organisms large and small from bacteria
 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.029
organisms large and small from bacteria
to mammoth respond to climate in many

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039
to mammoth respond to climate in many
 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.429
to mammoth respond to climate in many
cases in the geologic past there are

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439
cases in the geologic past there are
 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.719
cases in the geologic past there are
examples of great extinctions or great

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729
examples of great extinctions or great
 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.550
examples of great extinctions or great
speciation events link to changes in

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560
speciation events link to changes in
 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.249
speciation events link to changes in
climate the most recent being at the end

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259
climate the most recent being at the end
 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.569
climate the most recent being at the end
of the Ice Age their so called the

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579
of the Ice Age their so called the
 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.349
of the Ice Age their so called the
megafauna extinction when all the woolly

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359
megafauna extinction when all the woolly
 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:53.420
megafauna extinction when all the woolly
mammoths and the sort of large

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430
mammoths and the sort of large
 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.120
mammoths and the sort of large
mammals disappeared from North America

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130
mammals disappeared from North America
 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.240
mammals disappeared from North America
so the sediment core that we collected

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
so the sediment core that we collected
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.130
so the sediment core that we collected
what was interesting about this

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140
what was interesting about this
 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.550
what was interesting about this
particular study is that this was a

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560
particular study is that this was a
 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.440
particular study is that this was a
penultimate leg of a cruise at

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
penultimate leg of a cruise at
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.630
penultimate leg of a cruise at
circumnavigated Africa so it started

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
circumnavigated Africa so it started
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.210
circumnavigated Africa so it started
near Morocco went toward South Africa

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220
near Morocco went toward South Africa
 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.800
near Morocco went toward South Africa
and then marched its way back up East

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810
and then marched its way back up East
 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.460
and then marched its way back up East
Africa the coast of East Africa and

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470
Africa the coast of East Africa and
 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.930
Africa the coast of East Africa and
fortunately we were on a dutch flag ship

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940
fortunately we were on a dutch flag ship
 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.600
fortunately we were on a dutch flag ship
because actually the timing of our

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610
because actually the timing of our
 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.520
because actually the timing of our
cruise was two months before nine eleven

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530
cruise was two months before nine eleven
 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.440
cruise was two months before nine eleven
at that time the Pirates hadn't gotten

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450
at that time the Pirates hadn't gotten
 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.930
at that time the Pirates hadn't gotten
so bold as we now know them to be they

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940
so bold as we now know them to be they
 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.060
so bold as we now know them to be they
weren't coming out hundreds of

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070
weren't coming out hundreds of
 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.770
weren't coming out hundreds of
kilometers away from the Mara from the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
kilometers away from the Mara from the
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.960
kilometers away from the Mara from the
coastline as we were sailing along the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970
coastline as we were sailing along the
 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.820
coastline as we were sailing along the
Somali coast which you know is known by

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830
Somali coast which you know is known by
 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.710
Somali coast which you know is known by
everyone as being a really terrible

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720
everyone as being a really terrible
 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.300
everyone as being a really terrible
place we had to shut off all the lights

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310
place we had to shut off all the lights
 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.070
place we had to shut off all the lights
all the navigation lights which is

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
all the navigation lights which is
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.180
all the navigation lights which is
normally totally illegal but we shut up

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190
normally totally illegal but we shut up
 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.740
normally totally illegal but we shut up
all navigation lights in all interior

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750
all navigation lights in all interior
 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.050
all navigation lights in all interior
lights and so all we had were those who

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060
lights and so all we had were those who
 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.880
lights and so all we had were those who
serve red photographers lights if you

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890
serve red photographers lights if you
 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.060
serve red photographers lights if you
know those was very dim red lights we

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070
know those was very dim red lights we
 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.100
know those was very dim red lights we
had that and we had total radio silence

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110
had that and we had total radio silence
 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.770
had that and we had total radio silence
which the captain wasn't particularly

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780
which the captain wasn't particularly
 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.180
which the captain wasn't particularly
happy about but I was certainly the safe

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190
happy about but I was certainly the safe
 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.009
happy about but I was certainly the safe
thing to do and then we had a whole

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019
thing to do and then we had a whole
 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.390
thing to do and then we had a whole
protocol for what to do if we were

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400
protocol for what to do if we were
 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.490
protocol for what to do if we were
boarded because we had women on board

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500
boarded because we had women on board
 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.070
boarded because we had women on board
and so one of the things that the

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080
and so one of the things that the
 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.870
and so one of the things that the
captain was really concerned about was

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880
captain was really concerned about was
 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.090
captain was really concerned about was
you know what might happen and so we had

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100
you know what might happen and so we had
 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.130
you know what might happen and so we had
this whole plan to lock certain people

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140
this whole plan to lock certain people
 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.110
this whole plan to lock certain people
up in the chain Locker and you know it

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120
up in the chain Locker and you know it
 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.170
up in the chain Locker and you know it
was really it was really pretty

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180
was really it was really pretty
 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.610
was really it was really pretty
nerve-wracking for a lot for a lot of

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620
nerve-wracking for a lot for a lot of
 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.190
nerve-wracking for a lot for a lot of
people the side story to this paper is

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200
people the side story to this paper is
 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.520
people the side story to this paper is
that we got a we developed this record

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530
that we got a we developed this record
 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.910
that we got a we developed this record
from a place where it's just impossible

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920
from a place where it's just impossible
 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.770
from a place where it's just impossible
to do science now and that's I think one

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
to do science now and that's I think one
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.699
to do science now and that's I think one
of the side stories who this whole

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709
of the side stories who this whole
 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.840
of the side stories who this whole
geopolitical conflict period is that

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850
geopolitical conflict period is that
 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.819
geopolitical conflict period is that
there's a whole section of the world

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829
there's a whole section of the world
 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.340
there's a whole section of the world
that we can't do science in and it's not

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350
that we can't do science in and it's not
 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.930
that we can't do science in and it's not
because the science isn't fascinating

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940
because the science isn't fascinating
 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.370
because the science isn't fascinating
and interesting it's just because it's

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380
and interesting it's just because it's
 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.759
