VKORC1 is really important in the pharmacodynamic processes

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.800
of Warfarin. So let's learn a bit more

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.470
about how we go from gene to protein.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.760
VKORC1 can be found on chromosome 16 of the

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.230
human genome. Chromosome 16 is about 90 million

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.490
base pairs long. And the VKORC1 gene can be

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.370
found about 1 3rd of the way down

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.489
the chromosome. The gene itself contains three exons spanning

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.730
more that 4,000 base pairs of DNA.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.890
After transcription and splicing, the resulting mRNA has

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.610
492 nucleotides of coding region between the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.080
start and stop codons. And after translation, you

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.090
end with the protein with 163 amino acids. Now there is one allele of the

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.730
VKRC1 gene that's associated with enhanced warfarin efficacy

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.670
but the mutation isn't in the coding region

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.350
of VKRC1. It's in the non-coding region. About 1600 base pairs in front of

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.860
the start of transcription. So based on

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.700
what you know about saturation, if the mutant

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.020
allele increases warfarin efficacy What do you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.750
think the net effect of that mutant allele

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.470
is on VKRC1 transcription? Do you think

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.680
it increased the transcription or decreased the transcription?

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.560
Remember that Warfarin binds and inhibits

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.040
VKORC1 which normally promotes blood clotting.
