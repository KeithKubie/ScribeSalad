00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, here's my solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I define deal. It takes the number of hands and the number of cards in each hand.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And then I've also added in an optional parameter

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
to make the function a little bit more general.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Here I built up a normal poker deck

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
with the 13 different ranks and 4 different suits.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I have a list comprehension that goes over both of them

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and makes a 52-card deck.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But I provide that as a parameter because you might want to

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
deal different types of decks.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In other games like pinochle, you have a different number of cards.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I just want to make deal a little bit more general, so I provide that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
as an optional parameter.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Then I randomly shuffle the deck,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and if you looked up in the random module, you see there is a function called shuffle.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's the one you want.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And then I go through, and for the number of hands

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I take a slice out of the deck which has been shuffled

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and accumulate that into the result list.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now, let's look a little bit more carefully at exactly

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
what this expression here means, pulling out this slice.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I've got a deck of cards which have been shuffled,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
so they're not in any particular order.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Say the 3 of clubs is first, and then the 7 of spades, and so on.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And now I want to pull out this slice out of the deck,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
which is defined as the deck starting at n x i

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and going up to n x (i + 1).

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And we'll assume for now that n = 5.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
When i = 0, then this will go from 0 to 5.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And we'll pull out the first 5 cards, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
That slice will be the first element that we'll pull out.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Now when i is equal to 1, we're dealing to the second player,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and 5 x 1 is 5, 5 x 1 + 1 is 10,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and we'll pull out the next 5 cards.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We'll keep on going until we get numhands different cards and return them in a list.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now let's just make sure this works.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Let's print, and let's just deal out 2 hands.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And there we see we get 2 hands back.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
There are 2 total hands, and each of them has 5 cards.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
If we wanted to, we could deal different numbers of cards,

00:02:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
so here we deal 2 hands, and they each have 7 cards.
