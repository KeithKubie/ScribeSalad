GONZALO RODRIGUEZ:
Since I was a child,

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.360
I always wanted to
create something

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.890
that creates an impact
on millions of people.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.810
And with the use of technology,
we see that possible.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.270
We can create great games that
reach and help kids be smarter

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.650
and grow stronger every day.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.450
We are a small team that have
been working in the gaming

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.380
industry for the past 10 years.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.690
Our vision was to be a global
company since we started.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.980
The idea of the first app came
about when my niece asked me

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.950
for a new animal sounds
app, and everything

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.290
out there in the market was
full of ads. [? Shall ?]

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.030
we [INAUDIBLE] that let's
try to build our own animal

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.580
sounds app, one
with no advertising.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.270
And when we launched
it, we started

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.390
to have thousands of
downloads every day.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.390
For the first hour we launched,
it was only in three languages

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.280
by then.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.620
We saw in Google Analytics that
people from all over the world

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.760
were using the app.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.810
We said, OK, let's do it in
as many languages as we can.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.690
We are a team of four
here in Argentina

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.653
that is creating the
initial part of the project.

00:01:02.653 --> 00:01:04.069
We knew from the
beginning that we

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.330
had to build a very
big and strong team.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.120
We started to hire people
from all over the world

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.070
to collaborate with us
in voiceover, language

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.600
translator, and editors.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.860
In about two months, we released
the app in 15 languages,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.920
and we increased our downloads
by 300% in only 12 months.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.980
In order to go global,
you have to figure out

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.170
all the cultural aspects.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.040
In our product called "Animal
Sounds," we have our pig.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.020
And in some specific
countries, our users

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.170
were requesting us to remove
their animal from the game.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.040
After removing the animal
from those specific countries,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.500
our average rating changed
from 3.9 to 4.2 stars,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.379
and the results for
us were just amazing.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:54.920
SPEAKER 2: Ratings
and review section

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.480
is a powerful tool
in order to learn

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.040
from your community of users.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.280
We are answering to them in
their user native language

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.130
with the help of the
Google Translator.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.940
As a result, we have
seen a great improvement

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.039
in terms of user ratings.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.660
In fact, all of
them are 4.4 stars

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.414
or even higher on average.

00:02:15.414 --> 00:02:17.830
GONZALO RODRIGUEZ: Having our
apps in the Google PlayStore

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.700
is great for us.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.850
We can reach millions
of people every month

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.310
in different countries and
in different languages.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.650
Recently we have been
working on localizing.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.260
Also, the pricing
is super-important.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.250
Since we did it, we saw a
20% increase in our revenue.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.280
SPEAKER 2: We
understand that Papumba

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.550
is like a bridge that can
connect kids, parents,

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.880
and teachers.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.450
All of our products
are conceived

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.810
with the idea of empowering
our little users,

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.140
and it is so exciting to
create a mobile product

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.030
that you know will have an
impact in so many families

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.430
and houses from
all over the world,

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.810
In order to prepare future
adults in the best way

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.360
possible.
