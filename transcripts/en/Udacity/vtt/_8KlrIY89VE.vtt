00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When I'm starting from exp, I can use any of these 3 rules,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
so in particular I could use the third one and just replace exp with number,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so number is definitely in the language of the grammar.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's one of the strings that I can derive.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Unfortunately, - number is not.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
There's no way to get a minus sign without an exp before it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If we take a look at all 3 of our rules, the minus sign only appears once,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and there's something before it, so this isn't going to happen.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Over here, number + number + number,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
it looks pretty big, but I could get it by applying this first rewrite rule twice

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and then turning each one of these expressions into numbers.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I've drawn it in kind of this tree format.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We will see more on that in a minute, but for now, just imagine I did this

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
because I ran out of space in the corner.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Poor planning on my part.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Similarly, we could get number - number + number

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
just by getting a minus sign here instead, using rule 2 and rule 1 in combination.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Over here, there's no way to get number next to number.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Whenever we get multiple expressions on the right-hand side,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
they're always separated by a terminal.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This can't happen, so just to review,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
this uses rule 1, rule 2, and rule 3 three times.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This is rule 1. That's rule 2.

00:01:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That's rule 3 three times in order to derive this string.
