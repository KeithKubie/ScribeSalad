00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.160
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, DC.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.860
&gt;&gt; Al Banks: So my
name is Al Banks,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.080
and I'm the Chief Operating
Officer for Library Services

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.270
and so I'd like to welcome you
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.620
On behalf of the Librarian
of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.650
and our entire team, I'd like
to welcome you and thank you

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.580
for choosing to today's Gold
Star Legacy Panel Discussion.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.810
The Veterans History Project is
one of the most popular projects

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.540
at the Library of
Congress, and is considered

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.170
on of the largest oral history
projects in the country.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.480
Through a Congressional
Mandate to collect,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.870
preserve and make accessible.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.230
The memories of our nation's
veterans we hear directly

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.290
from them what they
saw, felt and heard.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.540
The human experience
of military service.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.990
These first hand narratives
reinforced the realities

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.700
of their selfless service

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.860
so that we all better
understand and appreciate them.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.740
When the Gold Star
Families Voices Act

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.430
of 2016 amended the Veterans
History Project legislation its

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.870
scope expanded to
include oral histories

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.800
from immediate family
members of the armed forces

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.370
who became missing in action
or who died as a result

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.580
of their wartime service.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.460
This revision reinforces our
dedication to making sure

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.510
that all military
veterans are not forgotten,

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.380
but instead are heard,
appreciated and remembered

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.420
with a lasting, living legacy.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.290
Through our work with the
Gold Start individuals

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.740
and organizations, some
of whom are here today,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.950
we are able to demonstrate
to these families

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.270
and the American people that
the legacy of these heroes is

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.210
in the memory of
a grateful nation.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.470
This Sunday marks Gold Star
Mothers and Families Day

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.050
which is observed in the
US on the last Sunday

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.530
of September each year.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.480
We are pleased to
commemorate this day

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.150
with this landmark
panel discussion.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.990
In a few moments you will
hear from the leaders

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.050
of Gold Star organizations
and individuals

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.430
who will explore ways that
families, organizations

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.500
and communities are
currently working to honor

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.130
and preserve the legacy
of our fallen members

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.360
of our service members.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.780
They will also highlight ways

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.700
in which we all can support
families of the fallen,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.940
and ensure their loved ones
are honored and remember,

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.320
and remembered in
a suitable way.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.890
At this time, I'm delighted

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.550
to introduce today's Gold
Star Legacy panel moderator.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.710
Emmy Award Winning News
Correspondent Mr. Mort Dean.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.740
As a correspondent of CBS News
20 years ago, and with ABC

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.120
for 14 years, his many
assignments includes the US

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.850
space program, political
campaigns and the Vietnam War.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.600
Putting himself in harm's
way, Mr. Dean reported

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.200
on the invasion of Grenada,
the [inaudible] War,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.810
and Cuba from the early days

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.580
of the Castro regime
through the present.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.210
He reported on Iran
when the hostage crisis

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.400
from Somalia during
the US intervention,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.800
the turmoil in Israel and
the Palestinian territory

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.440
and the military action in
Kosovo involving US marines.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.000
He covered Saddam Hussain's
Iraq, the NATO air attacks

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.500
in Belgrade, the terror attack
on the USS Cole in Yemen,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.090
the bombing of the US embassy in
Nairobi, and the US retaliation

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.130
in Sudan as well as the first
terrorist terrorists attacks

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.960
on the World Trade
Center in 1993.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.170
With his more recent endeavors,
Mr. Dean has written, directed

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.910
and produced a PBS
documentary, American Medivac.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.650
The documentary tells the story
of a harrowing medivac mission

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.530
to rescue three wounded soldiers
from enemy fire in a rice patty.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.310
Mr. Dean long wondered what
had become of the medivac troop

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.260
and the bloody men
who were airlifted

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.940
to safety on that day in 1971.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.950
American Medivac is a story

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.630
of their reunion more
than 40 years later.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.510
It is my pleasure to welcome
and introduce Mr. Mort Dean.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:57.440
[ Applause ]

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.130
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: That was so long,
that introduction that you,

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.260
you probably think I wrote
it, but I had nothing to do,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.610
to do with is, and I have to
say given the current attitude

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.400
in among some people,
including the Commander in Chief

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.360
about reporters, I think
it's very gutsy of you all

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.660
to have me here today.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.380
And, and if any of you
are still on active duty,

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.290
I wonder what this is going to
mean to you and your future.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.370
I'm very honored to be here
and to be in your company

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.350
and thank you Library
of Congress for caring

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.080
about America, for caring
about Gold Star families,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.070
and thank you New Day USA for
caring about America and caring

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.410
about Gold Star families.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.880
Anyone who knows a Gold
Star family is well aware

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.870
that Gold Star mothers
and fathers and brothers

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.590
and sisters, Gold Star
families often wear a gold star,

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.200
but they also carry a
gold star in their hearts.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.440
And I believe it's the duty
of all Americans to reach

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.580
into those hearts, to
touch those gold stars,

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.710
to embrace them with
our love and respect.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.340
And to polish them
up a little bit

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.680
and make them a little
less burdensome to carry.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.960
And show that we too,
the civilians care.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.170
That we too will
never, ever forget.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.240
That's why I'm here and that's
why New Day USA is here,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.800
and has brought many
of us together today.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.930
It's why others of you are
here also to say to those

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.880
who carry a gold
star in their hearts

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.070
that you are not alone today,
and you will never be alone,

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.120
and America truly
cares about you.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.420
We're going to hear more
about that from our panel

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.350
in just a moment
about what the they

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.520
and their organizations are
doing for Gold Star families

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.290
and what we and our
government needs to do.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.600
I was at an event, a meeting
in Washington just a couple

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.390
of weeks ago, and the
discussion did get

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.580
around to Gold Star families.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.370
It was a meeting of the Vietnam
War Commemoration Commission,

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.080
Steering Committee.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.330
And we were talking about
Gold Stars and families

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.640
and the activities
that are taking place

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.840
in Washington this
coming weekend.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.260
And an old soldier, a
former, a current medal

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.640
of honor recipient
said that he was

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.860
in a gold star family
event just a couple

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.470
of years ago here in Washington.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.670
And he raised the question,
he said how many members

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.660
of Congress are out there?

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.510
Nobody. How many members

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.280
of a Congressional
office are out there?

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.870
Nobody. And he turned to the
crowd the other day and said,

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.100
this is one of the jobs we
have to do to convince people

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.780
in the highest offices of our
country that there are people

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.970
out there who deserve
the government's care

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.600
and respect and honor.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.010
So let me introduce the people
on the panel, Jenine Melton,

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:14.890
US Army Veteran, two tours in
Iraq and a Gold Star sister.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.840
What does the term
Gold Star mean to you?

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.850
&gt;&gt; Jenine Melton: When I
think of the term Gold Star,

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:25.390
to me it symbolizes sacrifice,
the ultimate sacrifice

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:29.060
that our fallen heroes made
to preserve our freedom.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.920
So every time I look at the
gold star, it reminds me

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.200
that freedom is not free.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.010
There is a fallen hero that
made the ultimate sacrifice,

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.720
and then there is a
family that's associated

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.320
with every single star.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.270
So when you see the service
flag hanging in a window,

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.240
or a magnet on the back

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.700
of somebody's car there's
a story behind every star,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.710
a story of pain, a story of
sacrifice and a story ultimately

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.100
of love and we should
never forget that.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.020
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Yeah my
understanding is what I said is

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.910
that when you mentioned
Gold Star to,

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.550
to many people they don't know
what you're talking about,

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.480
it's not the way it was
when I was a kid growing up,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.370
just after World War
II when you would go

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.790
through the neighborhood
and see gold stars hanging

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.150
in the windows of
so many families.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.670
Have you found that true?

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.250
&gt;&gt; Jenine Melton: Yes
I was actually amazed.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.500
Coming from active duty, prior
to the passing of my brother,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.460
I did not know and there
were actually some chaplains

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.800
that I had met when
I was on active duty

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.340
and separated that did not know.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.590
So right now, and I find it
to be my personal mission

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.530
to make people aware of that.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.640
To let them know about the
sacrifice associated with that.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.610
Even currently I'm a
civil servant working

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.170
with the Department
of Veteran Affairs

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.900
and they've been really trying
to do more with initiatives

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.130
with veterans and even talking
about Gold Star families,

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.160
but really a lot of
people do not know,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.640
which is why I'm glad we
have platforms like this

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.120
to promote awareness
and make people aware

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.310
of our family sacrifices
and our heroes.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.310
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Becky
Christmas is President

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.420
of the American Gold
Star Mothers, Inc.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.750
And I read something about
when you were named president,

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.920
and you said in your,
your thank you speech,

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.520
we are mothers on a mission.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.980
What is your mission?

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.030
&gt;&gt; Becky Christmas: The mission
of American Gold Star Mothers,

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.740
Incorporated, is to serve
and support veterans

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.590
and the families of the fallen
and our active military.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:42.580
We are a veteran service
organization, 90 years old.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.860
It was started in 1928
by a Gold Star mother

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.750
who lost her son in World War I.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.050
And that is our mission.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:55.070
And so our theme this year
is Mothers On A Mission,

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.030
A Powerful Force,
because we do have a voice

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.820
that people will listen to.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.960
And it's important, because
we can speak for some

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.660
of our veterans that aren't able
to, and some of our families

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.790
that aren't able to, and
that is, that is what we do

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:16.050
to take our grief, serve in a
positive way, because grief held

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.930
within can be destructive.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.910
So we learned that and we feel
that service is our mission.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.350
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: And Becky
you really know what you're

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.650
talking about.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.330
Your son served in Iraq.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.630
&gt;&gt; Becky Christmas: Yes.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:29.930
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Tell us about him.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.320
&gt;&gt; Becky Christmas: My son
was Captain Todd Christmas.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.070
Todd was very proud
to serve in the army.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.400
That was all he ever
wanted to do.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.130
And he hoped to have
a long career.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:44.070
He was deployed to Iraq in 2003,

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.680
and he was the recipient
of a bronze star.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.890
He was a ranch boy
from New Mexico

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.110
who could be quite
innovative with things

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.650
that maybe they didn't have
or things they needed to do,

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.290
and he was determined to
do those kinds of things

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.710
that needed to be done,
to help with his mission.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:10.750
So he returned in late, in early
2004, from Iraq, and was chosen

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.610
to be an Aid to General Ben
Allen at Fort Hood, Texas.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.790
And unfortunately the
money after Thanksgiving,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.390
there were seven
on a helicopter,

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.290
including General Allen and
Colonel Jim Moore and they were,

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.100
they hit a communication
tower outside of Fort Hood

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.700
in heavy fog, and all perished.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:33.590
But we were blessed to have a
close relationship with our son.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.450
And he loved his job.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:39.020
He told me every day when
he got up to go to work,

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.340
he loved what he was doing.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.810
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Thank you Becky.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.700
General William Caldwell,

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.340
to mention where General
Caldwell has been during a long

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.200
and illustrious career in the US
military would take probably the

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.560
rest of this afternoon
and we'd have

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.610
to serve drinks this
evening and just continue,

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.120
not a bad idea by the way.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.300
Currently he is the President of
Georgia Military Prep College.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.180
He has helped facilitate
the awarding

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:13.150
of New Day USA scholarships to
children of Gold Star families

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.970
and children of disabled
veterans.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:21.440
General how important is it for
a family to learn as so many

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.740
of your students have learned

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.530
from having received
scholarships from New Day USA,

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.390
how it, important is it for them
to know that there are people

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.130
out there that they don't
even know who really care

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.450
about who they are and
what they've been through?

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.220
&gt;&gt; Lt. Gen. William B.
Caldwell: Well Mort thanks.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.260
I, I'm glad we didn't go
through my, my history.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.110
I wasn't sure if you were
just saying that I'm older

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.410
than you or not though.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.640
I do want to say it really is
important for us to remember.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.780
Everybody up here will tell you

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.690
that we don't want
to ever forget.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.210
I feel very blessed today that
I've been able to be a part

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:01.160
of a life of the young
lady there, Carolyn Wood,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.270
who lost her father,
and she's at our school.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.760
She's attending there.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.060
We've got some other kids

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.650
who are also Gold Star family
children that are at our school,

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:15.770
and we're incredibly blessed in
our ability to remember them,

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.710
that we hold a ceremony
every 9-11 and during

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.380
that ceremony we lay a wreath.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.170
And it's done in remembrance of
those who lost their fathers,

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.380
mothers, brothers, sisters.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.920
In our case its two fathers
and four young children

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.770
that are there that we go out
and do this lay the wreath.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:36.600
We're in military uniforms
at this preparatory school,

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.550
the fourth through 12th grade.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:42.700
But what makes it really
special today for us is the fact

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.660
that New Day stepped forward.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.520
Rob Posner stepped
forward and said I,

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.160
I want to help these
families and I know

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.450
that you charge a
tuition to go there.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.290
It's like a charter school.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.440
And I want to relieve
their parents, their mother

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.390
or their father,
whomever is raising them

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:04.080
of all financial burden
to attend that school.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.780
And we've been just
enormously blessed,

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.350
and that he's now
been doing that.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:09.980
His company has, New Day has.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.940
And it makes an enormous
difference on those families

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.090
when there are other
Americans who recognize

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.290
that the sacrifice is enduring,
it's not a one-time sacrifice,

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.920
it's a, it's a life
commitment that somebody made

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.490
to our nation for others.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.400
And the fact that
New Day has done

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.140
that is making a
remarkable difference

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.440
in our little community there
in Milledgeville, Georgia.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.060
At that ceremony I'll share.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.800
We just started a fourth
and fifth grade this year.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.450
We added on to this
preparatory school we have.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.880
And it's all day
students, about 700.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.590
And I was chatting with some of
the fourth graders last week.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.780
And I asked them, I said what's
the one thing you've really

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.890
enjoyed so far being a part
of this preparatory school.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.330
This little fourth grade
gal raises her hand.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:03.010
She goes, I learned what
it means to do something

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.470
for somebody else
and give your life.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.810
I've never been taught
that before.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.110
And I said well what
do you mean?

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.820
She goes, well that 9-11
thing that you all did.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.870
She said, when we came out there
and listened to the stories,

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.960
and heard of people doing
something for somebody else

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.510
by giving their life,

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.110
we realized that there are some
great Americans around here.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.700
And this is coming out of
the mouth of a fourth grader.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:32.200
And so I just, I, I think
we all, as a nation,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.890
need to constantly remind
ourselves just how blessed we

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.650
are by having men
and women, you know,

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.680
who will serve their
nation like they have

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.510
and to therefore
remember their families

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.440
continuously thereafter.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.740
But anyway, so--

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.040
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Thank you General.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.020
And while I, I visited the
college and met the General,

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.510
last year I guess it was.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.740
And not all that long ago.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.650
And he was dressed in
his full dress uniform.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.260
And he was walking through
the corridor and I thought,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.680
oh this is going
to be interesting,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.320
all of the students are going
to shrink back and they're going

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.570
to be frightened
by his presence.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:13.070
But it was just the opposite.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.410
And it just struck me that
given the proper introduction

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:23.110
to people in uniform, being
told what the uniform means,

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:27.140
really does change their--
the attitude of young people

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.670
so that they respect people
in uniform, and they think

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:36.130
of them not as some obscure
people, but as friends,

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:40.990
people who care about them
and they in turn end up caring

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:42.570
about people like yourself.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:47.620
Bonnie Carroll, a veteran,
Founder and President of TAPS,

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.750
Tragedy Assistance
Programs for Survivors.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.870
Recipient of the
Presidential Medal of Freedom,

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.650
which is not-- it's a big deal.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:00.430
A Gold Star spouse.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.220
Tell us a little bit about TAPS.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:07.340
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Carroll: Well in
1992 my husband was killed

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.970
in an army plane crash along
with seven other soldiers.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:16.290
And like Becky, and her son,
my husband was a combat veteran

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.070
and a recipient of the Bronze
Star and the Air Medal.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.740
We certainly did not expect

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.990
that his career would
end in that way.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.310
So I immediately went looking
for the kind of the support

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.320
that I knew had to
exist for other types

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.230
of loss of our society.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.170
Immediately became a life
member of Gold Star Wives.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.290
And worked with the
Department of Veterans Affairs,

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:40.440
the Department of Defense to
identify any gaps that existed.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.380
The support that I found in
Gold Star Wives and talking

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.890
with other organizations
was fantastic,

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:51.770
but what was most valuable
was the peer connection,

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:55.310
being with others
who truly understood

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.890
in a very personal way
because they were also walking

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.940
this journey.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.160
Back in the early '90s there was
no organization in partnership

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.020
with Gold Star Wives,
Gold Star Mothers,

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:09.710
Society of Military Widows
to address some of the nuts

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.010
and bolts, the casework
assistance,

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.830
the peer based emotional
support and grief counseling.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:20.230
A 24/7 help line that
could be maintained

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.390
by trained peer mentors.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:23.690
Connections to free

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.750
and unlimited clinical
grief counseling,

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.680
if additional support
was required.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:34.510
So in 1994, TAPS was launched
and immediately was embraced

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:37.610
by the Defense Department
as a wonderful compliment

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.880
to the other organizations and
to what the government could do.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.960
Today General Dempsey, former
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs,

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.260
is on our Board of Directors.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.840
And he puts it beautifully.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.540
He says, the government
does a magnificent job

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.040
of administering benefit's,

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.070
and rendering final
honors when a death occurs.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.020
We honor all those who
have given their lives

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.320
for this country.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.050
But what we can't do in
the military is be there

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.850
for the emotional support,

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.800
for the additional financial
assistance, for the connections

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.730
to the educational
benefits that are offered

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:16.500
in the private sector, for the
24/7 resource that is given

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.960
by peers who truly understand.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.680
So we've had the support
since the very early days

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.870
of every chairman who has
directed the families,

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.280
or referred and connected to
the support that TAPS can offer.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.230
And it is a family,
it's a family of all

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:38.820
of us Gold Star Wives, Gold
Star mothers, siblings, dads,

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.620
together on this
journey honoring those

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.440
who have served and died.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.740
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Thank you.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.040
And I hope we'll all
participate later

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:55.490
on in discussing what more we
can all do to show that we care

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:59.140
and how we, what we can
do to energize others,

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.550
especially people in
the halls of Congress,

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.560
and in official Washington
to realize

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.980
that they do have a
lot more to accomplish.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.280
Dale Egan is Vice President

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.060
of the Hershel Woody
Williams Foundation.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.910
And their memorials are all

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:19.820
around the country
honoring those

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.050
who have given their
lives to our country.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.560
You've, you've erected
many, many memorials

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.380
around the country, what purpose
do you think they really serve?

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.680
&gt;&gt; Chad Graham: That's
a good question.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.980
I subbed out Dale today.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.640
Dale wasn't able
to make it, so I--

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.940
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Oh--

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.240
&gt;&gt; Chad Graham: I'm
Chad, Chad Graham,

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.540
President of Hershel Woody
Williams Foundation--

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.840
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: No, nobody--

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.140
&gt;&gt; Chad Graham: You
expected Dale,

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.440
but you didn't get him, so--

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.810
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: And I'm
not really Mort Dean,

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:47.500
I am just-- I'm just--

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.290
&gt;&gt; Chad Graham: No that's fine,
I just didn't want them to think

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.990
that Dale was this
ugly, so you know.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:57.770
No but I am, I am, I am honored
to be here and, and that's,

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.070
that's a great question.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:03.920
And I think the best answer that
I can offer is what I've heard

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.430
from these Gold Star families
that are sitting up here,

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.570
and the Gold Star
families that are out here.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:12.750
And, and that sacrifice, and
what that monument means.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:17.250
In terms of, of going into these
communities, so many communities

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.480
as you started out with, they,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.750
they don't know what
a Gold Star family is.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:25.320
And we have a duty, as
you said, to, to everyone

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.620
and the general public.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.390
We need to lead this movement
to put that on the forefront.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.010
And within our communities,
every community needs to realize

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.190
that there are Gold Star
families living amongst them.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.860
And that the reason they
can have the community,

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.970
and the reason that we can live
the lives that we've had is

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.240
because somebody else laid
down their life for it and paid

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.920
that ultimate sacrifice.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.520
And what our hope is that
these monuments act as a way,

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.060
a gathering place for that,
something that can serve

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.170
as a launch pad for Gold Star
mothers, Gold Star wives,

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.140
Gold Star siblings, Gold Star
children for all those folks

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.350
to gather, because it is
for them, and it is theirs

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.170
to use as they see fit.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.140
And from the public side
they, they get an education

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.300
about what, what is a Gold Star
family, and what does that mean

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.440
and hopefully that, that grows.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.340
And we can be a small part of
that and be a catalyst for that.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.160
And our hope is that each
one of these monuments now

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.270
that we have 40 by the end of
the year we'll have about 50

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.680
that have been established
across the United States,

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.760
that those serve as,
as a starting point.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.680
Those monuments are
there as a way that,

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.980
that we can gather
these Gold Star families

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.460
and also keep it fresh
on the communities mind,

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.560
because as we've all heard,
it is so, so important for us

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.670
to say every day, those loved
ones names who have fallen.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.660
And the only way we can keep
that in the public eye is

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.930
to have something
that is permanent,

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.610
and something there
that's in the public view.

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:46.910
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: That's good.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.630
So whatever your name really is,

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:53.440
but why did you get
involved in, in this project?

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.080
&gt;&gt; Chad Graham: Our family
kind of came together in 2010.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.800
We were getting to, to
celebrate our fifth birthday

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.360
as an organization.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.880
But about 2010, and we're really
talking about the, the influence

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.580
of my grandfather,
Woody Williams, who,

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.130
whose the namesake
of, of the foundation.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.990
At a young age, when he tried

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.290
to enter the Marine
Corps he was turned

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:15.870
down because they had
a height requirement

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.840
that he did not fit at the time.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.500
His, in the interim between them
lowering the height requirement.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.060
He was actually delivering
Western Union telegrams

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.920
to families, that was
a notice of death.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.870
And my grandfather, that had
such a huge impact on him.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.310
And I remember from the time
I was a little guy we used

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.610
to show horses together.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:37.910
And we'd be riding
around the countryside

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.210
and he would tell
me these stories.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:40.960
Because it was always
something that he taught us.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.200
He taught us that leadership
is service, and that service

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.890
above self there is nothing
more righteous on this planet

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.490
that any of us can do.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.430
And that was always a part
of the fabric of our family.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.980
When we started talking about
formalizing a foundation,

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.550
none of us had any idea.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.360
We definitely didn't,
didn't have the funding

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.660
to start a foundation.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.680
We didn't really
have that direction.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.020
I think divine intervention
had a hand in it,

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:08.310
and I think the biggest thing
is, is our, our duty is,

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.640
is to do what we're doing.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.440
And so for me, as, as a family
member, outside of that a,

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.740
a few years back when we,

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.450
we really started
formalizing the organization,

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:24.090
I saw it personally as, as
something of a calling to me.

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.900
It's part of my personal mission
and, and it's very important

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.260
to all of us in the
organization.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.310
I think we're very,
very fortunate

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:32.600
that everybody involved shares

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.050
in that personal
commitment to our mission.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:36.350
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Good, good.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:37.650
Thank you.

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:40.130
And I know some of you have some
questions and some comments,

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:44.570
and I hope you all participate,
just raise your hand

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.210
and we'll be able to hear you.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.690
If not, a microphone
will be at your side.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:53.470
Rob you start.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.820
&gt;&gt; Rob: [Inaudible]
it's an honor for us

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.770
to be here today at New Day.

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:04.050
It's an honor for us to
be here in New Day USA,

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:08.250
and be supportive of, of
the Gold Star families.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:13.500
And I guess a question
that I would have is,

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.760
what could companies like
New Day and the community

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.300
to do more, to help
more Gold Star families?

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:25.910
Because I think that [inaudible]
General Caldwell this,

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:29.480
this school that he has, at
Georgia Military College,

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:35.210
it's really an amazing, an
amazing place to raise children.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:39.410
And I think that any child
that's a son or daughter

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:42.060
of a Gold Star family, it
would just be incredible

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.400
if we could be helping
more Gold Star families.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:49.360
In terms of, if we're on the
phone, the Admiral Tyler Lynch,

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.630
our Chairman and
myself are on the phone

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.170
with many Gold Star families.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:27:01.620
And you know, we, we have some
understanding of, of the pain

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.770
and sacrifice just from our
conversations that we have

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:07.240
with Gold Star families.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.260
And one of the things
that we see is

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.590
that if we can help the children
of these Gold Star families be

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.110
in the right environment for
high school, it's not a question

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.410
of college, because a lot

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.220
of these Gold Star children
never get to college.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:25.240
And if we can get them
a boost and a step up,

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.570
in terms of getting them
the right education,

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.560
then more, very positive.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.540
So what can we do to find
more Gold Star families,

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.780
help more Gold Star children,
and what can the community do,

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:43.180
not just obviously New
Day, to, to help educate?

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.630
I think the education is the
greatest gift we can give

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:49.310
in terms of healing for
these Gold Star families,

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:50.610
but thank you Mort.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:51.910
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Yeah thank you.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:53.210
Go ahead.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:54.510
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Carroll:
Thank you so much Rob,

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:55.810
thank you for everything
that New Day does.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:28:00.820
And thank you for being here,
and you're absolutely right.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:04.600
The children of America's fallen
heroes have been given federal

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.580
benefits through the
Department of Veterans Affairs

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.610
to expand the GI bill,
the Frye Scholarship.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:12.020
There are also state
waivers of fees and tuition

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:15.470
and private scholarships
and programs like yours.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.060
It's absolutely essential

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.610
that we let the families
know in an organized way.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.780
I work very closely with
all of our partner VSOs

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.490
and military service
organizations.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.800
And through TAPS we
have an education portal

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.010
that families can go in, log
in, and get a list of everything

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:35.490
that they're available,
that they're eligible for.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:38.710
And then we help them
work through that

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.480
so that they can figure
out what's the right way

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.000
to structure their
benefit's to meet their goals,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.050
their educational goals.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.220
I appreciate we, we've
worked with you all

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:52.260
and it's good to
see you again sir.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:57.280
And it is absolutely essential
that we get the benefit's

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.180
and the resources
that are available

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.580
to the families to them.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.670
That's one of the goals
that the TAPS has.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:07.710
So it's at TAPS.org,
the education portal.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.230
And we've got to reach
every Gold Star family

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.520
and let them know that
there is support available

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.920
and there are resources

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.760
for education services,
absolutely essential.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.060
So thank you.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.430
&gt;&gt; Becky Christmas: I'd
like to add to that also.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:28.300
I think that can also reach out
to all the other organizations

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.120
in addition to TAPS, but
Gold Star Wives of America,

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.390
American Gold Star Mothers,
because we do have services

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:40.160
that we provide for veterans and
we, we don't always have the,

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.850
the manpower or the way to
get all that information out.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.830
So we're volunteering in the
VA hospitals, and we see needs

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:48.670
for the veterans
in the hospitals.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.230
Clothing, maybe newspaper
subscriptions,

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.620
maybe laptops, things like that.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.950
We volunteer in the
clinics, in small communities

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:00.420
like where I come from.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.920
We, we go, we sit in the,
in the waiting room visiting

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.660
with veterans, and they'll
tell you their story,

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.730
and they will tell you what they
need or what their barriers are

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:15.530
that they're trying to
overcome, to get benefit's or,

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:19.160
or just everyday living
things that they need.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.400
And so we, we try to help them
with the sources they need,

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.720
or the direction
to go get those.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.800
But sometimes they don't
have a strong enough voice

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.730
as I was saying, to, so
we sometimes have to go

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:33.050
with them personally
to do those things.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:35.790
We also volunteer in VA centers

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:39.600
where of course a veteran is
going to come to find out,

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.550
you know, what benefit's
he might get,

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:44.180
or help get his paperwork
in order,

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.420
and we try to steer
them that way.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.490
But then we work with stand
down, homeless veterans.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:54.140
When you go to a stand down,
and you see the veterans

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.710
on the street and the fact
that they need a haircut,

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:00.950
they need a dental exam
and all of those things,

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:05.000
there are resources there
that, that we, we really need

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.460
to help those, those veterans.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.160
The families of the fallen,

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.420
sometimes when the
initial casualty officer is

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.310
with the families of, of
a family of the fallen,

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:20.270
and then they're gone, and maybe
they don't remain in contact,

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:22.990
a few-- for me I
know it was two years

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.460
down the road before I really
was ready to even talk about a,

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:30.440
an organization where I
could volunteer my services.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:34.830
So we need to, we need to make
sure those families maintain

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:38.230
that information and
know who to contact.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:39.740
And they don't always do that.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.750
They, they've lost the
paperwork, you know,

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.260
for if they're a wife.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.760
They, they, you know, they
may have children and they,

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.560
that's what they've had
to concentrate on and

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.160
yet they need something for
themselves, people to talk to.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.790
So maybe they need
an organization

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:57.680
like Gold Star wives or a mother
needs someone else to talk

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.480
to that's besides her
husband, you know about,

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.990
because they're sharing
that grief.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:06.850
So those, the information
about the organizations,

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:11.140
the actual physical work that
we need to do for our veterans,

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:16.040
those things are sources,
resources that we really need.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.340
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Yes ma'am.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:22.120
&gt;&gt; Mona Gun: I don't need a
mike I don't think I have a

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.980
loud voice.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.280
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: We
all need a mike.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:30.110
&gt;&gt; Mona Gun: I am Mona
Gun, I'm a Gold Star mom.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:35.480
And my son pre-9/11, one of
the sailors that was killed

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.630
on board the USS Cole, so I
appreciate what you've done

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:41.530
if you're reported
on that bombing.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:46.030
That pre-9/11 families
are sometimes left

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.810
out of many, many things.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:52.890
And my son was not married,
he was a single young many

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.530
who followed dad's footsteps.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:56.830
Went into the Navy

00:32:56.830 --> 00:33:00.110
and my husband had a 21 year
very successful Navy career

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:03.380
and my son, nine
months and he was gone.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.700
And our family was
torn apart, you know.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.210
I have three other sons.

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:12.750
My oldest son found a way
to deal with his grief.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:17.290
Sharom who was killed had
two younger brothers, twins.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:20.180
My boys were in college
during that time.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:23.840
There's very little out
there for siblings, and for,

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.640
for parents and families,

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:30.330
when there is a single
service member that is killed.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:34.370
Of course the VA, the Department
of Defense, are right there

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:39.620
for spouses and for the children
of fallen, but siblings there,

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.920
there was very little.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.300
My boys, to this
day, were in college

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.270
and have not finished
their degree.

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:50.280
Mom's got two degrees,
daddy got two degrees.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.850
So any kind of support that
you can give for siblings,

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:59.000
I don't know if you're aware
of any sibling programs

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.770
that will provide
college support will be

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:06.220
greatly appreciated.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.910
I have found-- I
found Gold Star Moms

00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:13.520
that helped me tremendously,
my oldest son did some things

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.840
to keep alive the
service of his brother.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.860
But my boys, the twins, to this
day are still dealing with,

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.550
and it will be 18 years for us.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:28.010
They were in college, so if you
know of any programs out there,

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:31.120
if you all know of any
programs or any things out there

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.050
that could support
siblings is critical.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:36.350
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Thank you.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:40.110
Is, is there a, a list or
somewhere where people can go

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.410
who have questions like that?

00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:42.710
&gt;&gt; Jenine Melton: Well we have
a sibling and it's very true,

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:45.150
because there were not a
lot of things out there.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:49.410
And since I've recently gotten
more involved into TAPS,

00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:52.530
I joined what's called
a Peer Mentor Program.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:55.000
And that's a program
where we do some training,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.460
and then they assign
you with a peer mentor

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.630
who has experienced
a similar loss.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.410
And it's essentially
a network of siblings

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:04.390
that support each other.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:08.800
We also have routine calls where
we have webcasts where we talk

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.150
and communicate with each
other, and support, and just try

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.740
to establish that outreach.

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.280
So I would say TAPS has
done an excellent job

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.920
in establishing that program.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.160
And then also they have other
programs within the summertime

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.940
where they have certain things
for siblings, for camps,

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.380
and other activities and
outreach things that you can do.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.270
And I know also with
the Maryland Chapter

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.910
of Gold Star Mothers, I've
gotten involved with some

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.940
of the other siblings
there trying to partner

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.830
and do other outreach
things that we can do

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.590
in honor of our fallen heroes.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.430
So that's one thing that I'm
really trying to make sure

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:43.080
that I try to lean forward
on and trying to get involved

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.090
with the TAPS program,
doing things

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:46.870
with the American
Gold Star Mothers.

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:49.820
And then even things
within our community to try

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.710
to bring more siblings in
because sometimes we do feel

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.200
like we have been forgotten.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.570
But I'm glad to see
that programs like TAP

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.490
and the American Gold
Star Mothers is starting

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.810
to wrap their arms
around the siblings

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.140
and saying we haven't
forgotten you, we love you

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.440
and we're here for you.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.320
So that's what I'm
personally trying to do.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.740
I'm making sure that I
make other siblings aware

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:12.510
of these programs to
support each other.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:13.810
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: That's great.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.110
Any? Yes sir.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:18.210
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yeah I
was in Long Beach,

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:22.460
California for the annual
meeting of the Mothers,

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:25.360
and one [inaudible] came out of

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:31.130
that there were 22 suicides
per day of veterans.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:33.930
I just want to make [inaudible]
a lot more [inaudible].

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.090
&gt;&gt; Becky Christmas: Thank you.

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:40.910
For the last two years
we have had a major focus

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:45.200
on military suicide
awareness because this is one

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:50.420
of those unspoken sort of
hidden in the back issues

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:57.210
that I think we as Americans
have overlooked for a long time.

00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:00.790
And so we started that
program last year,

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.780
and we have done quite
a lot to raise money

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.850
for Working Dogs for
Vets, especially.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.240
And so we've continued
that mission this year.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:14.510
And that mission is, is
going to go on because this,

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:17.600
this is a serious,
serious issue.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.860
Sometimes it's years after
one of our service men

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:24.330
or women have left the service

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:28.420
and years later they
die by suicide.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.420
So there are many programs,
many things that are out there

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:35.590
but we need to make people aware
of those, they need support.

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:40.530
And as I said, we have worked
with Working Dogs for Vets,

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:43.660
which is based in Tennessee
for the last two years.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:47.080
They've been quite successful
with service dogs for those

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:51.770
who have those tendencies,
suffer from TBI or PSD.

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:57.320
And so we are really focused on
this, and we are very serious

00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:02.170
about this, and we are trying
to make every American aware

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:04.570
to help with this issue.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:09.750
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Tell me if, if
you've had this experience.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:13.810
I, I think you probably
have had.

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:17.300
But in, in prepping
for this documentary

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.340
and a few other things that
I've, I've been working on,

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.450
I have found that often
when you go to a veteran,

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:26.290
or you make a cold call,
somebody you know who has been

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:29.870
in the service, and you say
look I'm working on something,

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:32.160
I want to talk to you
about your service.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.770
It's usually, well
thank you very much,

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:39.230
but I'm not interested, I, I
wish you good luck with it.

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:42.430
And I have found that,
that just saying thank you

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:45.710
for your service which to some
people is [inaudible] now,

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.190
is not enough.

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:52.670
That as a good friend of mine
who did duty in Vietnam has said

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:55.040
to crowds, said,
what we really want

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.940
to know is that you love us.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.570
That you really care about us.

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:02.280
Anybody can say thank
you, but you know,

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.010
ask me what's really going on.

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:08.960
And it's been amazing to me
how many people have responded

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:14.190
to that, and have said, well
call me back we'll talk.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:17.900
And you know we've made a
number of friends simply

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.010
by proving that we care.

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.530
Does that make sense
to you General?

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.260
&gt;&gt; Lt. Gen. William B. Caldwell:
I, I think it really does.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:31.040
I remember the first time we
did the welcome home ceremony

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.410
for our Vietnam veterans back
in 2000, it was right around 13

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:38.120
at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:42.270
And it was one of the first in
the nation that the veterans,

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:45.690
you know, group had
started talking about doing

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:46.990
through the Department
of Defense.

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:49.620
And we signed up and
said we'd love to do it.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.680
And I can tell you it
wasn't the ceremony itself,

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.870
it was the aftermath, it
was the reception area,

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:58.310
inside the quadrangle that you
saw the emotions just running

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:01.270
tremendously high with
everybody hugging each other.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:05.470
And young people, young soldiers
that were there going up

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:07.470
and hugging these
veterans and telling them,

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:09.280
thank you for what
you did during a time

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.830
when our nation really
was not very grateful

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:14.540
for your willingness to
sacrifice for others.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.550
And gosh it was, it
was a moving ceremony.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:20.730
I remember Joe [inaudible] came
out for it and he was there,

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:24.980
he was heading up that group
and it, it does if you,

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:28.550
if you spend the time to
really tell them how much,

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:32.480
it's not just the thank you for
what you did, but truly we, we,

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:38.200
we can feel it deep inside the
realization that you were ready

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:42.000
to make that sacrifice that
had been required, and,

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.900
and you're home now and
we just need to know

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.200
that we really do appreciate
it, appreciate them.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.480
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: There
are some of you

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.020
who have not raised your hand
so I'm going to just call.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.960
There you go, I knew
it would work.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.260
Go ahead.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.560
&gt;&gt; Audience: Thank you.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.170
I lost my son-in-law,
2005, Lieutenant,

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:04.470
First Lieutenant Charlie Owens

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:07.100
who was an electronic
warfare officer

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.600
and Special Operations
Squadron Seven

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.710
out of Mendenhall, England.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:15.420
And he was killed in a low
level night training mishap

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.240
in Albania.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:22.930
His oldest son was five, his
youngest son was six weeks old.

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:30.550
So but what I wanted to
say, on behalf of my family,

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.580
thank you for all that you do.

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:40.180
We have had so much
support from TAPS,

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.870
from Special Operations
Warrior Foundation,

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:49.130
from Gold Star Teen
Adventures, all of these things.

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:53.150
And it has meant so much
to us and so much to them

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.770
and so I just want
to say thank you.

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:59.230
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: And, and
that sense that you need,

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:02.340
that you need people it
never really ends doesn't it?

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.240
Don't you find that
you're still reaching

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.940
out to these organizations?

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.630
Yeah. Yes sir.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.440
&gt;&gt; Lt. Colonel Retired
Mike Salmons:

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.900
Lieutenant Colonel
Retired Mike Salmons

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.440
on staff here are the Library.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.520
Also a retired medivac pilot.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:22.640
I want to echo Bob's comments
about all that you have done.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.930
I have recently got involved

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:28.540
in the Travis Manion
Foundation out of Pennsylvania.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:32.330
Travis was a marine who lost
his life in Afghanistan.

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:35.210
And some of the Gold Star
families that are associated

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.120
with them have reeled
me in, if you will.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.440
And I can't get enough
of that foundation.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:45.210
So coincidence this Sunday
morning at dawn we will gather

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:49.150
with about 500 runners
and about 100 volunteers

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.860
and I will help put
on a road race

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.600
up in Baltimore for
that foundation.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:57.270
And it's-- we need to see it as
another resource of your work

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.600
in the community,
because not only do,

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.080
does this foundation bring
together Gold Star families,

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:05.240
but it also takes young
veterans and puts them back

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.500
out into the community to
teach courses on leadership

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.570
and integrity and courage and
it, it's, it's their action

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:14.030
out in the communities that
helps bring those goals

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.630
to our parents together,
and veterans.

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:21.020
So I am totally blown away with
their work, and I'm honored

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.750
to be a part of that effort.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:25.270
And a part of that
is probably resourced

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.150
to you also, thank you also.

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:28.450
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Thank you.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:29.750
Thank you.

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:31.050
Anybody else over-- ?

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:32.350
&gt;&gt; Becky Christmas: I
was just going to say--

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:33.650
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Go ahead.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:34.950
&gt;&gt; Becky Christmas:
Before we get off that.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:36.250
We have quite a few Gold
Star families that work

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:37.870
within the Travis
Manion Foundation.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:40.430
In fact we have a family
from New Mexico where I'm

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:43.700
from that work, he's
a contractor.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.300
He's a builder and he
works with them quite a lot

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:48.480
and I think they are
going to New York

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.870
for something to build houses.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:53.230
So that, that's a
great organization too.

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:57.110
And that's another
way to show patriotism

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:59.340
to young people for our country.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.740
And get them involved
hands on to

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:06.120
to do some positive
things to help others.

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.420
So I'm glad you brought
that one up.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.720
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: I'd
like to, go ahead.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.020
&gt;&gt; Janice Chance: If I could.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.580
&gt;&gt; Janice Chance: Hi,
I am Janice Chance,

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.890
and I'm the proud mother of
Captain Jessie Melton, III,

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:22.980
United States Marine Corps.

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:27.350
He served 11 years and he was
killed while supporting combat

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:31.550
operations in Afghanistan
on 9/9/2008.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:33.130
So this, a ten years,
was ten years for him,

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:35.670
and we celebrated his life.

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:39.590
But I've been a mess, and of
course this is my daughter,

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:43.880
Jenine Melton, Captain Jenine
Melton who, I had two serving

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.250
at the same time, so that
was truly a challenge.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:51.290
But I have seen that after
the passing of my son,

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:53.810
the death of my son,
who made that sacrifice.

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:56.430
It was interesting on the
day that he was killed,

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:59.130
he was not scheduled
to be on duty,

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:02.470
but another marine asked
him to take his place.

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:05.000
And he was killed along with
First Lieutenant McDroso,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.150
Mick McDroso [inaudible]
Strickland an

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:09.730
Afghan interpreter.

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:13.370
And two days later that
marine's baby was born on 9/11,

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:15.540
so a lot of good
things happen on 9/11,

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.840
plus it's my wedding
anniversary,

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.450
not that year, but that day.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:21.280
But one of the things
you were saying as far

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.580
as saying just thank you,

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.720
go beyond the thank
you's is serving

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.490
in the Gold Star Mother we honor
to service and I'm a member

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:30.490
of TAPS and the Travis Manion
Foundation, I do a lot of work.

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:32.260
As a matter of fact
Sunday I'll be speaking

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.520
at the opening ceremony
for that.

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:38.130
But it is, when you go
to that and I volunteer

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:41.240
at the VA Medical
Healthcare System, Walter Reed

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.220
and the Office of the
American Red Cross.

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:47.130
And so listening to
those veteran stories

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:48.570
and just go beyond a thank you

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.120
and doing something
constructive.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.780
So I encourage people
to volunteer,

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:55.630
put action behind that,
go up to them and say,

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:57.510
what do you need,
and begin to serve.

00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:59.410
Listening to them.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.860
You know I had a
Vietnam veteran.

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.960
One day I cam into the
office and he said,

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.430
you know I've never shared
my story about Vietnam.

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:10.580
And he said, but I feel today
that I can share that with you.

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:12.920
And so he did and
it was so special

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.890
and the Maryland Chapter we
decided to have a challenge

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:19.430
for me specifically for
Vietnam veterans because both

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:22.440
of my brothers served
in Vietnam, my cousins.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.400
And so we had a commemorative
challenge coin made.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.040
And so we give that
to Vietnam veterans.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.890
And I was in the airport on my
way to the convention and I met,

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:33.610
I had on my t-shirt
with Jessie's picture.

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:36.860
And this gentleman came up
to me and said thank you.

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.010
And he said that he was a
Vietnam veteran and I said,

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:40.560
wait I have something for you.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.030
And I reached in my purse and
I have the challenge coin.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:46.840
And I said, thank you so
very much for your service

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.270
and sacrifice to our country

00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:51.620
because you guys did not
receive the heroes welcome

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:53.910
that you so richly deserve.

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:56.200
And so I honor and
I solute you sir

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.220
for your sacrifice
and your service.

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.700
And he had tears in his
eyes and began to cry.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.770
And I said thank
you so very much.

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:04.520
And that has been repeatedly.

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:06.080
I've done that so many times.

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.230
And just being there for them,
talking to the POW's and the,

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:13.350
at the, at the VA hospital
and I'm the Chaplain as well

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:16.350
so I've gotten to know
a lot of the veterans.

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:20.070
And so I was there one day and
one of the gentleman that was

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:23.190
at Poly High School,
he recognized my voice

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.990
and said Janice,
please come over here.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:27.790
And he said, can
you pray with me?

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:30.510
And I had the honor
of praying with him,

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:32.230
and then I heard
another voice that said,

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:33.650
Janice, I know you too.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:35.480
Can you pray with me afterwards?

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.930
And so it's three
people in a row.

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:41.540
So just doing things and it
has been an amazing journey

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.330
to be able to help out veterans.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:46.320
And wanted to, thank
you New Day USA.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.770
When I first walked into there
last year into their building,

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:51.890
and I said, you know I looked
around, I said you know what,

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:54.570
this is a new day at USA.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:56.390
You know this is
a new day for USA

00:47:56.390 --> 00:48:00.340
because they really present
new days for those veterans

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:03.000
who have served by helping them
to get mortgages for homes.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.210
So thank you for giving new
days to a lot of families.

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:07.560
And I'm hoping that
can be extended

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.350
to Gold Star families as well.

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:10.650
Moms who will need.

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:12.760
That's something that some
of the organizations will do.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.060
Reach back.

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.360
We thank you for the
veterans, and the families

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.020
as my daughter says,
attached to each fallen hero.

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.470
If you can do something to
help Gold Star mothers and all

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:22.460
who are struggling, maybe
you know single parents

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:24.170
who would need mortgages
and things

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:26.410
like that, helping them do that.

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:29.350
But you know just reaching out
and just sharing and serving

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:32.200
within the community,
really means a lot.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:35.360
You know it's, you can allow, I
always allow God to take my pain

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:38.260
and turn it to pearls
of glory to help others.

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.790
It's therapeutic and as you
water so shall you be watered.

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:44.080
You can't hold things
in, you got to let it go,

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.260
have an open hand and
begin to let it come

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:47.560
through you, just like water.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.860
Serving others.

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.810
You'll feel better and when
I leave VA hospital I can sit

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:54.520
in my car and say,
mission complete.

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.640
My son said he wanted
to go change the world

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.300
and make a difference
and do something

00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.770
that would bring God glory,

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.640
something that people
would not forget.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.250
Everywhere he went he did that
and now he passed the baton

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:07.530
to me and I'm running with it
and so is my, is my daughter,

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.490
and my husband and all
the rest of the family.

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:12.120
So I thank all of you for
being here today to support us

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.420
and so we can get the
story out about Gold Star.

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:14.720
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Thank you very--

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.020
&gt;&gt; Janice Chance: Thank
you and God bless you.

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.320
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Thank
you very much.

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:24.750
I'd like to call up Cadet
Caroline Wood, come on up here

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:33.490
for just a sec, whose from the
Prep School that New Day USA is,

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:36.670
where New Day USA was
helping to fund students.

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:39.060
You and I have done this before.

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:43.970
I met the Woods and Caroline's
mother at, at the school,

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:46.720
at the college about a
year and a half or so ago.

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:52.240
And her mother, like all of
the parents there said, oh no,

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:56.910
like she'll, the child is
scared, this is not going

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:59.440
to work, she hates cameras,
she hates microphones.

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:03.510
And she came up and was
the star that we had.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:06.660
So it's, it's good, good
to see you, and your mom.

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:11.630
Just, just tell us what, what
it meant to you to realize

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:15.970
that virtually out of
the blue somebody called

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:20.900
to say we recognize the
loss in your family and we'd

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.700
like to become friends
and help you.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.000
&gt;&gt; Cadet Caroline Wood:
It was, it was an honor

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.010
because it had been
like 12 years

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.270
after my father had passed.

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:35.130
And finally someone
remembered him and honored him.

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:38.880
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: And that
relationship has stayed

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.280
with you, right when
you got that call,

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.560
you probably thought oh
well who are these people

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:44.970
and what do they want from us.

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:47.110
But it wasn't quite
that way was it?

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:48.410
&gt;&gt; Cadet Caroline Wood: No.

00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:49.710
They wanted to give
a scholarship to pay

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:54.220
for my whole tuition at TMC.

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.070
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Well much
deserved, the whole family.

00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:58.670
And I remember you telling me,
and I'm sorry to do this to you,

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:03.490
but you know reporters do things
like this, they, they see tears

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:05.510
and they, they say
more, more, more.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:07.320
But I'm really not like that.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:11.840
But you know we, we talked
about several things so when,

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.800
when I was at, at
your college, and,

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:17.840
and one of those things was
that, that you were impressed

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.910
with the continuation
of the relationship

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:23.710
of packages would
arrive and tell us,

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:25.270
tell us about, about that.

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:27.550
&gt;&gt; Cadet Caroline Wood: So New
Day gives you a team member.

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:30.460
And they'll email you, ask
you how your day's been going,

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:31.760
how your year's going.

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.470
They'll remember
everything about you.

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:37.900
And that's just the most,
it's just touching to know

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.380
that they are remembering you,

00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:42.280
your father, everything
about you.

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:46.100
And they send you
packages in the mail, just,

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.400
just small little things.

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.790
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Lots of
candy I think you told me.

00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:50.090
&gt;&gt; Cadet Caroline Wood: Yes.

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:51.390
Yes.

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:53.740
&gt;&gt; Mort Dean: Well and
Ms. Wood and a number

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:58.530
of the other children who
have, have lost their,

00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:03.570
their parents or, their parents
have become terribly disabled a,

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:07.160
a number of these young
people said to me,

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.550
what Caroline has said, how
important the connection

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:14.960
with New Day has been, and
it, that it taught them

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.800
that in their lives,
when they grow up,

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.100
they know that they're
going to make a contribution

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:24.860
to something too, so this is
a legacy that you folks do

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:26.680
to keep, keep on giving.

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:27.980
Thank you.

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.510
I hope you don't hate me
for bringing you up here.

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:39.040
[ Applause ]

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.140
And now we have a gentleman,

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:44.040
Gary Morrison whose
going to come up.

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.950
He's a representative
of New Day USA.

00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:51.060
And I'm told you're coming
up, don't you know that?

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.510
Gary Morrison ladies
and gentlemen.

00:52:53.510 --> 00:53:02.050
[ Applause ]

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:03.350
It's all yours.

00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:06.290
Carri would you like
us to present now?

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:08.400
&gt;&gt; Gary Morrison: I'll ask
Admiral Lynch to please stand

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.700
in front of the podium.

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:12.620
Karen if you would go
stand by Admiral Lynch.

00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:17.920
One of the, the great
things they're doing here,

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:21.940
Carri could you stand
her by Admiral Lynch.

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.240
&gt;&gt; Carri: Me?

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.540
&gt;&gt; Gary Morrison: One

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:25.840
of the great things
they're doing here is the,

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.140
the Veterans History Project.

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:28.570
And I think everybody that's in
this room could probably help

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:30.740
with it, and it's a
terribly important effort.

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:35.130
They're basically creating
this oral and visual history

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:39.880
of service, and all kinds
of service, combat service,

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:48.030
service in war time, free time,
whenever, service is service.

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:52.460
And they asked us, as part
of this agreement that we,

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:55.620
and cooperation that we
currently have going,

00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:57.380
to see if we could put
together some things.

00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:00.220
And New Day is, is very humbled,
and we're always humbled

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:02.420
with every opportunity we
have to connect with people

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:05.760
in our community, especially
the families of those who serve.

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:09.740
Unfortunately their
stories often go untold.

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.900
That is why I'm grateful
to the Library of Congress

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:14.300
and the Veterans History
Project for allowing us to reach

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:17.430
out to these individuals
and tell these stories

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:18.740
that our community
and our nation

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.250
as a whole will better
understand the history

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:22.940
of our nation.

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:26.680
We may never be able to fully
repay our veterans for all

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.630
that they have done,
but this projects,

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:31.440
the Veterans History Project
is a great way to acknowledge

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.800
and to genuinely honor
these men and women

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.500
by archiving their
firsthand members, memories,

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:39.330
with the Library of Congress.

00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:42.260
Today we have brought
with us the first

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:44.780
of what will be many interviews

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:49.160
that New Day USA will
complete, yes complete.

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.790
And this is a testimony of
service, and long service

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:56.680
and distinguished service of
Rear Admiral Thomas Lynch,

00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:59.280
our chairman, and we
are pleased to turn

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:03.240
in this Living Touchstone over
to the Veterans History Project.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.510
And I'll let Admiral
Lynch do that.

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:20.340
[ Applause ]

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:22.000
&gt;&gt; Admiral Thomas Lynch: Since I
have the floor here I will take

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.610
a moment to thank all
of you for being here

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:28.990
and particularly our panelists,
our Gold Star Mothers,

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:31.420
got my classmate here
Todd [inaudible] and six

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:35.160
and a half years as
a POW in Vietnam.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:38.570
Bob [Inaudible] our CEO
of [inaudible] and CEO

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:43.210
who had the vision to
[inaudible] what we have

00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:47.510
which was 5% of our
operating income.

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:51.110
We put that into our foundation,
and that foundation goes

00:55:51.110 --> 00:55:56.830
out to help deserving
Gold Star families.

00:55:56.830 --> 00:56:01.270
You saw beautiful Caroline
up here a moment ago,

00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:02.570
the impact that can have.

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:07.130
We have how many, how many do
we have at your school now?

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.430
&gt;&gt; Lt. Gen. William
B. Caldwell: Thirteen.

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:10.470
&gt;&gt; Admiral Thomas Lynch:
Thirteen going to 1,300 we hope.

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:16.380
Of those who are sons
and daughters of deceased

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:20.010
or disabled members, or who
are fighting this global war

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:21.970
on terror on our behalf.

00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:25.500
Those who, as we've said
before, service before self,

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.190
that's what it's all about
when you wear that uniform.

00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:32.180
I just wish as Mort said earlier
in the program that more members

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:36.840
of Congress who aren't here
or their staff to understand

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.140
so they've got to know,

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:41.930
and that's one thing I think we
can do is, is, is be more vocal

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:44.920
up on The Hill, despite all
the division, divisiveness

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:46.220
that we have in our
country today.

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:50.340
I think they'd come together
for the person in uniform

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:54.300
who is making those sacrifices
and the family that has gone

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.590
through so much grief
and anguish.

00:56:57.590 --> 00:57:02.180
So to all of you, I feel
very humbled and very proud

00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:03.480
to be a part of New Day.

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:06.580
Very humbled in your presence,
and we're very thankful

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:08.320
that we can participate
in this program

00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.620
with The Library of Congress.

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:12.610
We congratulate the Library of
Congress for making this happen.

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:16.940
And we just hope that more
and more of us can get out

00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.240
and do more and more
in the future.

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:19.540
Thank you.

will be made available

all for being here and I,

I know I got a lot out of this,
and I'm sure all of you did too.

00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:55.890
Thank you very much and
thank you to the Library

00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:58.090
