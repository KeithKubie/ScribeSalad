00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.010
It was a century ago when famed World War
I German fighter pilot Manfred von Richthofen

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.520
was fatally shot out of the sky.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.940
Yet, his nickname – “Red Baron” – remains
part of American vernacular.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.499
Charles Schulz’s comic strip character Snoopy
famously took on the Red Baron in his imaginary

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:32.279
air battles aboard his doghouse, often yelling
“Curse you, Red Baron!”

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.540
Movies and songs feature the German war hero.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.589
Even a Minnesota-based food company co-opted
his name and image to sell frozen pizza.

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.350
So, who was the Red Baron?

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.379
And why do we celebrate him, even though he
was an enemy of the Allied Forces who, beyond

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.690
some number of unconfirmed kills, shot down
a confirmed 80 Allied planes during World

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.630
War I?

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:06.500
Born on May 2, 1892, Manfred von Albrecht
Freiherr von Richthofen was the son of a career

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.880
army officer in a prominent Prussian family.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.140
During the first decade of his life, he lived
comfortably as an aristocrat, playing sports

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.140
and hunting.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.970
But at age 11, his father forced him and his
brother to enroll in the Cadet Institute at

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.970
Wahlstatt.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.550
Richthofen’s 1917 autobiography reveals
that he wasn’t too happy about this.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.390
“As a little boy of 11 I entered the Cadet
Corps.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.040
I was not particularly eager to become a Cadet,
but my father wished it.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.740
So my wishes were not consulted.”

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.740
He goes on,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.200
I found it difficult to bear the strict discipline
and to keep order.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.479
I did not care very much for the instruction
I received.

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.700
I never was good at learning things.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.680
I did just enough work to pass.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.759
In my opinion it would have been wrong to
do more than was just sufficient, so I worked

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.049
as little as possible.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.860
The consequence was that my teachers did not
think overmuch of me.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.520
On the other hand, I was very fond of sport,
particularly I liked gymnastics, football,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.520
etc.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.100
I could do all possible tricks on the horizontal
bar.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.780
So I received various prizes from the Commandant.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.180
Beyond this, he also was apparently fond of
pulling “risky tricks” like risking life

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.970
and limb by climbing the town’s famous steeple.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.989
As you might imagine, Richthofen soon separated
himself as fearless and bold, a reputation

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.750
he’d maintain for the rest of his life.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.230
Shortly before his 18th birthday, he was commissioned
as an officer in a German cavalry unit.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.080
On June 28, 1914, a Bosnian-born Slav nationalist
named Gavrilo Princip, protesting the integration

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.760
of his country into the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
assassinated the heir to the throne, Archduke

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.530
Franz Ferdinand.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.090
Contrary to popular belief, nobody really
cared much about the actual assassination

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.090
(not even the Emperor himself who wasn’t
shy about his opinion that it was a good thing

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.989
that this particular heir had been killed),
but it was a great excuse to wage a quick

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.800
land-grab war, and as a result the world got
one of the most deadly conflicts in history.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.409
As a 22 years old cavalryman, Richthofen was
sent off to both the eastern and western fronts

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.010
where he served mostly as a messenger.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.510
It soon became clear that, in this age of
trench warfare and advanced weaponry, cavalrymen

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.970
were no longer terribly useful and provided
an easy target for the enemy.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.470
So, Richthofen got off the horse and was mostly
used to find telephone operators and to help

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.780
the army with supply transfers.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.950
He was not happy with this and asked to be
moved to the German Air Service.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.010
In his autobiography, he wrote that he sent
a polite letter to the Commanding General

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.280
making this request but “evil tongues report
that I told him: ‘My dear Excellency!

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.920
I have not gone to war in order to collect
cheese and eggs, but for another purpose.’”

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.939
Whatever he actually said, Richthofen’s
request was granted.

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.659
After a stint as an observer on flights, Richthofen
was promoted to pilot.

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.840
However, his first solo flight didn’t go
well.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.290
In a great life lesson for all of us, this
man whose name would soon become synonymous

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.920
with “Flying Ace” crashed.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.379
One fine evening my teacher, Zeumer, told
me: “Now go and fly by yourself.”

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.820
I must say I felt like replying “I am afraid”
But this is a word which should never be used

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.840
by a man who defends his country.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.820
Therefore, whether I liked it or not, I had
to make the best of it and get into my machine.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.450
Zeumer explained to me once more every movement
in theory.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.640
I scarcely listened to his explanations for
I was firmly convinced that I should forget

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.290
half of what he was telling me.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.530
I started the machine.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.219
The aeroplane went at the prescribed speed
and I could not help noticing that I was actually

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:44.219
flying.

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:47.039
After all I did not feel timorous but rather
elated.

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.479
I did not care for anything.

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.770
I should not have been frightened no matter
what happened.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.020
With contempt of death I made a large curve
to the left…Now came the most difficult

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.229
thing, the landing.

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.919
I remembered exactly what movements I had
to make.

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.149
I acted mechanically and the machine moved
quite differently from what I had expected.

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:09.230
I lost my balance, made some wrong movements,
stood on my head and I succeeded in converting

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.399
my aeroplane into a battered school ‘bus.

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:17.270
I was very sad… and had to suffer from other
people’s jokes.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.530
Flying went much better for him after that.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.400
Like when he was younger, Richthofen earned
a reputation for pulling risky maneuvers – like

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.649
flying into a thunderstorm against the orders
of his commanders.

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:29.610
His boldness again caught the attention of
his superiors.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.919
In 1916, Germany’s top flying ace at the
time, Oswald Boelcke, handpicked Richthofen

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.200
for the new air fighter squadron he was putting
together- Jasta 2.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.950
Richthofen was a cocky pupil but didn’t
disappoint.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.620
In September 1916, he got his first confirmed
kill when he shot down a British plane over

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.810
the French countryside.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:55.121
Wrote Richthofen later about this event, “I
was animated by a single thought: ‘The man

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:58.620
in front of me must come down, whatever happens.’…

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.480
I give a short series of shots with my machine
gun.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.160
I had gone so close that I was afraid I might
dash into the Englishman.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.010
Suddenly, I nearly yelled with joy for the
propeller of the enemy machine had stopped

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.010
turning.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.120
I had shot his engine to pieces.”

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.060
From then on, his confidence and reputation
only grew.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.039
Upon the death of his mentor Boelcke (due
to an accidental mid-air collision with a

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.610
fellow German plane), Richthofen took on the
mantle of Germany’s top flying ace.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.130
While racking up kills, Richthofen acquired
some rather morbid traditions.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:35.200
For example, for every plane he shot down,
he had a Berlin jeweler make him a small silver

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.200
cup.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.710
However, after 60 of these, the jeweler was
forced to tell him he could no longer make

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.610
them due to a silver shortage.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.130
He also had the habit of following his victims
down when possible and collecting some sort

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.370
of souvenir from their totaled plane or lifeless
body.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.370
With regards to one of his early kills, he
states,

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.450
My opponent fell, shot through the head, 150
feet behind our line.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.880
His machine gun was dug out of the ground,
and it ornaments the entrance of my dwelling.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.330
In no time at all his home was decorated with
pieces of propellers, compasses, pistols,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.210
and fabric serial numbers torn from uniforms.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.080
He even had a chandelier made from the engine
of a Frenchman he killed- “From the ceiling

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.320
of my dugout hangs a lamp which I made from
the engine of an aeroplane…

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.470
I fitted small bulbs into the cylinders; and
if I lie awake at night and leave the light

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:27.040
burning, its glow is reflected on the ceiling,
and God knows the effect is grotesque and

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.040
weird.”

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.750
In January 1917, he was handed command of
his own squadron, Jasta 11.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.090
In celebration, he painted his Albatros D.III
a distinctive, eye-catching red.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.229
He soon learned that this bright coloring
had the desired effect as a sort of calling

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:44.140
card, as he states after an encounter with
a pair of Englishman:

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.700
I felt some human pity for my opponent and
had resolved not to cause him to fall down

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.870
but merely to compel him to land.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:56.500
I did so particularly because I had the impression
that my opponent was wounded, for he did not

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.960
fire a single shot.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.690
When I had got down to an altitude of about
1,500 feet engine trouble compelled me to

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.460
land without making any curves.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.070
The result was very comical.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.640
My enemy with his burning machine landed smoothly,
while I, his victor, came down next to him

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.580
in the barbed wire of our trenches and my
machine overturned.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.529
The two Englishmen, who were not a little
surprised at my collapse, greeted me like

00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:20.529
sportsmen.

00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:24.440
As mentioned before, they had not fired a
shot, and they could not understand why I

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.479
had landed so clumsily.

00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:28.660
They were the first two Englishmen whom I
had brought down alive.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.760
Consequently, it gave me particular pleasure
to talk to them.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.210
I asked them whether they had previously seen
my machine in the air, and one of them replied,

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.250
“Oh, yes.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.229
I know your machine very well.

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:42.870
We call it ‘Le Petit Rouge’ (“The Little
Red”).

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:48.180
April 1917 became known to the Allied forces
as a “Bloody April” largely due to the

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.640
Red Baron’s elite squadron achieving an
astounding 89 victories, accounting for a

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.420
full one third of the Royal Flying Corps’
losses that month.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.600
It’s also noteworthy that the “Red Baron”
was responsible for 21 of those confirmed

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.480
kills in that single month alone.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.060
In the summer of 1917, Richthofen reached
the height of his celebrity as the squadron

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.370
leader of an elite unit that all had their
planes brightly painted.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.500
Because of this, the group earned the nickname-
the “Flying Circus.”

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:23.080
He became a powerful symbol for the Germans,
held up as a fitting example of a perfect

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.080
soldier.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.060
Unfortunately for him, in July of that year
Richthofen was severely injured when a slug

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.950
grazed his head and caused a fractured skull.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.830
He was able to land his plane in friendly
territory, but it was feared that he was close

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.670
to death and the injury soon required multiple
surgeries.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.210
Three weeks later, though, he returned to
flying against his doctors’ orders, but

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:49.340
this time in an advanced Fokker Dr.1 triplane,
the aircraft that is most often associated

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.680
with the “Red Baron” despite the fact
that he only made the last few of his kills

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.900
in this plane.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:00.640
On April 20, 1918, he got his 80th and final
kill when he shot down a British Sopwith Camel.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.930
At this point, however, like so many other
soldiers on both sides at the time, Richthofen

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.940
had lost his taste for the war.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.830
Beyond accounts from friends and family about
his changed demeanor, while staring at the

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:16.520
aforementioned chandelier made of an enemy’s
engine, the Red Baron wrote the following,

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.070
When I lie like this I have plenty to think
about…

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:23.490
Now the battle that is taking place on all
fronts has become really serious; nothing

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:28.350
remains of the “fresh, jolly war” as they
used to call our activities at the outset.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:33.980
Now we must face up to a most desperate situation
so that the enemy will not break into our

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:34.980
land.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:40.060
Thus I have an uneasy feeling that the public
has been exposed to another Richthofen, not

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.240
the real me.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.370
Whenever I read the book I smile at its brashness.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.800
I no longer have that brash feeling.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:52.750
Not that I am afraid, though death may be
right on my neck and I often think about it.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.610
Higher authority has suggested that I should
quit flying before it catches up with me.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:02.110
But I should despise myself if, now that I
am famous and heavily decorated, I consented

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:07.680
to live on as a pensioner of my honor, preserving
my precious life for the nation while every

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.120
poor fellow in the trenches, who is doing
his duty no less than I am doing mine, has

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.120
to stick it out.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.010
I feel terrible after every air battle, probably
an after-effect of my head wound.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.500
When I again set foot on the ground I withdraw
to my quarters and don’t want to see anybody

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.780
or hear anything.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:29.420
I think of the war as it really is, not “with
a hurrah and a roar” as the people at home

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.010
imagine it; it is much more serious, bitter.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:37.560
A hundred years later, there’s still no
firm conclusion on how the “Red Baron”

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.930
was actually killed.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:43.510
In the morning of April 21st, the “Flying
Circus” engaged a group of Allied fighter

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.890
planes flying low over northern France.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.780
The altitude in question was significant here
as it was sufficiently close to the ground

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:54.070
for Australian and Canadian machine gunners
below to join in the fray.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.180
From this, it is curious that Richthofen chose
to engage in such a battle in which he’d

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:03.670
be taking fire from not just the planes but
many enemies below; he is known to have advocated

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.890
against such generally unnecessary risk to
his subordinates.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:10.060
Some have speculated from this that he simply
didn’t realize at first he was behind enemy

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.240
lines, and thus perhaps didn’t know the
soldiers on the ground would be shooting at

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.240
him.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.790
Whatever the case, the decision to engage
cost him his life.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:22.560
During the battle, Richthofen was hit in the
torso, ultimately causing damage to his lungs

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.720
and heart.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.410
As to who fired this shot, to this day the
Royal Air Force (RAF) gives official credit

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:32.120
to Canadian Captain Arthur Roy Brown for killing
the Red Baron.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.370
However, it’s noteworthy that Captain Brown
was flying above and slightly to the left

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:41.570
behind Richthofen when he supposedly fired
the fatal shot, yet the bullet that pierced

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:46.270
his body came in through the right armpit
and exited through the upper left part of

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.270
his chest.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.750
It’s speculated from this that the shot
must actually have come from one of the machine

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.860
gunners below.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.230
As you might imagine, many people were keen
to take credit for finally bringing down arguably

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:02.500
the greatest flying ace of either side in
WWI, so determining who actually fired the

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.800
shot is an effort in futility today given
all the conflicting accounts.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.590
Whoever killed him, the 25 year old Red Baron
did manage to land in a beet field in Somme

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.800
Valley where he died moments later.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.540
Richthofen_funeralWhat was perhaps most amazing
was that, while the Red Baron was an enemy,

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.200
he was treated as a hero by the Allied forces.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.520
Since he had come down in Allied territory,
it was on the British and Australians to bury

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.520
him.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.320
And they did so, with his funeral being attended
by hundreds of soldiers looking to pay their

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.740
respects to the man who had killed so many
of their fellow brothers-in-arms.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.710
In the end, Richthofen was buried in northern
France’ with full military honors, which

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:43.140
included a guard of honor and six Royal Flying
Corps as pallbearers.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.050
Soldiers from the various Allied Squadrons
in the area also made wreaths to lay on his

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:52.890
grave, including one which had the words “To
Our Gallant and Worthy Foe” written on it.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:57.650
It is also noteworthy that after the funeral
the locals did not take kindly to the honors

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:01.750
given to Richthofen, with the French villagers
desecrating the grave and destroying the cross

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.750
over it.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.230
In response, one Allied squadron made a new
cross to put on the grave.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.520
In addition, one Captain Roderick Ross stated,

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.530
At the same time General Sir John Monash sent
for the mayor of Villers-Bocage, in which

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:18.089
the Australian Corps headquarters happened
to be located, and told him that he was disgusted

00:14:18.089 --> 00:14:22.490
with what they had done and that if such a
thing occurred again he would consider removing

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.230
his headquarters therefrom.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.430
This had the desired effect.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:30.350
Beyond honoring a man they considered a worthy
advisory, there was also a propaganda element

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.960
to be considered here; it was an opportunity
to show the Germans that their enemies were

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:39.110
chivalrous and not the blood thirsty savages
that so many propaganda campaigns (on both

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.730
sides of the conflict) were spreading about
their respective enemies.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:47.270
Indeed, photographs of the body and funeral
were soon after dropped over German-held positions

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:52.740
to both prove Richthofen was indeed dead and
to show the respect the Allies had shown him.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:57.710
Ultimately, however, the French would have
the Baron’s body moved and later, in 1925,

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.880
Richthofen’s brother would collect the body
and bring it back to Germany.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:30.930
The Red Baron’s remains currently reside
in a tomb 

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.260
in Wiesbaden, Germany.
