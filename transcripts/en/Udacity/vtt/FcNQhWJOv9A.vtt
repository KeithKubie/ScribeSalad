00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.534
Our first integration
point is the user input,

00:00:02.534 --> 00:00:06.536
Sunshine uses this to determine the
location we should get weather data for.

00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:09.679
Our second integration point
is when Sunshine communicates

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:11.041
with the weather server.

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:14.768
The sync adaptor that performs
this action stores the response

00:00:14.768 --> 00:00:18.995
in the database as a cache, notifying
Sunshine when new data is ready.

00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:23.661
The result of either invalid input by
the user or lack of connectivity to

00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:28.973
the weather servers results in an empty
database, and that means an empty list.

00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:33.550
Since an empty list is hardly user
friendly, let's handle that first.
