00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.668
- [Voiceover] Let's
solve 350 divided by 50.

00:00:05.812 --> 00:00:08.775
So, one way to think about
this is if we had 350

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:12.306
of something, let's say,
something delicious like brownies.

00:00:12.306 --> 00:00:16.546
If we had 350 brownies
and we were dividing them

00:00:16.546 --> 00:00:21.026
into groups of 50, how many
groups of 50 could we get?

00:00:21.026 --> 00:00:25.702
Well, one idea is to count
by 50's until we get to 350

00:00:25.702 --> 00:00:28.006
and see how many groups there are.

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.392
One group of 50 would be 50,

00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:33.765
plus another group of 50 would be 100,

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:36.432
plus another group of 50 is 150,

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.744
another one will be 200,

00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:42.327
200 plus 50 is 250,

00:00:44.124 --> 00:00:46.041
plus another 50 is 300,

00:00:47.078 --> 00:00:49.825
and plus one more 50 is 350.

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:53.996
So, when we added all these
50's, these groups of 50,

00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:56.746
50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350,

00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:01.542
we ended up with 350.

00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:05.468
So, 350 can be divided into
this many groups of 50,

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:07.173
and how many groups is this?

00:01:07.173 --> 00:01:10.506
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:16.224
So, 350 divided into
groups of 50 is seven.

00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:19.130
Now, let's look at that quotient,

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.804
that solution of seven
and let's say something.

00:01:22.804 --> 00:01:25.804
If we had simply divided 35 by five,

00:01:27.084 --> 00:01:28.976
we would have also gotten seven.

00:01:28.976 --> 00:01:33.143
35 divided into groups of
five is also equal to seven.

00:01:36.156 --> 00:01:39.290
So, in a way, these zeroes didn't matter,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.773
they didn't affect our answer.

00:01:41.773 --> 00:01:43.982
We were able to cancel them out.

00:01:43.982 --> 00:01:47.348
Having the zero in the first
number is cancelled out

00:01:47.348 --> 00:01:50.375
by having that zero in the second number.

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:52.421
And, let's look at why that is.

00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:54.902
Let's think about why that is.

00:01:54.902 --> 00:01:58.626
Division is really the same as a fraction.

00:01:58.626 --> 00:02:01.243
So, if we wrote this as a fraction,

00:02:01.243 --> 00:02:03.076
let's say 350 over 50,

00:02:07.047 --> 00:02:10.343
well this fraction bar
right here is the same

00:02:10.343 --> 00:02:12.578
as the division sign up here.

00:02:12.578 --> 00:02:16.328
350 divided by 50 is
the same as 350 over 50.

00:02:19.483 --> 00:02:22.633
And, when we have a fraction
like this fraction down here,

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:24.852
we can simplify it.

00:02:24.852 --> 00:02:27.981
In this case, because
there's zeroes on the end,

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.360
we know they're both multiples of 10,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.110
so we can divide them both by 10.

00:02:34.991 --> 00:02:39.955
We can divide our numerator
and our denominator by 10.

00:02:39.955 --> 00:02:42.970
And, when we divide whole numbers by 10,

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.567
we have a trick we can
use, a pattern, really,

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:50.594
which is that the whole
number, in this case 350,

00:02:50.594 --> 00:02:54.822
when it's divided by 10 we
drop a zero from the end.

00:02:54.822 --> 00:02:57.155
So, 350 divided by 10 is 35.

00:03:00.604 --> 00:03:04.000
350 could be divided into 10 groups of 35.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.128
And, then 50 divided by
10 will be the same thing.

00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:12.237
When we divided 50 by 10, we
drop that zero off the end,

00:03:12.237 --> 00:03:14.043
or another way to think about it is

00:03:14.043 --> 00:03:18.599
50 divided into groups of
10 would make five groups.

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.836
And, then we end up with
our simplified fraction

00:03:20.836 --> 00:03:23.753
of 35 fifths or 35 divided by five,

00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:27.512
which is the same thing here.

00:03:27.512 --> 00:03:30.393
So, in both of these cases, we can see

00:03:30.393 --> 00:03:34.560
that 350 divided by 50 is
the same as 35 divided by 5.

00:03:36.947 --> 00:03:39.283
So, when both whole numbers,

00:03:39.283 --> 00:03:41.159
when we're dividing whole numbers

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.326
and they both end in zeroes,
we can cancel those zeroes.

00:03:46.318 --> 00:03:48.549
Basically, we're factoring out a 10.

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.714
We're taking the 10, the divided
by 10 out of both of them,

00:03:51.714 --> 00:03:53.170
out of both numbers.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.833
So, we can cancel those zeroes

00:03:55.833 --> 00:03:57.682
which leaves us with smaller numbers

00:03:57.682 --> 00:04:00.753
and at least for me, I
find division a lot simpler

00:04:00.753 --> 00:04:04.578
when I'm working with smaller numbers.

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:06.282
Let's try a few more.

00:04:06.282 --> 00:04:09.365
Let's try one like 420 divided by 70.

00:04:15.017 --> 00:04:17.699
So, we can see we have two whole numbers,

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.116
both end in zero.

00:04:20.273 --> 00:04:22.516
So, we're gonna cancel those zeroes,

00:04:22.516 --> 00:04:25.754
basically we're dividing
a ten out of both numbers

00:04:25.754 --> 00:04:28.549
and end up with a simpler division problem

00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:30.466
of 42 divided by seven.

00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:37.556
42 divided by seven equals six,

00:04:38.605 --> 00:04:42.272
therefore 420 divided
by 70 also equals six.

00:04:46.714 --> 00:04:48.642
And, here's one last one.

00:04:48.642 --> 00:04:51.475
What is we had 5600 divided by 80?

00:04:58.254 --> 00:05:01.509
So, the first thing I notice
is I have zeroes at the end

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.842
of both of my whole numbers.

00:05:04.784 --> 00:05:08.300
If I cancel out this
one, I can cancel out one

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.550
on the other side.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.284
I can't cancel both of 'em
over here, there were two,

00:05:13.284 --> 00:05:15.181
with cancelling we have
to cancel the same amount

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:17.181
of zeroes on both sides,

00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:21.738
and now we end up with
560 divided by eight.

00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:27.478
This leaves us with a new division problem

00:05:27.478 --> 00:05:29.170
that's still a little bit tricky,

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.034
but easier than dividing by 80.

00:05:32.034 --> 00:05:35.284
So, here we can think of 560 as 56 10's

00:05:36.792 --> 00:05:39.340
because of the zero on the end,

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.507
and 56 10's or 560 could be
rewritten as 10 times 56.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.192
Theses are equivalent.

00:05:49.192 --> 00:05:50.859
560 and 10 times 56,

00:05:52.468 --> 00:05:56.635
because 10 times 56 is a
56 with a zero on the end.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.551
And, rewriting it this way makes it so now

00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:03.489
I have a division problem right here,

00:06:03.489 --> 00:06:06.322
56 divided by 8 that we can solve,

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.523
56 divided by eight is seven,

00:06:10.523 --> 00:06:13.965
and then we still have
this 10 and the times sign

00:06:13.965 --> 00:06:16.382
and 10 times seven equals 70.

00:06:19.231 --> 00:06:23.398
So, our solution here, when we
divided 560 by eight was 70,

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:29.226
so that means our solution up
here for 5600 divided by 80

00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:30.988
is also 70.

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:35.822
Because, when we cancel zeroes and divide,

00:06:35.822 --> 00:06:38.372
we still get the same solution.

00:06:38.372 --> 00:06:42.158
But, remember, we have to
cancel the same amount of zeroes

00:06:42.158 --> 00:06:45.119
in each number, here we
couldn't cancel both zeroes.

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:48.185
If we cancel one zero in the dividend,

00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:51.269
we can cancel one zero in the divisor.

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:53.829
And, another thing to
remember about this trick,

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:55.690
first thing to remember
is we need to cancel

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.647
the same amount of zeroes,

00:06:57.647 --> 00:07:00.172
and the second, the zeroes
have to be at the end

00:07:00.172 --> 00:07:01.644
of the problem.

00:07:01.644 --> 00:07:03.898
So, if we had a division problem,

00:07:03.898 --> 00:07:07.648
something for example
like 506 divided by 20,

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:12.813
here we cannot cancel the zeroes,

00:07:12.813 --> 00:07:15.064
we cannot cancel the
zeroes because this zero

00:07:15.064 --> 00:07:16.935
is not on the end.

00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:20.848
So, the new problem this would
give us, 56 divided by two,

00:07:20.848 --> 00:07:25.633
is not equivalent, does not
equal the top division problem.

00:07:25.633 --> 00:07:28.713
So, we can't cancel
zeroes, that does not work.

00:07:28.713 --> 00:07:31.054
We cannot cancel zeroes
unless they are at the end

00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:33.128
of the problem,

00:07:33.128 --> 00:07:36.387
and we cancel the same
amount in both the dividend

00:07:36.387 --> 00:07:37.720
and the divisor.
