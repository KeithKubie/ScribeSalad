00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.000
The obvious approach to selecting components is to say, well what is it

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.070
the system is supposed do or compute and break that down into, into pieces.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.420
However there are many other factors that might go into deciding

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.460
which components are going to be part of your system.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.590
Of course, required functionality is, is most important there, but

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.600
it may also be the case that you already have some existing reusable components

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.320
from your libraries that you want to build into your system.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.420
And that may have a important role in deciding on

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.710
the overall component structure as would the physical machine architecture,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.490
that is the architecture providing you multiple cores in which case how can you

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.780
take advantage of those in, in breaking down your computation.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.830
Another element you might not have thought of is your staff,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.040
that is the people who are going to do this.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.370
Conway's Law say's that the ultimate structure of

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.500
a system depends upon the structure of the organization building it.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.280
So it's well to take into account that if you have three people helping you

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.700
lay out the architecture you're likely to end up with three major components.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.750
Another important element is that for

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.160
real systems they're going to have long lifetimes.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.600
And the trajectory of that lifetime,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.500
the direction in which it's going to move as we saw in the Brohoff definition,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.960
could and should strongly influence the components into which you divided.
