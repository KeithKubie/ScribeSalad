So, thanks Lauren. So, you know, another way in which we express emotion is

00:00:03.778 --> 00:00:08.555
through our voice. As it turns out, our voice is harder to control than our

00:00:08.555 --> 00:00:12.406
face. People can lie with their face more easily, because it's under voluntary

00:00:12.406 --> 00:00:16.945
control. But our voice is regulated by the autonomic nervous system. And

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:21.890
remember the autonomic nervous system, we don't control. So, it's harder to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.072
manipulate. And for instance, we also have pitch changes with our voice. And

00:00:28.072 --> 00:00:32.104
pitch changes might happen when we have voice cracks, when we're nervous or

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:36.526
when we cry. So, two good examples of recognize an emotion in the voice, are

00:00:36.526 --> 00:00:41.584
with young children, and when people are speaking foreign languages. So, for

00:00:41.584 --> 00:00:44.642
instance, in young children. They may not understand the words, but they

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:49.544
clearly understand the emotional tone. So, for instance, if I parent says, oh,

00:00:49.544 --> 00:00:53.838
isn't that sweet versus no. The child may not understand those words, but

00:00:53.838 --> 00:00:56.260
clearly understands the emotional tone.
