00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.370
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder - but
since our survival is largely driven by sexual

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.010
selection, we often attempt to accentuate
our features with makeup. So what exactly

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.180
is in makeup products, and should we trust
these substances that we apply to our bodies?

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.749
Could makeup actually be bad for you?

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.749
Historically, ancient Egyptians would grind
up a mineral substance containing primarily

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:26.670
lead sulfide to rim around their eyes, creating
the sultry cleopatra look. Little did they

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.680
know that lead is a potent neurotoxin, which
can lead to learning and behavioural difficulties

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.930
in children and decrease fertility in both
men and women. Later, In 1891, creams, lotions,

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.809
and blush containing compounds of the radioactive
element radium were also sold to women in

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.170
Europe, promising a youthful glow - until
the harmful effects of exposure to radioactivity

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.510
was discovered, that is.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.380
But makeup has come a long way, and now there
are only trace amounts of lead found in our

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.680
products. Lead is found in nature and is therefore
an unintentional contaminant from the manufacturing

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.580
process. An FDA study of 400 tubes of lipstick
found concentrations ranged from 0.026ppm

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.790
to 7.19ppm of lead, which is under Health
Canada's limits of 10ppm.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.070
Lipstick is about 47% oils, 36% pigments,
17% waxes and 5% other components including

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.020
preservatives. The oils are primarily castor
oils, extracted from a bean which contains

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.229
the protein ricin – one of the most toxic
substances on this planet which has been used

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.720
as a biological weapon. However, the process
of extracting castor oil involves heating,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.259
thereby denaturing ricin and rendering it
inactive.

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.950
Pigments now use synthetic dyes due to cost
and production efficiencies, although traditionally,

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.039
red pigments were extracted from dried and
crushed cochineal insects. Some blue pigments

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.390
are created with ferric ferrocyanide. Cyanide
is extremely deadly, however in this compound

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.180
structure, cyanide has a very strong bond
to iron. As a result, it is unable to come

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.110
apart to poison us by eye shadow.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.951
When it comes to mascara, we recommend tossing
the tube after three months of opening. Harmful

00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:12.860
bacteria of the Streptococcus species and
certain fungi were discovered thriving in

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.310
36.4% of mascara tubes. And this is especially
important for contact lens wearers, as bacteria

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.180
can easily enter the micro abrasions caused
by the lens itself.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.060
Parabens have been a big concern as well as
they’re in a myriad of cosmetic products.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.709
Paraben works by mimicking estrogen and binding
to estrogen receptors. This can cause the

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.040
expression of genes to be changed and communication
within cells to be altered. Additionally,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.840
it can lead to the growth of certain breast
cancer cells. However, many products are switching

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.769
to paraben free - and a lot of research still
needs to be done in order to reach any definitive

00:02:46.769 --> 00:03:01.370
conclusions.
