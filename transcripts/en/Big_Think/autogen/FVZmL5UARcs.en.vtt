everything adds up now the ancient

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
everything adds up now the ancient
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.109
everything adds up now the ancient
observations now it's all lines up

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119
observations now it's all lines up
 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.109

Galileo says hey you know we're not the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
Galileo says hey you know we're not the
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.600
Galileo says hey you know we're not the
only planet with a moon oh we're gonna

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610
only planet with a moon oh we're gonna
 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.249
only planet with a moon oh we're gonna
have to put you in prison I'm sorry

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259
have to put you in prison I'm sorry
 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.390
have to put you in prison I'm sorry
we're gonna have to keep you in prison

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
we're gonna have to keep you in prison
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.520

so if we found evidence of life

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890
so if we found evidence of life
 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.649
so if we found evidence of life
elsewhere it would humble us in the same

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
elsewhere it would humble us in the same
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.969
elsewhere it would humble us in the same
way so there are many people that are

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
way so there are many people that are
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.280
way so there are many people that are
troubled by this uncertainty by this

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290
troubled by this uncertainty by this
 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.209
troubled by this uncertainty by this
inability to know and they want to have

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219
inability to know and they want to have
 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.609
inability to know and they want to have
all the answers and have it all settled

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619
all the answers and have it all settled
 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.609
all the answers and have it all settled
but that's not the nature of nature and

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619
but that's not the nature of nature and
 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.770
but that's not the nature of nature and
furthermore it's especially not the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
furthermore it's especially not the
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.960
furthermore it's especially not the
nature of science science is this

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
nature of science science is this
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.540
nature of science science is this
process where we keep making discoveries

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
process where we keep making discoveries
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.550
process where we keep making discoveries
in a disciplined fashion

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
in a disciplined fashion
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.220
in a disciplined fashion
and in general the more discoveries you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230
and in general the more discoveries you
 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.930
and in general the more discoveries you
make the more you realize you don't know

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940
make the more you realize you don't know
 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.550
make the more you realize you don't know
what's going on the more you realize you

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560
what's going on the more you realize you
 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.699
what's going on the more you realize you
don't know not knowing the next physics

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709
don't know not knowing the next physics
 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.260
don't know not knowing the next physics
whatever is causing the Stars to

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270
whatever is causing the Stars to
 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.050
whatever is causing the Stars to
accelerate away from each other not

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060
accelerate away from each other not
 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.780
accelerate away from each other not
knowing really where gravity comes from

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790
knowing really where gravity comes from
 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.540
knowing really where gravity comes from
not knowing the future these are all

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550
not knowing the future these are all
 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.540
not knowing the future these are all
very troubling to some people but to us

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550
very troubling to some people but to us
 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.380
very troubling to some people but to us
in science it is it's exciting it's

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390
in science it is it's exciting it's
 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.030
in science it is it's exciting it's
always exciting you're always going to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
always exciting you're always going to
 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.640
always exciting you're always going to
find something especially in space
