general principle about tight and loose
 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.580
general principle about tight and loose
is that groups that have more power

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
is that groups that have more power
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.049
is that groups that have more power

you can see other evidence of it all the

that these reps would never call the
 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.069
that these reps would never call the
same kinds of punishments and penalties

cultural intelligence it's more than

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659
cultural intelligence it's more than
 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.620
cultural intelligence it's more than
just knowledge about other cultures

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630
just knowledge about other cultures
 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.120
just knowledge about other cultures
that's certainly part of it there's one

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130
that's certainly part of it there's one
 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.410
that's certainly part of it there's one
dimension that's clearly just about

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420
dimension that's clearly just about
 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.359
dimension that's clearly just about
knowledge of the culture but it's also

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369
knowledge of the culture but it's also
 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.639
knowledge of the culture but it's also
about your motivation to interact with

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649
about your motivation to interact with
 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.560
about your motivation to interact with
people in different cultures that's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570
people in different cultures that's
 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.270
people in different cultures that's
actually one of the most important parts

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280
actually one of the most important parts
 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.709
actually one of the most important parts
of cultural intelligence is having that

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719
of cultural intelligence is having that
 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.050
of cultural intelligence is having that
kind of openness to see diversity as an

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060
kind of openness to see diversity as an
 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.420
kind of openness to see diversity as an
opportunity versus a threat that

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430
opportunity versus a threat that
 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.179
opportunity versus a threat that
predicts people doing much better when

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189
predicts people doing much better when
 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.100
predicts people doing much better when
they're crossing cultures and there's

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110
they're crossing cultures and there's
 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.959
they're crossing cultures and there's
also a sense of metacognition which is a

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969
also a sense of metacognition which is a
 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.539
also a sense of metacognition which is a
fancy way of saying thinking about what

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549
fancy way of saying thinking about what
 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.459
fancy way of saying thinking about what
you know about culture questioning what

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469
you know about culture questioning what
 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.620
you know about culture questioning what
you know about it so there's multiple

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630
you know about it so there's multiple
 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.380
you know about it so there's multiple
dimensions of cultural intelligence and

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390
dimensions of cultural intelligence and
 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.240
dimensions of cultural intelligence and
we can assess it we can measure it and

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250
we can assess it we can measure it and
 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.100
we can assess it we can measure it and
we can use it to predict how well people

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110
we can use it to predict how well people
 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.620
we can use it to predict how well people
will do on international assignments in

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630
will do on international assignments in
 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.550
will do on international assignments in
negotiations that are cross-cultural

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560
negotiations that are cross-cultural
 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.740
negotiations that are cross-cultural
so it's really an incredibly important

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750
so it's really an incredibly important
 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.650
so it's really an incredibly important
construct and again in this globalized

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660
construct and again in this globalized
 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.760
construct and again in this globalized
era we really need to move beyond IQ and

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770
era we really need to move beyond IQ and
 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.370
era we really need to move beyond IQ and
EQ you can have great intelligence but

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380
EQ you can have great intelligence but
 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.440
EQ you can have great intelligence but
have no cultural intelligence you can

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450
have no cultural intelligence you can
 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.330
have no cultural intelligence you can
have emotional intelligence but you can

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340
have emotional intelligence but you can
 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.000
have emotional intelligence but you can
also fail on CQ so it's really an

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010
also fail on CQ so it's really an
 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.800
also fail on CQ so it's really an
incredibly important attribute to

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810
incredibly important attribute to
 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.840
incredibly important attribute to
cultivate and the kids have been

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850
cultivate and the kids have been
 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.660
cultivate and the kids have been
noticing this as females they say you

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670
noticing this as females they say you
 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.970
noticing this as females they say you
know mom we're living in a tighter world

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980
know mom we're living in a tighter world
 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.010
know mom we're living in a tighter world
than our male counterparts and when they

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020
than our male counterparts and when they
 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.840
than our male counterparts and when they
play sports you hear the referee's

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850
play sports you hear the referee's
 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.970
play sports you hear the referee's
whistle going off way more and so I

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980
whistle going off way more and so I
 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.620
whistle going off way more and so I
think it's also important that to train

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630
think it's also important that to train
 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.940
think it's also important that to train
them to think about the world they're

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950
them to think about the world they're
 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.150
them to think about the world they're
living in to think about how they

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160
living in to think about how they
 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.610
living in to think about how they
themselves are you know going out in the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620
themselves are you know going out in the
 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.520
themselves are you know going out in the
world are going to be subject to the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530
world are going to be subject to the
 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.990
world are going to be subject to the
strength of norms and to try to think

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000
strength of norms and to try to think
 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.730
strength of norms and to try to think
about how to negotiate that

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740
 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.800
