JOHNNY LEE: Hi.

00:00:00.695 --> 00:00:02.460
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.660
Thank you very much.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.030
Welcome to day
two of Google I/O,

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.982
and thanks for joining
me this afternoon.

00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:12.190
Hopefully, the sun hasn't
been too hard on your skin,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.260
and you're not too sunburned.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.820
So today, we'll be talking
about Project Tango

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.840
and why we're pushing on this
technology, what we have today,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.440
and I want to share with
you a little bit about where

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.160
we hope to go in the future.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.870
The road ahead of us
is really exciting,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.671
and I thank you for
following us on this journey.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.800
So when we open our eyes,
something really amazing

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.700
happens.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.510
Light and shadow enter our eyes.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.540
And a large part of our brain--
our whole visual cortex--

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.750
starts to go to work and
interprets these signals

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.400
into edges and shapes.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.590
And we start to build
a memory of things.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.075
We start to recognize what
our environment looks like.

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:05.450
We know what our
room looks like.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.030
We know what our
home looks like.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.290
And we start learning
the space around us.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.710
And as we learn
our space, we start

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.800
to get familiar with
where it's safe to walk,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.860
where it's not safe to walk,
and how we adjust our movements

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.300
even in the slightest way to
avoid bumping into things.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.670
And if any of you
are parents, you

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.250
are intimately familiar with,
or can appreciate, the dangers

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.150
and pains of misjudging
your space around you, even

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.950
just by a few inches.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.760
And some of the things
in our environment

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.750
are even more important
to judge correctly.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.470
Even as adults, when
the lights go out,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.360
we can sometimes
take for granted

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.030
how important vision is to us.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.470
We start to fumble around
and walk very cautiously.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.410
And the few inches can be the
difference between safe passage

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.610
or a dangerous fall.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.660
So our ability to
navigate our space

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.430
is pretty fundamental
to our everyday lives.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.500
So just a reminder,
Project Tango

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.570
is our focused goal to give our
mobile devices and our tools

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.290
this similar level of
perception of space and movement

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.550
and, ideally, ultimately unify
how people think about space

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.680
and how our tools
think about space.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.480
More and more, our
phones have become

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.942
increasingly sophisticated
with more functionality.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.490
Phones used to be phones.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.560
It's actually hard
to remember that.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.250
But now they have cameras that
allow us to augment our memory,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.940
communicate visually with
friends and partners.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.740
The sensors, which
humbly started

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.430
to help just with automatic
screen orientation,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.790
like accelerometers
and gyroscopes,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.780
now provide a source of
potentially health analytics

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.520
and even activity awareness for
pattern recognition and context

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.660
awareness.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.490
And now we're getting
accustomed to simply

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.150
being able to unlock our
phones simply by touching them.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.030
And this, then, becomes the
foundation for mobile payments.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.250
So the ability to track
position and track movement

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.500
and measure the environment
are such fundamental parts

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.175
of how we operate as
people that we see it

00:03:18.175 --> 00:03:20.660
as an inevitable direction.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.270
And in fact, we're starting
to see consumer products

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.330
coming out in the
past 12 months that

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.090
start to incorporate
these capabilities

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.510
of positional tracking that
enable new user experiences

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.410
or advanced computer
vision to do collision

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.610
avoidance in the drone space.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.510
So just a quick reminder,
Project Tango devices

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.800
give three capabilities.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.010
There's motion tracking,
which is the ability

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.710
to respond to physical movement,
so when I walk forward, left,

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.400
or right.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.580
Depth perception,
which is the ability

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.710
to measure the
distance to floors,

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.550
the walls, and surfaces.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.110
And area learning, which is
basically the device's ability

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.120
to have some spatial
memory-- to recognize

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.550
places it's been before.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.200
And that can be used to
help with drift correction

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.420
or enable multi-player
experiences in the same space.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.450
Now we've had a few sessions
at Google I/O going deeper

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.450
into some of these topics, so I
won't be going into much detail

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.710
here.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.720
But to achieve these
new capabilities,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.911
we actually have to
introduce new hardware.

00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:30.660
And if you've been
following very closely,

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.979
you'll be familiar
with some of these.

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.270
But I want to give you a sense.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.640
It started about three
years ago with a drawing

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.170
that looked like
this, which is just

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.910
a proposal for a tablet
that has new sensors

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.240
to do tracking, depth sensing,
and [INAUDIBLE] measurement

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.280
units.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.510
And so a few months
later in 2013,

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.290
we had our very first
Android prototype.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.010
Now it was a very
clunky, bulky prototype.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.370
And it worked, but it
wasn't very pretty.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.870
But you can start
to see that it had

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.560
the first components that we
needed to do Project Tango.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.040
We have a sensor dedicated
for motion tracking.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.220
We have integrated
depth sensing,

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.160
and then hardware
accelerated vision processing

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.895
to do all the computer vision.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.300
A few months later,
we pushed ourselves

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.750
to drive down on size.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.220
And we started using mobile
phone class components

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.920
and mobile phone class cameras.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.730
And this is important for
manufacturability and cost

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.060
down as well as power reduction.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.350
So you may have seen
these as the white phones

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.380
a few years ago.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.220
Then we decided to
really push the limits

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.210
on processing power with
our tablet development kits.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.870
And this is what we
showed off last year.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.640
These include, again, the
same three components.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.460
And the specifications
for this tablet

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.315
were actually well
ahead of their time.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:52.780
The specifications in
terms of processing power

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.320
and RAM and GPU
capability are only

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.104
now being matched by phones
being released today,

00:05:59.104 --> 00:05:59.770
two years later.

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:03.870
Over the past year,
one of the things

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.560
that we've been doing a lot is
working heavily with Qualcomm

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.950
to integrate support
for these new hardware

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.700
components into their Snapdragon
processor board support

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.630
package, or BSP.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.810
And for those of you who
are familiar with how

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.550
mobile devices are made, the
BSP is a package of software

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.910
that phone
manufacturers, or OEMs,

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.990
receive when they want
to build a new phone.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.970
And so this required creating
new hardware abstraction

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.530
layers, new changes
to the camera

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.630
stack to allow not only
the RGB camera to work,

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.000
the motion tracking camera
to work, and the depth sensor

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.010
to work all at the same
time, but also things

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.970
like accurate time stamping.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.660
And so this means
that any OEM that

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.940
wants to build a
Snapdragon-based phone

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.500
will already have the
major components they need

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.000
to make a Tango-enabled device.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So this unlocks the possibility
for more phones as well as

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.470
more form factors, such
as wearables and robotics,

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.710
in coming years.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.570
And we're eager to see the
incorporation of these features

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.440
into those products.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.600
Now the first of these
products is the Lenovo phone

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.980
that we've been working
with over the past year.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.250
You've probably heard
about it from CES.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.100
And you can also see
that it maintains

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.960
the same pedigree in terms of
the hardware components inside.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.020
We have the depth sensor,
the motion tracking sensor,

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.720
and our vision processing.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.750
Now unfortunately, we won't be
talking much about the phone

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.110
today.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.170
You'll have to wait
for Lenovo's Tech World

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.110
on June 9 in just a few weeks.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.570
But the event will
be live streamed

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.600
for those who can't attend.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.410
Now the hardware is
just part of the story.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.290
And in fact, most of
the Project Tango team

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.220
is composed of the software.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.584
So when you combine
all this data,

00:07:49.584 --> 00:07:51.250
you have to put it
together into a stack

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.810
to interpret the signals
into motion and sensing.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.270
So I wanted to give
you a short video

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.110
montage of some of
the journey that we

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.830
have from our very
humble beginnings

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.479
when we were a very small
team to where we are today.

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:04.520
Could you play the video?

00:08:07.514 --> 00:08:11.506

00:10:44.685 --> 00:10:46.641
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:54.630
JOHNNY LEE: So I'm also
really happy to say

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.660
that we've actually incorporated
the basic fundamental APIs

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.720
for Tango into
Android N. So what

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.220
that means is that if you
target an Android N device,

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.290
you'll be able to see
some new sensor types.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.970
You'll see the 6-DOF sensor as
well as a depth sensor camera

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:11.560
type.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.200
And this means that you'll
start to be able to write games

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.350
that respond to
the user's motion

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.260
or be able to write
apps that can measure

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.450
the environment and some of the
things you saw in the video.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:27.190
Now, remember, it's important
to know that these devices will

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.020
only have the APIs
enabled on devices

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.350
that have the right hardware.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.000
This is similar to GPS.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.040
If you don't have
GPS modules inside,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.990
the APIs won't be enabled.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.069
And on devices which meet our
Project Tango specifications,

00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:41.610
there'll be additional
libraries that

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:45.710
help with things like area
learning, depth, and meshing,

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.029
as well as augmented
reality samples that

00:11:48.029 --> 00:11:50.320
have to do with things like
time stamping and alignment

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.740
with the RGB camera.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.040
But the integration with
the Snapdragon processor

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.160
BSP as well as
integration into Android N

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.190
lays the groundwork for
many, many new devices

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.690
to come out with
these capabilities.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.160
So let me give you
some live demos

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
of some of those components
working in action.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.240
So if we could switch
over to the tablet

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.575
and bring down the lights.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.050
So this is just a
reminder of what's

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.420
happening underneath the hood.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.780
This is our motion
tracking sensor.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.310
You can see it's
a fisheye camera

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.600
with hardware-accelerated
feature tracks.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.140
And you see in the
upper right-hand corner

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.250
how it responds to movement.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.470
And so this is the
underlying piece

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.730
of what the 6-DOF
APIs will provide you

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.700
if you write an
app in Android N.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.880
And I can walk to this
side of the stage,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.130
walk to this side of the stage,
wave the device up and down.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.635
Wave it up and
down, and it tracks.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.250
So one of the things
we want to give

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.130
to people who receive
a Tango device,

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.430
a bit of a tutorial
on what it's like

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.050
to have these new
capabilities in their phone.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.780
So this is an out-of-the-box
experience that we've built

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.687
inside of Unity using our APIs.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.530
And so you can see it uses
a depth sensor to actually

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:23.400
provide a point cloud
of the environment

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.660
and illustrates the fact
that we're indeed capturing

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.282
a 3D model of the scene.

00:13:29.282 --> 00:13:30.365
And we have some visitors.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.750
And if we walk forward,
we can get closer to them.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.588
You see the edge
of the stage there.

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:44.473
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.480
So as I look around, I can
get closer to the flowers.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.007
And it starts to build this
virtual environment around me

00:13:59.007 --> 00:14:00.090
with plants and creatures.

00:14:04.875 --> 00:14:06.500
And then we're visited
by some friends.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.991
There we go.

00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:16.440
AUDIENCE: Ah.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.428
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:48.248 --> 00:14:50.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.170
JOHNNY LEE: So you can create
really wonderful experiences

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.800
when you combine all the
different pieces together--

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.510
you combine tracking
with depth sensing

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.820
and the passthrough
camera to transition

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.820
between a hand-held VR
experience and a hand-held AR

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.670
experience.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:18.970
Now we can get down to slightly
more utilitarian use cases.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.900
Actually, I want to keep
the lights down for this.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.020
And so this is our
updated measurement app.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.484
We just call it Measure It.

00:15:27.484 --> 00:15:29.150
And what it does is
it shows another way

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:33.080
of combining the APIs to
provide value to the user.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:38.020
So if we wanted to measure
the width of this cabinet,

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.310
you can see that we actually
have a slightly updated

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.050
UI here.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.720
We have this circular
radical with a green dot

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.799
that wobbles around.

00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:47.090
The reason why there's a
wobble is because what it does

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.690
is it looks for interesting
features to lock onto.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.730
So when I get
close to this edge,

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.100
you can actually see it snaps
to the edge of the cabinet.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.720
And what this does,
it allows me to get

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.034
a very good snap of that wall.

00:16:01.034 --> 00:16:02.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.570
We can also do something
a little bit fancier.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:18.520
So let me place a marker there.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.508
And it also tries to
maintain right angles.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:29.150
But what's also very cool
is we can now do volumes.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:33.070
So if I walk backwards, I can
actually strike out a box.

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.958
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:40.994 --> 00:16:42.910
And you can see all the
different measurements

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.110
overlaid onto the edge.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:48.170
So that's two foot, four inches
thereabouts on each dimension.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:54.560
And if I take a picture of this,
it'll save it to my gallery.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.110
And so if I'm working on some
new cabinetry or kitchen work,

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.514
I can simply take this picture.

00:16:59.514 --> 00:17:00.930
And you can see
on the right side,

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.760
it shows a picture
on the left side,

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.700
but then a schematic
view on the right side

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.203
where it shows an
orthographic view.

00:17:06.203 --> 00:17:08.369
And you can take this to
the hardware store and say,

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:11.910
this is approximately the size
of the cabinets I'm working on.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.744
Now being able to understand
the physical size of things

00:17:22.744 --> 00:17:23.660
is really interesting.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.140
So this is an app
from Wayfair, who's

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.630
one of the world's largest
online retailers of furniture.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.830
And when you're shopping
online for furniture,

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.250
you typically have to
scroll through a large set

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.645
of thumbnails of
couches and lamps.

00:17:36.645 --> 00:17:39.020
And you have to guess-- oh,
will you keep the lights down

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.480
for this, actually?

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.725
You sort of have to
guess, how big is it?

00:17:42.725 --> 00:17:44.350
Is it actually going
to fit in my room?

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.950
Do I have enough space?

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.550
So what Wayfair
has done is started

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.680
working with furniture
suppliers to acquire

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:56.240
3D models of the furniture
in their web store.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.570
So I have all small
collection here.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.910
And we can select some items.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.630
And let me see how
this chair looks.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:08.330
And if I pick a place
on the floor, I drop it.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.400
That's the loading progress bar.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.844
And it unpacks the
box in front of me.

00:18:13.844 --> 00:18:15.792
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.970
So again, we get all the
correct dimensions of the chair.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.070
We can look at it
from different angles.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.430
We can decide if
we like the fabric

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:31.080
or how many chairs we can
actually get into the space.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.282
So let me pick another item.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.230
You can see this lonely
table right here.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.010
So let's pick this lamp.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.650
Again, that's a 3D progress bar.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.240
And we can lay down the
lamp on top of the table

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.200
and do the same thing.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.970
Now you'll notice on
the bottom, there's

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.305
actually this shopping
cart with a plus button.

00:18:56.305 --> 00:18:58.060
I'm not connected to
the Wi-Fi right now,

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.990
but that button actually works.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.910
It will actually populate
Wayfair's main mobile app.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.860
And you can then make
the purchase there.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.820
So this actually helps
a lot because one

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.444
of the problems with
online retailers,

00:19:10.444 --> 00:19:11.860
especially in the
furniture space,

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.720
is that you often
get a lot of returns.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.250
And so what this can
do is prevent or reduce

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:20.520
the amount of issues
that you'll have.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.450
Now this one, we can
keep the lights up.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:29.130
So you'll see I actually
have this other toy here.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:30.920
And one of the
things, of course,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.000
we can do-- the
measurement and shopping.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.110
But another thing
we can do is games.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.860
Now some of you at
I/O last year may

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.200
have seen a version of
this kind of mechanic.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.330
But this is a demo where
it's a much simplified

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.940
version to give you a sense
of the subtlety and the type

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.291
of interaction you can enable.

00:19:50.291 --> 00:19:52.290
So the volume may be a
little high for this one.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:52.870
We'll check.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:53.425
We'll see.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.270
There we go.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:02.900
So this is basically a
target practice game.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.380
And you imagine you're
in a training scenario.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:11.610
And I can look around and see
all the different targets.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.680
Now if I just stand in one
place and pull the trigger,

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.110
it actually shoots this
kickball back at me.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.042
I see this red ball.

00:20:20.042 --> 00:20:21.500
And it comes and
[SHATTERING SOUND]

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.180
hits me back in the face.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.064
In order to do
well in this game,

00:20:25.064 --> 00:20:27.230
you actually have to dodge
the ball that comes back.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.490
So if I shoot and take a step
to the side, [SHATTERING SOUND]

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:34.080
you can see that the
ball goes past my head.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.670
So if you actually really
want to do well at this game,

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.054
you have to constantly move.

00:20:39.054 --> 00:20:51.990
[SHATTERING SOUNDS]
[AIR HORN] [SHATTERING SOUNDS]

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.870
And you can also see
there's this tree here

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.890
[SHATTERING SOUND] that you
actually have to look around

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:01.570
to see all the targets.
[SHATTERING SOUNDS] So

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.960
that's just another example of
the range of experiences you

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.946
can do.

00:21:05.946 --> 00:21:07.918
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:16.298 --> 00:21:17.923
I got to get the
device out of the rig.

00:21:17.923 --> 00:21:19.342
There we go.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.690
So this last demo is actually
from the American Museum

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.850
of Natural History in New York.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.720
And what they have
there is an exhibit

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.180
on the evolution of
dinosaurs to modern birds.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.129
And this app was
built in conjunction

00:21:38.129 --> 00:21:39.170
with the help of Guidigo.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.780
And what they've done is
they've taken-- sorry,

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.254
I'm a little bit out of breath.

00:21:43.254 --> 00:21:43.754
Whew.

00:21:46.409 --> 00:21:48.450
But what they've done is
they've taken the assets

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.620
from their exhibit in
the museum and allowed

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.410
you to create an AR experience
at home with those assets.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:56.910
So let's bring the
lights back down.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.870
So we have on the
right, it's actually

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.620
similar to the
furniture shopping app.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.995
You can now search
for dinosaurs.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.210
So we all love the velociraptor.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:44.290
Thanks to "Jurassic
Park," that's

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.881
a very well-understood creature.

00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:51.130
So the polygonal model is
actually the aesthetic style

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.020
they chose for the exhibit.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.390
And they chose it to
maintain scientific accuracy

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:59.130
because they don't actually know
the exact details of the skin

00:22:59.130 --> 00:22:59.780
texture.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.730
And so rather than
have a false texture,

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:04.540
they decided to give a
more abstract figure.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.120
So you can see, he's
here in front of me.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.660
He's interacting.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.830
If I push this little
plus button on the right,

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:15.950
he actually pauses and
gives me these info buttons.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:19.545
So if I walk up to the
tail, I can click on it.

00:23:19.545 --> 00:23:21.420
And it gives me a little
bit more information

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.072
about this particular
feature of the body.

00:23:25.072 --> 00:23:27.920
Or I go here, and I can
learn a little bit more

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.070
about his wings.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.770
Now, what's also cute is if I
could have my lovely assistant

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.490
come up-- Clay [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.470
Let me start it over so
the animation will play.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.910
They've actually added
this little camera button

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:51.990
on the bottom.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.970
And you can essentially
do dinosaur selfies here.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.046
Three, two, one.

00:24:06.046 --> 00:24:08.762
There you go.

00:24:08.762 --> 00:24:10.220
And then email this
to your friend.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.452
Thanks, Clay.

00:24:11.452 --> 00:24:13.414
[APPLAUSE AND WHISTLES]

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.760
Actually, this one demo,
we'll see if it works.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.360
I actually didn't test
this one quite as much.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.290
But if it works, it'll be fun.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.200
So some dinosaurs are big.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.770
There we go.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.660
So he doesn't look too big, but
if you go in the upper right,

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.220
that's because he's at 20% size.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.130
And we have a little
plus button here,.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.040
And we can start to get
a picture of exactly how

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.840
big he is in real life.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.730
There you go.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:58.070
Hey buddy. [DINOSAUR ROAR]
He's harmless.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.360
He's friendly.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.996
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.030
So let's go back to the slides.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.470
So you just saw
five or six demos

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:16.350
of apps that are either
already in the Play store

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.050
or in progress for
launch later this year.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.550
And this is just
a small selection

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:24.250
of dozens of apps that are
already in the Play store.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.980
So I want to give you a
quick little montage of some

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.930
of the other apps that
are in progress that I

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.570
didn't have time to demo today.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:31.340
So play the video.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.336
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:33.336 --> 00:25:35.332
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:52.058 --> 00:27:54.054
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:54.054 --> 00:27:56.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:01.437 --> 00:28:03.020
JOHNNY LEE: So just
a reminder, if you

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.020
want to build a Project
Tango enabled app,

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.600
you use standard Android
development processes

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.400
and tools and publishing.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.290
Your app just goes
up on the Play store,

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.240
and your app has
access to the APIs

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.140
and detects them if
they're on the device.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:21.080
So we have C, C++, Java, Unity,
and Unreal support with sample

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:21.880
code.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.900
And you can actually
write one APK

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.350
that you can distribute
to all Android devices.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:27.990
And if you have the
right code in it,

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:30.585
if it gets downloaded on
a Tango-enabled device,

00:28:30.585 --> 00:28:35.060
you can check for those APIs and
unlock new features in your app

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:38.310
with a single distribution.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:40.690
So that's where we are.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:43.690
But obviously, the thing
we started with Tango

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.470
is sort of a journey.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.167
And we're definitely
not done with that

00:28:48.167 --> 00:28:50.000
because we're very much
in the early stages.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.580
And I know almost
everybody says that.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.747
But I actually
really believe that.

00:28:54.747 --> 00:28:56.830
We're really just starting
to scratch the surface.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:00.240
These APIs just start to unlock
very superficial capabilities

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.440
of what you can start to
do with basic movement.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.550
But completely understanding
our environment

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:08.360
and the objects
in it is actually

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.730
still an open challenge.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.890
For example, I know
that the podium here

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:18.080
has walls on the back
sides of the podium,

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.160
but my device actually
doesn't know that yet.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.420
The depth sensor only tells
it about the front surfaces.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.200
It also doesn't know that
the podium is potentially

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.090
composed of many, many
different objects.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.470
There's a shelf here and
some equipment underneath.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:34.930
And it treats it basically
as one large set of geometry.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:39.200
So we also can't
tell, for example,

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.400
what the amphitheater
might look like at night

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.480
simply by seeing it
once during the day.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.980
And that's something
we've developed

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.760
this immense human capacity
and experience to actually

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.120
be able to do.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.650
And these problems
aren't actually

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:53.760
going to be solved in the
next one to two years.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.440
So we actually view that it's
similar to these other efforts.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.750
Working on improved
speech understanding

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.450
so that you can have more
sophisticated interactions

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.600
with just your voice.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.460
We can allow cars to
navigate traffic and safely

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.150
transport us home.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.790
Or investments in machine
learning like AlphaGo

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:17.490
to tackle increasingly
difficult or ambiguous problems.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.280
So the Project Tango
team is invested

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.730
in focusing on giving our
tools this perception of space

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:28.330
and movement at a human scale.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.900
And we actually believe
we can't do it alone.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.630
The challenges here are so
large that many of the things,

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:37.700
just like the ones
I described to you,

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.610
are built on
decades of research.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:43.060
And Tango, really,
is no different.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.140
Some of the same concepts used
in our sensor fusion stack

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.040
have pedigree in the work
done for space exploration

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.320
and robotics.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.860
The researchers had to
combine the raw data

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:57.300
from the cameras and the
IMU data on the rovers

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.570
to estimate its motion on Mars.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.750
And even some of
the researchers that

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.350
worked on this
original Rover are

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:06.180
involved in Project
Tango in various ways.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.570
So we stand on the
shoulders of giants.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:12.402
And taking on this understanding
is really no small task.

00:31:12.402 --> 00:31:13.860
And it's actually
the reason why we

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.560
maintain a very open
collaboration with research

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.940
partners.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.880
And in fact, we have over 10
research partner institutions--

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.460
either research labs
or universities--

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:26.680
that we fund for
doing research work.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.240
Over 26 conference journals,
conference papers or journals,

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.560
and 25 PhDs and master's
students in various ways

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.150
have been involved
in the project,

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:40.640
all contributing over 50,000
lines of open source code.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.740
Now I want to show you
a quick video of things

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.140
that are in progress or
in development as part

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.384
of these research efforts.

00:31:47.384 --> 00:31:48.800
Some of these are
done internally,

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.880
but also some of them are
done by our external partners.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.020
And these aren't things that
are committed to the product

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.040
roadmap, but they're
very much thinking

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.600
about the direction
we want to go

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.970
and things we hope to one
day become mature enough

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:02.499
to be developer tools.

00:32:02.499 --> 00:32:03.790
So if we could play this video.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.782
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.762

[END PLAYBACK]

00:35:45.556 --> 00:35:47.532
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.430
JOHNNY LEE: So just as with
the introduction of GPS,

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:01.270
it enabled new industries
and new functionality that

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:03.160
wasn't really possible before.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.600
But as these technologies
find their way

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.320
into phones and
into our pockets,

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.260
it suddenly became possible
to navigate new spaces.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.940
You can now press
a button and a car

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.580
will appear and drive to you.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:20.320
You can find the nearest
pizza or find a friend nearby.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.540
And the impact of
the technology far

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:26.870
exceeds what it was first
initially conceived for.

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:29.280
And so we imagine,
wouldn't it be

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.000
great to have a tool
that would allow

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.930
you to find rooms and places
that you've never been before?

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:37.090
Or wouldn't it be great
to have a device that

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:40.320
could help the visually
impaired navigate through spaces

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.630
with greater confidence
or greater independence?

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.640
It would be great if
emergency workers had

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.520
a tool that could
let them estimate

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.910
the positions of their
teammates in a disaster

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:53.860
area in real time.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.540
Or it would be great
to have the ability

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:58.180
to walk through stories
without tethers or cables.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:03.430
It would be great if we
could increase the speed

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.210
or efficiency of
package delivery

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:09.330
or even allow supplies to
reach remote locations.

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.460
And one day, it would be nice
to have robotic systems that

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.140
share our perception
of physical space

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:19.780
to be better collaborators
with their human counterparts.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.680
So we're seeking people who
want to build a future with us.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.420
And we want to find
colleagues in this space.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.949
So just a reminder,
everything you just saw,

00:37:29.949 --> 00:37:31.740
including the things
in the research video,

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.320
were done with our Tango
tablets and the data

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.090
that they're actually
able to capture.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:38.280
And these are available
on the Google Store today.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.400
You can find the link
from our website.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.410
And later this year, we'll
see the first consumer device

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:47.530
with these capabilities in it
with the project with Lenovo.

00:37:50.075 --> 00:37:51.950
I also want to give a
shout out and thank you

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:54.220
for all the partners that
we have demo-ing here

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.370
at the Sandbox or
were participating

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:57.719
in the panel earlier today.

00:37:57.719 --> 00:37:59.760
If you haven't had a chance
to go to the Sandbox,

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.135
I think it's right
by that corner

00:38:01.135 --> 00:38:04.980
and you can try
some of the demos.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.170
In the after hours this evening,
we also have a treat for you.

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:11.320
We actually have a
20-person multi-player game

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.600
where you can battle
against aliens

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.030
in a game called Phantogeist
from Tricksy Studios.

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:19.920
It'll be 8:00 PM in the
Cassiopeia tent, which

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.630
I think is in that direction.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.490
So that should be fun.

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:26.690
There's also a dedicated
session tomorrow

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:30.130
on making six degree of freedom
gaming with Project Tango.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:34.720
So I encourage you to see
that tomorrow at 10:00 AM.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.010
And we want to help.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.600
Now, we don't have an infinite
number of people on our team

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.360
to do it, but there are
some mechanics-- ways

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.580
that we try to help you
create really great apps.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.140
First of all, we have
periodic workshops.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.140
We have developer
engineering support.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.000
We also have the opportunity
to feature your app on devices

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.770
that may be coming out or
featuring it in our Tango app

00:38:55.770 --> 00:39:00.010
portal if you work with us.

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:01.800
We can connect
clients with partners.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.549
We talk with a lot of
different companies.

00:39:03.549 --> 00:39:04.980
And sometimes,
people have assets

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.540
and they simply need
a viewing application,

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.320
or there are opportunities
for connections that we

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.600
might be able to help with.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.420
And periodically, we
have application RFPs

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:18.190
or even competitions
we'll announce.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:21.350
So to keep in touch,
we have our website.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:23.290
We have our support email.

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:28.220
We also have a reasonably robust
Google+ page with over 8,000

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.900
developers regularly posting
updates about related news

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.570
as well as their own apps
and their Twitter handle.

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.910
So I'll leave this page
up for those of you

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:39.790
that want a picture of it.

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:41.100
Thank you very much for coming.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.550
