00:00:00.535 --> 00:00:02.136
Let's think about the pay off diagram

00:00:02.136 --> 00:00:04.003
for just owning the stock or we can say

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:07.136
"going long the stock", which
is really just owning it.

00:00:07.136 --> 00:00:09.618
If we think about just
the underlying asset value

00:00:09.618 --> 00:00:11.737
and we're talking about
the value at some date

00:00:11.737 --> 00:00:13.867
and, you know, and traditionally
we're talking about some

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:16.937
maturity date for some options,
but the value at maturity

00:00:16.937 --> 00:00:19.137
but at some date we have in our mind.

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:21.728
So if we're thinking about just the value,

00:00:21.728 --> 00:00:24.951
if on that date the
underlying stock price is 50,

00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:28.034
then the value of holding
the stock is going to be 50.

00:00:28.034 --> 00:00:30.603
If the value of the underlying stock is 0,

00:00:30.603 --> 00:00:32.469
then the value of owning
stock is going to be 0.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.869
If the value of the
underlying stock is 70,

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:37.136
then the value of the
stock is going to be 70.

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:39.950
So you just have this very
simple line payoff diagram.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.702
It's just whatever the
underlying stock price,

00:00:41.702 --> 00:00:44.803
that is the value of the asset
because you just own the stock.

00:00:44.803 --> 00:00:47.678
If you think about it from a
profit and loss point of view,

00:00:47.678 --> 00:00:50.868
you break even if on that
day since you're paying

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:53.145
$50 per share for it today,

00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:55.729
if on whatever day we're talking about,

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:57.576
the stock price at some future date,

00:00:57.576 --> 00:01:01.209
at maturity for some ...
for some type of option.

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:04.966
You paid 50. If the value is
50, then you're at break even.

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:08.337
If the value is at 0,
then you just lost $50.

00:01:08.337 --> 00:01:10.785
So you're going to be at -50 over here.

00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:13.369
If the value of the stock
price on that day goes to

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.264
60, 70, 80, 90, 100,
then you just made $50.

00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:19.537
So it's going to be this
point right up here.

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:23.137
Your profit will be 50. So
you see, a payoff diagram

00:01:23.137 --> 00:01:24.824
that looks something like this.

00:01:24.824 --> 00:01:26.961
And once again, the only
difference between this payoff

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:30.368
diagram and that payoff diagram
is that this one right here

00:01:30.368 --> 00:01:34.470
is shifted down by $50
to incorporate the price

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.851
that you paid for it. Now,
let's say this is what happens

00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:38.680
if you just buy the stock
and let's say you want to buy

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.952
the stock and let's say,
you want to buy the stock,

00:01:39.952 --> 00:01:41.527
but you want to mitigate
your downside risk.

00:01:41.527 --> 00:01:43.640
You want to buy some
insurance on your stock.

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:45.651
You want to mitigate the downside.

00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:48.250
So what you can do is, you
can literally just also buy a

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.388
put option, maybe with a
strike price right at $50.

00:01:51.388 --> 00:01:54.781
You want to mitigate your
downside if the stock goes

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.247
below 50 and if you do that
and I'll only do it on this

00:01:57.247 --> 00:02:00.251
payoff diagram, you could just
shift it down for this one.

00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:01.516
What would it look like?

00:02:01.516 --> 00:02:04.583
Well, just the put options
payoff diagram looks like this.

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:06.805
We've already drawn. Let me
try to do that in the color

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:09.581
of the put option. We've
already done that in a previous

00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:11.315
video. It looks something like this.

00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:14.471
If the underlying stock price
is 0, then the put option is

00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:17.250
worth 50 because you can buy
it for 0 ... Buy the stock

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.183
for 0 and then you have
the right to sell it for 50

00:02:20.183 --> 00:02:22.581
and then the value of the put
option is worthless if the

00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:24.850
stock can actually be sold for 50,

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.555
then you wouldn't exercise the put option.

00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:28.445
But what happens if you own both?

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.580
If you own both at maybe
the maturity of the option,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.211
if the stock is worth 0,
your stock part is worth 0

00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:38.783
but the option is worth
50, so the combination

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:40.725
is going to be worth 50.

00:02:40.725 --> 00:02:44.555
If the stock is worth 25 ...
If the stock is worth 25,

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:46.514
then the put option is also worth 25.

00:02:46.514 --> 00:02:48.916
So if you own both of them,
the combination is going

00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:52.305
to be worth 50. If the stock
is worth 50, the put option

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:56.479
is worth 0. You own the combination
is going to be worth 50.

00:02:56.516 --> 00:02:59.922
Anything above 50, the put
option is just worth 0 but

00:02:59.922 --> 00:03:01.864
then you have the value of the stock.

00:03:01.864 --> 00:03:06.711
So the stock + the put would
look like this payoff diagram,

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.914
would just look like this
payoff diagram right over here.

00:03:09.914 --> 00:03:12.222
So when you look at this,
what happened is we'll get all

00:03:12.222 --> 00:03:14.582
of the upside if the stock goes above 50,

00:03:14.582 --> 00:03:16.637
but we've mitigated our downside.

00:03:16.637 --> 00:03:21.450
This is ... This right here
is the stock + the put option.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.448
And what you see here is the
put is acting as insurance.

00:03:24.448 --> 00:03:26.981
When people talk about buying
insurance on a position,

00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:30.809
they're usually talking
about buying a put option.

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.626
And of course if we were to
draw the same graph over here

00:03:33.626 --> 00:03:35.515
we would shift it down
by the amount you pay

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:38.723
for the stock and for the
$10 that you're paying for

00:03:38.723 --> 00:03:41.852
the put option. So, you
would shift this graph down

00:03:41.852 --> 00:03:45.155
by $60 because that's what it
pays ... what it costs to go

00:03:45.155 --> 00:03:46.967
into this position.
