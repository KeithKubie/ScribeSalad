00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.219
Few individuals have influenced the world
and many of today's thinkers like Plato.

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.799
One 20th century philosopher 
even went so far

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.129
as to describe all of Western philosophy
as a series of footnotes to Plato.

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:24.390
He created the first Western university

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.330
and was teacher to Ancient Greece's 
greatest minds,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.129
including Aristotle.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:32.731
But even one of the founders of philosophy
wasn't perfect.

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:34.249
Along with his great ideas,

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:38.640
Plato had a few that haven't 
exactly stood the test of time.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.359
So here are brief rundowns
of a few of his best and worst ideas.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.829
Plato argued that beyond
our imperfect world

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.049
was a perfect unchanging world of Forms.

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:57.556
Forms are the ideal versions of the things
and concepts we see around us.

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:01.761
They serve as a sort of instruction
manual to our own world.

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:05.581
Floating around the world of Forms
is the ideal tree,

00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:07.581
and the ideal YouTube channel,

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:09.391
and even the ideal justice,

00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:11.742
or ideal love.

00:01:11.742 --> 00:01:17.471
Our own reality is comprised of imperfect
copies of ideal Forms.

00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:20.941
Plato argued that philosophers
should strive to contemplate

00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.810
and understand these perfect Forms

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.090
so that they may better navigate
our misleading reality.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.570
While it may seem silly,

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.069
the disconnect between the world
as it appears

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.211
and the greater truth behind it

00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:37.432
is one of philosophy's
most vexing problems.

00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:40.741
It's been the subject of thousands
of pages by theologians,

00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:41.932
philosophers,

00:01:41.932 --> 00:01:44.212
and screenwriters alike.

00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:48.201
It raises questions like should we trust
our senses to come to the truth

00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:50.401
or our own reason?

00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:52.892
For Plato, the answer is reason.

00:01:52.892 --> 00:01:57.753
It alone provides us with at least
the potential to contemplate the Forms.

00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:01.364
But reason didn't always pan out
for Plato himself.

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:04.522
When he sought to situate humankind
amongst the animals,

00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:07.752
he lumped us in with birds.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:11.603
"Featherless bipeds" 
was his official designation.

00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:14.682
Diogenes the Cynic,
annoyed by this definition,

00:02:14.682 --> 00:02:17.992
stormed into Plato's class
with a plucked chicken,

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:22.303
announcing, "Behold. Plato's man."

00:02:22.303 --> 00:02:24.423
But back to a few good ideas.

00:02:24.423 --> 00:02:27.614
Plato is one of the earliest 
political theorists on record,

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:32.425
and with Aristotle, is seen as one 
of the founders of political science.

00:02:32.425 --> 00:02:36.478
He reasoned that being a ruler
was no different than any other craft,

00:02:36.478 --> 00:02:38.614
whether a potter or doctor,

00:02:38.614 --> 00:02:42.827
and that only those who had mastered
the craft were fit to lead.

00:02:42.827 --> 00:02:46.414
Ruling was the craft 
of contemplating the Forms.

00:02:46.414 --> 00:02:52.343
In his Republic, Plato imagined a utopia
where justice is the ultimate goal.

00:02:52.343 --> 00:02:57.185
Plato's ideal city seeks a harmonious
balance between its individual parts

00:02:57.185 --> 00:02:59.864
and should be lead by a philosopher king.

00:02:59.864 --> 00:03:01.855
Millennia before his time,

00:03:01.855 --> 00:03:07.643
Plato also reasoned that women were
equally able to rule in this model city.

00:03:07.643 --> 00:03:11.275
Unfortunately, Plato was inconsistent
with women,

00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:13.634
elsewhere likening them to children.

00:03:13.634 --> 00:03:16.923
He also believed that a woman's
womb was a live animal

00:03:16.923 --> 00:03:21.014
that could wander around in her body
and cause illness.

00:03:21.014 --> 00:03:25.017
This bad idea, also espoused by other
contemporaries of Plato,

00:03:25.017 --> 00:03:29.898
was sadly influential for hundreds
of years in European medicine.

00:03:29.898 --> 00:03:34.226
Furthermore, he thought that society
should be divided into three groups:

00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:35.250
producers,

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.360
the military,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.652
and the rulers,

00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:42.997
and that a great noble lie should convince
everyone to follow this structure.

00:03:42.997 --> 00:03:44.775
The noble lie he proposed

00:03:44.775 --> 00:03:50.246
was that we're all born with gold, 
silver, or a mixture of brass and iron

00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:51.825
in our souls,

00:03:51.825 --> 00:03:54.464
which determine our roles in life.

00:03:54.464 --> 00:03:58.027
Some thinkers have gone on
to credit the idea of the noble lie

00:03:58.027 --> 00:04:01.506
as a prototype for 20th century
propaganda,

00:04:01.506 --> 00:04:06.786
and the philosopher king as inspiration
for the dictators that used them.

00:04:06.786 --> 00:04:07.917
Should a few bad ideas

00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:11.817
tarnish Plato's status as one 
of the greatest philosophers in history?

00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:12.987
No!

00:04:12.987 --> 00:04:17.266
Plato gave the leaders and thinkers who
came after him a place to start.

00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:18.406
Through the centuries,

00:04:18.406 --> 00:04:22.336
we've had the chance to test those ideas
through writing and experience,

00:04:22.336 --> 00:04:25.646
and have accepted some
while rejecting others.

00:04:25.646 --> 00:04:29.816
We are continuing to refine,
amend, and edit his ideas

00:04:29.816 --> 00:04:33.056
which have become foundations
of the modern world.
