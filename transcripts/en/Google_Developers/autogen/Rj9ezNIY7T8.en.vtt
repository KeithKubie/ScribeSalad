00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:18.279
 Today is google developer relations Suzuki 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:24.189
 Thank you for coming to Atsushi Nakano of gd of google app of 8 gd today 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:26.710
 Do you want to hear the story in various ways? 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.950
 Apis responsible for chess gd 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.019
 We say Nakamura 3 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.990
 Wrong 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:34.370
 Up once from around 2010 4 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.940
 Beginning to use 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.450
 So especially about club grab script 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.220
 Do talks and study sessions 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.450
 Something like writing news or something like that from around 2010 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.660
 I saw it 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.380
 Did you buy it for the opportunity to start? 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.140
 That's in the Google App called spreadsheet lost on google io 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:00.470
 In the application of documentation 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:05.630
 I have a spreadsheet, but the system of the script is included in it 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.200
 The good thing is that in the beginning of 2009 I don't know much about it 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.540
 The 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.130
 The fact is that various data when I was touching that little bit when it was 2010 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.800
 You can access to 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.460
 Knowing that it will be automated, this is a routine work you usually do 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.260
 Tally something 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:31.200
 If you exceed that certain threshold you have to send some notification 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.790
 In that time, it would be possible to automate everything that human beings are making decisions 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.790
 Well various details from 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.450
 I'm starting to write a script 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:44.200
 Banquet satipet that is said to be moving every day 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.360
 Mama æƒœ island Jean There may be a sound that can not be a job, but how about yellow people 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.190
 Increase usage 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.770
 The easiest to understand in many cases is that the remaining capacity management device of the disk 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.479
 2 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.630
 For example, if there is a lot of storage for that file, which disk is which 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:07.140
 It is difficult to understand whether it is used only before 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:12.120
 Only the remaining balance is registered in the splash, and the remaining capacity is 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.790
 For example, you can set a key value that cuts 10% keel or 20% and email it only when kicking it 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.709
 If you put out 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:24.579
 Then human beings have something to do with the capacity there since the mail came 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:29.240
 Suddenly 99 parts become 100% and can not write because there is no need to work out that plan 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:34.130
 I think it often happens to notice it, but all that can be avoided 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:39.050
 Conversely, as I mentioned earlier, that kind of server migration style is used 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:45.320
 Besides, there are many places that drink sake in the community as gd 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.830
 I think that it will be designated as a park or something, but whatever the form is exactly 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.230
 this 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.410
 This is a good idea to study Google Apps Gift 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:57.220
 What kind of advice do you want people to start? 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.850
 Who's using and more Fiday routing 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:06.400
 I think it will be useful that 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:09.250
 There are people who think that I'm looking for two kinds of pulling like that one lump 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.410
 That person is usually that way 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.460
 I have touched spreadsheet software like excel, but 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.460
 I'm all done 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.800
 Speaking of people in a team 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.700
 In dealing with that spreadsheet 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:31.480
 The place where children can do it already seems to be script script but how is it? 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.440
 So much skill that it's skill doesn't detail me 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:39.190
 Even for those who say that Google App Script 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:43.600
 Help is also substantial because the threshold of is low 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:46.870
 That's why I want you to use it first and the other is that 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.680
 The people who are the stations of bali bali engines are already 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.050
 Because I can do a part without reading the document, I am a person from the same company 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.489
 Among people in the same community 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.120
 For example, I want to mail one of 1002 barbers 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:05.150
 When I say, I think I'm not so detailed, but I think it's 100 deep 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:09.560
 Instead of using that script, if you actually write 10 seconds of employee sales, it will fall apart 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.140
 I can do something like merge printing, so that's a bit more of that 3 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.290
 I would like people to write off for a place 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.100
 There are roughly two such alternatives. 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:23.330
 I think that the talk of the community came out earlier 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:28.520
 I think it is done in the form of a manager in the community. 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.690
 What kind of activities do we do in the community and now? Most of them 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.129
 The story of is that 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.759
 It is gas now of exhaust gas 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:38.729
 I want to do something like this but I can't even 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:42.990
 That's that of the brain 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:45.210
 Questions and answers but most of the answers are another Mr. Ohashi called g yes 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:50.969
 Well then bang bang 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:57.169
 That's the answer to that faq or in Japanese that much of that failure story 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:58.720
 Since it does not go up to the net mountain, using the community to mail basis Solos 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.160
 Josiah prepared 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.480
 Some advice for those who want to know that you want to have a former bus you want to marry 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.950
 It sounds like 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.420
 What 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:15.770
 For everyone who uses Google Apps 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:19.910
 In fact, it doesn't mean that the other party really has to be something, so for now 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.990
 There is a sense of not only using but also trying to make better use of it 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.280
 If 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.480
 By all means always with the community of google apis Japan 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.090
 Have you look at the flow 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:36.300
 If you don't understand, it won't be interesting anymore. 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.300
 I think the leader Yes thank you for today
