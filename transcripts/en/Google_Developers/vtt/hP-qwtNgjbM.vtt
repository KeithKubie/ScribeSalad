00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:06.220
MORGAN DOLLARD: I'm really
excited to be here today,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.910
and we have an incredible
lineup of products and speakers

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.720
in store for you today.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.740
There's never been a better time
to turn your passion for games

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.120
into a business.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.530
Mobile gaming remains the
fastest growing segment

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.800
of the games industry, and
Android and Google Play

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.290
are at the forefront
of that growth.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.840
Google Play has the most
vibrant, diverse and engaged

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.030
gaming community.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.370
Gaming on Android is
a global phenomenon,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.200
with Google Play
reaching more than 1

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.940
billion monthly active users
in more than 190 countries.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.270
Every year we see more
and more developers

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.985
finding success on our platform,
and over the past year,

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:47.540
the number of games with
over 1 million installs

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.600
has increased by 50%.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.530
That's amazing momentum,
and we're incredibly

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.694
excited to see you succeed.

00:00:55.117 --> 00:00:56.700
So as remarkable as
these numbers are,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.170
you, the games developers, are
the real heroes of this story.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.740
The contributions of developers
like many of you in the room

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.917
were integral to the
adoption of Android.

00:01:04.917 --> 00:01:07.250
So let's give a round of
applause for all the developers

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.670
that helped Android succeed.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.000
Everything my team and
teams across Google do

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.320
are inspired by you,
the games developers,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.140
and the games you make.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.640
You are the ones that
take big risks, that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.560
are pursuing your
passion for games,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.820
for many a passion
since childhood.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.820
You eat, sleep, and
breathe video games.

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.440
If you're inspired by
great games, as we are,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.170
you want to build great games.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.200
You want to create a
new style of gameplay,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.860
find a clever hack
to get the best

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.010
performance from your hardware,
or make your mark on VR gaming.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.900
Once you've built
an amazing game,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.290
you want people to
discover it, and enjoy it.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.040
For that, you need to find
users, the right users,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.794
the ones that will
love your game

00:01:55.794 --> 00:01:57.085
and make it a critical success.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.070
Most of you in here don't
do this as a hobby, though.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.170
You have to turn your
awesome game into a business

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.300
so you can keep making games.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.870
Are you going to
go free-to-play,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.540
are you going to
sell a premium game,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.149
are you going to use
in-app advertising?

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:13.690
There are some tough
choices to make,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.960
and every game has to
find the right balance.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.920
If you have done these
things, then of course

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.003
you'll want to turn a game
into an ongoing service

00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:23.190
to deliver to players,
to keep them coming

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.820
for new content, new
goals, and new ways

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.574
for them to share their
experience with others.

00:02:29.574 --> 00:02:31.240
For the next few
minutes, we'll show you

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.430
how we can help you, the hero
of the story, be successful.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.250
So let's talk about
making great games.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.750
Think about the
games you've played,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.849
the ones that inspired you to
build games in the first place.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.265
What's common among
the best games

00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:46.515
is that they find something
new to deliver to players.

00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:48.630
They push the boundaries
of graphics and sounds

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.780
by integrating deeply with
the platforms they run on.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.350
Mobile technology
is moving fast.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.410
We now have a generation
of mobile devices

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.610
that are near console quality,
and you need powerful tools

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.540
to make them perform.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.105
And Google is
working to bring you

00:03:02.105 --> 00:03:04.480
the newest and best tools to
take full advantage of these

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.065
on Android.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.747
Last week, we announced
the Android N preview,

00:03:10.747 --> 00:03:13.246
and this year we're trying to
give you earlier access so you

00:03:13.246 --> 00:03:15.240
can build and test your
games with the latest

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.260
generation of Android.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.250
Android N contains a lot of new
features for users, including

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.820
improved battery
life and performance,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.180
new interactions
for large screens,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.920
improved accessibility, and
some new security features.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.280
And for game developers, we
have some exciting additions

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.410
to Android N. OpenGL
ES 3.2 support, which

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.600
includes great features
like geometry, tessellation

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.057
changes, and ASTC
compression; and also includes

00:03:42.057 --> 00:03:43.890
new multi-window features,
including support

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.330
for split screen on
phones and tablets,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.960
as well as picture-in-picture
for Android TV.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.440
For data plan
constrained players,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.000
N offers Data Saver, a
foreground-only data usage

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.710
mode, and you'll also be
able to take advantage

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.370
of new notification features
like notification bundling

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.983
and new customization options
for relevant notifications.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.880
Your games also
need to look great,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.360
so a big part of the upcoming
Android platform is Vulkan.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.065
Vulkan is a new 3D
rendering API which

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:15.440
we've helped to develop as a
member of the industry group

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.190
Khronos, which develops open
graphics standards like OpenGL

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.550
ES.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.790
Vulkan provides explicit
low-overhead GPU control

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.730
to developers.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.196
Let's take an example of that,
of Vulkan running on Android.

00:04:29.196 --> 00:04:29.862
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:29.862 --> 00:04:32.718
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:37.932 --> 00:04:41.850
This is our Fish Tornado running
on the Android SHIELD TV.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.980
This demo runs both on desktop
and [AUDIO OUT], the same code,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.158
the same shaders, the same C+.

00:04:47.158 --> 00:04:50.370
The cross-platform shaders
would have been much harder

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.872
with OpenGL ES.

00:04:52.872 --> 00:04:54.970
Vulkan's render pass
system enables Fish Tornado

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.790
to take advantage of
multi-pass rendering

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.520
in ways you couldn't
have with OpenGL ES.

00:05:05.567 --> 00:05:06.150
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.650
In January, we announced
the Spatial Audio edition

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.610
to the Cardboard SDK.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.710
Many apps create simple
versions of Spatial Audio

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.320
by playing sounds from the left
and right in separate speakers,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.190
but with this SDK
[AUDIO OUT], your app

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.690
can produce sound the same
way humans actually hear it.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.400
All your players need is their
smartphone, their headphones,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.600
and their Google
Cardboard viewer.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.930
Overall, the SDK
allows more [AUDIO OUT]

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.470
3D specializations via modeling
the physiology of your head.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.540
This SDK update
gives you the ability

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.000
to put your players in tiny
spaceships, huge caverns,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.970
with even better performance.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.500
Graded audio like this can
make for very immersive games

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.741
and virtual reality apps.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.780
So why do you make games?

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.890
To entertain and delight
your players, of course.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.830
For that to happen, you
actually need players.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.840
Google has a number
of ways for you

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.522
to find and engage
with your audience.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.860
Advertisers have long
been able to control

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.170
who sees their AdWords ads,
and in the coming weeks,

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.711
we'll be launching
even finer options

00:06:07.711 --> 00:06:10.080
to reach high-quality users
with active user targeting

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.740
for games.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.760
This new type of
targeting for Android apps

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.210
can show active users who have
spent more than 30 minutes

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.250
playing games, or played
a Google Play Games

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.610
integrated game.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.920
Game developers can show
their ads to game lovers,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.290
and combined with other
types of targeting,

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.470
such as a particular
game category,

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.100
they can reach a very
precise audience.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.200
Video is also a
powerful way to let

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.710
users see gameplay, graphics,
and features before downloading

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.350
the app.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.349
And we've been exploring
ways to give developers

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:41.560
more opportunities
to connect with users

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.920
or view their game videos
on their mobile device,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.540
and we've discovered
that over 80%

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.960
of video ad views in mobile apps
on the Google Display Network

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.550
start from the devices
held vertically.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.130
Over the next few weeks, we're
launching portrait video ads,

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.930
so users can see a fullscreen,
immersive, portrait video

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.062
experience, without having
to reorient their device.

00:07:05.062 --> 00:07:06.520
We've seen significant
improvements

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.230
in both click-throughs
and conversion rates

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.050
from game developers
using portrait video,

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.200
resulting in a much
lower cost per install

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.820
and a larger number
of downloads.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.102
Search Trial Run Ads
will be in beta soon,

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.560
and will allow
users to stream apps

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.070
directly from ads
on Google Search.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.525
With this new ad format, we're
making it significantly easier

00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:26.900
for you to promote your games
while giving users a chance

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.910
to try a game for
up to 10 minutes

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.635
before choosing to download it
directly from Google Search.

00:07:32.635 --> 00:07:34.760
This is a great way to
drive highly qualified users

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.301
to your game.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.910
For those of you who
are indie developers,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.451
you'll be excited to hear we're
adding a new way to highlight

00:07:43.451 --> 00:07:46.326
you and your games with a new
Indie Corner in the Play Store.

00:07:46.326 --> 00:07:48.200
The Indie Corner is
dedicated to highlighting

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.260
truly amazing and unique
indie games that users love.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.300
Here's how it works.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.910
First, you have to
make a great game.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.346
Submit your game to
participate in the program.

00:07:58.346 --> 00:07:59.820
[AUDIO OUT] games
are then featured

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.040
in the Indie Corner collection
in the Google Play Store.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.600
If your game gets
traction with users

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.160
and achieves
critical acclaim, it

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.620
can ascend and be featured
in the Indie Masterpiece

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.290
[AUDIO OUT], which highlights
the very best games on Google

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.850
Play.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.780
Check it out today.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.821
The Indie Corner collection
is live on the store.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.240
Last month, we launched
gamer IDs and avatars

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.290
to give users an improved
Google Play Games experience.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.310
Users can choose
their own gamer ID

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.010
and avatar, set their privacy
preferences [AUDIO OUT]

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.880
automatically sign into games.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.080
Our sign-in improvements
also benefit developers.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.230
Automatic sign-in can
make it easier and faster

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.690
for players to
start playing games.

00:08:44.386 --> 00:08:47.010
In the next few months, we'll be
adding Gamer Friends to Google

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.350
Play Games so that players
can build connections

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.636
with their friends or gamers
they interact with in-game.

00:08:52.636 --> 00:08:55.000
So you can see some screenshots
of how this will work.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.583
You can find other players based
on either our recommendations

00:08:57.583 --> 00:08:59.380
or invite them to
become friends,

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.130
manage your invitations
through our Inbox,

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.727
and choose to accept or
ignore requests to connect.

00:09:03.727 --> 00:09:06.310
And you'll be able to see what
games your friends are playing,

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.384
helping users discover
new and amazing content

00:09:08.384 --> 00:09:09.675
that they might not know about.

00:09:14.952 --> 00:09:17.160
Gameplay videos are a great
way to drive viral growth

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.506
for your games.

00:09:18.506 --> 00:09:20.380
Late last year, we made
it possible for users

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.890
to record their gameplay with
the Google Play Games app.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.974
Today, we're announcing
that in the coming months,

00:09:25.974 --> 00:09:28.515
players will have the option to
livestream their gameplay, as

00:09:28.515 --> 00:09:29.040
well.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.580
We'll also be
providing an API that

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.860
enables you to easily
add video recording

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.220
and livestreaming to your games.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.690
Monetizing your game is an
important part of this journey.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.106
You can, of course, monetize
directly through Google Play,

00:09:39.106 --> 00:09:41.620
by using in-app purchases,
selling your premium game,

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.790
or using in-app advertising.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.390
Today, we're launching rewarded
ads via AdMob Mediation.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.720
You can now grow your
app's overall ad revenue

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.020
by adding reward-based ads
from third-party providers

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.850
to your app via AdMob Mediation.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.400
Reward-based video
ads enable users

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.030
to earn in-game currency
or items of value

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.280
in exchange for viewing ads.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.110
You choose a reward amount,
you experiment as often

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.720
as you like to find
the optimal amount,

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.880
without having to resubmit your
app to the stores for approval.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.040
AdMob Mediates the ads,
choosing the ones which

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.397
can earn you the most, and ads
will come from third parties.

00:10:19.397 --> 00:10:21.980
We have certified adapters for
leading rewarded ads providers,

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:27.060
such as Chartboost, Vungle,
AppLovin, AdColony, Fyber,

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.162
Upsight, Unity, and
many more coming.

00:10:31.162 --> 00:10:33.120
And now, I'd like to
introduce Ben Frenkel, who

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.930
is a product manager for Play
Games Developer Experiences.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.240
BEN FRENKEL: Thank you, Morgan.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.340
All right, so now you have a
great game, a growing audience,

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.590
and hopefully, hopefully
you've made some revenue.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.710
And as much time and effort as
you spent working on your game

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.430
pre-launch, it's
post-launch we can

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.000
gather enough data
about your users

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.700
to finish tuning your game.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.870
That's why it's important
to think about your game

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:13.250
as an ongoing service you
can deliver to players.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.005
You need to think about
your games as a service.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.150
And you need to do three
things-- three things--

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.320
to manage your
games as a service.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.360
You need to be able to
dynamically make changes

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.900
to the way your games
behave, tailor and optimize

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.010
game experiences for
different player segments,

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.120
and you need the tools
to deeply understand

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.420
what's working and not
working for your players.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.100
Most developers that manage
their games as a service

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.190
can dynamically change almost
everything about the way

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.140
their games behave
from their servers,

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.490
and the best at
this control almost

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.450
every aspect of
their game, including

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.960
their virtual good inventory,
their in-game economy balance,

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.170
the difficulty of
their game, and even

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.600
what promotions to run.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.400
It's a lot of hard work
to set up and manage

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.810
these types of services,
and if you're not

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:12.080
a large studio with a dedicated
server engineering team,

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.570
every single minute you
spend on this type of work

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.500
takes away from the thing
you're really passionate about,

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.010
which is making games.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.880
Well, no more.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.380
We are excited to announce
that Play Games Game Parameters

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.810
Management will be launching
in the coming months

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.470
to make it simple to dynamically
manage the parameters that

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.530
drive your game.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.540
With Game Parameters
Management, you'll

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.520
be able to manage your
virtual good inventory

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.720
and gameplay parameters, manage
your different currencies,

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.800
and create time- and
location-based value overrides.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.970
The time- and
location-based overrides

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.860
are particularly powerful.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.370
Many developers that offer
time-limited content,

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.600
like a new character
or a weapon, still

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.440
have to manually turn on
and off these promotions.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.260
So let's say, for example,
you had a promotion that

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.670
ended at 11:59 on a Sunday;
you might need someone

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.070
from your team to go into
the office and physically

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.370
turn off the promotion.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.990
There's got to be a
better way to do it.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.140
And if you're running a
global games business,

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.000
you want your promotions to be
run at locally relevant times.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.570
And with our time- and
country-based overrides,

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.410
you'll be able to specify
country-specific start and stop

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:33.190
times, and we'll automatically
manage everything for you.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.680
And we've been working with
our partner, Concrete Software,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.790
throughout the development of
Game Parameters Management,

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.980
and they are the real
heroes of the story.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.100
They're the ones that inspired
us to build the Game Parameter

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.440
Management service, because
we saw the opportunity

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.020
to make it easier and
faster and cheaper

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.430
and less error-prone
for Concrete Software

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.540
to manage their
games as a service.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.210
And we're really
fortunate today to have

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.620
Keith, the CEO of Concrete
Software, in the audience.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.160
Keith, do you want to
wave your hand over there?

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:05.660
Excellent.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.230
So Keith and the
Concrete Software team

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.630
have run their first
end-to-end promotion

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.240
using Game Parameters
Management over the weekend,

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.740
and from all the
reports I've heard,

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.189
it's been a tremendous success.

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.980
So let's give a round
of applause for Keith

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.271
and the Concrete Software team.

00:14:20.271 --> 00:14:22.036
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:22.036 --> 00:14:23.380
Woo!

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.994
Go, Keith.

00:14:25.994 --> 00:14:28.160
And in Keith's own words,
Game Parameters Management

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.200
will drastically cut
setup time and issues,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.800
while allowing us to create
all kinds of new promotions

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.170
we couldn't previously,
and they're looking forward

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.230
to including Game
Parameters Management in all

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.370
of their future games.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.700
So last year we launched
the Player Stats API,

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.470
which allowed you to create
tailored game experiences

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.070
for every player segment.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.830
We provided segment data
based on percentile sessions

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:58.050
and spend, average session
length, and so forth.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.210
We also gave you predictions
for whether or not someone is

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.700
going to spend or
churn from your games.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.420
The Player Stats API is
another powerful tool for you

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.610
to run your games as
a service, and it's

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.225
available for free today.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.920
Developer Underwater Apps
has a killer application

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.780
of the Player Stats API.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.720
They integrated Player Stats
into their flagship title, Tap

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.620
Ventures, and used the
spend prediction signal

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.160
to determine whether or not
they would show ads to users.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.350
If a user was
predicted to spend,

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.750
they didn't see any ads
at all, and for users

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.510
that were not
predicted to spend,

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:43.790
they would see ads every single
time they opened up the game.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.750
Then they ran an experiment that
compared their current approach

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.890
to serving ads to the new
and improved approach powered

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:55.540
by spend prediction, and the
results speak for themselves.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:59.400
Revenue from ads was 17%
higher in the cohort predicted

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.170
not to spend, and
not showing ads

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.770
to users that were
probable to spend increased

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:09.290
the number of IAP
transactions by 15%.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:11.630
That's huge impact,
and we couldn't

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.540
be more excited for them.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.710
And we've continued to
invest in new predictions

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.140
to make the Player Stats
API even more powerful,

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.780
and we're excited to announce
two new predictions will be

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.880
available in the coming months.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.270
The first is a prediction
of how much someone

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.950
will spend in the next
30 days, and the second

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.689
predicts the probability a user
will become a high spender.

00:16:33.689 --> 00:16:35.480
And we couldn't be more
excited to see what

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.960
creative things you'll end up
doing with these new tools.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.490
At last year's GDC, we
launched the first version

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.620
of Player Analytics, and we've
made significant investments

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.790
in uMetrics and uReports,
and most recently, we

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.310
launched the Cohorts
and Funnel Reports

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.110
to help you track the
impact of new game features

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.040
you've added to your game, learn
where and why you are losing

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.160
users, and to understand
the differences in behavior

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.550
between people who don't
spend any money at all,

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.760
people who spend a little bit
of money, and your big spenders.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.060
And if you haven't had a chance
to check out Player Analytics

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.119
before, you can go to
the Developer Console

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:21.160
today and see the
reports, see how they work

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.470
with one of our sample games.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.190
And we've heard from developers
that Player Analytics has had

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:30.080
a big impact on their business.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.340
Developer Max Games has been
using Player Analytics to help

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.890
understand where and why
they are losing players

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.490
in their game Stick Wars:
Legacy, and with that data,

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.130
they can focus
their improvements

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.360
to most efficiently
improve retention.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.340
Max Games used the Funnel
Report to identify levels

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.580
in Stick Wars with
above-average churn,

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.780
and here's what Jason,
their CEO, had to say.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.080
"The Funnel Report is vital
to balancing our game Stick

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.530
Wars: Legacy, and using the
Play Games Funnel Report,

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:06.500
we were able to reduce
churn in level six by 40%."

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.430
That's incredible impact.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.950
40% more users now
get to experience

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.320
the rest of the game.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.250
And of course, since then
the bottleneck has moved,

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.630
and they've identified
more opportunities

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:21.660
to reduce churn even further.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.110
So there you have it.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:26.490
You have new tools to
create the best games,

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.600
find the right audience,
monetize that audience,

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.250
and grow your game as an
intelligent, living service.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.190
And remember, you
are the real heroes

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:41.830
of the story, the developers,
and all of these products

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.800
and all these people
here from Google

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:49.400
are working for you to help make
your business more successful.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.050
So go out there,
make awesome games,

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.750
and be the heroes
we know you can be.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.390
With that, thank you.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.686
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:57.686 --> 00:19:01.460
