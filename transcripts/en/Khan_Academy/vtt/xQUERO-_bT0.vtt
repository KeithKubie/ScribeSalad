00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.650
- [Instructor] A disk is
initially rotating clockwise

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.650
around a fixed axis with
angular speed omega nought.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.030
At time t equals zero,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.610
the two forces of F sub
one is equal to 20 newtons

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.340
and F sub two is equal to 10
newtons are exerted on the disk

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.600
as shown in the figure below.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.640
So these are the magnitudes,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.730
but here they show the
magnitude and the direction.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.560
And they say, which graph
could show the angular velocity

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.050
of the disk over time?

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.960
So before I even show you the options,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.940
let's see if we can just
sketch it ourselves.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.100
So pause this video

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.660
and see if you can sketch
the angular velocity

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.283
of the disk over time.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.090
All right, so in our vertical axis here,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.930
let's put our angular velocity.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.010
And then in our horizontal axis here,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.490
we wanna see how that changes over time.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.320
So what is our initial angular velocity?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.290
Well, they tell us that our
angular speed is omega nought

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.500
and the direction is in
the clockwise direction.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.080
They tell it right over there.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.930
And the typical convention
is that clockwise,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.500
clockwise is negative

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.240
and counterclockwise would be positive.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.280
So we're starting at a
negative angular velocity.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.680
So we're starting at a
negative angular velocity.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.530
Let's see right over there.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.220
And it actually would be
negative omega nought.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.710
I'll just write negative omega nought.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.570
Remember, omega nought is
the speed, the angular speed,

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.170
so it's the magnitude
of the angular velocity.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.400
But since we're going
clockwise, it would be negative,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.860
so we're gonna start right there.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.220
And now let's see what the net torque is.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.000
F one, we're assuming, goes straight down

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.530
and it's perpendicular to the radius.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.420
Let's call that r, that length r.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.520
And F two is straight down.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.100
It's perpendicular to the radius.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.890
But F one is providing a torque

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.970
in the counterclockwise direction,

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.730
while F two is providing a torque

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.670
in the clockwise direction.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.190
And the way it's
depicted, F one is larger,

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.900
and they're both r away
from the center of rotation.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.900
So your net torque is going
to be counterclockwise.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.700
It's going to be against the direction

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.450
or the starting direction of rotation.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.080
If your net torque is counterclockwise.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.610
So we could say our net torque
is going to be positive.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.150
Positive.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.540
And if our net torque is positive,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.020
that means that our angular acceleration

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.630
is going to be positive.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.090
And our angular acceleration
is just the rate of change

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.630
of our angular velocity.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.240
And this is going to be constant,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.920
assuming that these forces are constant.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.310
You're going to see this.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.370
We're going to be rotating clockwise

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.470
at a slower and slower rate

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.970
until all of a sudden the
wheel switches direction

00:02:51.214 --> 00:02:52.360
or the disk switches directions

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.590
and then all of a sudden we
are rotating counterclockwise.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.490
So it would look something like that.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.533
So let's see which of these choices fit.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.680
So if we look at all of 'em,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.250
this looks almost exactly like we drew,

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.920
but let's just review what
these other ones are saying.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.370
This one is implying here

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.660
that you're starting off going clockwise,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.340
but then you're accelerating
in the clockwise direction.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.580
And that wasn't the direction

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.170
that the net torque was being applied in,

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.770
so we rule that out.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.800
This assumes that you're starting

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.500
in the counterclockwise direction,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.710
which we know is not the case.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.870
This assumes that you're starting

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.163
in the counterclockwise direction.

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:38.100
And then you're accelerating
in the clockwise direction.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.470
And you would've picked this

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.020
if you got your convention mixed up

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.310
between counterclockwise and clockwise

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.800
and which one is positive or negative,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.300
but we can rule that one
out, and the choice is A.
