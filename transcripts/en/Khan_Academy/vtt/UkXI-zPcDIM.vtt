00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.540
On the same day,
police have made two

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.150
at first unrelated arrests.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.560
They arrest a
gentleman named Al.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.450
And they caught him red
handed selling drugs.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.070
So it's an open and shut case.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.820
And the same day, they catch
a gentleman named Bill.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.120
And he is also caught red
handed, stealing drugs.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.840
And they bring them separately
to the police station.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.670
And they tell them, look,
this is an open and shut case.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.784
You're going to get
convicted for drug dealing

00:00:27.784 --> 00:00:29.200
and you're going
to get two years.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.900
And they tell this to
each of them individually.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.400
They were selling the
same type of drugs,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.441
just happened to be that.

00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:35.510
But they were doing it
completely independently.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.270
Two years for drugs
is what's going

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.829
to happen assuming nothing else.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.620
But then the district
attorney has a chance

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.080
to chat with each of
these gentleman separately

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.690
and while he's
chatting with them

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.145
he reinforces the idea this
is an open and shut case

00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:51.020
for the drug dealing.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.050
They're each going to get two
years, if nothing else happens.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.280
But then he starts to realize
that these two characters look

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.760
like-- he starts to have a
suspicion, for whatever reason,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.760
that these were the two
characters that actually

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.599
committed a much
more serious offense.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:09.010
That they had committed a major
armed robbery a few weeks ago.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.160
And all the district
attorney has to go on

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.770
is his hunch, his suspicion.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.710
He has no hard evidence.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.520
So what he wants to do is
try to get a deal with each

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.910
of these guys so that
they have an incentive

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.410
to essentially
snitch on each other.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.222
So what he tells each
of them is, look,

00:01:27.222 --> 00:01:29.180
you're going to get two
years for drug dealing.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.220
That's kind of guaranteed.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.960
But he says, look,
if you confess

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.040
and the other doesn't
then you will get 1 year.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.880
And the other guy
will get 10 years.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.050
So he's telling Al, look,
we caught Bill, too, just

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.820
randomly today.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.810
If you confess that
it was you and Bill

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.217
who performed that
armed robbery your term

00:02:05.217 --> 00:02:07.550
is actually going to go down
from two years to one year.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.110
But Bill is obviously
going to have

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.880
to spend a lot
more time in jail.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.340
Especially because he is
not cooperating with us.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.080
He is not confessing.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.410
But then, the other
statement is also true.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:28.770
If you deny and the
other confesses now

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.750
it switches around.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.180
You will get 10 years, because
you're not cooperating.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.060
And the other, your
co-conspirator,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.335
will get a reduced sentence--
will get the one year.

00:02:39.335 --> 00:02:40.710
So this is like
telling Al, look,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.370
if you deny that you
were the armed robber

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.850
and Bill snitches
you out, then you're

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.660
going to get 10 years in prison.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.630
And Bill's only going to
get one year in prison.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.830
And if both of you
essentially confess,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.770
you will both get three years.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.250
So this scenario is called
the prisoner's dilemma.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.000
Because we'll see
in a second there

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.130
is a globally optimal scenario
for them where they both deny

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.970
and they both get two years.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.850
But we'll see, based
on their incentives,

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.427
assuming they don't have any
unusual loyalty to each other--

00:03:20.427 --> 00:03:22.010
and these are hardened
criminals here.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.385
They're not brothers or related
to each other in any way.

00:03:24.385 --> 00:03:26.160
They don't have any
kind of loyalty pact.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.400
We'll see that they
will rationally pick,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.200
or they might rationally
pick, a non-optimal scenario.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.390
And to understand that I'm
going to draw something

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.570
called a payoff matrix.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.090
So let me do it
right here for Bill.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.600
So Bill has two options.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.610
He can confess to
the armed robbery

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.670
or he can deny that
he had anything--

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.190
that he knows anything
about the armed robbery.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.020
And Al has the same two options.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.950
Al can confess and Al can deny.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.950
And since it's called
a payoff matrix,

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.250
let me draw some grids here.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.380
Let me draw some grids
and let's think about all

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.340
of the different scenarios
and what the payoffs would be.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.720
If Al confesses and
Bill confesses then

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.070
we're in scenario four.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.100
They both get three
years in jail.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.560
So they both will get three
for Al and three for Bill.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.670
Now, if Al confesses
and Bill denies,

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.940
then we are in scenario two
from Al's point of view.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.580
Al is only going
to get one year.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.070
But Bill is going
to get 10 years.

00:04:47.942 --> 00:04:49.400
Now, if the opposite
thing happens,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.360
if Bill confesses and
Al denies, then it

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.800
goes the other way around.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.114
Al's going to get 10
years for not cooperating.

00:04:55.114 --> 00:04:56.530
And Bill's going
to have a reduced

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.490
sentence of one year
for cooperating.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.861
And then if they both deny,
they're in scenario one,

00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:08.360
where they're both just going
to get their time for the drug

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.270
dealing.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.690
So Al will get two years,
and Bill will get two years.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.830
Now, I alluded to this
earlier in the video.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.160
What is the globally
optimal scenario for them?

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.340
Well, it's this scenario,
where they both deny

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.610
having anything to do
with the armed robbery.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.060
Then they both get two years.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.210
But what we'll see is
actually somewhat rational,

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.520
assuming that they don't
have any strong loyalties

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.180
to each other, or strong level
of trust with the other party,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.200
to not go there.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.720
And it's actually rational
for both of them to confess.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.780
And the confession is
actually a Nash equilibrium.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.800
And we'll talk more about
this, but a Nash equilibrium

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.750
is where each party has
picked a choice given

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.230
the choices of the other party.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.896
So when we think
of, or each party

00:05:53.896 --> 00:05:58.620
has to pick the optimal
choice, given whatever choice

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.090
the other party picks.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.210
And so from Al's point of
view, he says, well, look,

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.430
I don't know whether Bill
is confessing or denying.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.300
So let's say he confesses.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.200
What's better for me to do?

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.910
If he confesses, and I confess,
then I get three years.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.820
If he confesses and I
deny I get 10 years.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.370
So if he confesses, it's better
for me to confess as well.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.237
So this is a preferable
scenario to this one down here.

00:06:23.237 --> 00:06:24.820
Now, I don't know
that Bill confessed.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.070
He might deny.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.210
If I assume Bill
denied, is it better

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.510
for me to confess and get one
year or deny and get two years?

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.390
Well, once again, it's
better for me to confess.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.790
And so regardless of whether
Bill confesses or denies,

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.390
so this once again, the
optimal choice for Al to pick,

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.020
taking into account Bill's
choices, is to confess.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.550
If Bill confesses, Al is
better off confessing.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.996
And if Bill denies, Al
is better off confessing.

00:06:50.996 --> 00:06:52.870
Now, we look at it from
Bill's point of view.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.500
And it's completely symmetric.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.220
If Bill says, well, I don't know
if Al is confessing or denying.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.950
If Al confesses, I can
confess and get three years

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.890
or I can deny and get 10 years.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.300
Well, three years in
prison is better than 10.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.020
So I will go-- I would
go for the three years

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.750
if I know Al is confessing.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.860
But I don't know that Al
is definitely confessing.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.030
He might deny.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.840
If Al is denying, I could
confess and get one year

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.580
or I could deny
and get two years.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.050
Well, once again, I
would want to confess

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.470
and get the one year.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.100
So Bill, taking into account
each of the scenarios

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:33.280
that Al might take, it's always
better for him to confess.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.027
And so this is interesting.

00:07:35.027 --> 00:07:36.610
They are rationally
deducing that they

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.990
should get to this scenario,
this Nash equilibrium state,

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.590
as opposed to this
globally optimal state.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.360
They're both getting three years
by both confessing as opposed

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.490
to both of them getting
two years by both denying.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.290
The problem with this one is
this is an unstable state.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.140
If one of them assumes that the
other one has-- if one of them

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.810
assumes that they're somehow
in that state temporarily,

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.370
they say, well, I can
always improve my scenario

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.630
by changing what I want to do.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.130
If Al thought that Bill
was definitely denying,

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.110
Al could improve
his circumstance

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.770
by moving out of that state
and confessing and only

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:15.950
getting one here.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.140
Likewise, if Bill thought that
maybe Al is likely to deny,

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.572
he realizes that he can optimize
by moving in this direction.

00:08:23.572 --> 00:08:25.280
Instead of denying,
getting, two and two,

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.290
he could move in that
direction right over there.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.270
So this is an unstable
optimal scenario.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.000
But this Nash equilibrium,
this state right over here,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.280
is actually very,
very, very stable.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.490
If they assume, it's
better for each of them

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.490
to confess regardless of
what the other ones does.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.890
And assuming all
of the other actors

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:50.480
have chosen their strategy,
there's no incentive for Bill.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.800
So if assuming everyone else
has changed their strategy,

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.670
you can only move
in that direction.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.310
If you're Bill, you can go
from the Nash equilibrium

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.380
of confessing to denying,
but you're worse off.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.760
So you won't want to do that.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.100
Or you could move in
this direction, which

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.020
would be Al changing
his decision.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.950
But once again, that gives
a worse outcome for Al.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.090
You're going from three
years to 10 years.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.830
So this is the equilibrium
state, the stable state,
