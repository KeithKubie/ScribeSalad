00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:01.315
- It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:01.315 --> 00:00:02.685
I am in Saigon.

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:04.715
Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

00:00:04.715 --> 00:00:09.581
I am at probably the most
well known food vendor,

00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:13.355
the legendary Lunch Lady in the city.

00:00:13.355 --> 00:00:16.736
Many of you recommend I
check this restaurant out,

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:19.403
made famous by Anthony Bourdain.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:21.187
This is,

00:00:22.348 --> 00:00:24.509
she serves a different noodle dish

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.250
every single day of the week.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.854
I thought it would be very interesting

00:00:28.854 --> 00:00:30.208
to come on Monday

00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:32.338
because she is serving a Vietnamese dish

00:00:32.338 --> 00:00:34.093
called Bun Thai,

00:00:34.093 --> 00:00:36.930
which is a Vietnamese noodle dish

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.763
with a Thai influence.

00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:42.835
I thought it would be
really cool to experience

00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:44.002
the Vietnamese

00:00:45.707 --> 00:00:48.790
and fusion of Thai soup in this dish.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.144
It's a very popular restaurant,

00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:53.473
very popular spot.

00:00:53.473 --> 00:00:56.341
A lot of people are
eating and hanging out.

00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:59.313
We are right here at
lunchtime, so yeah it's packed.

00:00:59.313 --> 00:01:02.813
Luckily, we got a table with a view of her

00:01:04.468 --> 00:01:07.189
actually assembling the noodles.

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.922
I'm actually peering into the glass,

00:01:10.922 --> 00:01:12.605
watching her make the noodles,

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:14.829
which is pretty awesome.

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:16.996
It's like front row seats.

00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:20.684
(upbeat music)

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:27.583
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:53.174 --> 00:01:54.617
So the noodles have come,

00:01:54.617 --> 00:01:55.700
the Bun Thai.

00:01:56.728 --> 00:01:59.024
I've gotta say from appearance

00:01:59.024 --> 00:02:01.045
it is a very beautiful bowl of noodles.

00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:03.779
There is some beef at the top.

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:05.132
Looks like a meatball.

00:02:05.132 --> 00:02:07.109
I think there's some squid in here, too.

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:08.815
There's some squid

00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:11.982
and then two beautiful, orange prawns.

00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:15.172
The noodles are at the bottom.

00:02:15.172 --> 00:02:19.228
On top looks like some chopped
up Vietnamese coriander.

00:02:19.228 --> 00:02:21.741
Before doctoring it up
with some chili and lime.

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:24.241
I'm just gonna taste the soup.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.053
Mmm.

00:02:31.044 --> 00:02:33.377
Oh yeah, that's pretty good.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.019
It definitely has a little
bit of a Tom Yum flavor to it.

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.211
It is a little bit sweet,

00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:42.464
a little bit sour,

00:02:42.464 --> 00:02:46.047
and has some good broth
stock flavor to it.

00:02:48.113 --> 00:02:50.985
I could definitely add some chili to that.

00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:54.527
Looks like some roasted
chili oil and with chili

00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:58.768
and it looks like there's some
toasted garlic in here, too.

00:02:58.768 --> 00:03:01.326
I could definitely use some of this.

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:02.743
Add some of that.

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:06.429
I'm going to squeeze in some lime as well

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.477
to give it that citrusy-lime flavor,

00:03:09.477 --> 00:03:10.310
which is always a great thing

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.393
when it comes to eating soup noodles.

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:17.135
Stir that into the broth

00:03:17.135 --> 00:03:20.186
and you can see the noodles below.

00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:22.418
I'm ready to start slurping.

00:03:22.418 --> 00:03:24.636
I'm gonna to check out
a piece of that beef

00:03:24.636 --> 00:03:27.219
with some of the noodles first.

00:03:34.026 --> 00:03:34.859
Mmm.

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:38.916
That's pretty good.

00:03:41.272 --> 00:03:43.169
That's wonderful, actually.

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.336
It definitely has a Thai
hot and sour flavor to it.

00:03:50.016 --> 00:03:53.766
The noodles are kinda
like spaghetti noodles,

00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:59.062
but a little bit softer,
and a little more bouncy.

00:03:59.062 --> 00:04:02.219
I think I'm gonna add some
chili sauce to this prawn.

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.636
Then, just eat up that prawn.

00:04:15.393 --> 00:04:16.226
Mmm.

00:04:18.442 --> 00:04:21.456
Oh yeah, that prawn is awesome.

00:04:21.456 --> 00:04:23.206
So meaty, very fresh,

00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:27.725
and with that roasted, dry chili sauce

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:29.002
that's awesome.

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:31.177
It's not overcooked.

00:04:31.177 --> 00:04:35.637
I think they must be
just cooked to perfection

00:04:35.637 --> 00:04:38.162
and then she doesn't
overcook them in the soup.

00:04:38.162 --> 00:04:40.455
She just kinda puts them into the soup

00:04:40.455 --> 00:04:44.809
so they remain juicy
and just really fresh,

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:48.542
not overcooked and that is delicious.

00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:50.496
That's a great prawn.

00:04:50.496 --> 00:04:53.073
I'm gonna add some of the vegetables.

00:04:53.073 --> 00:04:55.635
This is banana flower.

00:04:55.635 --> 00:04:56.802
On the bottom,

00:04:57.981 --> 00:05:00.064
I think its water mimosa.

00:05:01.097 --> 00:05:05.424
This is water mimosa as well
as some morning glory as well.

00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:08.841
Anyway, let me add some vegetables to it.

00:05:10.723 --> 00:05:14.890
Alright and then go and
slurp down some more noodles.

00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:23.464
Mmm.

00:05:25.407 --> 00:05:28.415
Another very famous thing
here is the goi cuon,

00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:30.015
the Vietnamese summer rolls.

00:05:30.015 --> 00:05:32.530
The fresh Vietnamese summer rolls.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.781
These are one of the greatest treasures

00:05:35.781 --> 00:05:37.614
of Vietnamese cuisine.

00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:42.652
Let me dip it into the sauce.

00:05:42.652 --> 00:05:44.604
They're also very famous to eat here

00:05:44.604 --> 00:05:46.604
along with your noodles.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.383
Mmm, yeah.

00:05:56.726 --> 00:06:01.441
You can never go wrong with
summer rolls in Vietnam.

00:06:01.441 --> 00:06:03.691
They are just so wonderful.

00:06:04.598 --> 00:06:06.598
So fresh, so herbaceous.

00:06:08.128 --> 00:06:09.431
I really like the sauce here.

00:06:09.431 --> 00:06:11.014
It's not too sweet,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.805
you can really taste that
Hoisin, that dark Hoisin,

00:06:15.805 --> 00:06:17.012
the nutty flavor

00:06:17.012 --> 00:06:21.072
and I think she added some
crispy shallots to that as well.

00:06:21.072 --> 00:06:23.390
That's great sauce.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.807
Great sauce here.

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:29.588
Mmm.

00:06:30.447 --> 00:06:34.055
I am finishing up my bowl of noodles.

00:06:34.055 --> 00:06:37.893
Definitely a delicious,
well-balanced bowl of noodles.

00:06:37.893 --> 00:06:40.279
The soup is a little bit sweet,

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:41.525
a little bit sour,

00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:44.493
and then with adding that chili oil

00:06:44.493 --> 00:06:45.927
it did make it spicy.

00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:50.010
It really almost has a
Thai Tom Yum flavor to it.

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:52.545
The soup is very good,

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:56.451
but then those are very
Vietnamese noodles.

00:06:56.451 --> 00:07:00.451
I've never seen that type
of noodle in Thailand.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.409
It's really kinda a
cross between a Thai dish

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:06.944
with Vietnamese ingredients and flavors.

00:07:06.944 --> 00:07:08.267
It's definitely famous for a good reason

00:07:08.267 --> 00:07:10.421
because the food is very good,

00:07:10.421 --> 00:07:11.895
at least the day that I'm coming.

00:07:11.895 --> 00:07:13.991
The noodles are very good.

00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:16.267
The Lunch Lady is a legend

00:07:16.267 --> 00:07:19.742
and she is extremely nice as well.

00:07:19.742 --> 00:07:22.075
Very friendly and very kind.

00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:26.279
The environment under the tree,

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.605
the atmosphere, the cool breeze,

00:07:29.605 --> 00:07:31.354
at least there was a breeze before.

00:07:31.354 --> 00:07:33.933
Now, I'm sweating it out,

00:07:33.933 --> 00:07:37.535
but this is definitely a place to come

00:07:37.535 --> 00:07:39.301
when you are in Saigon.

00:07:39.301 --> 00:07:41.502
Huge thank you to all of
you for your recommendation

00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:44.219

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:46.382

I am with the Lunch Lady right now.

00:08:00.868 --> 00:08:04.035
A very kind woman and an amazing cook.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.454
(speaking in foreign language)
