announce that we are starting to open
 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.290
announce that we are starting to open
source our code the wearable support

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300
source our code the wearable support
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.750

library will be moving to the Android

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
library will be moving to the Android
 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.000
library will be moving to the Android
support library and will become the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010
support library and will become the
 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.130
support library and will become the
so-called wear module this is similar to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
so-called wear module this is similar to
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.350
so-called wear module this is similar to
other modules in the android support

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360
other modules in the android support
 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.780
other modules in the android support
library once that hopefully you already

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790
library once that hopefully you already
 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.510
library once that hopefully you already
know like the core UI or the recycler

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520
know like the core UI or the recycler
 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.090
know like the core UI or the recycler
view or design so we will just become

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100
view or design so we will just become
 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.340
view or design so we will just become
another module for you again open

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
another module for you again open
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.399
another module for you again open
sourcing the code this is launching with

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
sourcing the code this is launching with
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.240
sourcing the code this is launching with
Android support library 26 point OB de 1

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
Android support library 26 point OB de 1
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.520
Android support library 26 point OB de 1
so it launched actually two days ago so

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
so it launched actually two days ago so
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.780
so it launched actually two days ago so
you can start using it pretty much

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
you can start using it pretty much
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.440
you can start using it pretty much
immediately it's very easy to add to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
immediately it's very easy to add to
 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.179
immediately it's very easy to add to
your code you just your regular

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
your code you just your regular
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.730
your code you just your regular
dependency on a with a very similar

structure to other modules just make

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890
structure to other modules just make
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.370
structure to other modules just make
sure to mention where there and beta1

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380
 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.440
so hopefully this change makes you happy

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
so hopefully this change makes you happy
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.859
so hopefully this change makes you happy
there's a few reasons to be happy first

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
there's a few reasons to be happy first
 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.170
there's a few reasons to be happy first
and foremost as I said before the code

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
and foremost as I said before the code
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.840

is now open source you can stop trying

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
is now open source you can stop trying
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.539
is now open source you can stop trying
to reverse engineer it now it's all

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549
to reverse engineer it now it's all
 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.779
to reverse engineer it now it's all
going to be out there and the API will

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789
going to be out there and the API will
 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.910
going to be out there and the API will
now be part of the support library and

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920
now be part of the support library and
 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.309
now be part of the support library and
they will be consistent

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319
they will be consistent
 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.649
they will be consistent
with the rest of Android and the rest of

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659
with the rest of Android and the rest of
 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.559
with the rest of Android and the rest of
the support library we will have more

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569
the support library we will have more
 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.349
the support library we will have more
frequent releases along the Android

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359
frequent releases along the Android
 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.089
frequent releases along the Android
support library that will be roughly

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099
support library that will be roughly
 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.729
support library that will be roughly
every two months and this means we will

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739
every two months and this means we will
 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.740
every two months and this means we will
be able to take in more of your feedback

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750
be able to take in more of your feedback
 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.740
be able to take in more of your feedback
and react to it a lot quicker than we

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750
and react to it a lot quicker than we
 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.720
and react to it a lot quicker than we
were before but we won't be moving all

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730
were before but we won't be moving all
 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.000
were before but we won't be moving all
of the code at once that would be a bit

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010
of the code at once that would be a bit
 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.210
of the code at once that would be a bit
of a shock to the ecosystem to move

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220
of a shock to the ecosystem to move
 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.819
of a shock to the ecosystem to move
everything so we'll start with the UI

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829
everything so we'll start with the UI
 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.740
everything so we'll start with the UI
components and I'm going to focus on

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750
components and I'm going to focus on
 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.530
components and I'm going to focus on
that for the rest of my talk so the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540
that for the rest of my talk so the
 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.420
that for the rest of my talk so the
first package we will be open sourcing

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430
first package we will be open sourcing
 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.050
first package we will be open sourcing
is the view package or now it's going to

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060
is the view package or now it's going to
 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.240
is the view package or now it's going to
be called the widget package and there

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250
be called the widget package and there
 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.159
be called the widget package and there
we want to focus on enabling round

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169
we want to focus on enabling round
 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.440
we want to focus on enabling round
friendly eyes and space-efficient

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450
friendly eyes and space-efficient
 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.030
friendly eyes and space-efficient
interaction patterns so we're targeting

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040
interaction patterns so we're targeting
 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.759
interaction patterns so we're targeting
the two main issues that developers had

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769
the two main issues that developers had
 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.159
the two main issues that developers had
with with you eyes which is building

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.169
with with you eyes which is building
 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.530
with with you eyes which is building
stuff for round screens for the first

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540
stuff for round screens for the first
 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.960
stuff for round screens for the first
time in Android and also building for

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970
time in Android and also building for
 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.259
time in Android and also building for
really really tiny screens very little

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269
really really tiny screens very little
 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.699
really really tiny screens very little
screen estate it's not trivial to build

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709
screen estate it's not trivial to build
 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.469
screen estate it's not trivial to build
good you eyes in such conditions so

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:20.479
good you eyes in such conditions so
 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.539
good you eyes in such conditions so
that's why those are the things we're

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549
that's why those are the things we're
 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.680
that's why those are the things we're
focusing on first here's a good example

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690
focusing on first here's a good example
 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.979
focusing on first here's a good example
of how we've enhanced a typical Android

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989
of how we've enhanced a typical Android
 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.219
of how we've enhanced a typical Android
list you used to have on Android a very

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:33.229
list you used to have on Android a very
 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.170
list you used to have on Android a very
straight list all the elements would

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180
straight list all the elements would
 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.530
straight list all the elements would
just go one by one start at the top what

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540
just go one by one start at the top what
 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.689
just go one by one start at the top what
we've done with we're here is we've

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:40.699
we've done with we're here is we've
 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.949
we've done with we're here is we've
played to the round factor of the watch

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959
played to the round factor of the watch
 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.039
played to the round factor of the watch
we've adapted the list to follow a curve

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049
we've adapted the list to follow a curve
 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.129
we've adapted the list to follow a curve
and that means also it fits a lot more

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139
and that means also it fits a lot more
 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:52.899
and that means also it fits a lot more
information on the screen that it was

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909
information on the screen that it was
 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.849
information on the screen that it was
able to with just a straight list here

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859
able to with just a straight list here
 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.179
able to with just a straight list here
are some other examples of our best

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:00.189
are some other examples of our best
 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:02.649
are some other examples of our best
round friendly wise we've got the

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659
round friendly wise we've got the
 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.500
round friendly wise we've got the
launcher we've got the date time picker

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510
launcher we've got the date time picker
 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.990

launched recently in the new pocket in

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000
launched recently in the new pocket in
 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.649
launched recently in the new pocket in
the new desk lock up and then we've got

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659
the new desk lock up and then we've got
 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.629
the new desk lock up and then we've got
live song which is a great example of a

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639
live song which is a great example of a
 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.319
live song which is a great example of a
third-party app that encompasses and

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329
third-party app that encompasses and
 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.339
third-party app that encompasses and
encompasses around from the UI so all of

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349
encompasses around from the UI so all of
 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.649
encompasses around from the UI so all of
these make use of the curvature of the

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659
these make use of the curvature of the
 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.000
these make use of the curvature of the
screen all of them fit

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010
screen all of them fit
 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.400
screen all of them fit
is to fit more information in the eyes

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410
is to fit more information in the eyes
 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.410
is to fit more information in the eyes
and are just generally more pleasant to

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420
and are just generally more pleasant to
 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.060
and are just generally more pleasant to
use so these are the kind of you eyes

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070
use so these are the kind of you eyes
 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.190
use so these are the kind of you eyes
that we want you to build in the future

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200
that we want you to build in the future
 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.930
that we want you to build in the future
and we want to help you build those you

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940
and we want to help you build those you
 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.000
and we want to help you build those you
eyes with with the support library so

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010
eyes with with the support library so
 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.790
eyes with with the support library so
when building the we're widget module so

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800
when building the we're widget module so
 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.830
when building the we're widget module so
the UI components we were thinking of

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840
the UI components we were thinking of
 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.560
the UI components we were thinking of
the UI generally until in terms of

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570
the UI generally until in terms of
 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.880
the UI generally until in terms of
components much like android framework

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890
components much like android framework
 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.680
components much like android framework
much like the android support library

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690
much like the android support library
 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.740
much like the android support library
so with this module we want to develop a

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750
so with this module we want to develop a
 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.170
so with this module we want to develop a
suite of building blocks that would make

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180
suite of building blocks that would make
 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.810
suite of building blocks that would make
it easier for developers to put together

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820
it easier for developers to put together
 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.600
it easier for developers to put together
y which is both intuitive and like feels

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610
y which is both intuitive and like feels
 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.830
y which is both intuitive and like feels
native on Android wear as well as build

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840
native on Android wear as well as build
 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.050
native on Android wear as well as build
it in a flexible manner and of that it

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060
it in a flexible manner and of that it
 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.780
it in a flexible manner and of that it
will kind of express the personality and

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790
will kind of express the personality and
 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.150
will kind of express the personality and
the character of your app so we're

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160
the character of your app so we're
 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.820
the character of your app so we're
exploring both tiny building blocks like

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830
exploring both tiny building blocks like
 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.880
exploring both tiny building blocks like
views so image views or tech fields

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890
views so image views or tech fields
 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.490
views so image views or tech fields
we're also exploring larger ones like

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500
we're also exploring larger ones like
 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.590
we're also exploring larger ones like
the wearable recycler view or swipe

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600
the wearable recycler view or swipe
 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.410
the wearable recycler view or swipe
dismiss frame Alliance and we call these

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420
dismiss frame Alliance and we call these
 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.340
dismiss frame Alliance and we call these
specifically components and these

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350
specifically components and these
 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.010
specifically components and these
components is this larger larger pieces

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020
components is this larger larger pieces
 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.340
components is this larger larger pieces
of data and you will come come together

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350
of data and you will come come together
 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.590
of data and you will come come together
to form UI so this is where you come in

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600
to form UI so this is where you come in
 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.300
to form UI so this is where you come in
as developers and you will reuse our

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310
as developers and you will reuse our
 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.340
as developers and you will reuse our
components and views to build your own

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350
components and views to build your own
 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.720
components and views to build your own
app ok some of these views and layouts

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730
app ok some of these views and layouts
 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.850
app ok some of these views and layouts
already exist on Android and some of

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860
already exist on Android and some of
 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.950
already exist on Android and some of
them need to be implemented specifically

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960
them need to be implemented specifically
 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.220
them need to be implemented specifically
for where those are the ones that we

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230
for where those are the ones that we
 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.940
for where those are the ones that we
would want to go to put in the wear

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950
would want to go to put in the wear
 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.660
would want to go to put in the wear
module and the in the widget UI library

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.670
module and the in the widget UI library
 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.630
module and the in the widget UI library
so here's a visualization again of how

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640
so here's a visualization again of how
 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.600
so here's a visualization again of how
we think about UI is its reusable

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610
we think about UI is its reusable
 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.730
we think about UI is its reusable
building blocks rather than custom

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740
building blocks rather than custom
 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.010
building blocks rather than custom
tailored or a special case interfaces

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020
tailored or a special case interfaces
 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.020
tailored or a special case interfaces
like hopefully that's not big news to

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030
like hopefully that's not big news to
 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.520
like hopefully that's not big news to
you but I wanted to make it very plain

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530
you but I wanted to make it very plain
 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.290
you but I wanted to make it very plain
that this is for this is what we're

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300
that this is for this is what we're
 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.910
that this is for this is what we're
going for with this new library so again

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920
going for with this new library so again
 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.890
going for with this new library so again
with this in mind we hope we will enable

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900
with this in mind we hope we will enable
 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.070
with this in mind we hope we will enable
you to build good interfaces functional

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080
you to build good interfaces functional
 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.070
you to build good interfaces functional
interfaces very rich ones that feel

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080
interfaces very rich ones that feel
 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.710
interfaces very rich ones that feel
native to Android wear but also Express

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720
native to Android wear but also Express
 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.229
native to Android wear but also Express
the character of your app

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:38.239
the character of your app
 

00:06:38.239 --> 00:06:42.309
the character of your app
so this is quite a long project the

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319
so this is quite a long project the
 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.469
so this is quite a long project the
complete construction of the word module

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479
complete construction of the word module
 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.989
complete construction of the word module
will take some time so I wanted now to

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:46.999
will take some time so I wanted now to
 

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:49.569
will take some time so I wanted now to
spend the rest of my my time to talk a

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:49.579
spend the rest of my my time to talk a
 

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:52.119
spend the rest of my my time to talk a
little bit about how we will make it

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:52.129
little bit about how we will make it
 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:54.989
little bit about how we will make it
happen and what was the timeline for it

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:54.999
happen and what was the timeline for it
 

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:59.229
happen and what was the timeline for it
kind of step by step so we have divided

00:06:59.229 --> 00:06:59.239
kind of step by step so we have divided
 

00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:01.509
kind of step by step so we have divided
all the existing where UI elements

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:01.519
all the existing where UI elements
 

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:04.179
all the existing where UI elements
broadly speaking into three categories

00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:04.189
broadly speaking into three categories
 

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:07.329
broadly speaking into three categories
we will migrate the components that are

00:07:07.329 --> 00:07:07.339
we will migrate the components that are
 

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:10.149
we will migrate the components that are
already built for where and that are

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:10.159
already built for where and that are
 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:12.850
already built for where and that are
where specific into the new moment where

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860
where specific into the new moment where
 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.779
where specific into the new moment where
module some components we will merge

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:16.789
module some components we will merge
 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:19.449
module some components we will merge
those are the components that are useful

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:19.459
those are the components that are useful
 

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:21.819
those are the components that are useful
not only for wearable devices but also

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:21.829
not only for wearable devices but also
 

00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:24.669
not only for wearable devices but also
for handheld devices so they can be

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:24.679
for handheld devices so they can be
 

00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:27.069
for handheld devices so they can be
reused on phones there's no need for

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:27.079
reused on phones there's no need for
 

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:28.779
reused on phones there's no need for
them to live only in the wearable space

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:28.789
them to live only in the wearable space
 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:30.999
them to live only in the wearable space
so we will kind of graduate or merge

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:31.009
so we will kind of graduate or merge
 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:34.529
so we will kind of graduate or merge
them into the framework or into other

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:34.539
them into the framework or into other
 

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:39.489
them into the framework or into other
handhelds or generic support modules and

00:07:39.489 --> 00:07:39.499
handhelds or generic support modules and
 

00:07:39.499 --> 00:07:41.259
handhelds or generic support modules and
then the last group is the component

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:41.269
then the last group is the component
 

00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:43.629
then the last group is the component
that we will deprecated those are the

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:43.639
that we will deprecated those are the
 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:45.609
that we will deprecated those are the
ones that are mostly associated with all

00:07:45.609 --> 00:07:45.619
ones that are mostly associated with all
 

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:48.329
ones that are mostly associated with all
the design patterns that have not proven

00:07:48.329 --> 00:07:48.339
the design patterns that have not proven
 

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:51.369
the design patterns that have not proven
successful with our users and I'll talk

00:07:51.369 --> 00:07:51.379
successful with our users and I'll talk
 

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:55.539
successful with our users and I'll talk
a little bit more about that in a second

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:55.549
 

00:07:55.549 --> 00:07:57.129
so first I want to talk about the

00:07:57.129 --> 00:07:57.139
so first I want to talk about the
 

00:07:57.139 --> 00:07:58.899
so first I want to talk about the
components that will migrate I want to

00:07:58.899 --> 00:07:58.909
components that will migrate I want to
 

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:00.579
components that will migrate I want to
kind of shine a spotlight on them those

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:00.589
kind of shine a spotlight on them those
 

00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:03.669
kind of shine a spotlight on them those
are the most important bit they are the

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:03.679
are the most important bit they are the
 

00:08:03.679 --> 00:08:06.969
are the most important bit they are the
ones that are launching with the support

00:08:06.969 --> 00:08:06.979
ones that are launching with the support
 

00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:10.749
ones that are launching with the support
library 26 beta 1 and that's the

00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759
library 26 beta 1 and that's the
 

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:12.699
library 26 beta 1 and that's the
wearable recyclerview which gives you

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:12.709
wearable recyclerview which gives you
 

00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:15.759
wearable recyclerview which gives you
that nice curved list that we use also

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:15.769
that nice curved list that we use also
 

00:08:15.769 --> 00:08:19.899
that nice curved list that we use also
to build the launcher and then we have

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:19.909
to build the launcher and then we have
 

00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:22.569
to build the launcher and then we have
the box inside layer which enables you

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:22.579
the box inside layer which enables you
 

00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:26.559
the box inside layer which enables you
to fit all of your you eyes on the

00:08:26.559 --> 00:08:26.569
to fit all of your you eyes on the
 

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:29.919
to fit all of your you eyes on the
screen into the center middle square of

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:29.929
screen into the center middle square of
 

00:08:29.929 --> 00:08:32.290
screen into the center middle square of
the screen so you can reuse basically

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:32.300
the screen so you can reuse basically
 

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.389
the screen so you can reuse basically
your device between a square and a round

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399
your device between a square and a round
 

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:37.899
your device between a square and a round
watch and then we've got the swipe

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:37.909
watch and then we've got the swipe
 

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:40.240
watch and then we've got the swipe
dismiss frame layout which is quite an

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:40.250
dismiss frame layout which is quite an
 

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.369
dismiss frame layout which is quite an
interesting case because it calculates a

00:08:42.369 --> 00:08:42.379
interesting case because it calculates a
 

00:08:42.379 --> 00:08:44.499
interesting case because it calculates a
design pattern that we want you to use

00:08:44.499 --> 00:08:44.509
design pattern that we want you to use
 

00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:47.799
design pattern that we want you to use
so this pattern is replacing the back

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:47.809
so this pattern is replacing the back
 

00:08:47.809 --> 00:08:48.850
so this pattern is replacing the back
button on

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:48.860
button on
 

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.300
button on
the handheld device on where we don't

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:52.310
the handheld device on where we don't
 

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.509
the handheld device on where we don't
use the button for for a back gesture we

00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519
use the button for for a back gesture we
 

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:57.490
use the button for for a back gesture we
we want you to swipe away your views

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:57.500
we want you to swipe away your views
 

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.280
we want you to swipe away your views
that was a specific request from the

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:00.290
that was a specific request from the
 

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.819
that was a specific request from the
developers during our developer preview

00:09:02.819 --> 00:09:02.829
developers during our developer preview
 

00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:06.519
developers during our developer preview
program so we're making this component

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:06.529
program so we're making this component
 

00:09:06.529 --> 00:09:08.500
program so we're making this component
available to you and in the wearable

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:08.510
available to you and in the wearable
 

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:13.690

so in terms of code should be really

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040
so in terms of code should be really
 

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.360
so in terms of code should be really
simple short slide on the example of the

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:19.370
simple short slide on the example of the
 

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.100
simple short slide on the example of the
wearable recycler view this is how you

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:21.110
wearable recycler view this is how you
 

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.389
wearable recycler view this is how you
import it now into your code and this is

00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399
import it now into your code and this is
 

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:27.310
import it now into your code and this is
how you would use it in an on create

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:27.320
how you would use it in an on create
 

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.790
how you would use it in an on create
method in the activity for example so

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800
method in the activity for example so
 

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.550
method in the activity for example so
when now with the migration to the new

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:33.560
when now with the migration to the new
 

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.680
when now with the migration to the new
module there are very few changes that

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:35.690
module there are very few changes that
 

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.720
module there are very few changes that
we would need from you in terms of code

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:37.730
we would need from you in terms of code
 

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.769
we would need from you in terms of code
hopefully very simple and you need to

00:09:41.769 --> 00:09:41.779
hopefully very simple and you need to
 

00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:43.480
hopefully very simple and you need to
implement so first we change the package

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:43.490
implement so first we change the package
 

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.050
implement so first we change the package
name to support wear widget to

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:47.060
name to support wear widget to
 

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.519
name to support wear widget to
distinguish this new UI wear module in

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:51.529
distinguish this new UI wear module in
 

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:53.949
distinguish this new UI wear module in
the support library and then the second

00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959
the support library and then the second
 

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:56.170
the support library and then the second
second thing is that we would introduce

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:56.180
second thing is that we would introduce
 

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.889
second thing is that we would introduce
minimal tweaks to the API so that it is

00:09:59.889 --> 00:09:59.899
minimal tweaks to the API so that it is
 

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:02.620
minimal tweaks to the API so that it is
consistent with the existing android api

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:02.630
consistent with the existing android api
 

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.310
consistent with the existing android api
and and support library api's these are

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320
and and support library api's these are
 

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.340
and and support library api's these are
better api's and hopefully will make

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:09.350
better api's and hopefully will make
 

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.880
better api's and hopefully will make
your code healthier in general so super

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:12.890
your code healthier in general so super
 

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.850
your code healthier in general so super
easy to update your app really not much

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:15.860
easy to update your app really not much

applicable to add to wear this we will

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:27.199
applicable to add to wear this we will
 

00:10:27.199 --> 00:10:29.050
applicable to add to wear this we will
as I mentioned merge into the main

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:29.060
as I mentioned merge into the main
 

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.910

point in having separate UI components

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:49.070
point in having separate UI components
 

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.090
point in having separate UI components
for it separate kind of pieces of

those additional API that we've created

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:05.290
those additional API that we've created
 

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.950
those additional API that we've created
and merge them into that one component

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:07.960
and merge them into that one component
 

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.740
and merge them into that one component
so that there's only one kind of really

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:10.750
so that there's only one kind of really
 

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.900
so that there's only one kind of really
strong really flexible component for you

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:12.910
strong really flexible component for you
 

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:18.690
strong really flexible component for you
to use and then the third group here I

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:18.700
to use and then the third group here I
 

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.060
to use and then the third group here I
want to talk about it on the on this

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.070
want to talk about it on the on this
 

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.130
want to talk about it on the on this
exam on this example of a conversation

are challenges rendering the text in
 

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.660
are challenges rendering the text in
both cases so here's a short text

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:00.670
both cases so here's a short text
 

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.720
both cases so here's a short text
example this string here is 7 characters

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:03.730
example this string here is 7 characters
 

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.940

characters long so to handle both of

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:12.550
characters long so to handle both of
 

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.370
characters long so to handle both of
these and make them fit you have to

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:14.380
these and make them fit you have to
 

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.650
these and make them fit you have to
measure the text before you draw and

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:16.660
measure the text before you draw and
 

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:21.870
measure the text before you draw and
adjust the font size accordingly here's

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:21.880
adjust the font size accordingly here's
 

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.540
adjust the font size accordingly here's

a long text example a short string looks
good centered vertically but the text

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:27.310
good centered vertically but the text
 

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.250
good centered vertically but the text
can be any length so it can easily flow

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:29.260
can be any length so it can easily flow
 

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.580
can be any length so it can easily flow
outside the box you can use something

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:32.590
outside the box you can use something
 

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.470
outside the box you can use something
like a static layout to help with this

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480
like a static layout to help with this
 

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.660
like a static layout to help with this
but you need to be careful not to relay

out the text on every frame with text
 

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:42.450
out the text on every frame with text
renderer you tell it the bounds that you

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:42.460
renderer you tell it the bounds that you
 

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.870
renderer you tell it the bounds that you
want the text to fit in if 7 characters

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:45.880
want the text to fit in if 7 characters
 

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.020
want the text to fit in if 7 characters
don't fit it will shrink the font until

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:49.030
don't fit it will shrink the font until
 

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.650
don't fit it will shrink the font until
it does and longer text can be flowed

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:52.660
it does and longer text can be flowed
 

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.230
it does and longer text can be flowed
over multiple lines and a lip size at

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.240
over multiple lines and a lip size at
 

00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:02.999
over multiple lines and a lip size at
the end so let's look at some code

00:19:02.999 --> 00:19:03.009
 

00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:05.710
so when you initialize your watch face

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720
so when you initialize your watch face
 

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.259
so when you initialize your watch face
create a text render using this simple

00:19:08.259 --> 00:19:08.269
create a text render using this simple
 

00:19:08.269 --> 00:19:11.649
create a text render using this simple
constructor and you pass in the text

00:19:11.649 --> 00:19:11.659
constructor and you pass in the text
 

00:19:11.659 --> 00:19:14.019
constructor and you pass in the text
paint that you want to use the text

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:14.029
paint that you want to use the text
 

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:16.810
paint that you want to use the text
paint defines the font the text size the

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:16.820
paint defines the font the text size the
 

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.590
paint defines the font the text size the
color things like that now because text

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600
color things like that now because text
 

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.940
color things like that now because text
surrender it caches things like the

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:21.950
surrender it caches things like the
 

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.590
surrender it caches things like the
layout you should create one for each

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600
layout you should create one for each
 

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.659
layout you should create one for each
field so we have one for the type there

00:19:25.659 --> 00:19:25.669
field so we have one for the type there
 

00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:27.460
field so we have one for the type there
text here and we also have one for the

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:27.470

title don't share text renderers between

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080
title don't share text renderers between
 

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.499
title don't share text renderers between
fields now when you want to draw you

00:19:35.499 --> 00:19:35.509
fields now when you want to draw you
 

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:38.139
fields now when you want to draw you
need to set the text on the renderer so

00:19:38.139 --> 00:19:38.149
need to set the text on the renderer so
 

00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:43.480
need to set the text on the renderer so
you do that calling set text and the to

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:43.490
you do that calling set text and the to
 

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.990
you do that calling set text and the to
get the text you call get text now this

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.000
get the text you call get text now this
 

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.940
get the text you call get text now this
takes the current time and you need to

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:48.950
takes the current time and you need to
 

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.220
takes the current time and you need to
do this every time you draw and that's

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:51.230
do this every time you draw and that's
 

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.930
do this every time you draw and that's
whether you're using text renderer or

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:52.940
whether you're using text renderer or
 

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.639
whether you're using text renderer or
not and that's because some

00:19:54.639 --> 00:19:54.649
not and that's because some
 

00:19:54.649 --> 00:19:56.590
not and that's because some
complications are time dependent so

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:56.600
complications are time dependent so
 

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.899
complications are time dependent so
imagine a world clock complication the

00:19:58.899 --> 00:19:58.909
imagine a world clock complication the
 

00:19:58.909 --> 00:20:03.970
imagine a world clock complication the
text changes depending on the time once

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:03.980
text changes depending on the time once
 

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.090
text changes depending on the time once
you set the text draw into the bounds

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:07.100
you set the text draw into the bounds
 

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.600
you set the text draw into the bounds
that you specify now it's okay to pass

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:10.610
that you specify now it's okay to pass
 

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.879
that you specify now it's okay to pass
in the text and the bounds every time

00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:12.889
in the text and the bounds every time
 

00:20:12.889 --> 00:20:15.159
in the text and the bounds every time
like this because text renderer only

00:20:15.159 --> 00:20:15.169
like this because text renderer only
 

00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:17.499
like this because text renderer only
lays the text out again if something has

00:20:17.499 --> 00:20:17.509
lays the text out again if something has
 

00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:21.669
lays the text out again if something has
changed that does mean that sometimes

00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679
changed that does mean that sometimes
 

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:23.440
changed that does mean that sometimes
you need to tell text renderer that a

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:23.450
you need to tell text renderer that a
 

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.450
you need to tell text renderer that a
changes occurred such as if you change

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:25.460
changes occurred such as if you change
 

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.879
changes occurred such as if you change
the paint text size and that's because

00:20:27.879 --> 00:20:27.889
the paint text size and that's because
 

00:20:27.889 --> 00:20:29.590
the paint text size and that's because
the paint is a different object from the

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600
the paint is a different object from the
 

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.940
the paint is a different object from the
text renderer so let's imagine that we

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:33.950
text renderer so let's imagine that we
 

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.649
text renderer so let's imagine that we
have code that makes the text bigger

00:20:35.649 --> 00:20:35.659
have code that makes the text bigger
 

00:20:35.659 --> 00:20:39.970
have code that makes the text bigger
when something happens in that case you

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:39.980
when something happens in that case you
 

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.909
when something happens in that case you
should call request update layout on the

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919
should call request update layout on the
 

00:20:42.919 --> 00:20:48.220
should call request update layout on the
text renderer so that it can adjust now

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:48.230
text renderer so that it can adjust now
 

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.869
text renderer so that it can adjust now
one other thing that text renderer can

00:20:49.869 --> 00:20:49.879
one other thing that text renderer can
 

00:20:49.879 --> 00:20:51.580
one other thing that text renderer can
do is adjust the rendering for the

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:51.590
do is adjust the rendering for the
 

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:55.019
do is adjust the rendering for the
always-on screen so for ambient mode

00:20:55.019 --> 00:20:55.029
always-on screen so for ambient mode
 

00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:57.519
always-on screen so for ambient mode
many watch faces are black and white in

00:20:57.519 --> 00:20:57.529
many watch faces are black and white in
 

00:20:57.529 --> 00:20:59.619
many watch faces are black and white in
this mode so you might not want things

00:20:59.619 --> 00:20:59.629
this mode so you might not want things
 

00:20:59.629 --> 00:21:04.119
this mode so you might not want things
like color emoji appearing so you need

00:21:04.119 --> 00:21:04.129
like color emoji appearing so you need
 

00:21:04.129 --> 00:21:06.159
like color emoji appearing so you need
to tell the text renderer that the

00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:06.169
to tell the text renderer that the
 

00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:08.560
to tell the text renderer that the
device is entered ambient mode so in on

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:08.570
device is entered ambient mode so in on
 

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.480
device is entered ambient mode so in on
ambient mode changed in your watch face

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:10.490
ambient mode changed in your watch face
 

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:12.399
ambient mode changed in your watch face
you just pass the in ambient mode

00:21:12.399 --> 00:21:12.409
you just pass the in ambient mode
 

00:21:12.409 --> 00:21:17.860
you just pass the in ambient mode
boolean into the text renderer like so

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:17.870
 

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.810
so that's a Texas renderer we strongly

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:20.820
so that's a Texas renderer we strongly
 

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.490
so that's a Texas renderer we strongly
suggest to use it whenever you're

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:22.500
suggest to use it whenever you're
 

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.720
suggest to use it whenever you're
rendering text directly onto a canvas

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:25.730
rendering text directly onto a canvas
 

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.550
rendering text directly onto a canvas
but what if you want not just text but

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:28.560
but what if you want not just text but
 

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.800
but what if you want not just text but

the entire complication drawn for you in
 

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:34.730
the entire complication drawn for you in
a standard way that's where the new

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:34.740
a standard way that's where the new
 

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.390
a standard way that's where the new
complication drawable comes in

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:37.400
complication drawable comes in
 

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.860
complication drawable comes in
complication drawable can render all of

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:39.870
complication drawable can render all of
 

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.230
complication drawable can render all of
the six main complication types and it

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240
the six main complication types and it
 

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.030
the six main complication types and it
handles all of the layout and styling

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:44.040
handles all of the layout and styling
 

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.770
handles all of the layout and styling
for you as an example let's recover

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:48.780
for you as an example let's recover
 

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.540
for you as an example let's recover
you'd need to do to render a short text

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:50.550
you'd need to do to render a short text
 

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:54.080
you'd need to do to render a short text
complication like this now without

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:54.090
complication like this now without
 

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.390
complication like this now without
complication drawable when data arrives

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400
complication drawable when data arrives
 

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.000
complication drawable when data arrives
you need to decode any of images which

00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.010
you need to decode any of images which
 

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.580
you need to decode any of images which
are included and you also need to cache

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:01.590
are included and you also need to cache
 

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.320
are included and you also need to cache
those images because you certainly don't

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:03.330
those images because you certainly don't
 

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:08.030
those images because you certainly don't
want to decode them more than once now

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:08.040
want to decode them more than once now
 

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.550
want to decode them more than once now
every time you draw first you need to

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:10.560
every time you draw first you need to
 

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.620
every time you draw first you need to
check that the data is active and that's

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:12.630
check that the data is active and that's
 

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.690
check that the data is active and that's
because some complication data is only

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700
because some complication data is only
 

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.360
because some complication data is only
relevant within a certain time frame for

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:17.370
relevant within a certain time frame for
 

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.860
relevant within a certain time frame for
example if it's for your next meeting

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:18.870
example if it's for your next meeting
 

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.360
example if it's for your next meeting
you don't want to show it after the

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:20.370
you don't want to show it after the
 

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:24.320
you don't want to show it after the
meeting is finished and then to draw

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:24.330
meeting is finished and then to draw
 

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.080
meeting is finished and then to draw
well we draw the background we draw the

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:27.090
well we draw the background we draw the
 

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.140
well we draw the background we draw the
image and we draw the text probably

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:30.150
image and we draw the text probably
 

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:34.220
image and we draw the text probably
using text renderer with complication

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:34.230
using text renderer with complication
 

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.250
using text renderer with complication
drawable it's much simpler when data

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:37.260
drawable it's much simpler when data
 

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.530
drawable it's much simpler when data
arrives you pass it to the drawable by

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:39.540
arrives you pass it to the drawable by
 

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.710
arrives you pass it to the drawable by
calling set complication data and then

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720
calling set complication data and then
 

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.380
calling set complication data and then
on every frame you just called draw it

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:45.390
on every frame you just called draw it
 

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:49.850
on every frame you just called draw it
is a drawable now like text renderer and

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860
is a drawable now like text renderer and
 

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.500
is a drawable now like text renderer and
like other drawables complication

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:51.510
like other drawables complication
 

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:56.570
like other drawables complication
drawable draws within bounds and the

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:56.580
drawable draws within bounds and the
 

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.090
drawable draws within bounds and the
layout adapts to the shape of the bounds

00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100
layout adapts to the shape of the bounds
 

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.310
layout adapts to the shape of the bounds
so here you can see within square bones

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320
so here you can see within square bones
 

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.320
so here you can see within square bones
you get a circular complication whereas

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:03.330
you get a circular complication whereas
 

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.270
you get a circular complication whereas
the wider bounds give a pill shape and

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280
the wider bounds give a pill shape and
 

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.880
the wider bounds give a pill shape and
you can also see that the position of

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:07.890
you can also see that the position of
 

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:11.110
you can also see that the position of
the icon is different in the two cases

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120
the icon is different in the two cases
 

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.700
the icon is different in the two cases
if you don't set any style parameters

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:13.710
if you don't set any style parameters
 

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:15.260
if you don't set any style parameters
you'll get a default look but there's

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:15.270
you'll get a default look but there's
 

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.480
you'll get a default look but there's
many things you can set such as the

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:17.490
many things you can set such as the
 

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.990
many things you can set such as the
background color the corner radius if

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000
background color the corner radius if
 

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.160
background color the corner radius if
you'd rather have something more like a

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:22.170
you'd rather have something more like a
 

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.550
you'd rather have something more like a
square than a circle you can change the

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:25.560
square than a circle you can change the
 

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.280
square than a circle you can change the
border or have no border at all you can

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:28.290
border or have no border at all you can
 

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:29.299
border or have no border at all you can
change the

00:23:29.299 --> 00:23:29.309
change the
 

00:23:29.309 --> 00:23:35.119
change the
and you can change the typeface you can

00:23:35.119 --> 00:23:35.129
and you can change the typeface you can
 

00:23:35.129 --> 00:23:36.529
and you can change the typeface you can
create a complication drawable

00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:36.539
create a complication drawable
 

00:23:36.539 --> 00:23:38.810
create a complication drawable
programmatically with a simple

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:38.820
programmatically with a simple
 

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.529
programmatically with a simple
constructor and then you can set styling

00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:42.539
constructor and then you can set styling
 

00:23:42.539 --> 00:23:45.499
constructor and then you can set styling
options for active mode and for ambient

00:23:45.499 --> 00:23:45.509
options for active mode and for ambient
 

00:23:45.509 --> 00:23:48.769
options for active mode and for ambient
mode but if you have lots of styling to

00:23:48.769 --> 00:23:48.779
mode but if you have lots of styling to
 

00:23:48.779 --> 00:23:51.110
mode but if you have lots of styling to
set you might find it easier to use XML

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120
set you might find it easier to use XML
 

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.110
set you might find it easier to use XML
instead you will need to be using API

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120
instead you will need to be using API
 

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.860
instead you will need to be using API
level 24 to do this but as long as

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:57.870
level 24 to do this but as long as
 

00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.149
level 24 to do this but as long as
you're doing that now you can just

00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159
you're doing that now you can just
 

00:23:59.159 --> 00:24:02.680
you're doing that now you can just
inflate the drawable in the standard way

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:02.690
inflate the drawable in the standard way
 

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.659
inflate the drawable in the standard way
now we do need the context to render so

00:24:05.659 --> 00:24:05.669
now we do need the context to render so
 

00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:07.730
now we do need the context to render so
you'll need to pass that into us as well

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:07.740
you'll need to pass that into us as well
 

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.639
you'll need to pass that into us as well
into the drawable and if you do that

00:24:10.639 --> 00:24:10.649
into the drawable and if you do that
 

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:12.619
into the drawable and if you do that
then your XML might look something like

00:24:12.619 --> 00:24:12.629
then your XML might look something like
 

00:24:12.629 --> 00:24:15.859
then your XML might look something like
this so attributes at the top level

00:24:15.859 --> 00:24:15.869
this so attributes at the top level
 

00:24:15.869 --> 00:24:18.340
this so attributes at the top level
apply to both ambient and active modes

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:18.350
apply to both ambient and active modes
 

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.570
apply to both ambient and active modes
unless they're overridden in ambient

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:20.580
unless they're overridden in ambient
 

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.180
unless they're overridden in ambient
mode by the attributes in the ambient

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:23.190
mode by the attributes in the ambient
 

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:28.129
mode by the attributes in the ambient
section so there are a few things you

00:24:28.129 --> 00:24:28.139
section so there are a few things you
 

00:24:28.139 --> 00:24:29.690
section so there are a few things you
need to pass to the drawable as I

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:29.700
need to pass to the drawable as I
 

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.369
need to pass to the drawable as I
mentioned earlier you course have to

00:24:31.369 --> 00:24:31.379
mentioned earlier you course have to
 

00:24:31.379 --> 00:24:34.100
mentioned earlier you course have to
give it the complication data so in on

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:34.110
give it the complication data so in on
 

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:36.440
give it the complication data so in on
complication data update for your watch

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:36.450
complication data update for your watch
 

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:38.090
complication data update for your watch
face which is where you receive the data

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100
face which is where you receive the data
 

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:42.609
face which is where you receive the data
you just pass that data to the drawable

00:24:42.609 --> 00:24:42.619
you just pass that data to the drawable
 

00:24:42.619 --> 00:24:45.259
you just pass that data to the drawable
you also need to tell the complication

00:24:45.259 --> 00:24:45.269
you also need to tell the complication
 

00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:47.509
you also need to tell the complication
drawable when the device goes in and out

00:24:47.509 --> 00:24:47.519
drawable when the device goes in and out
 

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:49.310
drawable when the device goes in and out
of ambient mode and that's because the

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320
of ambient mode and that's because the
 

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.169
of ambient mode and that's because the
drawable handles the change of styles

00:24:51.169 --> 00:24:51.179
drawable handles the change of styles
 

00:24:51.179 --> 00:24:53.450
drawable handles the change of styles
for you so all you need to do is put is

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460
for you so all you need to do is put is
 

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.489
for you so all you need to do is put is
call set in ambient mode every time it

00:24:55.489 --> 00:24:55.499
call set in ambient mode every time it
 

00:24:55.499 --> 00:24:59.239
call set in ambient mode every time it
changes and you also need to tell the

00:24:59.239 --> 00:24:59.249
changes and you also need to tell the
 

00:24:59.249 --> 00:25:00.379
changes and you also need to tell the
drawable if there are any special

00:25:00.379 --> 00:25:00.389
drawable if there are any special
 

00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:03.440
drawable if there are any special
properties of the screen so if it uses

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:03.450
properties of the screen so if it uses
 

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.720
properties of the screen so if it uses
low bit ambient mode or if it has burnin

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:05.730
low bit ambient mode or if it has burnin
 

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.399
low bit ambient mode or if it has burnin
protection tell the drawable that and it

00:25:07.399 --> 00:25:07.409
protection tell the drawable that and it
 

00:25:07.409 --> 00:25:09.529
protection tell the drawable that and it
can adapt the rendering for those

00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539
can adapt the rendering for those
 

00:25:09.539 --> 00:25:13.360
can adapt the rendering for those
properties

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:13.370
 

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:16.600
and then to draw now if it's the first

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:16.610
and then to draw now if it's the first
 

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.400
and then to draw now if it's the first
time or if something's changed then

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:18.410
time or if something's changed then
 

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.730
time or if something's changed then
you'll need to set the bounds so set the

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:21.740
you'll need to set the bounds so set the
 

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.740
you'll need to set the bounds so set the
bounds and you just call set bounds on

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:23.750
bounds and you just call set bounds on
 

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.460
bounds and you just call set bounds on
the complication drawable now the bounds

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:27.470
the complication drawable now the bounds
 

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.020
the complication drawable now the bounds
that you pass in here should be defined

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:29.030
that you pass in here should be defined
 

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.480
that you pass in here should be defined
in proportion to the watch face bounds

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:31.490
in proportion to the watch face bounds
 

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.750
in proportion to the watch face bounds
so you might say position if one quarter

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:34.760
so you might say position if one quarter
 

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.450
so you might say position if one quarter
of the screen width across don't use

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:37.460
of the screen width across don't use
 

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.580
of the screen width across don't use
fixed dimensions and that's because

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:39.590
fixed dimensions and that's because
 

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:42.130
fixed dimensions and that's because
watch is very hugely in their size so

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:42.140
watch is very hugely in their size so
 

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.020
watch is very hugely in their size so
you don't even use defining things in an

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:44.030
you don't even use defining things in an
 

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:48.550
you don't even use defining things in an
absolute way then you need you could

so those define what the entry is in
that settings list are so the top entry

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080
that settings list are so the top entry
 

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.720
that settings list are so the top entry
will probably be the preview and

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:50.730
will probably be the preview and

able to choose which complication type
you want to test so let's say we choose

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:56.350
you want to test so let's say we choose
 

00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:00.870
you want to test so let's say we choose
short text here's how it might appear on

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880
short text here's how it might appear on
 

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.760
short text here's how it might appear on
the watch face and then all you have to

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:02.770
the watch face and then all you have to
 

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.070
the watch face and then all you have to
do is tap the complication and it will

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:05.080
do is tap the complication and it will
 

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.970
do is tap the complication and it will
cycle through the different combinations

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:07.980
cycle through the different combinations
 

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.110
cycle through the different combinations
so all of these are short text

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:10.120
so all of these are short text
 

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.570
so all of these are short text
complications and if your watch face

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:12.580
complications and if your watch face
 

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.700
complications and if your watch face
supports short text it has to render all

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:14.710
supports short text it has to render all
 

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:21.090
supports short text it has to render all
of these correctly this is a long text

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:21.100
of these correctly this is a long text
 

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.010
of these correctly this is a long text
example and for long text there's even

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:23.020
example and for long text there's even
 

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.810
example and for long text there's even
more combination so it's really useful

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:24.820
more combination so it's really useful
 

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.370
more combination so it's really useful
to give it a go and check that

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:26.380
to give it a go and check that
 

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.140
to give it a go and check that
everything works properly you can have

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:28.150
everything works properly you can have
 

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.530
everything works properly you can have
