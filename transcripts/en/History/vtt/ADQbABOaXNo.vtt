00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.128
- Hello.
My name is Shawn Shropshire.

00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:04.587
Welcome to Oklahoma.

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:06.464
Take you inside and show you
around my shop.

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:09.175
So this is the anvil
where I do my handwork.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.344
It's one I picked up
off the internet.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.012
Little small anvil in the back.

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:15.348
Another machine I'm working on.
is my surface grinder.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:16.891
Hope to get it up
and running soon.

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:19.978
Post vise on a big truck rim.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.731
This is my vertical forge
that I use for larger pieces.

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:24.649
It gives a lot more volume.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.276
Obviously,
with the two-burner forge,

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.486
I don't have the length that
I need for larger pieces.

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:30.989
This gives me more flexibility
for odd shapes

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.491
and larger sizes.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:37.912
- I'm Jason Brown and I want to
give you a small tour

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:40.957
of my shop here
and some of the things I do.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:44.043
This is a mining shovel
I built a few years back.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.628
I do a lot of rock hunting.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:49.215
And I mainly made to sift
sapphires and barrel crystals.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.050
Nothing really too glamorous
here.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.221
This is a two-burner forge
I bought on eBay--good deal.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.682
This is an anvil
that a friend gave me.

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.976
Real generous of him.

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:02.395
This is a twisting wrench
that I built,

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.731
I mean, this was just a really
old wrench

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.900
and then it's...

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.402
By far, it gets a lot of use.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.279
This is the coal forge I built.

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.281
It has 3/4 inch plate steel

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:16.826
and there's 7018 rods is what
I used to weld it together.

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:18.244
And it comes apart
in three pieces,

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.205
so it's real easy to move.

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.415
- This is the primary grinder
that I use.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:25.752
It's a 210 variable speed,
1 1/2 horse.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.837
And this is what I do
most of my work on.

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:30.465
And then I've got another
grinder that's a 110

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.342
that I use
for more finishing work.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:35.220
Most of my hand-sanding is done
here at this table.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.348
My handle scales,
assembly of knives,

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:41.142
guard-fitting, most of that's
done right here.

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:43.770
I've got a knee mill
at this end of the shop

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.816
that I use for guard-fitting,
drilling precise holes,

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:51.319
variable drills, my knife
patterns that I've come up with

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.114
and several that I've gotten
from friends and other makers.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:57.242
So sometimes when I need
a break from the knife making,

00:01:57.242 --> 00:02:00.870
I'll grab my bow and go outside
and shoot a few targets

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.498
to break up the monotony
and get my mind off of things

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:06.125
that might be a problem.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.293
That's my shop.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.296
Thanks for coming and visiting.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.965
Hope to see you soon.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.133
- These hammers are my dad's.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.553
He passed away two years ago
from cancer.

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:18.471
I'm always using something
that he used to own,

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:21.266
and I think he either built it
or had this made, but--

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.892
and it has his initials on it

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:25.562
so it's like
my favorite hammer.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:28.815
I wear my dad's shoes,
basically for good luck.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.358
I wore them on the show
and I'm--

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:31.985
I've worn them every day here.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.611
And then, other than that,
this is--

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:36.489
I wear this arrowhead
that a friend made for me.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.408
It's brought me good luck
so far.

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:41.578
This is my shop.
Thanks for checking it out.
