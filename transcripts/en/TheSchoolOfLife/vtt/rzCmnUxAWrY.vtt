00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.100
Our lives are powerfully affected by a special quirk of the human mind to which we rarely pay much attention.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.180
We are creatures deeply marked by our expectations.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.200
We go around with mental pictures lodged in our brains of how things are supposed to go.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.260
We may hardly even notice we've got such phantasms,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.620
but expectations have an enormous impact on how we respond to what happens to us.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.380
What drives us to fury are fronts to our expectations.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.060
There are plenty of things that don't turn out to be as we'd like but don't make us livid, either.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.420
When a problem has been factored into our expectations, calm is not endangered.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.000
We may be sad, but we're not screaming.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.240
Unfortunately, our expectations are never higher, and therefore more troublesome than they are in love.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.400
Our expectations in relationships might go like this:

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.580
A decent partner should easily, intuitively understand what I'm concerned about.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.960
I shouldn't have to explain things at length to them.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.340
If I've had a difficult day, I shouldn't have to say that I'm worn out and need a bit of space.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.160
They should be able to tell how I'm feeling.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.460
They shouldn't oppose me.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.540
If I point out that one of our acquaintances is a bit stuck-up, they shouldn't start defending them.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.260
They're meant to be constantly supportive.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.440
When I feel bad about myself, they assure me up and remind me of my strengths.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.540
A decent partner won't ever make too many demands.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.880
They won't be constantly requesting that I do things to help them out,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.320
or dragging me off to do something I don't like.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.680
We'll always like the same things.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.900
I tend to have pretty good taste in films, food, and household routines.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.240
My lover will understand and sympathize with these at once,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.260
and then, of course, you get into a relationship and the problems start.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:56.800
A solution to our distress and agitation therefore lies in a curious area with a philosophy of pessimism.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.380
It's an odd and unappealing thought.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.920
Pessimism sounds so unattractive.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.400
It's associated with failure; it's usually what gets in the way of better things.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.460
But, when it comes to relationships, expectations are the enemies of love.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.200
A more moderate, more reasonable set of expectations about love would include a range of ideas.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.100
For example, the idea that it's normal and largely unavoidable

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.520
that people don't understand one another very well in a couple.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.120
Each person's mind is a hugely complex and convoluted place.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.980
It's hard to grasp exactly why someone acts as they do, and by extension,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.160
we'd be assuming from the start that no partner is going to have a complete, reliable,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.060
or terribly accurate understanding of us.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.600
There will be the occasional things they get right, but these will be the expception rather than the standard.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.280
As a relationship developed, we then wouldn't get hurt when our partner

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.840
made some wildly inaccurate assumptions about our needs or preferences.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.060
We'd have been assuming that this would be coming along pretty soon from the start.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.080
We'd ideally have an assumption that in any relationship, there would be significant areas of disagreement

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.560
which could well turn out to be irrseolvable.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.780
We wouldn't particularly relish this.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.660
It's not that we'd be eager to get together with someone with whom we are at odds,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.160
but we'd just assumed that we weren't going to find someone who'd be on the same wavelength as us

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.380
on every serious issue that cropped up.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.740
We'd know that a good, working relationship would not mean blanket agreement.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.920
Love begins with the discovery of harmony in some very specific and beautiful areas,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.120
but to continue with this expectation is to doom love to a slow death.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.020
The error we're always tempted to make is to see defects especial to our own partner.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.560
We get to know the irritating and disappointing sides of one particular person

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.880
and then draw the conclusion that we've been especially unlucky;

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.180
we've become involved with someone who seemed lovely on the surface,

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.460
but then, in time, revealed themselves strangely disturbed and defective.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.220
What a curse! What a problem to correct!

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.800
We therefore start looking around for a new partner

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.060
with whom we can finally have what we always knew was promised to us:

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.440
a problem-free relationship.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.060
Our romantic impulses are continuously and dangerously being renewed...

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.940
and we blame everything but our hopes.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.720
And yet, the reasons why other people in love are disappointing are universal.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.320
The problems may take on a local character,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.320
but everyone would have them in the broad to a significant extent.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.160
We don't need to know the specific eccentricities we would find in a prospective partner,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.340
but we can be sure that there will be some and that they will, at points, prove pretty serious.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.000
The only people we can think of as normal are those we don't yet know very well.
