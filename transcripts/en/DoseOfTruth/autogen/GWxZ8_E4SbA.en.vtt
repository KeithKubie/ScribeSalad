00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000
it's a descent into hell and it's
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.700
it's a descent into hell and it's

actually one of the places that we sort
 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.890
actually one of the places that we sort
of derive the popular conception of Hell

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900
of derive the popular conception of Hell
 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.530
of derive the popular conception of Hell
was partly based on Dante's and empties

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540
was partly based on Dante's and empties
 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.109
was partly based on Dante's and empties
imagination on his work and what Dante

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119
imagination on his work and what Dante
 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.910
imagination on his work and what Dante
was trying to do was to discover the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920
was trying to do was to discover the
 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.490
was trying to do was to discover the
hierarchical structure of evil and you

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500
hierarchical structure of evil and you
 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.269
hierarchical structure of evil and you
know you might think there's a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279
know you might think there's a
 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.890
know you might think there's a
hierarchical structure of good some

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
hierarchical structure of good some
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.630
hierarchical structure of good some
things are better than other things but

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640
things are better than other things but
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.250
things are better than other things but
there's also a hierarchical structure of

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260
there's also a hierarchical structure of
 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.080
there's also a hierarchical structure of
evil some evils are greater than other

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090
evil some evils are greater than other
 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.690
evil some evils are greater than other
evils and he put betrayal in the in the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700
evils and he put betrayal in the in the
 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.420
evils and he put betrayal in the in the
in the lowest part of Hell right so if

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430
in the lowest part of Hell right so if
 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.920
in the lowest part of Hell right so if
you were betraying people you were right

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
you were betraying people you were right
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.950
you were betraying people you were right
besides Satan himself and so and I think

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960
besides Satan himself and so and I think
 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.260
besides Satan himself and so and I think
that's good that's very smart well Dante

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
that's good that's very smart well Dante
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.740
that's good that's very smart well Dante
was a genius after all and I think the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
was a genius after all and I think the
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.020
was a genius after all and I think the
reason for that is that you see if

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
reason for that is that you see if
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.569
reason for that is that you see if
someone trusts you they're laying their

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579
someone trusts you they're laying their
 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.430
someone trusts you they're laying their
vulnerability open to you now they might

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440
vulnerability open to you now they might
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.770
vulnerability open to you now they might
just be naive let's say and that's we

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
just be naive let's say and that's we
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840
just be naive let's say and that's we
won't think about that because you're

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850
won't think about that because you're
 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.849
won't think about that because you're
just a child if you're naive you can

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
just a child if you're naive you can
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.619
just a child if you're naive you can
still be betrayed but if you're an adult

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
still be betrayed but if you're an adult
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.630
still be betrayed but if you're an adult
and you trust it's often because you if

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
and you trust it's often because you if
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.789
and you trust it's often because you if
you're an actual adult its you willingly

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799
you're an actual adult its you willingly
 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.640
you're an actual adult its you willingly
open yourself up knowing that you could

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
open yourself up knowing that you could
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.230
open yourself up knowing that you could
be hurt right because you're not naive

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
be hurt right because you're not naive
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.450
be hurt right because you're not naive

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
I'm laying myself open to you if you
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.550
I'm laying myself open to you if you
choose to use that power and then that's

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
choose to use that power and then that's
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.780
choose to use that power and then that's
a good thing to know you know if you've

been hurt as a child or hurt as a naive
person you might say well why should I

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
person you might say well why should I
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.359
person you might say well why should I
ever trust again which is a really good

ever trust again which is a really good
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.609
ever trust again which is a really good
question and the answer is the reason

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
question and the answer is the reason
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.319
question and the answer is the reason
you trust again once you're an adult is

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
you trust again once you're an adult is
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.780
you trust again once you're an adult is
because you're courageous your

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790
because you're courageous your
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.670
because you're courageous your
courageous it's an act of courage to

courageous it's an act of courage to
trust and the reason it's useful is

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
trust and the reason it's useful is
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.830
trust and the reason it's useful is
because if you trust someone you open

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
because if you trust someone you open
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.679
because if you trust someone you open
the door to reciprocity and negotiation

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
the door to reciprocity and negotiation
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.130
the door to reciprocity and negotiation
and cooperation and you entice the best

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
and cooperation and you entice the best
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.950

part of the person forward and so it's a
 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.620
part of the person forward and so it's a
it's a courageous act but then if you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
it's a courageous act but then if you
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.660
it's a courageous act but then if you
betray someone then what you've done is

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
betray someone then what you've done is
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.969
betray someone then what you've done is
you've taken the best part of them which

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
you've taken the best part of them which
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.130
you've taken the best part of them which
is the part that will courageously trust

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140
is the part that will courageously trust
 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.830
is the part that will courageously trust
you know with open eyes right and you've

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
you know with open eyes right and you've
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.130
you know with open eyes right and you've
stuck a dagger in that and so you've

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140
stuck a dagger in that and so you've
 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.749
stuck a dagger in that and so you've
purposefully damaged the best part of

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759
purposefully damaged the best part of
 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.719
purposefully damaged the best part of
them and so that's why it's such a

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729
them and so that's why it's such a
 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.780
them and so that's why it's such a
egregious fault and and it's often

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790
egregious fault and and it's often
 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.339
egregious fault and and it's often
people don't recover from that sort of

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349
people don't recover from that sort of
 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.820
people don't recover from that sort of
thing you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
thing you
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.740
thing you
if you betray someone badly enough you

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
if you betray someone badly enough you
 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.110
if you betray someone badly enough you
can you can damage them like you can

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
can you can damage them like you can

post-traumatic stress disorder it
produces permanent neurological

you can you can recover from it to some
degree but stress will tend to reinstate
