00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.770
Remember, when we see a number like 142,
the 1 represents, 1 hundred,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.207
the 4 is, 4 tens and

00:00:10.207 --> 00:00:14.840
the 2 is just 2 ones.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.130
We call this the ones place,
this is the tens place, and

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.060
this is the hundreds place.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.050
Likewise, in a decimal like 0.627,
the 6 represents 6 tenths,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.040
the 2 is 2 hundredths, and
the 7 is 7 thousandths.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.680
Altogether, this is six hundred
twenty seven thousandths.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.892
The way that we say this number gives
us a clue about how to write it

00:00:45.892 --> 00:00:46.911
as a fraction.

00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:52.122
0.627 or
six hundred twenty seven thousandths,

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:59.270
would be written as a fraction as six
hundred twenty seven over a thousand.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.150
Using this place value chart,
write one hundred and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.920
nine thousandths as a fraction.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.930
Write your answer in these boxes
with the numerator on the top and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.350
the denominator in the bottom.
