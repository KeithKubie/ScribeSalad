00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.860
&gt;&gt; [rhythmic percussion]

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.190
&gt;&gt; Okay, guys. Just a few housekeeping things
first.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.509
It's going to run for about an hour.
David will speak for 40 minutes, and then,

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.010
you've got 20 minutes to ask him a few questions.
If you have got questions, you can use the

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.769
podium mics at the sides of the auditorium.
Okay?

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.630
So, here he is, David McWilliams at Google.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.630
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:36.750
David McWilliams: It's really nice to be here.
And I'd say, 'a wee bit intimidating' actually,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.330
to be here too, as well -- on the basis that,
you know, this company has done so much in

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.700
the last couple of years, which has kind of
changed most of our lives.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.579
I certainly couldn't write books without Google,
so thank you very much -- and all your search

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.920
engines.
That's always very good to just 'cut and paste'

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.430
and download. [laughter]
It's like, "I swear I came up with that idea;

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.720
it was all me own." right?
So thank you all -- in advance -- for the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.060
royalties that come. No, but.
And also, this book that I do talk about,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.980
but I'm going to talk about other things as
well.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.050
This book, "Follow the Money," has come in
for a lot of strange attention over the last

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.150
couple of weeks, which was kind of unintended.
But that's sometimes, I suppose, something

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.170
that you just have to deal with, in the course
of doing things in Ireland.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.980
I'm going to talk mainly about Ireland, but
I'm going to broaden it out obviously, because

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.780
the audience is much more international than
the audience -- for example, I spoke last

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.890
night in Limerick, and it was much more of
a local event.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.310
I do need to get out alive, but so, here I
am -- it's grand. [laughter] No, I'm only

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.580
joking.
But, just by way of -- I was just thinking,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.990
kind of as a little bit of housekeeping -- just,
please do make sure that your mobiles are

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.400
switched off.
And the reason I say this is, about two months

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.890
ago, amazingly, one of the Irish banks let
me in, which is kind of unusual -- I'm rather

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.400
their Enemy No. 1.
And I was discussing at the board level what

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.170
I thought was going to happen.
I had written that I thought the banks -- one

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.250
of the big banks -- was going to be nationalized.
And then, all the banks were, "Oh, no. It's

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.250
not going to be nationalized.
That can't possibly happen, unless we use

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.751
up -- no money, and that's kind of what happens."
And I was down one end of the board, right?

00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:08.970
And there was the chief investment officer,
right?

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.580
And all his cronies on the other end.
And I was kind of a lone voice.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.790
And I was giving the argument for nationalization,
and they were giving very good arguments back.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.751
And I was giving the argument, and they were
giving the argument.

00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:22.331
And then, soon you realize the argument's
going away from you.

00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:25.900
You're beginning to lose the argument, and
you can feel yourself going into a hole.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:39.590
And, just as he was about to give his killer
point, the chief investment officer of one

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.300
of our biggest banks, his mobile phone rang.
And the ringtone was, "Don't you want me,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.300
baby?" by the Human League. [laughter]
Result? I said, "Thank you very much. You'll

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.530
never work in this town again."
So, what I'm saying is, sometimes some easy

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.450
download onto your phones -- that, in the
privacy of your own car, might be a guilty

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.820
pleasure -- sound really naff when they go
off in public.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.320
So just to save you from potential embarrassment
amongst your peers, please just hit the mobile

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.830
phones' mute.
The other thing I'd like to talk about is,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.069
you know, my own experience from working.
What I want to talk about is, in Ireland -- it

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.810
might be a little bit strange in Google, but
in Ireland -- we have a tradition here that,

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.350
when somebody or a company or an individual
or a group of individuals arrives with a new

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.810
idea, those ideas go through three phases.
The first phase is "open ridicule," okay?

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.400
Right?
You are undermined, besmirched, laughed at,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.390
and really held up to be a complete idiot.
That's the first phase.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:35.380
Then, the second phase in Ireland is, "violent
opposition" to both you and the idea, okay?

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.380
And that can manifest into an amazing array
of ways.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.050
And as I've suffered from this over the years,
I'm quite aware of it now.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:45.610
And then, the third thing in Ireland is the
"universal acceptance" phase, right?

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.560
Where the idea was ridiculed then.
Then, it's violently opposed.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.500
And then, it's the taxi drivers, "Oh, well.
We all knew the property was going to fall."

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.340
[in a thick Irish accent] "Oh, Jesus. Absolutely.
You know, you thought you were on your own,

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.819
man. But I knew it." Right? [laughter]
And so did all the maids down on the Suvman

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:09.630
Inn, right?
So that is what happens in Ireland with ideas,

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.160
right?
But it doesn't happen in Google, because Google

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.870
is a big place, full of mad ideas and things
like that.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.269
But that's an important thing, because when
you write books or when you stand up on television,

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.100
you make TV programs or whatever.
You do it because you're involved in the idea,

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.930
right?
And the idea is what drives you forward.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.240
And it's the idea that actually changes the
world.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.990
And it's the idea that changes the country.
So, this is why, you know, people like me

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.020
tend to get up and write these books every
couple of years.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.960
But I'm very -- I just want to also make one
point about the -- that was the phase of ideas.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.520
The other phase of ideas in Ireland, okay?
Maybe all over the world, but particularly

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.770
here is, there is no alternative, okay?
That's we are hearing at the moment in our

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.150
economy with respect to the banks, with respect
to cutbacks, with respect to everything.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.220
Anybody who articulates a counter-view, a
counter-cyclical view, or a counter-thinking

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.240
view is -- there is no alternative.
The mandarins are right, and ultimately, the

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.130
civil service is right.
And to argue with the civil service means

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.520
you're being unpatriotic, which is another
great Irish thing.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.229
See what happened to poor Auntie Arian Ree.
Forget all that, be nice to the bloody Frenchman

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.850
and all that sort of thing.
You can't do that -- oh, with the left paw.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.390
Anyway.
So I just want to talk about these big ideas,

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:26.970
because I put it by way of a story, which
 -- many years ago -- and it's really, the

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.210
important thing is that, "The system can be
wrong."

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:39.310
This is what I'm saying.
And if the system is proved to be wrong, what

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:50.080
tends to happen is, the system attacks the
person who says it is wrong.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:58.389
Because they believe that, by admitting you're
wrong, you undermine yourself.

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:06.040
Whereas I always believed, by admitting you're
wrong and the mistakes, you actually learn

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.470
something.
And our society is in this phase where the

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.810
battle for ideas is pivotal now for where
this country goes for the next couple of years.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:19.260
And I'll tell you, years ago, when I was about
the age of most of the people here.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.860
And I worked in the Central Bank of Ireland
as an economist, in 1992.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.790
And in 1992, this country was rather different
from the country that many of you have come

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.460
to and, obviously, most of us have lived in.
And in 1992, it was very interesting, because

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:44.340
you know that we now -- I presume at Google
like, you know, it's all to be kind of cool

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.770
with the chief executive and kind of play
softball with your manager and all that sort

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.140
of nonsense, you know?
[laughter] Hang out with the troops, you know?

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.960
And the receptionist is the best thing since
sliced bread, right?

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.070
You know, you just see that in corporate affairs,
you know.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.561
"If it wasn't for the people, the company
would be nothing," right?

00:07:03.561 --> 00:07:10.800
Which is true.
But back in 1992, in Ireland, it was the opposite

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.950
case, right?
We got unemployment was about 16 percent.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.259
And the way to success wasn't to hang with
the chief executives.

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:21.961
It was to avoid the chief executive like the
plague, right?

00:07:21.961 --> 00:07:33.270
To make sure that you never came into any
contact with anybody in power, right?

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:43.430
This was the key thing, and you can just meander
through the civil service.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.759
My -- you know, I was an economist there,
and I used to write articles about Europe

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:52.590
for the governor of the bank.
And just think about it now.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.479
It's quite different at Google.
The governor of the Bank of Ireland -- or

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:59.621
Central Bank of Ireland -- was so remote from
the poor lads who wrote his speeches, right?

00:07:59.621 --> 00:08:05.350
-- that he had his own bleeding lift.
So you can imagine, right? It's true. It's

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.130
true.
You go down there and take it now.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:16.140
There's a little small lift like that -- for
one or two people -- and then, there's a lift

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.680
for all the sardines who work there, who actually
write the policy.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.740
So I was always intrigued by this sort of
thing.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:35.319
I never met him, and that was the whole point
is, you'd write the speeches like this.

00:08:35.319 --> 00:08:42.990
You'd write a speech like this, and it would
go up like in a dorm waiter [oooh] up to his

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.490
floor. And you'd wait.
And about two days later [oooh] right back

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:51.980
down to you again, with scribbles ________.
Which is kind of difficult if you come from

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.900
Dunleary.
But Dunleary Gaelta didn't actually get that

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.129
far, you know?
So, you also might remember -- some of you

00:08:59.129 --> 00:09:05.670
who might be old enough to remember.
I don't think it's many in the room -- but

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.110
in 1992, we had a currency crisis in Ireland,
right?

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:17.309
But, we had spent the whole of the 1980s and
the early 90's pretending to the financial

00:09:17.309 --> 00:09:21.999
markets that we weren't Irish -- we were actually
German, right?

00:09:21.999 --> 00:09:28.920
We tied to the Deutsche mark.
And we said, "Don't worry, we're Germans,"

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:34.509
right?
And we've saved as much as the Germans, and

00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:39.410
we're as clever as them, and our exchange
rate is right, okay?

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:44.010
And the rest of the world believed, for about
three years, that we were Germans, right?

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:53.110
But then what happened is, Britain fell out
of the exchange rate mechanism -- we always

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:57.860
blame the Brits, you know.
That was a default position. [laughter] or

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:09.899
the French now; it's all good. [laughter]
I like the idea, I was reading the paper.

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:16.670
You mentioned actually Sarkozy's picking up
the phone.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:22.220
And he's got the weight of the world and Charlotte
on his shoulders.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.380
And he's -- [laughter] All right, he didn't
say that.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.529
It's a nice image, though.
Anyway, and Brian kind of reasons with him,

00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:35.230
he says, "It's all about the football."
I just find it amazing that we're going -- anyway,

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.279
but the point is -- it's a funny Irish diplomacy.
Anyway.

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:40.999
So the idea back then was, we'd said we were
Germans, but then of course, the financial

00:10:40.999 --> 00:10:46.920
markets didn't believe us, so they started
speculating against our currency, the 'punt'.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:57.439
And the official line in Ireland was -- the
official line from the top was, "No devaluation.

00:10:57.439 --> 00:11:04.670
Devaluation would be the worst thing we could
ever possibly do.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:17.019
And if we did that, we would be incredible.
And no money would ever come back.

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:27.750
And the likes of Google -- which wasn't created.
Or the likes of, let's say, Microsoft, or

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:33.509
whatever -- would never come into Ireland,
because we would not be a credible country.

00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:38.819
And we'd be really a bunch of paddies over
the mid-Atlantic, right?" The financial markets

00:11:38.819 --> 00:11:45.119
said, "We don't believe you."
So what happened was, we put our interest

00:11:45.119 --> 00:11:50.129
rates up.
Think about this. Our interest rates were

00:11:50.129 --> 00:11:56.470
up to 102 percent over night.
Just think about that, right?

00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:03.459
Our currency was falling like a stone. Our
reserves were falling like a stone.

00:12:03.459 --> 00:12:09.540
I was working in the bank at the time, and
I was trying to avoid the governor, clearly,

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:15.360
to get on in my life.
And we were sitting there one Tuesday, and

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:23.649
I was doing what was a very important job
in the Central Bank is to be the official

00:12:23.649 --> 00:12:25.730
photocopier of the Irish Times crossword,
right?

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:30.019
Essential part of the morning, okay?
To get it tuned into the competition for the

00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:33.110
day.
And I was sitting there -- publisher across

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:39.139
this -- and I got this sort of [thump, thump,
thump, thump] and I looked up, and there was

00:12:39.139 --> 00:12:41.190
the governor.
And I thought, "Oh, Jesus."

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:46.179
And he said, "Mr. McWilliams, you'll be aware
we are having some problems with the currency."

00:12:46.179 --> 00:12:50.069
And I said, "No shit, Sherlock. Jesus Christ."
[laughter]

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:57.860
He said, "I would like you to go to the Dorchester
Hotel in London to discuss economics with

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:01.129
some people from Germany and Switzerland who
are portfolio managers.

00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:11.910
Do you know the Dorchester?" And I said, "Well,"
 -- what he didn't know was that my second

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:21.869
last job was one as a kitchen porter in the
Dorchester Hotel in London.

00:13:21.869 --> 00:13:27.629
So I'd never been through the front door,
but I've been through the back door a lot

00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:30.870
of times.
So, I says, "Yes, I do."

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.509
And he said, "Would you go over there and
explain that we won't devalue?"

00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:41.709
And what has happened, at the time, is that
Ireland was sending out economists sooner

00:13:41.709 --> 00:13:48.689
to deal with portfolio managers to say, "This
is the policy."

00:13:48.689 --> 00:13:55.569
And I said, "Only at the Dorchester?" You
know, I kind of looked at him, and he said,

00:13:55.569 --> 00:14:04.040
"There will be no devaluation."
And I felt like saying, "Is that a _____?"

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:13.230
It was like standing in front of the dougal,
I said, "Oh." [laughter]

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.170
"All right, Ted. No devaluation."
So, [pause]

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:25.959
And at the time, we didn't know how to think
about this now, for all you Googlites.

00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:28.059
At the time, somebody mentioned something
about Powerpoint.

00:14:28.059 --> 00:14:35.720
And I said, "What?" He said, "There's a thing
called 'Powerpoint'.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:50.929
I think you should present the case in Powerpoint."
And I looked at him, and I said, "Okay." [laughter]

00:14:50.929 --> 00:14:57.569
"What in Jesus' name is Powerpoint?"
So we went, and we did a course in Powerpoint

00:14:57.569 --> 00:15:06.529
on Wednesday in the morning.
We learned the speech.

00:15:06.529 --> 00:15:14.019
Anyway, got the whole speech ready.
And we did what all the economists do, right?

00:15:14.019 --> 00:15:19.329
If the economist doesn't understand what they're
doing, or is nervous, they'd revert to mathematics,

00:15:19.329 --> 00:15:20.970
okay?
Just know that, right?

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:25.339
From your university things, right?
If they can't explain in simple terms what's

00:15:25.339 --> 00:15:31.629
going on, they've got all sorts of songs,
open the blackboard like this, right?

00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:37.860
Because that makes them look smart.
So, obviously, I put a lot of songs in the

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.399
document.
And I couldn't trust the floppy disk, so I

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:45.679
decided I'd print them all off, right?
All 20 speeches.

00:15:45.679 --> 00:16:00.339
So I print them all off [biig, biig, biig],
and I wrapped it all up in a brown, cardboard

00:16:00.339 --> 00:16:12.639
box, put it on the carousel, got onto Aer
Lingus in first class -- when Aer Lingus had

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:23.379
a first class -- which was many years ago.
And it's obviously not going to be around

00:16:23.379 --> 00:16:28.850
here in a couple of years, so that's a shame,
but anyway, there you go.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:34.209
And got the box, went into the thing, and
there was a big room like this.

00:16:34.209 --> 00:16:44.169
And I arrived in -- and I swear, like I was
riding this _______, right?

00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:54.339
And a pair of rubber shoes, and looking at
the lots, and I said, "Hi, how is?" And they

00:16:54.339 --> 00:16:59.439
said, "Hi, fine."
And there were about 17 or 18 very senior

00:16:59.439 --> 00:17:03.920
people in the room.
And they kind of looked different to us at

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.510
the time.
When we were poor, rich people smelled different

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.250
to us.
Remember that? They did.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:16.940
It was like a different race, or something,
you know. [laughter]

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:25.199
Like, we were really poor and skinny, and
they were all kind of full of pack air obanee

00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:31.420
and stuff like that, you know?
Kind of big heavy watches on them.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:38.120
Those big heavy watches have three little
watches on them, so you know. [laughter]

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:49.690
I don't know, you can call in an airstrike
on them or something like that. Anyway.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:56.760
So, I went up and I said, "Hello, just got
a little speech."

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:01.330
And I got up me box with all me speeches in
them.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:07.650
And I looked in the box, and I looked at them.
And then I looked into the box again, and

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.400
I looked at them.
And I looked in the box, and they started

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.050
looking in the box.
And in the box was not the speech, it was

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:19.101
six dozen golf balls. [laughter]
So I said, "Hold it. Hold it."

00:18:19.101 --> 00:18:26.400
And you could just hear them saying, "Sell
that currency. Sell that country."

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.990
Anyway, the long and short of it, we did make
the speech.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.880
And these things happened.
They all tripped out, except one guy at the

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.600
very back.
And I felt I was going to become a kitchen

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:46.870
porter again, actually, at heart.
That was it -- my career as an economist and

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:55.250
mathematician is all gone.
And one guy sat in the back -- big, huge lad.

00:18:55.250 --> 00:19:03.880
Big, huge lad, huge big double breasted ______.
And he says to me -- not that he was actually

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.990
going to cut me in two, or something.
And he said, "Very impressive."

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:12.180
I said, "Oh Jesus, thank you very much, Squire."
He said, "Your ability to articulate economics

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.030
is extraordinary."
I said, "Well, thank you, sir. Thank you very

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.030
much."
He said, "You know, you have this ability

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.800
to reduce technical ideas to something very
simple."

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:24.670
I said, "Oh, that's lovely. You're great too.
You're fab, you know."

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:29.190
"I like you already, you know? I take you
home."

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:33.940
And he said, "You know, but your extraordinary
way with words and confidence,"

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:41.200
He said, "In fact, you know, what really intrigues
me is that, for somebody so young -- and with

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:50.850
a smile on your face, looking almost angelic
 -- your ability to lie for your country is

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:56.180
phenomenal." [laughter]
All right. Rumbled, "Okay. Fair enough."

00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:03.640
I thought I was going off to the Old Bailey
at that stage.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:10.540
Then, he looked at me; he said, "Would you
like to lie for me?" [laughter]

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.160
And I said, "[Rghh]" warming to the conversation,
I said, "Who are you?"

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:22.080
Now, okay, at the time, UBS was the biggest
bank in Europe, and I had never heard of it,

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.760
right?
I thought there was two banks in the world:

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:31.980
Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish, right?
[laughter]

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:41.050
Couldn't tell you, I didn't know where.
And he says to me -- as senior chaps in these

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:48.440
sort of banks say -- he says, "I am from UBS."
Now, I thought the fucker said, "UPS," right?

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.990
[laughter]
So I was imagining me self one of those brown

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:57.050
uniforms, you know? [laughter]
Going around in a little van saying, "Sign

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:00.890
here, please."
I thought it was a promotion, and anyway.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:07.821
In subsequent weeks, I did start working for
UBS, in London and then in Russia and all

00:21:07.821 --> 00:21:11.340
over the place.
But the point of the story is, what happened

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.810
to Ireland?
We devalued about eight weeks later, right?

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:20.000
Now, official Ireland said that, If we devalued,
number one, unemployment will rise, inflation

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.940
will rise, interest rates will rise, the budget
deficit will go out of control, emigration

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:29.310
will rise, and the country might as well saw
itself off the rest of Europe and float out

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.220
into the Atlantic, Okie doke.
That was the official line.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.830
What actually happened? Unemployment fell
rapidly.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:43.290
A huge wall of money that was terrified about
Irish policy came flooding back into the country.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:49.740
Interest rates fell, almost by the minute.
The rate of inflation didn't rise; it fell,

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.460
okay?
Unemployment fell. The economy boomed.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:22:03.680
So official policy was that, "If we devalue,
we will end up in a disaster situation."

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:16.690
What actually happened is, we devalued and
the country boomed.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:29.070
So what this does -- says to you that ideas
and official positions can sometimes be wrong.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:31.670
And, if they are wrong, they are catastrophically
wrong.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:35.190
Catastrophically wrong.
And in our country, this has happened.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:44.250
But again, those who said that we should devalue
at the time were ridiculed.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:48.250
Then, they were violently opposed.
But ultimately, every single one of the people

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:54.260
who opposed the devaluation in Ireland, included
_____,

00:22:54.260 --> 00:23:06.980
[in
a heavy Irish accent] "Oh, sure. We all knew

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:18.100
if we devalued, it would be fine, right?"
By the way, they've all been promoted.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:40.770
Every single person who presided over the
failed policy are now very, very senior positions

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:46.640
in the country, right?
So, what I'm saying to you is, Always think,

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.480
when ideas are first mooted, they are opposed
viciously.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:58.480
Number one, because they threaten people.
And the other side of the thing is that, If

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:11.170
a country decides to run up an intellectual
cul-de-sac -- as we did in the 90's, and I

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:24.960
believe we are doing now again -- what happens
is, we in Ireland can't admit that we're wrong,

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:40.210
because to admit we're wrong is a bigger failure
in the eyes of those who are orchestrating

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:46.310
policy than actually doing the right thing.
Now, I compare this to -- there's many Irish

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:49.140
people here.
Does anybody remember their granny in the

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:57.080
country having a 'good room'? Right?
My granny had a good room for so good that

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:05.240
I wasn't good enough to go into it, right?
[laughter] The good room was just for the

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:12.549
foreigners, to explain.
The good room was an Irish concept, right?

00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:29.970
 -- that grannies had.
And I was always intrigued by the good room

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:42.090
when I was a kid, because I just wasn't good
enough.

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:49.100
I mean, Ma wasn't good enough.
I mean, Dad wasn't good enough, right? -- to

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:54.260
go into the good room.
And what happened is, my granny's house, the

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.300
good room was locked.
She had the key.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:03.900
But in the good room was kind of China that
she'd got for a wedding present, right?

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.740
Wrapped it up in faded covers of the Irish
Independence, right?

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:17.350
No Irish press in our bleeding house. Anyway.
And there'd be delf and pictures of fictitious

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.550
ancestors, which we never had.
They probably bought in the market in the

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:25.950
Croom to make us look posh, right? Okay?
But I don't think any of our ancestors were

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:30.860
rich enough to get their photos taken in 1910.
So, that was it, you know?

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:37.460
Like normally, if you go to German houses
that have great -- sometimes French houses

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:43.190
 -- ancestors, fellows with big mustaches
and shit like that, right?

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:52.640
And we didn't have them. Or, if we did, they
weren't in our house.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:27:04.250
But anyway, the good room was a conceit.
And the conceit of the good room was that,

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:10.860
if the local priest came -- or the local doctor
or the local big farmer came -- you'd bring

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:16.120
him into the good room.
And you'd pretend that you all lived in the

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:39.000
good room. [laughter]
But everyone knew you didn't live in

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.530
the good room.
So, it was a big pretense, right?

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:53.740
So you probably pretend that we are as good
as you, so you come into the good room, right?

00:27:53.740 --> 00:28:04.170
But the priest knew that we all lived out
in the backyard, right?

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:10.220
On top of each other, right?
With the animals and shit like that, right?

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:14.470
But the good room was all about a lack of
self-esteem.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:20.280
It's a serious point.
I know made light, but it's a serious point.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:30.520
A lack of self-esteem which percolated through
the Irish psyche.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:44.110
So we pretended we were posher than we were,
and the posh people pretended to believe us,

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:51.950
okay?
And, in so doing, the status quo of the good

00:28:51.950 --> 00:29:01.850
room remained very much part of Irish life
for many years. It's gone now, right?

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:10.660
But think about policy.
Bad policy is the equivalent of the good room.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:21.340
We have got a lack of self-esteem to say at
the moment when our banks are bust, when our

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:28.260
economy is in terrible difficulty -- we haven't
got the self-esteem to go to our European

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.170
partners and say, "We're in real trouble.
And that trouble demands radical solutions."

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:38.920
Because we are in extraordinary times here
in Ireland, but I actually believe we are

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.620
in extraordinary times all over the world.
But here in Ireland, we're in extraordinary

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.990
times.
And that demands extraordinary solutions.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:50.510
But we sit in the good room, pretending that
everything is all right.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:57.040
And we're waiting for the calvary to come
over the hill.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:03.070
It's the, "Something might turn up in the
next 20 minutes" approach to economics, right?

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:07.260
Something hasn't turned up for quite awhile.
The calvary won't turn up.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:13.390
Anybody who's traveled.
You guys know you're in a competitive global

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:26.600
marketplace.
You know what's going on in the rest of the

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:35.410
world.
You know what other countries are doing.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:40.490
You know such technological advances are going.
So we are in the good room petrified.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:47.210
And we have to analyze where we've got to
in Ireland -- not only in Ireland, but in

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:57.740
Britain and America.
And we are in -- to use the parlance of economics

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:07.830
 -- a very classic "liquidity trap", right?
We don't want to borrow, because of huge,

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:13.910
inherited debts that we took out in the last
few years.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:24.660
The banks don't want to lend, because we have
now become a bigger risk.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:32.960
And what the banks are doing is, they're taking
their money from the European Central Bank.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:38.650
It's very nice, at one percent.
The Irish Government bond market is yielding

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:48.179
5.7 percent for 15-year money.
So you say, "I get that for free. That's one

00:31:48.179 --> 00:31:58.040
percent money from the Germans.
Danke Schon, Zerdie." Okay?

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:05.370
And I can invest it at 5.7 percent, which
is a 4.7 percent free carry, without even

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:14.630
opening the doors of the bank.
So, why in Jesus' name, would I lend to anyone

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:23.710
 -- including a restaurant or a bar or a car
dealership or a small company?

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:32.780
-- because it makes no sense.
If I was the corporate treasurer for big banks,

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:38.220
I wouldn't lend either.
Because I would rebuild our balance sheet

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:42.620
internally based on a little bit of obvious
financial play.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:33:11.070
But what happens is, then the money that we
are getting from Europe gets stuck in the

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.390
banking system.
We don't want to borrow as much as we did,

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:20.570
because we've got to pay back things.
I think there's a moment in Ireland we have

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:24.540
to admit one thing, which is unfortunate.
[whispering] We don't have money.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:33.190
We don't have the money to pay back the 132,000
Euros that we owe per household in this country.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:36.210
Okay?
We just don't have it.

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:41.691
And then again, you've got to think of what
we spend the money on.

00:33:41.691 --> 00:33:49.120
This is the unfortunate thing.
When you're on tele, you have a very, very

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:54.960
unusual relationship with taxi drivers. Okay?
I'll just tell you this, so everyone who chooses

00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:01.580
the career I've chosen -- so you go to Dublin
airport, you know, you come back from London.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.920
And, about two years ago, this happened to
me.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:10.700
I'd made a program about how the economy was
going to really, really -- the property market

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:18.039
was going to crash, banks were going to crash,
and it was back to the ridicule idea.

00:34:18.039 --> 00:34:25.960
You were ridiculed at the time.
I got into the taxi, and there's a dog there.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:32.799
And he's a huge big _______ and the Dublin
jersey, you know?

00:34:32.799 --> 00:34:39.799
Kind of a man who thinks that blue bubble
wrap is a good look, you know?

00:34:39.799 --> 00:34:43.239
[laughter] and he stretch down over him like
that.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:47.500
He's kind of kissing the castles, you know?
Up in the hill.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:53.749
And I get in and say, "Hi. Hi, how are you?"
And he goes, "Oh, it's only yourself." [laughter]

00:34:53.749 --> 00:34:58.589
"That's me. Thank you very much."
He says, "I seen you on the tele the other

00:34:58.589 --> 00:35:03.079
night, talking through your bleeding hole."
[laughter] "Okay."

00:35:03.079 --> 00:35:08.690
"You haven't a Jesus clue what you're talking
about, man.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:17.239
Well, I don't mind, for a man has to earn
their cross, but you haven't a bleeding clue."

00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:19.700
I said, "Can I please?" [laughter]
Then he says, "Where are you at?"

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:25.559
And then, we kind of warm into the conversation.
Usual thing. Break the ice.

00:35:25.559 --> 00:35:28.109
And he said, "Where are you coming from?"
I said, "London."

00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:32.319
And he was talking about them, he said, "I'm
after just coming back me self from Culsedussy."

00:35:32.319 --> 00:35:34.119
I said, "Really? Culsedussy."
He says, "Yeah."

00:35:34.119 --> 00:35:46.510
And he put his log up to the mirror -- as
Dublin taxi drivers do when they want to indicate

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:49.819
numerals, okay?
And he said, "I'm after buying five guffs

00:35:49.819 --> 00:35:54.559
just now off plants in the beautiful development
in Culsedussy.

00:35:54.559 --> 00:35:59.960
The golf course is coming in 2029.
[laughter] And a very nice man from AIB is

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:09.279
after the finest, and the whole thing based
on my house in the _____."

00:36:09.279 --> 00:36:11.640
[laughter] I thought, "Okay."
"Lovely people, them Greeks." [laughter]

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.940
Say nothing. Balkan wars and all that stuff,
right?

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.501
Now, we have to pay for all that stuff now,
right?

00:36:18.501 --> 00:36:24.420
We have to pay for all that stuff.
I mean, it wasn't just this month.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:32.720
It was a frenzy.
And other stuff we got to pay for in Ireland,

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.769
right?
And this is before we get on to how Google

00:36:37.769 --> 00:36:43.739
is going to save us -- so don't worry.
There's an evangelical chief executive tone

00:36:43.739 --> 00:36:51.220
to the _____. Anyway.
I just sort of figure it out as I keep speaking.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:54.960
[laughter]
You know, like the other thing.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:00.609
We spend on funny things in Ireland.
Like, about eight months ago -- I have a friend

00:37:00.609 --> 00:37:05.670
of mine, who was in college with me, and she's
married to a mate of mine.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:10.900
And she's very, very nice, but she's got one
of those very high-pitched South Dublin voices.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:15.259
[imitating chipmunk voice] Like talking to
a ______, like a ventriloquist.

00:37:15.259 --> 00:37:22.109
And I met her at Dan Ducky, and she was [imitating
chipmunk voice] [laughter]

00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:27.859
"Would you like to come up and see my island?"
[laughter]

00:37:27.859 --> 00:37:32.900
And I said, "Your what?" "My island." [laughter]
There was I thinking -- Tuesday afternoon,

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:38.109
her fellow's away, you know?
No, I wasn't. I wasn't. I wasn't.

00:37:38.109 --> 00:37:45.539
But, it does cross your mind when you work
for yourself. Anyway. [laughter]

00:37:45.539 --> 00:37:52.270
So you go off to see 'the island', right?
Now, when I was in school -- when I was a

00:37:52.270 --> 00:38:00.700
kid -- like, in Ireland was like the Aran
Islands or Lambay Islands or Dorkey Islands.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:06.980
That's an island, right?
So you go into this house, sort of typical

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:11.480
Dublin house -- they're all over the country.
Not `just -- all over the country.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:16.510
And you walk through the door, and it looks
kind of normal.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:21.309
But you're having kind of a Dr. Hood tireless
moment, because you can sense something's

00:38:21.309 --> 00:38:24.660
going on.
And you walk in, and clearly, an architect

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:30.460
 -- on far too much acid -- has got hold of
the house, and pushed back walls and sliding

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:34.940
this and doors and rain forest, and all sorts
of things.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:42.569
And so, you're kind of shocked, but you're
still waiting to see 'the island', okay?

00:38:42.569 --> 00:38:51.670
And then, you walk into the kitchen.
When did we decide that we have to have kitchens,

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:58.390
which you could land an entire platoon of
American marines in -- in five Blackhawks

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:02.859
that don't touch each other?
[imitating helicopter sounds] And the yummy

00:39:02.859 --> 00:39:10.579
mummy is kind of rolling her blade around.
[woo!] [woo!] [woo!] And you're kind of looking

00:39:10.579 --> 00:39:14.500
at her.
She's got one of those great -- you know,

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.519
those bicycle things.
Those things -- those bike show.

00:39:17.519 --> 00:39:28.640
"Let's go for a bicycle ride" -- but would
stay in the same place -- sitting over there.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.630
That's a great idea.
There will be a view and the whole thing.

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:38.630
And the island is there, and has eight sinks,
which is absolutely necessary, because we've

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:45.269
all become Orthodox Jewish people, right?
And we don't like our meat in our milk.

00:39:45.269 --> 00:39:50.549
You can understand in Israel if there's an
explosion in islands, right?

00:39:50.549 --> 00:39:54.259
There are religious reasons.
But we have the island for vanity.

00:39:54.259 --> 00:40:01.219
And then, of course, you look, and over in
the corner -- muttering to himself in Sanskrit

00:40:01.219 --> 00:40:10.979
 -- is the 'genius' child.
Does anybody of you that have children you'll

00:40:10.979 --> 00:40:16.950
know that everyone else's child is a geeenius.
[chipmunk voice] I don't know how it happened.

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:22.769
[regular voice] And the genius child is there
with this fat -- called bloody 'Setanta',

00:40:22.769 --> 00:40:28.180
or something. [laughter]
Or, you know, 'Lir', or something, any name

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:33.089
that predates Jesus by 2,000 years in any
culture. [laughter]

00:40:33.089 --> 00:40:39.900
Like I heard me buddy black, Ezekiel. [laughter]
"Ezekiel, come eat your dinner."

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:45.140
I believe you'll find it's in Leviticus -- anyway,
so. Setanta's there, right?

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:49.059
The problem is, we have to pay for all this
stuff now, right?

00:40:49.059 --> 00:40:53.309
This is my point, right?
In humor, there are some serious points.

00:40:53.309 --> 00:41:02.119
We have to pay for all these things, right?
Ezekiel and Setanta have to pay for all these

00:41:02.119 --> 00:41:07.430
things, right?
And we have this dilemma, because we can't

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:19.359
pay for them.
And what has happened in Ireland is, we have

00:41:19.359 --> 00:41:28.670
decided that the way we are going to deal
with our past mistakes is to make more of

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:32.269
them, right?
Which is not smart, okay?

00:41:32.269 --> 00:41:39.660
We are now involved in an economic policy,
which is based on grinding down wages and

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:52.480
grinding down employment and grinding down
prices, to such an extent that we want to

00:41:52.480 --> 00:42:03.579
regain the competitiveness that we lost, okay?
Which makes sense -- you need to be more competitive.

00:42:03.579 --> 00:42:13.739
But it makes no economic sense to pursue a
policy of grinding down wages through deflation,

00:42:13.739 --> 00:42:18.329
okay?
Because what is happening in the country -- has

00:42:18.329 --> 00:42:20.869
anybody here got young children?
All right. I have them. It's okay, you know?

00:42:20.869 --> 00:42:22.880
Right.
But, you might have noticed an outbreak of

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.479
nits recently in schools, which didn't happen
when I was a kid, right?

00:42:25.479 --> 00:42:27.460
You sent your children in, and you scrubbed
them with tea tree oil.

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:39.010
And then they go in, and they're smelling
lovely, like the forest or something.

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:44.690
And then, they come back going like this,
in their hands, right?

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:53.970
So the thing about nits is, if one kid gets
nits in the school, the next kid gets nits,

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:59.349
and so on, okay? [Imitating dominoes falling]
Now, think about the way the economy works.

00:42:59.349 --> 00:43:07.309
If I decide that I'm not going to spend and
I'm not confident, because I think prices

00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:13.200
are falling, then you're not going to spend
 -- then you're not going to spend, then you're

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.799
not going to spend, then you're not going
to spend.

00:43:14.799 --> 00:43:19.279
And suddenly, the expectations that prices
are going to be cheaper tomorrow -- called

00:43:19.279 --> 00:43:22.029
'deflation' -- gets into the psyche.
So everybody, rather than bringing forward

00:43:22.029 --> 00:43:23.779
spending, retracts spending.
And this becomes psychological.

00:43:23.779 --> 00:43:30.869
And it's crucial to break that cycle, otherwise
what happens in a country is that, ultimately,

00:43:30.869 --> 00:43:38.960
you simply end up spending less and less and
less.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:46.220
And it means all the stabilizations of the
government will fail.

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:50.700
That's the cycle we're in.
We have six percent deflation.

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:58.339
It's worse than Europe, and it seems to be
getting worse in Ireland, okay?

00:43:58.339 --> 00:44:01.930
So think about what we're doing is, we're
allowing unemployment to rise as the residual.

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:08.460
Now, unemployment has always been something
that -- one of the reasons I probably went

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:15.930
into economics is because, years and years
ago, my father lost his job, which was not

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:20.460
supposed to happen to families who are in
Monkstown and Dunleary.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:26.299
It didn't happen.
And so much so that my dad -- and I remember

00:44:26.299 --> 00:44:34.750
this as a ten-year-old -- used to put on his
suit and his tie and his coat and pretend

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:44.039
to our neighbors that he was going to work.
Every morning, got up past seven, he left

00:44:44.039 --> 00:44:51.049
the house, pretending he was going to work
because of the shame of unemployment.

00:44:51.049 --> 00:44:56.849
And I remember as a young boy -- you know,
ten years old -- cycling to school, and dad

00:44:56.849 --> 00:45:05.079
would cycle behind me.
And, when you're ten, you think this is fantastic,

00:45:05.079 --> 00:45:15.270
because you've got your dad with you.
But what made you feel delighted as a little

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:25.340
boy -- that he'd be there to play football
with you in the afternoon -- was killing him,

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:33.680
right?
So again, when I was a kid at ten -- one afternoon,

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:43.980
he said, "Listen, do you want to come with
me? I have to go give a message to somebody."

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:51.549
And I said, "Fine."
And he drove me to a place that I'd never

00:45:51.549 --> 00:45:56.220
been before.
And I've subsequently found out -- when I

00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:04.960
went to Trinity and I used to walk around
 -- that it was a place called "Warburg Street".

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:09.569
Warburg Street is a big, social welfare office,
right?

00:46:09.569 --> 00:46:16.319
And it was about as far from our road in Monkstown,
Dunleary as you could get.

00:46:16.319 --> 00:46:25.910
And my dad was signing on there, because he
was so ashamed of being unemployed in Dunleary

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:29.739
that he might meet somebody in the welfare
office.

00:46:29.739 --> 00:46:32.769
Now, that has affected me as an individual
profoundly.

00:46:32.769 --> 00:46:35.569
And maybe, you know, in school, I always preferred
maybe English and history.

00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:39.140
But I used to think, "How can this economics
game exist?

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:44.989
How can good people be laid low by bad economics?"
Because, it's always intrigued me.

00:46:44.989 --> 00:46:54.789
Because if that was happening to my dad, it
was happening to hundreds of thousands of

00:46:54.789 --> 00:47:06.450
dads and hundreds and thousands of families.
And my mother and my father tried to protect

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:14.720
 -- as you do your children, you try to protect
them.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:29.130
Now, think about what's happening now in Ireland.
We have seen our unemployment rate double.

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:36.009
That means all this strain and stress and
emotional trauma, psychological trauma, as

00:47:36.009 --> 00:47:39.660
well as financial distress.
But forget the finance.

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:53.609
If you want to see the cost of this in our
country, don't go and talk to economists,

00:47:53.609 --> 00:48:02.619
talk to doctors.
I have friends of mine who are doctors in

00:48:02.619 --> 00:48:09.130
small towns and big towns around the country,
and presenting to them every day are people

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:15.440
of our age -- younger -- who are beginning
to give up hope.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:22.440
And we in Ireland have to give everybody in
this country a chance.

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:27.160
We have to have an economic policy that gives
us a chance.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:33.310
Because if we just decide that we're going
to grind down wages and prices and let unemployment

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:36.200
rise, -- which is exactly what they're doing,
right?

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.650
-- we will destroy the country. We will destroy
families.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:47.030
And we will have thousands and thousands of
men, like my dad, living in shame.

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:57.220
And this we cannot afford.
And this is what people like Roosevelt figured

00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:07.650
out in America in the 30's.
Roosevelt was advised to stay on the gold

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:12.839
standard by all his advisors, and he said,
"No.

00:49:12.839 --> 00:49:16.539
The currency can change."
This is the key, right?

00:49:16.539 --> 00:49:24.510
This is how we get back in.
In Sweden and Finland, they have exactly the

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:29.460
same dilemma we had in the early 90's.
What did they do?

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:33.039
Change their currency.
They dropped their currency.

00:49:33.039 --> 00:49:38.190
They changed it to make themselves more competitive.
So, rather than go through the six years -- or

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:44.009
the four years -- of having a row with yourself
and grinding down wages, you just drop them

00:49:44.009 --> 00:49:50.579
overnight, like a company would -- you change
your prices, right?

00:49:50.579 --> 00:50:02.769
Think of it. Every single Asian tiger -- every
single one in the 1990's when I was working

00:50:02.769 --> 00:50:08.799
in investment banking, all -- same problem,
banks went mad.

00:50:08.799 --> 00:50:16.450
People bought property. Usual carry on.
-- They all dropped their exchange rates.

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:26.920
They all changed fundamentally, because in
a radical situation, you've got to do radical

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:32.289
things.
And the interesting thing about Ireland is,

00:50:32.289 --> 00:50:38.819
if anybody here -- and I'm sure a lot of you
have studied economics, right?

00:50:38.819 --> 00:50:50.589
Basic, orthodox economics tells you that,
in a crisis of debt deflation, the way you

00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:58.589
get out of it is, you change your currency.
That's what the whole world -- what is Obama

00:50:58.589 --> 00:51:02.829
doing?
"Uh, Mr. President, we've just borrowed another

00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:06.009
hundred billion, trillion, squillion from
China."

00:51:06.009 --> 00:51:13.430
We'll just keep borrowing, let the dollar
drop, because it's they're full event, no

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:18.200
problem, okay?
What is Britain doing? Britain is letting

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.980
its currency fall.
And if there's anything more nonsensical about

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:27.470
Irish Euro policy, it's a place called Nuri.
Nuri is 50-miles away from here, okay?

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:31.339
There was a program about the Berlin Wall
the other night.

00:51:31.339 --> 00:51:38.970
I think I saw George Lee, former colleague
of mine, great guy, right?

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:47.770
And he's made this film -- this great image
 -- and I presume there's some Germans here

00:51:47.770 --> 00:52:07.239
 -- it was a great image of the last bit of
the wall before, you know, it was put up.

00:52:07.239 --> 00:52:18.099
And there's like two or three guards and fellows
legging through the last bit of the wall,

00:52:18.099 --> 00:52:24.619
right?
Doctors and lawyers are getting out, right?

00:52:24.619 --> 00:52:31.980
And you think now, "Oh, my God. That was so
awful."

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:40.250
Have you ever been to the border of Northern
Ireland?

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:48.520
Have you ever seen the queues of our travants,
right?

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:57.180
Trying to get in to the North to shop?
Because our currency is too bloody expensive.

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:13.069
It will be regarded in the future as the biggest
economic nonsense that I have black and white

00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:25.609
grainy photographs of us in our 4x4's, which
you really need in Donnybrook, because the

00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:31.599
mudslides are shocking. [laughter]
Swear that whole bits of _____ just disappeared

00:53:31.599 --> 00:53:34.809
into the gutter last night.
Except for people with 4x4's. Anyway.

00:53:34.809 --> 00:53:39.339
Going there, we are denuding our entire retail
base -- for a currency, which we only trade

00:53:39.339 --> 00:53:47.329
20 percent in.
We only do 20 percent of our trade in the

00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:54.890
Euro, right?
So we have got this -- we're prostrate on

00:53:54.890 --> 00:54:25.539
some ridiculous idea.
And the reason is because -- I voted pro-European.

00:54:25.539 --> 00:54:32.180
I always do in all elections, right?
I believe that we should accelerate political

00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:37.400
union in Europe, absolutely.
And I believe Ireland should be part of that.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.549
But I also understand what's happening in
Europe, because what we have -- I worked as

00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:44.430
a waiter in Boston, Massachusetts, many years
ago.

00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:47.769
And there was a thing called the, "Dukakis
Boom."

00:54:47.769 --> 00:54:51.829
When we were in college, we all went over
there.

00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:57.269
Pretended to be the antis and the yonkers.
It was a fictitious ant in yonkers that we

00:54:57.269 --> 00:55:03.170
all went to.
And so, needless to say, we didn't go in legally.

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:04.170
I was actually the only white, English-speaking
dishwasher, ever.

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:05.170
And I remember my Colombian associate, who
was with me.

00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:10.809
He looked like Van Duren, football player.
Big, big, fro on the man.

00:55:10.809 --> 00:55:18.920
And he just used to look at me and he was
so intent, you could just see going through

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:28.769
his head, "You must be really ticked if you're
in here with us and you're white and you speak

00:55:28.769 --> 00:55:32.309
English."
And he was probably right. Anyway.

00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:39.979
But then, in Massachusetts, what happened
was, the economy collapsed, right?

00:55:39.979 --> 00:55:43.369
Same sort of carry on. Cycles, booms, busts.
Well, once the economy collapsed in Massachusetts,

00:55:43.369 --> 00:55:49.769
the rest of the United States paid for the
unemployment benefit of Massachusetts, okay?

00:55:49.769 --> 00:55:57.869
So what you get -- and the people in Massachusetts
migrated to California, or to wherever it

00:55:57.869 --> 00:56:04.859
was that was booming, and you got this kind
of thing of 'automatic stabilizers' in economics,

00:56:04.859 --> 00:56:07.400
right?
So your budget deficit doesn't go out of control,

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:13.589
because the rest of the federal republic pays.
So what America has is a military union with

00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:16.869
a real political union, right?
Proper, political, centralized government.

00:56:16.869 --> 00:56:23.619
We, in Europe, have a monetary union, and
we're pretending -- we're back in the good

00:56:23.619 --> 00:56:28.509
room again -- we're pretending to have a government.
So therefore what happens is, in the booms,

00:56:28.509 --> 00:56:31.089
the booms are exacerbated, and in the busts,
the busts are exacerbated.

00:56:31.089 --> 00:56:37.609
Because, instead of the rest of Europe saying,
"Okay, the paddies are in trouble.

00:56:37.609 --> 00:56:43.630
Money should flow into Ireland," which is
the objective.

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:54.729
It's where we're going maybe next generation.
But at the moment, we're not there yet.

00:56:54.729 --> 00:56:59.490
The European Union says, "Ireland is in trouble,
but you cut your budget deficit."

00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:04.030
But no economics says this.
So, at a time when the country is contracting,

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:11.790
the official policy is to contract it even
more, which makes no sense.

00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:17.219
So this is where I believe the radical option
 -- the only option -- is for us to step out

00:57:17.219 --> 00:57:22.109
of the good room, and analyze where we're
at and what we can possibly do.

00:57:22.109 --> 00:57:29.170
You take a country like Denmark.
Denmark is in the European Union -- very,

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:36.839
very fully paid up member.
It's not in the Euro. Sweden's not in the

00:57:36.839 --> 00:57:41.800
Euro.
Britain's not in the Euro. Czech Republic's

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:49.450
not in the Euro.
Hungary's not in the Euro. All the Baltic

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:57.209
states are not in the Euro.
Do I have to say anymore?

00:57:57.209 --> 00:58:03.319
It's not an anti-European argument.
It's actually pro, because what I believe

00:58:03.319 --> 00:58:11.759
 -- and I've written in the book.
Obviously, a lot of this stuff is in the book.

00:58:11.759 --> 00:58:23.109
But what I believe is that -- and it's 'NAMAting'.
I call it in the book, "VietNAMA," right?

00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:29.729
[laughter]
That's why I'm not popular with the government.

00:58:29.729 --> 00:58:36.150
Anyway, it's a small town as well, which is
really a sharp thing.

00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:40.059
That's the worst thing.
You can say all this in America, nobody will

00:58:40.059 --> 00:58:46.009
ever see you again.
In Ireland, you bump into everyone.

00:58:46.009 --> 00:58:50.839
But VietNAMA -- think about what happened
in Vietnam.

00:58:50.839 --> 00:58:59.150
The Americans threw everything they could
at South Vietnam, because they were operating

00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:14.229
in the Pentagon on an idea called the 'Domino
Theory' -- you know, the idea that, "If Vietnam

00:59:14.229 --> 00:59:23.049
goes, Indonesia might go, Malaysia might go,
Thailand." -- blah, blah, blah, the big fear

00:59:23.049 --> 00:59:28.819
of Communism -- "So we've got to stop Communism
wherever we find it with all our power, because

00:59:28.819 --> 00:59:36.269
that's how we prevent the dominos falling."
So eventually, what the Americans end up doing

00:59:36.269 --> 00:59:43.449
is throwing all their hardware at South Vietnam,
but not cognizant of the facts on the ground

00:59:43.449 --> 00:59:49.910
 -- not aware of what was actually going on
in Vietnam.

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:51.500
Because the Pentagon's policy was a global
view -- you know, rightly or wrongly. Okay?

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.500
We won't get into that argument.
But rightly or wrongly.

00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.539
The ECB has the same view with Ireland.
They are throwing all this money at us through

00:59:54.539 --> 00:59:55.539
NAMA, okay?
Which is Frankenstein creature -- God knows

00:59:55.539 --> 00:59:56.539
where he comes from -- okay?
We can follow the dots in the ____.

00:59:56.539 --> 00:59:57.539
Not because they're concerned about us, but
because they're concerned about the Domino

00:59:57.539 --> 01:00:03.329
Theory in the Euro.
That, If a bank were to go bust in Ireland,

01:00:03.329 --> 01:00:04.970
it would be an embarrassment in the financial
markets.

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:05.970
They'd say, "That Euro is only a shoddy currency.
It allows banks to go bust."

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:06.970
If a country goes bust, it's not because they're
worried about us, but they're worried about

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:07.970
the Domino Theory.
They're worried about how it'll play out in

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:08.970
Washington -- how it'll play out in Beijing,
how it'll play out in London.

01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:10.549
So, a bit like the Yanks.
It wasn't out of love for the South Vietnamese

01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:11.549
people that the Americans threw all their
military hardware at Vietnam.

01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:15.779
And equally, it's not out of the love of the
Irish.

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:16.940
And what happened in Vietnam is, the Americans
lost anyway.

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.750
And I believe that's what's going to happen
here.

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:20.750
The banks will go bust anyway, and we'll be
nationalized.

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:21.750
And we'll end up having fought this stupid
war -- like we did in the devaluation -- because

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:27.170
we couldn't accept that we might be wrong,
and we couldn't accept that, by being weak,

01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:29.099
you're strong.
When you admit that you make mistakes, you

01:00:29.099 --> 01:00:30.099
get stronger.
All of us make mistakes every single day.

01:00:30.099 --> 01:00:32.160
And there's a dreadful thing.
You know you make a mistake at work?

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.529
It never happens here at Google, right? [laughter]
And your first instinctive reaction, "Hide

01:00:36.529 --> 01:00:39.651
the Jesus thing."
Because, "Maybe they just won't see it," right?

01:00:39.651 --> 01:00:41.673
And you're kind of looking suspiciously at
your neighbor like this.

01:00:41.673 --> 01:00:42.673
Remember _______ the copy books during your
junior exams, right?

01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:45.559
Swarthy fellows in class, "No, he can't see
the answer."

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:49.569
But, when you admit your mistake, it's when
actually all the pressure goes, and you feel

01:00:49.569 --> 01:00:50.569
better about yourself.
And somebody says, "Listen, actually it's

01:00:50.569 --> 01:01:01.660
not a big deal. You are in trouble, so."
And we in Ireland have to admit that, but

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.380
we're not -- we're pretending we're stronger
than we are.

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:07.030
And by pretending we're stronger than we are,
nobody believes us.

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:17.180
This is the crazy thing.
Why are the financial markets fleeing from

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:25.530
Ireland, and charging us 5.7 percent for 15-year
money, where they're charging Germany 3 percent

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:27.339
in the same currency?
It's because the financial markets believe

01:01:27.339 --> 01:01:29.130
that something is going to give here -- maybe
this year, maybe next year.

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:33.089
But the risk in Ireland is so big, that they're
not prepared to give us money at the same

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:55.430
rates -- as they should do -- in the Euro.
So why do -- and I've got friends who work

01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:58.759
in the financial markets in London -- you
know, very wide boys.

01:01:58.759 --> 01:02:03.890
"Auhh, can't believe it."
He says, "You're fucking bankrupt, and you

01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:07.839
guys are paying me every single piece of the
bet all night."

01:02:07.839 --> 01:02:11.440
The guys in London can't believe that we are
paying them back, right?

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:17.040
And the reason is very simple, because business
is business.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:25.619
If you win some, you do well.
I presume it happens in lots of Google initiatives.

01:02:25.619 --> 01:02:29.979
You know, it's going great, and then it hits
the buffers and you lose and you park that

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:40.019
idea and you go onto something else.
And you have a contingency for, you know,

01:02:40.019 --> 01:02:49.150
ideas that don't work, and you try to make
sure that the ideas that work are substantially

01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:51.989
more -- or at least more -- than the ideas
that don't, and you move on.

01:02:51.989 --> 01:03:00.420
That's the way the markets work.
So, the financial markets have already made

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:05.650
provisions for their losses in the Irish banks.
But we can't understand that.

01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:11.869
Because we believe that, if we admit to the
mistakes of the past, that we will be crippled.

01:03:11.869 --> 01:03:13.119
But what happened in every country that has
admitted their mistakes?

01:03:13.119 --> 01:03:14.119
All the Asian tigers recovered straight away.
Okay?

01:03:14.119 --> 01:03:15.119
Korea, Indonesia, Thailand -- all banks failed;
recovered straight away.

01:03:15.119 --> 01:03:16.119
Financial markets are forward-looking, not
backward-looking.

01:03:16.119 --> 01:03:18.029
They want to see, "What's the next gig?" -- exactly
like yourselves at work, you know?

01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:19.039
You can't dwell on your mistakes; you learn
from them, and you move on.

01:03:19.039 --> 01:03:21.859
And the book argues strongly -- and that's,
I suppose, why it's created a lot of -- maybe

01:03:21.859 --> 01:03:24.589
also eating garlic with the final specials.
But anyway.

01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:28.559
_____ on prime time, which is very stupid.
But I come back to the ideas, right?

01:03:28.559 --> 01:03:32.891
Even that prime time thing.
You know, in 2003, I went on prime time and

01:03:32.891 --> 01:03:36.329
I said that the Irish economy was strong in
certain areas -- like here, in this area -- but

01:03:36.329 --> 01:03:38.680
it was weak in other areas.
And the areas that are weak were going to

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.920
predominate, and they are going to be -- and
I said that property markets wasn't a sign

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.880
of strength, but was a sign of weakness.
And I said on TV that it was a scam -- perpetrated

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.619
by developers, bankers, and the government
 -- to extract money from the people, which

01:03:48.619 --> 01:03:52.040
I believe it was.
Back to the idea, "ridicule," and "violently

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.859
opposed," then "Actually, we all knew it was
a bleeding scam." Right? Okay?

01:03:54.859 --> 01:04:01.269
And this idea will be the same, because this
idea is pure.

01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:08.141
It's what economics tells you to do.
I mean, we in Ireland have to realize that,

01:04:08.141 --> 01:04:11.599
if we don't do something like this, we are
going to find a generation -- your generation

01:04:11.599 --> 01:04:12.630
 -- will be hamstrung by the mistakes of a
different generation.

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:15.239
And this country can actually do almost anything
 -- once we admit we're wrong and once we've

01:04:15.239 --> 01:04:17.769
changed.
You know, I believe that this country -- what

01:04:17.769 --> 01:04:19.269
happened has happened in Google here, in Ireland,
and lots of other of our multinational corporations

01:04:19.269 --> 01:04:20.269
could be multiplied ten-fold.
Because the key to it is to have a country

01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:21.269
that is a pleasant-enough place to live, that
is open for business, it's open to foreign

01:04:21.269 --> 01:04:22.269
talent, and that ultimately plugs itself into
 -- at a competitive price -- the world market.

01:04:22.269 --> 01:04:23.269
This is the key, right?
This is what we have to achieve and what we

01:04:23.269 --> 01:04:24.269
should consistently be trying to achieve,
because I think we can steal a march on many

01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:25.269
of our competitors if we just get back to
first principles.

01:04:25.269 --> 01:04:26.269
Now, to do that, we have got to sort out some
of the mess that we've made in an adult fashion.

01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:27.269
And, at the moment, we're kind of being very
adolescent.

01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:29.380
It's like being told what your ma -- have
you noticed that? Right?

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:32.039
The reaction is -- rather, when you're adult
like, and you get caught doing something,

01:04:32.039 --> 01:04:33.039
you fess up and you say, "Okay, let's deal
with it."

01:04:33.039 --> 01:04:34.039
But, when you're a child, you say "No, no.
It wasn't me. No, no, no, no, no."

01:04:34.039 --> 01:04:35.539
And we've decided that we're pretending our
banks are fine.

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:36.819
And we're pretending that companies can expand.
And we're pretending that we can have a strong

01:04:36.819 --> 01:04:38.690
currency when we're weak, but we can't.
And it reminds me -- the way Ireland should

01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:39.690
do is -- Does anyone remember slow sets?
Okay. Does anybody remember Wesley? [laughter]

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:41.509
This is very local knowledge.
It will be passed on in the canteen of Google

01:04:41.509 --> 01:04:42.509
for those -- see, I have red hair.
So I have a pathological fear of the slow

01:04:42.509 --> 01:04:43.509
set, right?
Because red-haired boys didn't get lucky at

01:04:43.509 --> 01:04:45.709
slow sets.
We lived in fear of the lights coming on.

01:04:45.709 --> 01:04:46.709
And she got, [high-pitched voice] "Oh, my
God, he's got red hair!" right?

01:04:46.709 --> 01:04:47.709
And they'd flee away as if you'd done something
to them, right?

01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:48.709
I still -- as a mature man with children in
a happy marriage -- break out in a cold sweat

01:04:48.709 --> 01:04:49.709
at the opening bars of Spandau Ballet's, "True".
[laughter]

01:04:49.709 --> 01:04:50.709
Because I go back to Wesley, and the big,
red fro, sticking out, right?

01:04:50.709 --> 01:04:51.709
But there were friends of mine -- good friends
of mine -- who, there were three types of

01:04:51.709 --> 01:04:52.709
 -- two types of people and then us the Newtons,
the redsers okay? at the disco, right?

01:04:52.709 --> 01:04:53.709
There was the wallflowers, who -- when Spandau
Ballet True came on -- all disappeared.

01:04:53.709 --> 01:04:54.709
And then there were these people who changed.
And they were quite normal before the slow

01:04:54.709 --> 01:04:55.709
set, and then they turned into flirts.
They just had to have, right?

01:04:55.709 --> 01:04:56.709
Friends of mine like bloats just big thin,
right?

01:04:56.709 --> 01:04:57.709
Girlfriends of mine who are just batting,
batty, batty, batty, right?

01:04:57.709 --> 01:04:58.709
Okay? Just batty all over the place.
So we -- because the redsers were removed,

01:04:58.709 --> 01:04:59.709
brown's in good taste.
Put at the back, there's ten major and a flag

01:04:59.709 --> 01:05:00.709
there, sit out there for awhile. [laughter]
Now, but just think what I'm trying to say.

01:05:00.709 --> 01:05:01.709
Think about the world economy and a country
like Ireland, right?

01:05:01.709 --> 01:05:02.709
At the slow set, nobody really had a comparative
advantage, right?

01:05:02.709 --> 01:05:03.709
Because it was a bit dark and grubby and sweaty,
okay?

01:05:03.709 --> 01:05:04.709
So the flirts did amazingly well, right?
I have a friend of mine -- who I'm glad to

01:05:04.709 --> 01:05:05.709
say now is a little bit rotund and follicularly-challenged,
okay?

01:05:05.709 --> 01:05:06.709
-- but when he was sixteen, he was gorgeous.
And on our intercircles, which is juniors

01:05:06.709 --> 01:05:07.709
are two, our intercircle was something like,
you got about six snogs.

01:05:07.709 --> 01:05:08.709
A guy was halfway back to Dunleary on the
eight boss of his stage, right?

01:05:08.709 --> 01:05:09.709
He got snogs, he'd bring home to your ma,
snogs you wouldn't go near the garden gate

01:05:09.709 --> 01:05:10.709
with.
You Protestant snogs, we counted for two.

01:05:10.709 --> 01:05:11.709
[laughter] True or false?
Oh! Okay, okay.

01:05:11.709 --> 01:05:12.709
So what was he doing? He was flirting.
He was making himself known on the marketplace

01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:13.709
that was the slow set.
But think about all our companies or us as

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:14.709
individuals, right?
And then, there are companies, right?

01:05:14.709 --> 01:05:15.709
We -- there's nothing really going on here
that the competition won't try to steal.

01:05:15.709 --> 01:05:16.709
There's nothing going on, let's say, in Ireland
at Aer Lingus, that won't be copied by Ryanair,

01:05:16.709 --> 01:05:17.709
or vice versa.
There's nothing going at Bank of Ireland -- well,

01:05:17.709 --> 01:05:18.709
there actually is nothing going on at Bank
of Ireland, anyway [laughter] -- that won't

01:05:18.709 --> 01:05:19.709
be done at AIB.
You think about it.

01:05:19.709 --> 01:05:20.709
Like, all companies, you get this little comparative
advantage for awhile, and then your competitor

01:05:20.709 --> 01:05:21.709
notices you, and boom! -- you're gone, right?
So it's like a big, slow set.

01:05:21.709 --> 01:05:22.709
Nobody has a comparative advantage, except
for the flirts.

01:05:22.709 --> 01:05:23.709
So the key for all of us in the new marketplace
 -- you know, when Ireland recovers, and it

01:05:23.709 --> 01:05:24.709
will -- whether it's a company or an individual
 -- How do you do things differently that

01:05:24.709 --> 01:05:25.709
people want to pay you more than they pay
the competition?

01:05:25.709 --> 01:05:26.709
That's all it's about.
Because when you come up with a good idea,

01:05:26.709 --> 01:05:27.709
somebody else will come up with it.
You have a good idea, somebody else does too.

01:05:27.709 --> 01:05:28.709
It reminds me -- about four or five weeks
ago, I met a very, very swanky friend of mine.

01:05:28.709 --> 01:05:29.709
She's very sophisticated, and she is one of
those people who knows the difference between

01:05:29.709 --> 01:05:30.709
fennel and fenugreek -- which is obviously
something you need to know in your early 40's,

01:05:30.709 --> 01:05:31.709
because I'm like a girl talking about the
offside rule when it comes to foods, right?

01:05:31.709 --> 01:05:32.709
I'm a man who lives exclusively on hula hoops
and Mars bars.

01:05:32.709 --> 01:05:33.709
And any content of Nestle Garage is fine with
me, right?

01:05:33.709 --> 01:05:34.709
But my friends have got all sophisticated
when they talk about 'food' now, right?

01:05:34.709 --> 01:05:35.709
And this girl -- a few months ago I met her
 -- and she goes, "Hello, David, lovely to

01:05:35.709 --> 01:05:36.709
see you."
She says, "Where did you go on your holidays?"

01:05:36.709 --> 01:05:37.709
And I said, "Oh, you know, we went to Spain
and it was great. And the kids were fine.

01:05:37.709 --> 01:05:38.709
And there was other couples like us..."
And she was like recording.

01:05:38.709 --> 01:05:39.709
I said, "Well, where did you go?" Which is
what she wanted me -- she goes, "Well, I went

01:05:39.709 --> 01:05:40.709
to Uzbekistan."
"Uzbekistan. Jeez, that's very far away."

01:05:40.709 --> 01:05:41.709
She's, "Well, that's the point."
But she said, "And last night, just before

01:05:41.709 --> 01:05:42.709
we came home -- myself and Jerry -- we're
up on the top of the Atlas Mountains, under

01:05:42.709 --> 01:05:43.709
the full moon, eating pine nuts with nomadic
tribesmen."

01:05:43.709 --> 01:05:44.709
So, what she was actually saying was, "You
 -- who go to Spain -- are a naka." [laughter]

01:05:44.709 --> 01:05:45.709
Didn't say it, but this is what was in her
head.

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:46.709
"I am a piny, nutty, nomadicky type of person,"
right? Okay?

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:47.709
Because "That's me, that's my tribe," okay?
"And you are beneath contempt," okay?

01:05:47.709 --> 01:05:48.709
Now, the point is, somebody has got into her
head that if she's a nomadic tribesy, piny,

01:05:48.709 --> 01:05:49.709
nutty type of person in that particular tribe,
okay?

01:05:49.709 --> 01:05:50.709
Somebody has convinced her that that will
actually make her feel better about life,

01:05:50.709 --> 01:05:51.709
okay?
And has made her seven grand lighter as a

01:05:51.709 --> 01:05:52.709
result, okay?
Because you can't fly in a charter to Uzbekistan

01:05:52.709 --> 01:05:53.709
 -- which is the whole point, okay?
Somebody's flirted with her head and gotten

01:05:53.709 --> 01:05:54.709
right inside her head to change the way she
perceives herself.

01:05:54.709 --> 01:05:55.709
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what we
all have to do.

01:05:55.709 --> 01:05:56.709
So irrespective of whether we in Ireland go
through a grinding recession, or whether we

01:05:56.709 --> 01:05:57.709
take the dramatic move that everybody else
is taking by changing our currency, which

01:05:57.709 --> 01:05:58.709
is dramatic.
For all of us -- whether it's in Google or

01:05:58.709 --> 01:05:59.709
individually -- to get on, we've got to go
back to the slow set, put on Spandau Ballet's

01:05:59.709 --> 01:06:00.709
"True", which is not a good tune, really,
to be caught on your iPod, but anyway, put

01:06:00.709 --> 01:06:01.709
it on.
We've all got _____.

01:06:01.709 --> 01:06:02.709
Thank you very much.

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:03.709
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

01:06:03.709 --> 01:06:04.709
&gt;&gt; Okay, guys. If anybody has any questions,
the podiums are open.

01:06:04.709 --> 01:06:05.709
David McWilliams: Go for it.
Who has the first question on Spandau Ballet,

01:06:05.709 --> 01:06:06.709
and important things like that?

01:06:06.709 --> 01:06:07.709
Q Hi, David. How are you?

01:06:07.709 --> 01:06:08.709
David McWilliams: Good.

01:06:08.709 --> 01:06:09.709
Q What advice would you give for entrepreneurs
in this deep and dark economic time?

01:06:09.709 --> 01:06:10.709
David McWilliams: Well, I suppose in many
ways, I'm kind of an entrepreneur myself.

01:06:10.709 --> 01:06:11.709
Like, you work for yourself, and you create
your own stuff, and you hope to sell it in

01:06:11.709 --> 01:06:12.709
the marketplace.
Just keep doing it, you know?

01:06:12.709 --> 01:06:13.709
People asked me the other day -- I presented
a panel, right?

01:06:13.709 --> 01:06:14.709
The panel is a comedy show, I'm a straight
man economist.

01:06:14.709 --> 01:06:15.709
And they said, "Why are you presenting a panel?"
And I says, "Because I do stuff."

01:06:15.709 --> 01:06:16.709
And that's what I do in life.
You get up and say, "What are we going to

01:06:16.709 --> 01:06:17.709
do today?
How are we going to -- how are we going to

01:06:17.709 --> 01:06:18.709
earn our cross?"
So I believe that it doesn't matter what's

01:06:18.709 --> 01:06:19.709
happening up there.
It really doesn't matter what's happening

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:20.709
in the banks, or whatever.
That is a credit constraint, right? That's

01:06:20.709 --> 01:06:21.709
all it is.
But it's what's in here -- it's the power

01:06:21.709 --> 01:06:22.709
of ideas -- that changes everything.
And it's how you convince people and change

01:06:22.709 --> 01:06:23.709
and cajole and taking risks.
So, I think that, you know -- if you take

01:06:23.709 --> 01:06:24.709
it from a macro-economic view, and costs are
falling -- some people say it's a good thing.

01:06:24.709 --> 01:06:25.709
But I don't think the environment for us has
changed at all.

01:06:25.709 --> 01:06:26.709
We just do stuff in different environments.
So if like, for example, the way I look at

01:06:26.709 --> 01:06:27.709
it is, people say, "Do the panel?"
I say, "Yeah, do it." And enjoy it.

01:06:27.709 --> 01:06:28.709
So I don't think -- I think what happens in
Ireland is this extraordinary thing that -- we

01:06:28.709 --> 01:06:29.709
have to fix the big things.
But if we wait until we fix the big -- it's

01:06:29.709 --> 01:06:30.709
like in Google.
I mean, I presume you don't wait around for

01:06:30.709 --> 01:06:31.709
direction from on high to do stuff.
And this is what I think -- the sort of environment

01:06:31.709 --> 01:06:32.709
that you've created here -- if we could replicate
that outside.

01:06:32.709 --> 01:06:33.709
You know, it is going to be difficult.
Taxes are going to rise here, dramatically.

01:06:33.709 --> 01:06:34.709
Ain't no doubt about it, okay?
Social welfare is probably going to be cut.

01:06:34.709 --> 01:06:35.709
You know, all these big, macro indicators.
The education budget is going to be cut, you

01:06:35.709 --> 01:06:36.709
know?
I just do things.

01:06:36.709 --> 01:06:37.709
Like, you know, the reason I try to put the
farming thing together -- the diaspora thing

01:06:37.709 --> 01:06:38.709
in farming -- was, it gets people back in
and try and get ideas going.

01:06:38.709 --> 01:06:39.709
So I would just say, it hasn't changed, really.
It's all about up here.

01:06:39.709 --> 01:06:40.709
And it's all about expressing ourselves.
And yeah, it's a bit more difficult.

01:06:40.709 --> 01:06:41.709
And I don't want to lay off people, so we're
trying to do all sorts of jiggery-pokery to

01:06:41.709 --> 01:06:42.709
make sure that we can keep people.
And it's a small company I have, but I don't

01:06:42.709 --> 01:06:43.709
see -- apart from the credit crunch -- I don't
see any change at all in Ireland.

01:06:43.709 --> 01:06:44.709
And I think we've all got to see that.

01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:45.709
Q Thank you.

01:06:45.709 --> 01:06:46.709
David McWilliams: By the way, my CD for a
job in Google is just here.

01:06:46.709 --> 01:06:47.709
You can take it, but. [laughter] I can do
lots of shifts. [laughter]

01:06:47.709 --> 01:06:48.709
Q Many people are very annoyed about the government's
decision to nationalize _____ .

01:06:48.709 --> 01:06:49.709
Many people really feel it should have been
just allowed to collapse because of the corruption

01:06:49.709 --> 01:06:50.709
that's going on.
What do you say to that?

01:06:50.709 --> 01:06:51.709
David McWilliams: Okay, you know.
About 15 months ago -- 14 months ago -- I

01:06:51.709 --> 01:06:52.709
had this unusual occurrence, which is in the
book, which again, has detracted from the

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:53.709
book, because it's where the minister came
to my house to chat about stuff.

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:54.709
And what had happened was, I had gone on a
radio program with him.

01:06:54.709 --> 01:06:55.709
And I said the banks were going to go bust
in this country and that's our big problem.

01:06:55.709 --> 01:06:56.709
And he said, "Oh, you can't talk like that.
That's dangerous talk."

01:06:56.709 --> 01:06:57.709
Now, I actually felt a lot of sympathy for
him, because if he even talks to the vice

01:06:57.709 --> 01:06:58.709
_____, he couldn't as a minister say that.
But, you know, I was watching his body language

01:06:58.709 --> 01:06:59.709
and the leader of the opposition, a finance
spokesman, and they really believe the banks

01:06:59.709 --> 01:07:00.709
were fine.
So that was in the sixth of September, and

01:07:00.709 --> 01:07:01.709
I kept writing that the banks would be in
trouble -- not because I knew anything about

01:07:01.709 --> 01:07:02.709
what was going on in the banks, but because
I knew about economics and cycles and what

01:07:02.709 --> 01:07:03.709
happens, right?
And I'd seen it -- I'd seen it in Argentina,

01:07:03.709 --> 01:07:04.709
I'd seen it in Serbia, I'd seen in Israel
 -- all these places.

01:07:04.709 --> 01:07:05.709
I worked in Russia -- same carry on, right?
And then the other day, I went on prime time,

01:07:05.709 --> 01:07:06.709
and again, the same thing.
Government spokespeople coming out -- central

01:07:06.709 --> 01:07:07.709
bankers saying, "The banks are fine."
And I was like, "The dogs in the street know

01:07:07.709 --> 01:07:08.709
they're bust."
We're going to lose all our deposits, because

01:07:08.709 --> 01:07:09.709
these guys have been so cavalier with their
own finance, that they won't give a damn if

01:07:09.709 --> 01:07:10.709
they drag all the deposits with them on a
run on the bank.

01:07:10.709 --> 01:07:11.709
That's I suppose my -- when the minister arrived
in my house, we were discussing this.

01:07:11.709 --> 01:07:12.709
And I thought -- not just me, but some other
people.

01:07:12.709 --> 01:07:13.709
Not lots of other people -- thought that a
full guarantee, which is what the Swedes had

01:07:13.709 --> 01:07:14.709
done in '92, might work.
And the argument was, "Well, what about Anglo?"

01:07:14.709 --> 01:07:15.709
Even back then, if you guarantee Anglo, are
you not guaranteeing something that you can't

01:07:15.709 --> 01:07:16.709
unravel?
And my argument was at the time -- and it's

01:07:16.709 --> 01:07:17.709
still in the book, and it's still what I make
was, the guarantee prevented a run on our

01:07:17.709 --> 01:07:18.709
banks.
And it was incredibly successful as a policy.

01:07:18.709 --> 01:07:19.709
It now runs out on the first of October of
next year, 28th of September of next year.

01:07:19.709 --> 01:07:20.709
So what we should be doing now, with the likes
of Anglo, okay? is saying to the creditors

01:07:20.709 --> 01:07:21.709
of Anglo, "Those of you lucky enough to have
very short-term paper with Anglo covered by

01:07:21.709 --> 01:07:22.709
the guarantee, we'll pay you."
But that's a fraction of the total Anglo liability

01:07:22.709 --> 01:07:23.709
with creditors.
"The rest of you, we can give you a hundred

01:07:23.709 --> 01:07:24.709
percent today" -- or we're not going to give
you that, because you know that the markets

01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:25.709
are liquid -- "But if you wait, at this time
next year, you'll get zero, because the banks

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:26.709
are closing." Now what do you want to do?
You should start negotiating with the creditors

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:27.709
under the terms of the guarantee.
Because they are stuck.

01:07:27.709 --> 01:07:28.709
And I come back to the guys in London who
can't believe that we, as a nation, are going

01:07:28.709 --> 01:07:29.709
to spend 28 billion of NAMA money on Anglo,
which is a basket case.

01:07:29.709 --> 01:07:30.709
So we've got to go back first, use the guarantee,
so that my mother and your deposits don't

01:07:30.709 --> 01:07:31.709
fly out, so you don't have a run on the bank.
Then negotiate with the creditors.

01:07:31.709 --> 01:07:32.709
And what you should do with something like
Anglo is, go to someone like AIB and say,

01:07:32.709 --> 01:07:33.709
"Do you want the deposit book of Anglo?" because
there is a deposit book there.

01:07:33.709 --> 01:07:34.709
Sell that a little bit off, and then do what
you do when the Swede shop went bust.

01:07:34.709 --> 01:07:35.709
You know, you deal with everyone.
Creditors take ten cents on the dollar, and

01:07:35.709 --> 01:07:36.709
you start again.
What you could then do, I think, with AIB

01:07:36.709 --> 01:07:37.709
which I think will also be in dire situation
is, go to, let's say, a bank -- I used to

01:07:37.709 --> 01:07:38.709
work for P &amp; B Parry Bob -- and I'm just using
this as an example, right?

01:07:38.709 --> 01:07:39.709
All the French banks substantially well-managed
during the boom.

01:07:39.709 --> 01:07:40.709
You have no problems.
And basically say, "Do you want AIB for free?

01:07:40.709 --> 01:07:41.709
We give it to you.
We'll give you the branch network.

01:07:41.709 --> 01:07:42.709
We'll give you the deposit base.
What you do is, you give the old creditors

01:07:42.709 --> 01:07:43.709
BNP paper at a heavy discount, and we -- as
the Irish state -- will act as a broker in

01:07:43.709 --> 01:07:44.709
the deal.
Not a principal, as a broker, to bring the

01:07:44.709 --> 01:07:45.709
buyer and the seller together.
That's what you would do in a normal company.

01:07:45.709 --> 01:07:46.709
But what has happened is, I think, that the
lads are in power -- and they're protecting

01:07:46.709 --> 01:07:47.709
themselves.
Because it makes no sense at all.

01:07:47.709 --> 01:07:48.709
People are right to be angry, because you
can wind down Anglo creatively with modest

01:07:48.709 --> 01:07:49.709
cost to the taxpayer and maximum payment,
extraction, to creditors.

01:07:49.709 --> 01:07:50.709
I can't see why.
But they're all mixed, and there is a haul

01:07:50.709 --> 01:07:51.709
over feeling in Ireland at the very top.
It's a very small bunch of individuals.

01:07:51.709 --> 01:07:52.709
And if it happened in Serbia, you'd be shot.
But this is Ireland, and it's happened -- and

01:07:52.709 --> 01:07:53.709
it's happening.

01:07:53.709 --> 01:07:54.709
Q Hi, David. In the early 90's, when the savings
and loans banks in U.S. went bust, the federal

01:07:54.709 --> 01:07:55.709
government set up a company called the Realty
Trust Corporation to deal with it -- similar

01:07:55.709 --> 01:07:56.709
to NAMA.
And so, in the last year, when we've been

01:07:56.709 --> 01:07:57.709
discussing NAMA, I've heard nothing about
similar structures anywhere.

01:07:57.709 --> 01:07:58.709
So I'm wondering is, we have _______ McCarthy
in here and I just see a big disconnect of

01:07:58.709 --> 01:07:59.709
expertise and then people like Culla McCarthy
coming out with reports, other experts from

01:07:59.709 --> 01:08:00.709
different countries who have been through
these experiences before.

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:01.709
And it seems that nobody's learning from mistakes
and expertise in other places, and I'm just

01:08:01.709 --> 01:08:02.709
wondering why that is, and why can't we?

01:08:02.709 --> 01:08:03.709
David McWilliams: I think you're on to the
crux of the issue, right?

01:08:03.709 --> 01:08:04.709
What I would like -- if in Google.
I'll answer the reach in a second, but more

01:08:04.709 --> 01:08:05.709
in general like, let's say for example, in
Google -- there's never a problem, but tell

01:08:05.709 --> 01:08:06.709
me -- let's say there's a problem in the company
and you need a solution, how do you arrive

01:08:06.709 --> 01:08:07.709
at the solution?
Because what I'm saying is, in Ireland in

01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:08.709
the civil service, if we're faced with problem
they retract the advice base, right?

01:08:08.709 --> 01:08:09.709
So instead of having the self-confidence to
 -- you know, like open source -- to say,

01:08:09.709 --> 01:08:10.709
"We need to get all the brains involved, and
we need to do it in two weeks, because we

01:08:10.709 --> 01:08:11.709
don't have time.
But in that two weeks, we're going to talk

01:08:11.709 --> 01:08:12.709
to everybody, we're going to take advice,
we're going to look at other countries."

01:08:12.709 --> 01:08:13.709
That's what I presume adult people do, right?
-- when you're faced with a dilemma.

01:08:13.709 --> 01:08:14.709
In our country, the civil service -- and I've
noticed it, you know, they've done a lot of

01:08:14.709 --> 01:08:15.709
 -- they've said a lot of quite nasty things
about me, but that's neither here nor there,

01:08:15.709 --> 01:08:16.709
but it's indicative of the mentality that
is -- instead of throwing and opening the

01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:17.709
problem, they contract.
And therefore, I think, get the wrong answer.

01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:18.709
And then, once they contract, it's very difficult
to go back on this.

01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:19.709
And this has to do with the psychology, to
do with the illusion of power, right?

01:08:19.709 --> 01:08:20.709
That the illusion of power is that, by being
powerful -- by having the badge that says,

01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:21.709
"I am the minister for finance."
That you will undermine the mystique of that

01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:22.709
power by ventilating your problems.
I believe that the way successful companies

01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:23.709
and individuals work is the opposite.
That we have a problem, let's see what the

01:08:23.709 --> 01:08:24.709
best practice -- what's best practice -- what
happened?

01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:25.709
So something like Greeks.
The other problem is -- think about it.

01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:26.709
What we need in the Department of Finance
is a trader with a mentality of a trader,

01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:27.709
okay?
What we have are lawyers, civil service and

01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:28.709
academic economists.
What's putting the three of them together?

01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:29.709
They have never taken one risk in their lives.
So they don't understand risk.

01:08:29.709 --> 01:08:30.709
And we're dealing in risk.
So I think it would be much better to get

01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:31.709
traders to say, "Okay.
Well, you know, the way the market works is,

01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:32.709
like you take the way those savings and loans
 -- the bundles of loans drop in price to

01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:33.709
maybe ten cents in the dollar, okay?
And then they begin to trade and work their

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:34.709
way out.
It's taken off the balance sheet and you start

01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:35.709
again.
That's simple stuff, but it seems to be far

01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:36.709
too difficult to do.
So I think to do with the inability to see

01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:37.709
the world in an 'open source' way.

01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:38.709
Q If that's it, thank you very much.

01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:39.709
David McWilliams: The book is fantastic by
the way.

01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:40.709
It's called "Follow the Money."

01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:41.709
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:41.715
David McWilliams: Thank you very much.
