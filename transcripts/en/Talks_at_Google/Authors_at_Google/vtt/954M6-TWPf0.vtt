[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.097 --> 00:00:06.680
MICHAEL WITWER: We've
been working now

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.420
for a couple years
on really trying

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.050
to tell the entire history of
this incredible game, "Dungeons

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.250
and Dragons,"
through its visuals,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.250
which was a really pretty
interesting project.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.708
So we're not going
to be able to go

00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:19.737
through the entire
45-year history today.

00:00:19.737 --> 00:00:22.070
But we do want to give you
some highlights of what we've

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.330
got in the book and
some things that we

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.010
found that I think
are really pretty

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.967
important to this
entire movement.

00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:29.300
Can we get a show of hands,
before we really kind of get

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.730
into it, of who
either plays or has

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.513
played "Dungeons and Dragons
or another role-playing game?

00:00:35.513 --> 00:00:37.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.470
MICHAEL WITWER: Nice, OK.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.900
Let's skip that slide.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.780
JON PETERSON: I see why this is
standing room only [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.510
MICHAEL WITWER: So we can
skip this slide, I think.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.010
[? JON PETERSON: ?] But
we're not skipping this one.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.990
MICHAEL WITWER: We're
not skipping this slide.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.190
So "Dungeons and
Dragons is certainly

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.580
having a moment right now.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.970
The game is as popular
as it's ever been,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.765
but it hasn't always
been this way.

00:00:54.765 --> 00:00:56.390
So, Kyle, you want
to talk a little bit

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.931
about kind of where
we are right now,

00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:00.090
maybe why we are where we are?

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.630
KYLE NEWMAN: There's no denying
that "Dungeons and Dragons

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.750
2018, it's having a
zeitgeist moment, the brand.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.160
And it's probably the most
players it's actively had.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.980
And it's growing.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.604
2018 is going to turn out to be
the biggest year for the brand.

00:01:13.604 --> 00:01:16.560
It's already on
course for 10% growth.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.040
And what's happening
now is the entry point

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.680
for "Dungeons and Dragons,"
because of digital things

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.950
like YouTube and Twitch, where
you can watch somebody play

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.020
or see how the game
is meant to be played

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.560
over a five-minute clip, now you
can see that that's all it is.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.940
The stigmas are stripped away.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.680
And we've got to
this point where

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.830
the vernacular and the
shorthand about gaming

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.170
and some of the important
principles that were invented

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.420
by "Dungeons and Dragons,"
leveling up and XP,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.950
are all part of our
culture already.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.250
So in a sense,
people have already

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.750
been playing "Dungeons
and Dragons."

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.040
And now they're exposed to it,
and there's this easy entry

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.560
point.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.080
So it's an exciting
time for the brand,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.640
I think for role
playing in general,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.180
because it's really about
collaborative storytelling

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.320
and community.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.530
And you make a little family.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.863
And you tell the story together.

00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:03.260
And in a digital age, there's
something wonderful and analog

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.840
about having that
presence with each other,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.720
using pencil and paper,
and getting together,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.960
and connecting.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.080
So I think there's
a nostalgia tied in

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.660
with escapism and escapism
within the narrative.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.245
So it's having a
wonderful moment.

00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:17.870
MICHAEL WITWER: We'd
like to show this,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.710
because this game has come
a really, really long way.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.306
And this is kind of a one shot.

00:02:22.306 --> 00:02:23.930
We've got a number
of these in the book

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.180
about really how far this
game really truly has come.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.138
And again, this is a way
the visuals can really

00:02:28.138 --> 00:02:29.230
help you see that.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.277
Something that was
entirely homebrew,

00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:32.610
that's really kind of very cool.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.866
Anyone on this
panel like to talk

00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:35.660
a bit more about what
we're looking at here

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.410
and who that is?

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.570
JON PETERSON: Does anyone not
recognize this guy up here?

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.486
SAM WITWER: You guys
know what that is, right?

00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:45.050
The jerk of all
jerks, the beholder?

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.640
Yeah, well, what we
were able to unearth

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.710
is a lot of the interesting
inceptions of these very

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.380
specific and unique monsters.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.560
And what surprised me--

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.840
it surprised Jon, because
he's an old pro at this,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.890
but for me, it
surprised me greatly

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.110
how young some of the people
that Gary Gygax brought in

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.170
were to try to conceptualize
some of these things.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.410
If you're like a 14-year-old
kid and some old war gamer

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.050
comes to you and says,
I'm going to give you $2,

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.920
and I need some illustrations,
and I need them done yesterday,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.760
well, what are you going to do?

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.477
You're going to
violate copyright law.

00:03:27.477 --> 00:03:29.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.050
Right?

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.675
I mean, it's the only
thing you can do.

00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:34.850
And, I mean, look, we got some
Dr. Strange going on up there.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.879
KYLE NEWMAN: This is
issue 167 of Dr. Strange.

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:37.670
It was [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.375
JON PETERSON: Strange Tales.

00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:39.749
KYLE NEWMAN: --oh,
Strange Tales,

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.740
between Dr. Strange
and Nick Fury.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.955
And this particular
artist seemed

00:03:44.955 --> 00:03:46.080
to have an affinity for it.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.955
And you can see he
copied and swiped--

00:03:47.955 --> 00:03:48.830
JON PETERSON: Swiped.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:49.860
KYLE NEWMAN: --some of the--

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.660
JON PETERSON: Yeah.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.118
KYLE NEWMAN: --some of the key
images from this book, which

00:03:53.118 --> 00:03:55.580
translated to very
foundational art

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.445
in the first copy of
"Dungeons and Dragons."

00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:59.570
JON PETERSON: It's important
to appreciate, though,

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.930
that this was a very open and
collaborative fan community

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.910
when it started, right?

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.470
This was not something
where anybody had any notion

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.080
that this would be commercially
viable, that this would escape

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.000
from a very tiny audience.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.490
And much like with comics
fandom, yes, you did swipes.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.910
People would take characters
and re-appropriate them,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.940
because it wasn't really
for commercial purposes.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.070
And so what we see in these
borrowings that are clearly

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.167
so indebted to Marvel
Comics in this instance,

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:29.000
it was just the way the
community functioned

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.500
at the time.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.130
And it really wasn't
quite illegal.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.520
SAM WITWER: Right.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.811
JON PETERSON: It's a gray area.

00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:34.010
MICHAEL WITWER: Yeah.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.050
And one thing we
really love to show,

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.570
when we show things like
that, is this notion

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.520
that this was-- it
was so homebrew,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.410
it almost redefines what we
understand as homebrew today.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.910
Right?

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.260
And there's something
kind of cool.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.676
There's a cachet
about that today.

00:04:46.676 --> 00:04:48.170
Well, at this time,
you're talking

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.378
about people that were
playing a game for themselves,

00:04:50.378 --> 00:04:53.150
and they were hand assembling
this game in their basement

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.150
to sell it to this really small
esoteric group of war gamers

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.650
at the time.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.274
And, Jon, you want
to talk a little bit

00:04:58.274 --> 00:05:00.220
about kind of where
this all emerged from,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.220
this whole notion of role
playing games and D&amp;D.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.011
JON PETERSON: Sure.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.240
And some of you may
recognize the actor,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.530
the elegant English gentleman
who is depicted up there

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.450
in the upper left, a guy by
the name of Peter Cushing--

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.820
Been in "Star Wars," a
lot of classic [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.350
horror films, things like it.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.120
Well, Peter was
part of a community,

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.800
and it was largely
an Anglo American

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.020
community that
collected and painted

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.340
these military miniatures.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.890
And this was a pretty
serious historical hobby.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.840
People would explore
the Napoleonic period.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.940
They would want to pay
meticulous attention

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.010
to getting uniform details
right and things like it.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.480
And Gary Gygax, who was one
of the co-creators of "D&amp;D,"

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.000
he was a part of this
community in the 1960s.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.970
You see him depicted
there in the lower panel.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.450
He's the guy on the right who's
kind of closely scrutinizing

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.830
this scene in front of him.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.870
That was a medieval
miniature war

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.510
game, a period recreation of
what medieval combat would

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.449
have been.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.240
And that picture is
actually from something

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.800
he called The Lake
Geneva War Games

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.258
Convention, which is a little
group of friends he had over.

00:05:55.258 --> 00:05:57.457
About 96 people
made it to this con,

00:05:57.457 --> 00:05:59.040
which was a block
away from his house.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.940
KYLE NEWMAN: About
this many people.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.731
JON PETERSON: Yeah,
about this many people.

00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:03.330
And it was at this
horticultural hall,

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.089
a place they did
flower shows, that

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:06.630
was about a block
away from his house

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.165
in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.

00:06:08.165 --> 00:06:09.540
Today, of course,
that convention

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.650
has continued since then.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.690
We now just call it
Gen Con for short.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.680
And the ones we have now in
Indianapolis draw 60,000-plus

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.280
people.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.440
This is a pretty big
deal at this point.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.220
But it was at this time in '68
that Gary got really interested

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.510
in medieval miniature war games.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.610
And so he teamed up with
another guy, Jeff Perrin,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.540
who lived in Rockford,
Illinois, nearby.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.520
And actually, Greg
Bell, the kid that we

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.890
saw during those illustrations
from Marvel Comics,

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.290
he was part of
Jeff's circle there.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.831
And they put out this
pamphlet called "Chainmail",

00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:43.080
which as you can see is rules
for medieval miniatures.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.240
And these kinds of
things, usually you

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.730
share these kinds
of miniature rules.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.640
They developed through fanzines
that would determine, OK,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.354
what does combat mean when
you have this kind of soldier

00:06:53.354 --> 00:06:54.520
versus this kind of soldier?

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.820
And what are the odds
that things will hit?

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.251
And how many people get killed
by arrows or boiling oil

00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:00.750
or whatever?

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.104
And you roll dice
to determine that.

00:07:03.104 --> 00:07:04.770
The interesting thing
about "Chainmail",

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.560
though, is that the final
third of that booklet

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.500
was reserved for something they
called the fantasy supplement.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.670
And there really had been no
fantasy wargaming products

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:15.390
before this.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.930
And it detailed how you would
fight with orcs and elves.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.630
It had wizards who could cast
fireball and lightning bolt.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.140
SAM WITWER: Could I ask you,
what did war gamers at the time

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.150
think of the fantasy supplement?

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.574
JON PETERSON: They weren't
usually crazy about it.

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:30.990
These guys who,
again, were really

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.110
focused on exploring history
through these miniatures

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.860
looked down on it.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.450
It was childish.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:36.866
You were playing
with fairy tales.

00:07:36.866 --> 00:07:40.075
It was very controversial, but
it caught on with a few people.

00:07:40.075 --> 00:07:41.700
And one of the people
it caught on with

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.370
is the gentleman you see
there to the left, whose

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.720
name is Dave Arneson.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.600
Now, Gary and Dave
had, in 1970, been

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.420
a part of the group they called
the Castle and Crusade Society.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.760
And this was a small club--
it was never larger than 80

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.660
people--

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.810
who largely
connected up by post.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.540
They sent around a fanzine they
called the "Domesday Book."

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.460
And the map you see
behind them there

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.830
is from the ninth issue
of the "Domesday Book,"

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.890
and it shows an imaginary
land that Gary had devised

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.450
called the Great Kingdom.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.610
And Dave Arneson had
a parcel of this.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.170
He was a baron in their
society, so he was the baron

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.240
of an area called Blackmoor.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.600
And Dave used these
"Chainmail" rules

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.610
to start exploring
kind of the fantasy

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.460
dimensions of this in Blackmoor,
including dungeon exploration.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.480
Although "Chainmail" had
wizards and fighters,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.799
he added a cleric class to
it, and also added to it

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.659
this notion that you
might be able to go up

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:40.659
in level, gain experience
points as you kill things.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.984
And so he and Gary started
corresponding about it,

00:08:42.984 --> 00:08:44.400
and that process
ultimately led up

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.066
to what you see there
on the left, which

00:08:46.066 --> 00:08:49.170
is the cover of the first draft
of "Dungeons and Dragons,"

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:50.462
which we reproduce in the book.

00:08:50.462 --> 00:08:52.211
MICHAEL WITWER: And
you can see here we've

00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:54.600
got a couple of fun panels,
actually one of which

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.770
that does not make the
original draft of "Dungeons

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.320
and Dragons," the
other that does.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.861
The beautiful witch
you will actually

00:08:59.861 --> 00:09:02.474
find in those original
pamphlets that very few people

00:09:02.474 --> 00:09:03.390
have today, of course.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.934
This was a very
small production.

00:09:04.934 --> 00:09:06.600
But one thing I always
like to point out

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.990
with things like what they
call the ugly witch there

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.015
in that panel by Cookie Corey.

00:09:12.015 --> 00:09:14.140
She writes this little note
to Gary that says, hey,

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.390
I'm trying to figure this out.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.110
Help.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.760
It was a draft panel
from a game that

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.610
was as homebrew as you get.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:20.667
And it was never used.

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:23.250
It's a miracle it still survives
today, if you think about it.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.020
They didn't know they
were making history

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:25.560
when they made it.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.420
This is that draft piece of
paper that's on your desk

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.294
that you scribble
something on and throw away

00:09:29.294 --> 00:09:30.600
because it wasn't good enough.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.730
And finding things like that
was particularly interesting,

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.290
and it told you a little bit
different story about how

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.820
this all really came together.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.236
JON PETERSON: And
it's fascinating

00:09:37.236 --> 00:09:39.180
that Cookie Corey, again
a female artist, half

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.970
of the artists who worked on
the original "D&amp;D" illustrations

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:42.640
were female.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.200
KYLE NEWMAN: And
what's important

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.658
about that previous panel, the
map, the great kingdom, that

00:09:45.658 --> 00:09:47.260
was the first shared universe.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.170
And these guys were
communicating either

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.560
in person at the
convention or pen pals.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.750
And they would say, oh,
this castle has been sieged,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.180
or this village
has been ransacked.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.690
And they would have to
mark it down on their map.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:58.870
And in the
pre-internet days, that

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.720
was the only way to have
this shared universe.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.430
SAM WITWER: Sort of an
early "World of Warcraft."

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.660
KYLE NEWMAN: But it's
precursory to everything

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.830
that people find
interesting now in gaming.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.880
SAM WITWER: And
sending a letter off

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.880
to tell someone that a
character has been killed

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.390
is a little bit
slower than dial-up.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.180
Trust me.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.120
MICHAEL WITWER: So we
finally get to a point here,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.270
kind of emerging from this
wargaming lineage, where

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.530
they publish a game.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.150
They self-publish a game.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.810
And there it is, what we call
in this space, the brown box,

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.080
hand assembled by Gary Gygax,
his partners, and his family

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.700
in 1974.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.100
And this becomes fairly
popular in the space.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.140
But by popular,
what I mean really

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.734
is that it becomes popular
in the wargaming community.

00:10:37.734 --> 00:10:38.650
People really like it.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:39.566
They're interested in.

00:10:39.566 --> 00:10:42.460
And I will tell you, if you
read these original rules,

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.671
it's incomprehensible to
just about anybody else.

00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:46.420
Even today, if you're
a roleplaying gamer,

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.580
you will read these rules
and say, what in hell

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.500
is he talking about?

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.140
But again, it does catch
on in this little space.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.240
And of course,
because this game is

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.859
this interesting do-it-yourself
fantasy builder for everybody,

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:01.150
for whatever reason, it really
captures the imagination

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.860
of this group.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.830
And they start writing about it.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.579
They start developing
their own campaigns.

00:11:04.579 --> 00:11:07.750
It's the ultimate
viral type of mechanism

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.100
to put into people's hands.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.440
And this catches
on pretty quick.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.330
By 1975, the game
is going very well.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.449
And they actually are invited
to a convention in Baltimore

00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:19.990
called the Origins Convention,
which is alive and well today.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.290
You may have been to Origins.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.350
This is Origins
one in Baltimore.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.210
And Origins has
asked Gary to put

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.520
on a tournament for this
radical new game called

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.290
"Dungeons and Dragons."

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.510
And Gary brings a couple
of his staff members

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.490
to be co-DMs with him.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.620
And he built something
called the Tomb of Horrors.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.960
Has anyone ever heard
of the Tomb of Horrors?

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.260
SAM WITWER: Who's played
the Tomb of Horrors?

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.030
Raise your hand if you've
played the Tomb of Horrors.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.170
Oh, you're so sheepish.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:42.250
Look at this.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.135
The fear is still with
you after all these years.

00:11:45.135 --> 00:11:48.650
Did anyone survive
the Tomb of Horrors?

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:49.150
Thank you.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.570
Thank you.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:50.140
JON PETERSON: The first
honest people we've seen.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.170
SAM WITWER: The first
audience that tells the truth.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.380
JON PETERSON:
First honest group.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.110
KYLE NEWMAN: No one survives
the Tomb of Horrors.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.180
SAM WITWER: No one survives
the Tomb of Horrors.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:00.240
This is universally known as
the most deadly, maybe unfair

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.740
adventure in "Dungeons
and Dragons."

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.615
KYLE NEWMAN: In the
novel "Ready Player One,"

00:12:03.615 --> 00:12:06.100
it was the first obstacle
in Ernie Cline's book.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.452
And although it didn't make the
movie, the iconography right

00:12:09.452 --> 00:12:10.410
there, you see in the--

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.860
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.112
--right, that's all over
the third act graffitied

00:12:16.112 --> 00:12:17.320
on the van they drive around.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.944
So they tried to keep
the homage alive.

00:12:18.944 --> 00:12:21.315
But it is known as the
ultimate challenge for a gamer.

00:12:21.315 --> 00:12:22.690
JON PETERSON:
Well, and it needed

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.880
to be such a challenge
because the way they ran

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.050
this is a tournament, right?

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.400
They needed to find winners.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.740
And so you could go
in with a party of 15.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.080
These were huge parties.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.360
Remember, this is only 16 months
after the game has come out.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.050
Maybe 1,500 copies
have been sold.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.130
A lot of Xeroxed
copies, but 1,500

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.480
have been sold at this point.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.970
Most people who went into
this in Origins that year

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.014
had never been
played before, right?

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:46.180
This was their introduction.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.390
Welcome to "Dungeons
and Dragons."

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:47.960
SAM WITWER: You die.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.400
JON PETERSON: Enjoy
the Tomb of Horrors.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.650
KYLE NEWMAN: And to survive
it, you had to often bring

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.782
hirelings or in-laws to send
into the room in front of you--

00:12:53.782 --> 00:12:54.766
JON PETERSON: Right.

00:12:54.766 --> 00:12:56.262
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:56.262 --> 00:12:57.970
KYLE NEWMAN: And people
to sacrifice that

00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:59.870
would touch the wall
and absorb the poison.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.600
And this was the
kind of thing where

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.520
it wasn't your character's
life on the line.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.930
You found ways to
probe the dungeon.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.680
SAM WITWER: So what
we're looking at here.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.700
This is Gary's hand-drawn
map of the tomb itself.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.300
And what happened is we're
talking about a tournament,

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.140
you know?

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:14.849
It's competitive.

00:13:14.849 --> 00:13:16.348
You have all these
different groups,

00:13:16.348 --> 00:13:17.890
and they're all
running concurrent.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.790
There are different dungeon
masters running each group.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:25.070
So Gary knew, because up
until now, what is he doing?

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.440
He's selling rules.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.150
And the rules have
little illustrations

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.520
to make things a little
bit more specific.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.560
But that's about
as far as it goes.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.170
1,000 copies, cool.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.090
Some Xerox machines,
some bootlegs, whatever.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:40.037
But Gary understands going
into this tournament-- wow,

00:13:40.037 --> 00:13:41.620
the way I'm describing
the tournament,

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.755
it's almost like "Karate Kid."

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:44.713
KYLE NEWMAN: It is like
"Karate Kid." (SINGING)

00:13:44.713 --> 00:13:45.700
It's the best around.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.550
SAM WITWER: Sorry.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.900
So he knows going into this
tournament he needs some help,

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.150
because he's going to have
several dungeon masters who

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.910
are not him running different
groups all at the same time,

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.810
all with these timed challenges
and these huge groups.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.610
They all need to be
reacting to the same stuff.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:08.590
So he brings on
14-year-old Tracey Lesh

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.580
to start making
these illustrations.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.770
So you can see the prototypical
version of the great Green

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.090
Devil right here.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:17.740
Tracey Lesh is this
14-year-old kid

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.730
who's making all of these very,
very specific illustrations

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:22.930
so that-- why?

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:24.060
Why is he doing this?

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.101
To spruce it up?

00:14:25.101 --> 00:14:25.600
No.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.930
For no other reason
than the dungeon master

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.390
for each of these
tournament groups

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:35.320
has to be able to present the
same information to each group.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.390
And what's the easiest?

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.679
Well, a picture is
worth a thousand words.

00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:40.720
KYLE NEWMAN: It's to
standardize the experience--

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.100
SAM WITWER: Exactly.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:41.890
KYLE NEWMAN: --so
you could actually

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.860
run it as a legitimate
competition,

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.874
so each group experience
the same thing.

00:14:45.874 --> 00:14:47.290
SAM WITWER: These
are the graphics

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.090
to the game that
Gary designed, right?

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.600
Now, so, suddenly there becomes
a little bit more pressure

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.110
in terms of, well, we
really need art, don't we?

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:59.870
We really need to be
pushing this artistic thing.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.470
We need to instruct people,
what is happening in this room?

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.719
We need to instruct people,
what is the challenge that

00:15:04.719 --> 00:15:05.710
is placed before you?

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:09.560
And so as the game continues
and continues on in prominence.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.560
And, by the way, what my
brother is holding here

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.750
is really quite special.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.704
This is the tournament version
of Gary's Tomb of Horrors.

00:15:16.704 --> 00:15:18.120
This is not the
published version,

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.328
the one that killed you, sir.

00:15:19.328 --> 00:15:20.078
KYLE NEWMAN: 1970.

00:15:20.078 --> 00:15:21.661
JON PETERSON: They're
not responsible.

00:15:21.661 --> 00:15:23.240
Well, they're
partially responsible.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:23.740
Partial.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:24.760
They're definitely responsible.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.540
But, look, it's not them.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.340
It's different, because
this is different.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.540
These are different
illustrations

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.250
that lead to the
illustrations that you

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.384
were shown before you died.

00:15:31.384 --> 00:15:32.800
These are different
illustrations.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.040
You get Gary's
handwritten notes in here.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.114
You get references
to rules that never--

00:15:39.114 --> 00:15:40.780
KYLE NEWMAN: Characters
like the Mystic.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.860
SAM WITWER: Yeah,
things that didn't quite

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.020
make it into the game.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.115
And it is our great
privilege to have

00:15:45.115 --> 00:15:48.570
been able to reproduce this for
this special edition of our--

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:49.320
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.620
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.810
SAM WITWER: Yeah, so that
this too can kill you.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.976
KYLE NEWMAN: What's important
about this early art--

00:15:54.976 --> 00:15:57.370
and you see a lot of it's
hand drawn, black and white.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.380
Color hasn't been
introduced yet.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.480
And its purpose is function.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.360
It's like a cave
painting, or like pottery.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.510
It has a purpose.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.150
It's not to blow you away
with cinematic landscape.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.210
It's not to transport
you somewhere else.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:13.960
It's there to tell you how
the game can be played,

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:19.580
because this is a totally
customizable experience.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.970
And so this early art,
what's fascinating

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.839
is it has just such a
hand-drawn quality is there.

00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:27.880
And they haven't introduced
the budget yet to it.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.560
And we're going to get to this--

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.519
Technicolor finally is
introduced into the game

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:32.310
at a certain point.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.610
Once it starts selling copies,
they have an art budget.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:35.710
MICHAEL WITWER: So we're
now two years into the game.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.450
So we'll only be six
to eight hours more

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:38.902
if you have the time today.

00:16:38.902 --> 00:16:40.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:43.030
So things like this,
though, were really

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.232
pretty meaningful to us.

00:16:44.232 --> 00:16:46.690
I don't want to certainly talk
about our personal story too

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.330
much, only to say that
things like Tomb of Horrors

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.320
are iconic in the brand.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.980
But we never actually
realized the visual relevance

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.660
of Tomb of Horrors
till we started

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.400
looking at this visual
history through that lens.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.400
And so that was pretty
cool to actually discover

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.727
some really new things.

00:17:01.727 --> 00:17:04.060
SAM WITWER: By the way, for
new players, Tomb of Horrors

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.880
has added significance in
that recently they put out

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.286
Tomb of Annihilation, which
is a continuation of all

00:17:09.286 --> 00:17:09.910
of that danger.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.368
KYLE NEWMAN: As
well as the Yawning

00:17:11.368 --> 00:17:12.880
Portal, the last
challenge in that,

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.500
is a reproduction of the Tomb
of Horrors fourth edition.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.990
MICHAEL WITWER: So they
keep coming back to this.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:17.781
It's really iconic.

00:17:17.781 --> 00:17:20.980
KYLE NEWMAN: So the
nostalgia is still alive,

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.780
looking back to these
previous things that

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.220
were so landmark in the game.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.470
And that's one other reason why
fifth edition is so successful

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.303
because it's pulling
off of all this history

00:17:28.303 --> 00:17:30.220
rather than supplanting
it with something new.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.303
MICHAEL WITWER: So the
game starts selling copies,

00:17:32.303 --> 00:17:35.310
and it does start to really
grow in these really niche hobby

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.810
channels.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.810
But again, we're still
very much in a small space.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.330
And I want to really
reiterate that.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.040
But the game starts
to make some money.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.730
And in an associated
fashion, they

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.980
start producing a little
bit better materials.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.770
They start creating
beginner and basic box sets.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.695
And more importantly,
they start to hire

00:17:52.695 --> 00:17:54.820
real artists that have a
little bit of art training

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.580
to do their work, not just
local teenagers they could find

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.850
that would work for $2 a panel.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.140
And you start to see some
illustrated panels that

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.310
are in color.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:07.900
And then, of course, in end
of 1977, beginning of 1978,

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.970
they start on this line
called the Advanced

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.560
"Dungeons and Dragons" line.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.550
What's notable about
it-- well, there's

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.924
a lot of things notable about
it we won't get into today.

00:18:14.924 --> 00:18:17.830
But these are hardcover books
that are very high quality.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:20.020
They have full-color covers.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.476
And we're actually really
pleased in our book

00:18:23.476 --> 00:18:25.600
to bring you actually the
original native paintings

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.525
of the wraparound covers for
the first time that have ever

00:18:27.525 --> 00:18:27.945
been published.

00:18:27.945 --> 00:18:29.560
KYLE NEWMAN: Now, when we
got together to make this--

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.490
there's four of us
here, and you're

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.620
saying, why did it take
four people to do this?

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.203
We got together, and
we said, we don't

00:18:34.203 --> 00:18:36.310
want to just make a
visual history book,

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.480
where it's just images.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.390
There's a story here.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:40.960
There's a juxtaposition,
a magic that happens when

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.440
you put two images together.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.470
And we wanted to also
present native art.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.700
And there were five
key images that we saw.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.940
And up until the last day,
even after the book was

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.590
closed and ready to
go to the printer,

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.390
we said, open it up, because
this one came into our lap.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.950
But like the previous one,
you see the spider in the tree

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.740
was covered by spine and
trade [INAUDIBLE] up there.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.170
So to be able to present
this in its full glory,

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:06.220
to see the brushstroke,
to see the color quality,

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:09.550
to remove it from the
low-quality printing process

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.430
that they had back then and
actually photograph it new.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:13.847
And each time we'd
find something,

00:19:13.847 --> 00:19:16.180
and Jon spearheaded a lot of
this-- we'd find something,

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.957
it would lead to three
or 10 more images

00:19:17.957 --> 00:19:19.040
that we wanted to include.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.980
So we wanted this
to be a book that

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.870
was not just art, but ephemera,
and toys, and animation cells,

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:29.500
and belt buckles, and color
forms, and anything the way

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.910
the brand was visualized.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.425
And so these, though,
are the key images,

00:19:33.425 --> 00:19:35.800
I think, in the book, seeing
this brand in its full glory

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.914
back in this era.

00:19:37.914 --> 00:19:39.580
MICHAEL WITWER: So
at this point, again,

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.680
the game really is
doing very well.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.800
But it is not destined
for the mainstream.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.860
And I would, if I had to say--

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.350
I mean, I don't know what
would have happened otherwise.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.850
But what I would say is that
this game would have never come

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.430
to the mainstream
if not for a really

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.971
weird particular incident that
no one could have ever planned

00:19:53.971 --> 00:19:56.620
for in 1979.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.092
JON PETERSON: James
Dallas Egbert III,

00:19:59.092 --> 00:20:01.680
a 16-year-old college student--

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.070
16 years old in college.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:07.230
You can imagine that must have
been very difficult for him.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.840
He disappears at some point.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.310
And the family is very worried.

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.430
They hire a private
investigator named

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.640
William Dear, who comes
to the campus, checks

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.650
out the guy's dorm
room, looks around,

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.470
finds these strange books
that he can't really

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.794
make head nor tails of.

00:20:23.794 --> 00:20:25.710
There's a thing called
"Dungeons and Dragons,"

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.850
and it's got devil faces on
the cover and stuff like that.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.380
And he's looking through
it, and he's reading it,

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.290
and he's seeing these
maps, strange mazes.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.490
And he's asking around.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.610
Hey, are there any mazes around?

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.020
Oh, there's steam tunnels.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.436
There's steam tunnels underneath
the camp-- wait a second.

00:20:42.436 --> 00:20:43.930
Wait a second.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.140
I know what happened here.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.890
I know what happened to
James Dallas Egbert III.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.680
I think that he played
this strange game,

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.680
and he played it too well.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.560
He played it so long
that he became confused

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.500
between reality and
fantasy, between am I me,

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.710
or am I my character?

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.872
And I think James
Dallas Egbert, he

00:21:04.872 --> 00:21:06.330
wandered down to
the steam tunnels,

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.520
which are the very
same, very similar thing

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.736
to the maps in the game.

00:21:09.736 --> 00:21:11.610
And he's probably
wandering down right there.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.162
He probably even killed himself.

00:21:13.162 --> 00:21:14.370
I think that's what happened.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.220
And suddenly this
makes national news.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.100
"Dungeons and Dragons"
is now everywhere.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.891
People are talking
about it, this game that

00:21:20.891 --> 00:21:22.470
drove this kid
insane, caused him

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.290
to go off down into these
steam tunnels and kill himself.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.700
And then in the meantime,
James Dallas Egbert,

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.450
he just ran away.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:28.950
He was fine.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:29.940
It had nothing to do with "D&amp;D."

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.230
He was just under
a lot of pressure.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.520
KYLE NEWMAN: And there was
no corrected follow-up story.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.750
JON PETERSON: No corrected
follow-up, because that's not

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.080
a very good story, right?

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.870
Like, he's fine.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.135
Anyway.

00:21:38.135 --> 00:21:39.510
MICHAEL WITWER:
So this game that

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.610
was selling in hobby
catalogs all of a sudden

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.280
is in "The New York Times."

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.551
So while the story
does resolve itself

00:21:46.551 --> 00:21:48.550
in about a month's time--
and as they suggested,

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.130
no one ever comes
back and retracts.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.963
Oh, by the way, all
that stuff was nonsense.

00:21:51.963 --> 00:21:54.660
All this bizarre cult
talk, all of this confusion

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.670
between reality and
fantasy, it's all nonsense.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.880
No one bothers really doing
that, or very few people do.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.480
But now you've got parents
that are interested.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.600
Oh, but my kid plays that.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.200
Let me go take a look.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.259
And they see things
like this on the cover.

00:22:09.259 --> 00:22:10.800
KYLE NEWMAN: Which
nobody had noticed

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.406
until recently the amazing
thong on that demon.

00:22:14.406 --> 00:22:15.780
We didn't even
notice it until we

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.130
were able to look at
this image so big.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:19.440
SAM WITWER: the first time
we reproduce the demon thong

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.054
as it's never before been seen.

00:22:21.054 --> 00:22:23.220
MICHAEL WITWER: So, Jon,
what happens from here, now

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.678
that there's a new scrutiny on
this game that was otherwise

00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:27.245
just kind of in
the shadows before?

00:22:27.245 --> 00:22:29.370
JON PETERSON: Oh, well,
obviously sales quadrupled.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.537
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:30.537 --> 00:22:31.620
I mean, why wouldn't they?

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.340
So, yeah, once this got
this mainstream attention,

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.580
yeah, people started buying it,
and that additional scrutiny.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.310
Obviously once these
sorts of images, parents

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.460
became aware of what was in
them, this created controversy.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.004
But also the news
cycle, once it stopped

00:22:47.004 --> 00:22:48.420
talking about James
Dallas Egbert,

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.540
that got Gary Gygax on Tom
Snyder's "Tomorrow," which

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.100
was a big show at the time.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.510
It got articles in "Newsweek."

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.390
They were no longer really about
the James Dallas Egbert thing.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.057
But from that,
again, it completely

00:22:59.057 --> 00:23:01.140
transformed the brand into
the most unlikely thing

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.320
that could have happened.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.650
And with it came
mainstream attention.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.290
Now, that mainstream attention
included a nice contract

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.650
with Random House, who happens
to be our publisher as well.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.570
Random House started
distributing this.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.970
But of course, because this
pressure and this concern,

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:17.730
and also it looked
demographically

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.790
like younger and younger
people were buying it,

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.650
they needed to really
redo their image a bit.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:26.922
The devils and thongs and things
like that probably weren't what

00:23:26.922 --> 00:23:29.255
Random House wanted to see
in Walden Books [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:29.255 --> 00:23:29.670
SAM WITWER: Not really.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:30.660
JON PETERSON: And
so one of the things

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.701
we love about this book--

00:23:31.701 --> 00:23:32.640
I love advertisements.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.240
Advertisements bring you back
into the moment so quickly.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.450
So do catalogs and
things like that.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:42.150
These are catalogs here, side
by side, from 1981 and 1982.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.130
1981, the Gateway
to Adventure looks

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.320
like a pretty scary
place, actually.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.060
You know, I love the septum
piercing for the door knocker.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.590
But the demon tail,
everything looks really scary.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.695
The adventure looks like it
might actually not be for kids.

00:23:55.695 --> 00:23:59.650
Fast forward to 1982, and
it's Morley, the happy wizard.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:00.410
[LAUGHING]

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.400
Come, come into my
room, where there's

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.000
treasure and games and fun.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.479
And this is very much
what the band became then.

00:24:09.479 --> 00:24:11.520
First of all because they
had so much more money,

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.728
they got much better artists.

00:24:12.728 --> 00:24:14.940
They got much better
public relations

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.590
teams and marketing teams.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:19.470
And then they got
much better artists.

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:22.687
WITWER: But there is still this
stigma attached to the brand.

00:24:22.687 --> 00:24:25.020
KYLE NEWMAN: Forever fused
with this heavy metal energy.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.300
SAM WITWER: There's
mothers that want

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:31.390
to form a group called Bothered
About "Dungeons and Dragons."

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.246
BADD.

00:24:33.246 --> 00:24:34.620
JON PETERSON: Game
Devil Worship.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.661
SAM WITWER: That's right.

00:24:35.661 --> 00:24:39.420
The most trusted face of our
generation, Mr. Tom Hanks,

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:43.200
right here, plays in a
made for TV movie by CBS

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.020
called "Mazes and Monsters,"
which is about the fact

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.610
that "Dungeons and
Dragons" does--

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:51.270
it's not ambiguous-- it does
drive your children insane.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:55.080
And Tom Hanks has a real
Oscar-winning moment

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.084
at the end when he
realizes that he's insane.

00:24:57.084 --> 00:24:58.500
MICHAEL WITWER:
It's a must watch.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.208
SAM WITWER: Yeah.

00:24:59.208 --> 00:25:00.720
It's on YouTube
somewhere, I think.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.310
KYLE NEWMAN: And it finds
its way into the mainstream.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:04.230
This is Steven
Spielberg's "E.T."

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:05.160
from 1982.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.830
And Spielberg's filming
this movie in 1981.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:09.630
And what's in the zeitgeist?

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.390
What are teens playing, and
what's got an edge to it?

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:16.040
He's trying to authenticate and
ground the movie to endear it

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.300
to teens and children.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.370
And "Dungeons and Dragons"
provides him that.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.900
It gives it that energy
and authenticity.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.840
So you can see it in the movie
here, and in a very early scene

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.950
just before Elliott meets E.T.

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:32.280
An interesting footnote--
you can see it on YouTube--

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.170
is that the end of
the movie was supposed

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.300
be bookended by Elliott
finally graduating

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.590
to the Dungeon Master's chair.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.460
And he's actually leading the
group and the older brother

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.139
and his friends
through the dungeon.

00:25:42.139 --> 00:25:44.430
So you can see that "Dungeons
and Dragons" was supposed

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:47.490
to have more of a central
place in the narrative,

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:48.810
and it's a really nice bookend.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:53.730
But here what its purpose
was, was to really show

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:57.210
what teens were up to in 1982.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.529
That's one of its more
famous pop culture examples.

00:26:00.529 --> 00:26:02.820
MICHAEL WITWER: And you think
about this domino effect.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.860
Sometimes people
ask us, so does D&amp;D

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.980
make the mainstream without what
they call the Satanic Panic?

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.730
This whole kind of controversy
we're talking about.

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:12.270
And the answer is, I don't know.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:16.920
But I think it's safe to say
that it's not in "E.T." by 1982

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.092
if it hasn't showed up in
the mainstream circa 1980.

00:26:19.092 --> 00:26:21.300
KYLE NEWMAN: We can thank
the worst private detective

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.250
of all time, William
Dear, for the success

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.050
of "Dungeons and Dragons."

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.550
MICHAEL WITWER: Now
we've got money.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.560
Now we're on the
shelves of Waldenbooks.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.500
Now we've grown from a company
with $2 million of revenue

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.500
a year to $30 million
of revenue a year

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.174
in about a four year span.

00:26:36.174 --> 00:26:37.840
So things are actually
going quite well,

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.730
and now you can hire some really
well-seasoned, trained artists.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:44.002
Some of the best, actually,
in the fantasy business.

00:26:44.002 --> 00:26:45.960
That's kind of what starts
happening from here.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.450
Does anyone know-- did anyone
grow up on the Red Box?

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.210
What we call the Red
Box in the space?

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:51.044
SAM WITWER: Nice.

00:26:51.044 --> 00:26:52.710
MICHAEL WITWER: One
of the most famous--

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.876
Not only the most famous
products in gaming history,

00:26:54.876 --> 00:26:57.072
but of course, some of
the most famous art.

00:26:57.072 --> 00:26:58.530
We're showing off
a little bit here

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.050
by being able to find some
draft art of some really

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.290
iconic imagery.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:04.770
As you can see here,
you've got some variations

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:08.122
in this early Larry Elmore
version of the Red Box cover.

00:27:08.122 --> 00:27:10.080
We've got a lot of things
like that in the book

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:10.440
that we're real excited about.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.898
KYLE NEWMAN: This
is a real gateway

00:27:11.898 --> 00:27:14.730
piece between the old '70s
stuff and the direction

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:15.660
the brand is going.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.910
That's one of the reasons
why it ends up on our cover,

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.961
because it has this very
cinematic, immersive entry

00:27:20.961 --> 00:27:21.460
point.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.030
And you feel like you're
right there with the fighter.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:27.210
It's one of those ones that
survive multiple generations.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.836
Even up until recently
they recycle it.

00:27:28.836 --> 00:27:31.043
JON PETERSON: Oh, I mean,
it was on pinball machines.

00:27:31.043 --> 00:27:31.890
It was on wallets.

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:33.990
That piece of art
appeared everywhere.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.837
And the game was inspiring
so many people by this point,

00:27:36.837 --> 00:27:38.670
because it could reach
such a wide audience.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:42.420
People who became really,
really, really into "D&amp;D."

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.850
One of them was a guy
named Ed Greenwood who

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:47.550
developed this campaign world
that he called "The Forgotten

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.780
Realms."

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.870
He had written something
like 11,000 pages

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.420
of material for this.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.640
By the late 1980s "D&amp;D--"
I guess the people at TSR

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.880
decided they wanted to be
more in the story business.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.360
To be building not just kind of
a set of rules, but very much

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.020
worlds.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.600
Worlds that they
could exploit not just

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.520
through game products
like modules,

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.810
but to take to novels, to
calendars, to computer games.

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:13.890
KYLE NEWMAN: Animation.

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.390
JON PETERSON: Animation.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.120
So what you see up here is
Ed Greenwood's original map

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.405
of the Sword Coast of
the Forgotten Realms

00:28:20.405 --> 00:28:21.780
that includes
places you may have

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.020
heard of like Waterdeep
or Baldur's Gate

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.160
or take your pick.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.840
"Neverwinter Nights."

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.056
As soon as they conceived of
this trans-media direction,

00:28:32.056 --> 00:28:33.930
we start to see games
like "Pool of Radiance"

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.760
become ambassadors
for the "D&amp;D" brand.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.339
"D&amp;D" no longer is merely
a tabletop phenomenon.

00:28:39.339 --> 00:28:41.630
This is something they felt
was very important to show.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:44.440
Again, we talk a lot about all
the ancillary things of "D&amp;D"

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.260
we like to show in this.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.330
Things like computer
games at this time

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:50.640
started to get close
to what the sales were

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.656
like for the base game books.

00:28:52.656 --> 00:28:54.030
This time the
"Player's Handbook"

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.300
might sell 400,000 copies,
say, but "Pool of Radiance"

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.510
now can sell 250,000 copies.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.480
You know, we love showing how
you can see the little kobold

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.690
figure in "Pool of
Radiance" copies so directly

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.560
from that kobold from
the "Monster Manual."

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.110
These kinds of
things just get us

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.460
in touch with the roots of this.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.487
But if you fast forward another
decade to "Baldur's Gate,"

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:17.070
by the time "Baldur's
Gate" comes out,

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.905
it's selling two million copies.

00:29:18.905 --> 00:29:20.280
And then "Baldur's
Gate II" sells

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.050
another two million copies.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.940
A lot of these campaign
worlds they develop--

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.340
Planescape is my personal
favorite of these.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.550
That was well-received
in the community,

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:32.100
but "Planescape: Torment" the
computer game is why everyone

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.830
knows Planescape, because
it's commonly rated as one

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:36.421
of the best RPGs of all time.

00:29:36.421 --> 00:29:38.670
KYLE NEWMAN: And so these
digital versions of the game

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:42.930
become the overriding and
dominant visualization of it

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.390
for mass audiences.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:47.550
You're seeing the brand's
identity shift a bit

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.380
as the marketplace is shifting.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.277
And it introduces
competitors as well,

00:29:51.277 --> 00:29:52.860
because "D&amp;D"'s been
around for a bit,

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:53.970
and now other
people are inspired

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.136
to create role-playing games
through the open gaming

00:29:56.136 --> 00:29:59.490
license, and people who grew up
on it now are game designers.

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.530
So the marketplace
is more crowded,

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:04.740
and "Dungeons and Dragons" is
also publishing other realms.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.120
They're competing
against themself too.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.499
And then you have the
influx of digital games.

00:30:09.499 --> 00:30:11.290
MICHAEL WITWER: There's
one thing we really

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:13.360
like to show in the
book, and one thing

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.860
that became clear to us.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.360
A lot of us have
studied-- we've all

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.530
played this game
our whole lives,

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:19.360
and we've studied this
game for a long time

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.790
and at a pretty in-depth level.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.540
But there are certain
things you will just

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.206
never see if you do
not look at the game

00:30:24.206 --> 00:30:26.020
through the visual lens.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.490
One of them is
something like this.

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:28.840
Again, this little
image here talks

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.310
about all the
different campaigns

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.980
that TSR was rolling
out in the 1990s.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.650
You can see how confused the
brand actually had become.

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.780
It was trying to create
something for everyone.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.260
KYLE NEWMAN: Buck Rogers is--

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.210
MICHAEL WITWER: We've even
got Buck Rogers in there

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:41.730
for some reason.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.002
Really, we do.

00:30:44.002 --> 00:30:45.460
There's so many
interesting stories

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.610
you see when you start looking
at the game in this way.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.450
We studied things
like how the game

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:51.760
had been inspired by pulp art.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.810
That's a picture from the
very famous Brom there,

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:59.140
from "D&amp;D"'s art stable, and
how he was inspired by Frank

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.270
Frazetta-- as was
everyone else--

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:02.590
from the famous "Conan" covers.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.006
KYLE NEWMAN: But the art needed
to be eclectic to sell it.

00:31:05.006 --> 00:31:08.610
So you'd have a more whimsical
fantasy, sci-fi "Spelljammer."

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:11.680
Or you'd have very
brutal and violent

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.080
and grounded "Dark
Sun" with psionics

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.760
that had a "Mad Max" feel.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.290
The art told you the direction
that you could creatively

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.900
take this world with the
same basic rules set.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:26.070
The art was the main
communicating factor

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:28.390
in this that sold
it for everyone.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.390
MICHAEL WITWER: This
little panel here, I think,

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.480
is pretty fun.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.420
And again, there's a lot we
can talk about, safe to say.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.665
But what we like to show
here is this idea that

00:31:38.665 --> 00:31:40.540
in the '90s there's this
little game called--

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.670
"Magic-- The Gathering" is born.

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:48.402
It creates what we know as the
collectible card gaming space.

00:31:48.402 --> 00:31:50.860
Again, it's the same bucket of
money for most hobby gamers.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.410
Those people that were
playing "D&amp;D" previously

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.346
start shifting their
money over to "Magic--

00:31:55.346 --> 00:31:55.970
The Gathering."

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.610
If you were buying
a module before,

00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:59.230
now you're buying
a booster pack.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:02.500
So it starts to eat the lunch
of the entire hobby gaming space

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.480
even though it's a
different type of game.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.414
What you see TSR doing,
the creator of "D&amp;D,"

00:32:07.414 --> 00:32:08.830
is that they start
following suit.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:11.560
They start trying to enter
the CCG space themselves

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.254
with "Spellfire."

00:32:13.254 --> 00:32:15.170
They start reacting to
a lot of market trends.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.659
Well we need newer and younger
players to enter the space.

00:32:17.659 --> 00:32:18.450
How do we get them?

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.502
How do we indoctrinate
young players?

00:32:20.502 --> 00:32:22.460
And so we like to show
little things like this,

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:26.050
which is an ad-- it actually
comes from an ad at the time.

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:28.240
That's about a four
or five year period

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.890
where these are
all different basic

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:32.680
and beginner sets they're
rolling out on an annual basis

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.810
to try to figure out, how can we
get new players into the space?

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.110
So there is the basic,
beginner, introductory set.

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:41.796
Here is the basic,
newly revised so-and-so.

00:32:41.796 --> 00:32:43.420
They're trying to
find a way to explain

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.795
this game to people still.

00:32:44.795 --> 00:32:47.170
SAM WITWER: It's so interesting
that that's an ad, right?

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.170
They're just kind of like,
confused about "D&amp;D?"

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.950
Well how about more confusion?

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:53.260
JON PETERSON: Here's eight
tries at being not confused.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.430
SAM WITWER: And
you're doing fine now?

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.940
Good.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.849
Great.

00:32:55.849 --> 00:32:57.640
It's interesting to
note that at this point

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.965
the brand had become
a little bit--

00:32:59.965 --> 00:33:01.840
I mean, while it was
doing some great things,

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.740
there was some insecurity there
for perhaps the first time.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.930
Because "D&amp;D," being the
first role-playing game,

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.990
could stride boldly
forward with no thought

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.510
as to what any competitor
was doing because they

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:16.116
were the only game in town.

00:33:16.116 --> 00:33:17.740
Then when there were
competitors, well,

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.573
the competitors weren't
as big as they were,

00:33:19.573 --> 00:33:21.127
so they didn't
bother to, you know,

00:33:21.127 --> 00:33:22.960
they didn't care what
anyone else was doing.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.154
They were "D&amp;D" and they
were going to be "D&amp;D."

00:33:25.154 --> 00:33:26.570
But then by the
time you get here,

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.389
it starts looking at different
marketplaces including,

00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:30.430
for example, video games.

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:33.850
It starts going what are
all those millions of kids

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:34.690
playing over there?

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.100
"World of Warcraft"?

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.160
But that's just "D&amp;D."

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.884
Well that's not-- oh come on.

00:33:39.884 --> 00:33:41.050
You can do better than that.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:44.020
Don't sit here in front
of your computer all sad.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:44.810
Looking sad.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:46.592
Don't play computer games.

00:33:46.592 --> 00:33:48.550
What are you, a loser
with your computer games?

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.008
Also play our
computer game though,

00:33:50.008 --> 00:33:52.840
because we're going to make
one even better than the one

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.250
that you are playing.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:58.341
And also, by the way, your books
are no good to you anymore,

00:33:58.341 --> 00:33:58.840
sir.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.120
Just use them to prop
your computer up and play

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:01.870
our computer game.

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.328
KYLE NEWMAN: You're
just like, wow.

00:34:03.328 --> 00:34:07.510
So the story of advertising
tells the schizophrenia.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.630
"D&amp;D" wasn't just looking
over its shoulder.

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:13.690
It was trying to catch up
or be forever replaced,

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:16.126
and it was a dangerous
time for the brand.

00:34:16.126 --> 00:34:18.250
What's fascinating is there
have been so many times

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.810
when the brand has been on
the brink of disaster and doom

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:24.521
and how it's been resurrected.

00:34:24.521 --> 00:34:26.020
I think that's
what's so wonderfully

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.030
traced with these ads.

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:28.900
Sometimes you don't have to
write the stuff in the book.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.420
The juxtaposition of images
tells you what's going on

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.219
and how they're trying to
figure out what they are,

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:35.989
and how they can
survive and sell it.

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:36.699
MICHAEL WITWER: And
so all of a sudden

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:38.860
the game starts to
look like those very

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.260
digital games they're trying
to now emulate and follow.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.469
They're trying to
capture this audience.

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:44.320
KYLE NEWMAN: It's like a fantasy
Busby Berkeley musical here.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.445
They're jamming everything
they can into the frame,

00:34:46.445 --> 00:34:48.467
and this guy's got an
impossibly large sword,

00:34:48.467 --> 00:34:50.050
and everybody looks
like they're doing

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:55.690
something absolutely heroic,
and the asymmetric angles.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:59.380
There's a total video game
emulation going on here.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.540
The game had become
more complex,

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:05.102
and it's also really a complex
minis game at this point.

00:35:05.102 --> 00:35:07.560
JON PETERSON: It's wonderful
to be able to reproduce things

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.580
like this.

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.550
The last image, in its
full glory like this.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.680
We're so grateful to
Wizards of the Coast

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.907
for having given us just
unprecedented access

00:35:15.907 --> 00:35:17.740
to their archives for
these kinds of things.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.020
MICHAEL WITWER: Seattle-based.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.750
Close, right?

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.560
Yeah, now we get
to this point where

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.630
the game has now been following
the market for a little while.

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:27.330
And they see there's literally
10x number of players playing

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.760
digital games-- digital
versions of their game

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.880
and their concept--

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.102
than what are playing
their tabletop games.

00:35:33.102 --> 00:35:34.560
What starts happening
in the market

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.643
as they start building
these more and more complex

00:35:36.643 --> 00:35:38.434
tabletop versions
of digital games?

00:35:38.434 --> 00:35:40.850
JON PETERSON: There is a bit
of a backlash, you might say.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:43.080
There's a bit of
a retro movement.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.480
You increasingly see
them trying to tap back

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.910
into an audience
that had gone back

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:49.035
to the original principles.

00:35:49.035 --> 00:35:51.159
There's something called
the Old School Renaissance

00:35:51.159 --> 00:35:53.190
that's out there, which
is a bunch of players

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:54.140
and collectors.

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.340
I'm part of this
collecting community

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.670
that has helped restore
originalist approaches

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.670
to "D&amp;D."

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.650
SAM WITWER: Retro clones and
all kinds of crazy stuff.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.990
Retro cloning, it's like a
clone of an old rule set,

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:10.050
so that if you
loved "D&amp;D" in 1982,

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:12.312
you could play that
version of "D&amp;D."

00:36:12.312 --> 00:36:13.770
JON PETERSON: And
you know, I think

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:17.160
that created some anxiety as
well at Wizards of the Coast.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.050
So you see, for example,
this starter set,

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:23.460
which is from around 2008
or so, if I had to guess.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.950
This really looks just
like the Red Box from 1983.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.924
They're reminding
people, hey, this--

00:36:27.924 --> 00:36:30.090
again, you can probably not
even tell the difference

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:32.190
looking at this in this room--

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.832
hey, this box, it's still
the same game, we promise,

00:36:34.832 --> 00:36:36.540
even though now we're
on a fourth edition

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.880
and these are very different
rules mechanically.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.440
Very miniatures driven in a way
that the 1983 version was not.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.931
MICHAEL WITWER: So Wizards
takes this to heart.

00:36:45.931 --> 00:36:47.430
Wizards, of course,
is now the owner

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:48.513
of "Dungeons and Dragons."

00:36:48.513 --> 00:36:49.914
Has been now for what, 15 years?

00:36:49.914 --> 00:36:51.330
KYLE NEWMAN:
Subsidiary of Hasbro.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.090
MICHAEL WITWER: A
subsidiary of Hasbro.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.460
They take this to heart and
they realize who are we?

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.900
What are we trying to be?

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.770
Are we a video game producer?

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:02.820
Are we trying to do nothing but
follow the video game space?

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.940
And they go through a massive
playtest called "D&amp;D" Next.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.490
It's actually the largest
role-playing game game test

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:10.039
in the history of the world.

00:37:10.039 --> 00:37:11.580
KYLE NEWMAN: 100,000
player playtest.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.621
SAM WITWER: By the way,
speaking of retro clones,

00:37:13.621 --> 00:37:15.420
it included the
design team playing

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.480
through every version of the
"Dungeons and Dragons" rules

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.340
going all the way back
to the early '70s.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.440
Literally
acknowledging that they

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.604
needed to reconnect with
the roots of the game.

00:37:24.604 --> 00:37:27.020
KYLE NEWMAN: I think it's a
very healthy and honest thing.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.020
They didn't just say we're
a new team of people,

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:31.440
we're going to go take the
game forward in our own way.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.470
Let's go back and be
truthful about what worked,

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.260
and let's look what's in the
DNA and why these elements have

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.460
survived through iterations.

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.668
Why is the game still around?

00:37:39.668 --> 00:37:40.440
There's a reason.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.030
So let's cull those
elements and let's

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:46.560
see what people respond to
and what resonates visually

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.730
and narratively.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.820
And let's see how we
can chemically weave it

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.190
into something special
that doesn't crush what

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:55.380
came before it, but can
stand on its shoulders

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.670
and still honor the past.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.710
I think that's
what's so wonderful

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:02.520
about Fifth Edition
is the simplicity

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:07.020
and the inclusiveness of it.

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.520
You can actually-- with
3 onward, 3.5 onward--

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.599
you could start to--

00:38:12.599 --> 00:38:14.640
the barriers were broken
in terms of what classes

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.420
you could play.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.860
Could a half-orc be a Paladin?

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.140
But now anybody in any
class and any gender

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.600
could be any type of character.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.060
It was a completely
blank slate and yet,

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.475
if you played all these other
games, it was even richer.

00:38:26.475 --> 00:38:28.350
SAM WITWER: Moreover,
it just took everything

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.150
that was great
about each edition

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:33.300
and put it all into
one pot and let you

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.760
decide how you wanted
to play the game.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.060
Me and Kyle are doing this book
because we fell back in love

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.444
with "D&amp;D" because of 5E.

00:38:40.444 --> 00:38:42.360
KYLE NEWMAN: That's kind
of how it came about.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.090
SAM WITWER: It really is.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:44.923
KYLE NEWMAN: There's a
really strange story.

00:38:44.923 --> 00:38:46.410
As I got back into
playing, and Sam

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.290
was my "Star Wars" Game Master,
and we were in this great game.

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:51.124
And he had to go
off to work, and I

00:38:51.124 --> 00:38:53.040
didn't want to start
another "Star Wars" game.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.510
And I'd played
"Dungeons and Dragons"

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:55.340
on and off my whole life.

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.520
So I got back into "D&amp;D."

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.970
Within a week or two I was
going on eBay and Amazon

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.470
to find where's the book?

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:02.970
Where's the book
about everything

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.420
I've missed in the
past few years?

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.870
And you know, it
really didn't exist.

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:07.828
I read Michael's book,
"Empire of Imagination."

00:39:07.828 --> 00:39:08.709
I was hooked.

00:39:08.709 --> 00:39:11.250
I knew him through Facebook,
and I knew he was Sam's brother.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:12.990
I reached out and said, hey,
do you want to do a book?

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:14.380
And he was like, yeah.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.380
And it just started
to pick up momentum.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:20.010
Michael immediately suggested
Jon, and I knew of Jon's book

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:24.131
and how esteemed he was as
a historian and collector.

00:39:24.131 --> 00:39:26.130
Then the group grew and
Sam's like, what, you're

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.180
doing a book with my brother?

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:27.570
How do you know my brother?

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:29.736
SAM WITWER: It was my initial
betrayal that sent you

00:39:29.736 --> 00:39:31.230
off looking for a new game.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:33.600
KYLE NEWMAN: We formed this
balanced party to go do it.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.240
I think it wouldn't have been
what it was unless we all

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.360
brought our experiences
and our unique perspectives

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.816
to this to tell it
in a prismatic way

00:39:41.816 --> 00:39:44.190
and look at it helpfully from
all these different angles.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:49.410
To organically write a
unified history of the game.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:51.630
Because if one of
us had done it,

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:53.607
it would've been so
different and limited.

00:39:53.607 --> 00:39:54.440
SAM WITWER: Limited.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.970
And everyone has a
different take on this game.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:59.760
And we all should.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.000
Much like we believe the
new version of the game

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.355
is very inclusive we needed to
include different perspectives.

00:40:07.355 --> 00:40:08.480
And it wasn't just us four.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.180
We also interviewed
countless people

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.530
who had worked on the games.

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:14.380
KYLE NEWMAN: We found out
artists' personal favorites,

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.220
which was often
enlightening to find out,

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.600
oh that was your favorite?

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.640
SAM WITWER: Talked
to fans old and new.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:23.450
The new fans that I talked
to were the most enlightening

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:24.170
to me.

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:25.640
JON PETERSON: We had a
tremendous amount of support

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.290
from the community
doing this as well.

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:28.310
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:30.320
When I mentioned we had
such great access to

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.340
Wizards' stuff--

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:34.899
unfortunately, before
Wizards acquired TSR in 1997,

00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:36.440
a lot of that material
ended up being

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.210
scattered to the nine winds.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:42.950
These early pieces of art,
these early drafts of the game,

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:45.590
they just ended up in the
hands of private collectors.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:47.350
Fortunately, we know
a of those people

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:49.490
and they've been
profoundly useful.

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:51.290
MICHAEL WITWER: Oh,
my gosh, incredible.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.810
So at the end of the day,
we started with this notion

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.220
that "D&amp;D" is having
a moment right now.

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.980
And the question we
tried to ask even when

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.800
we started our project is why?

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.330
And the why, I think,
is pretty clear.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.595
You've got this beautiful,
elegant, new rule

00:41:05.595 --> 00:41:09.470
set that's for everyone
and the barriers

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:11.900
to accessibility
have been broken.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.600
Because, where in
the '90s they had

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.210
to build new starter sets
every year to help people

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:19.220
understand what the
hell this game was-- now

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.947
you can go on
YouTube, and you can

00:41:20.947 --> 00:41:23.030
watch five minutes of Matt
Mercer or somebody else

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.250
like him playing a game
of "Dungeons and Dragons."

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:27.844
You can understand instantly
what the game is about,

00:41:27.844 --> 00:41:30.260
how easy it is to play, and
you can go start your own game

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.322
with your friends.

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:33.780
I think that's one reason why
we're all sitting here today.

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.792
We would love to
take some questions.

00:41:38.792 --> 00:41:40.250
I know we don't
have a lot of time,

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:41.780
Sage will kill me if
we go too far over.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:42.830
KYLE NEWMAN: If
you ask questions,

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:43.550
there are tour shirts.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:44.690
MICHAEL WITWER: I know we
have to sign books too,

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:45.770
and we promise we will.

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:47.390
We'll stay as long as
you want us to do that.

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:48.530
JON PETERSON: Why don't
you model a shirt, Kyle?

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:49.345
MICHAEL WITWER: Let's
take some questions.

00:41:49.345 --> 00:41:50.210
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:51.950
KYLE NEWMAN: But after you ask
a question, if we call you up,

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:54.450
just come up and see Michael
and we'll try and get you

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:55.720
a shirt size if we have it.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.430
MICHAEL WITWER: OK, let's start
with this gentleman right here.

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:59.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm curious.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.790
I know there were some other
role-playing games that

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.890
were created in the '80s.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.630
Do you know how much
of that, if any,

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:09.770
was driven by the panic over
"Dungeons and Dragons" itself?

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:12.590
I ask that because I
have a specific memory.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:15.800
My friends and I, we
couldn't play at my friend

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.860
Phil's house because his
mother totally bought into it.

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.410
But she bought him--

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:24.740
to placate him-- bought
him a role-playing game

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:28.760
based on the Sicilian Mafia,
which is in no way racist.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.462
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:31.462 --> 00:42:33.920
JON PETERSON: She should have
gotten him "DragonRaid" which

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.795
is the Christian one.

00:42:34.795 --> 00:42:36.295
AUDIENCE: I have a
very clear memory

00:42:36.295 --> 00:42:38.060
of sitting at his
kitchen table, three

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.430
of us plotting the hit
of a guy while she's

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:41.827
over there making dinner.

00:42:41.827 --> 00:42:45.185
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:45.185 --> 00:42:47.810
MICHAEL WITWER: So the question
is, largely how did the Satanic

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:49.750
Panic affect the industry?

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:51.140
How did it effect other games?

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:53.499
AUDIENCE: --that existed
because of the Satanic Panic.

00:42:53.499 --> 00:42:55.040
SAM WITWER: I can
say this before you

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.450
give the correct answer.

00:42:56.450 --> 00:43:00.890
I will say that our "Dungeons
and Dragons" collection

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:03.947
was destroyed by our mother
because it's the Devil.

00:43:03.947 --> 00:43:05.030
MICHAEL WITWER: It's true.

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:06.622
SAM WITWER: So we
played "Star Wars."

00:43:06.622 --> 00:43:08.330
MICHAEL WITWER: No,
that's exactly right.

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:10.310
JON PETERSON: I mean,
it's certainly true.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.830
In no small part, just
because of the prominence

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:14.660
of D&amp;D after the
Satanic Panic, everyone

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:15.920
wanted to cash in on it.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.570
So it wasn't merely
just reacting

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:20.371
against the potentially
occult elements of it,

00:43:20.371 --> 00:43:22.370
but just the fact that
it'd become so prominent.

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:25.880
But of course, by 1976 there
were already role-playing games

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.650
about bunnies in burrows.

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:31.130
And there was
"Traveler" by 1977.

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:34.010
There's a whole gamut of
genres that are explored.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:36.230
"Top Secret" by 1980.

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:38.750
I think that it had
already leapt away

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.700
from those potentially
occult trappings

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.480
long before there
had been any panic.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.540
But the panic definitely
made everyone think

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.260
there's actually money in this.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.260
KYLE NEWMAN: They actually
created a new market,

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.059
so people were bound to compete.

00:43:51.059 --> 00:43:52.100
MICHAEL WITWER: You next.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.910
And if you want to
come up for a shirt,

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:55.050
the [INAUDIBLE]
asked the question.

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:56.370
If you want to come
up for a shirt.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:57.536
AUDIENCE: I appreciate that.

00:43:57.536 --> 00:43:59.270
I already have more
shirts than I need.

00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.840
MICHAEL WITWER: Good.

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.280
Then more for
everyone else then.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:01.800
You, please.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.508
AUDIENCE: Did your
mother ever apologize?

00:44:03.508 --> 00:44:05.440
Did someone ever come
back later [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.920
and go, did you ever realize how
much of a difference you made?

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.440
SAM WITWER: How much he's
enriched all of our lives

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.440
by bringing "Dungeons and
Dragons" to the masses?

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.605
Mother has apologized, yes.

00:44:16.605 --> 00:44:17.480
MICHAEL WITWER: Yeah.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.396
She's very supportive.

00:44:18.396 --> 00:44:21.190
SAM WITWER: We just wrote a book
about it, so she's like, oh.

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:22.687
Huh.

00:44:22.687 --> 00:44:24.020
MICHAEL WITWER: I will say this.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.490
You have to understand
the context.

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:28.840
You know, these are parents that
get this game that is so weird.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.420
It has demons on the front.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:31.910
It has spells inside.

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:33.854
This is a really,
really frightening thing

00:44:33.854 --> 00:44:36.020
if your 8 year old is playing
this game in the 1980s

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:39.150
where there's a lot of media
attention around this topic.

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:41.810
And of course, the Satanic
Panic is a much broader

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:43.220
popular culture topic.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:46.060
It was not just for
role-playing games.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.720
This stretched into satanic
cults at all kinds of places.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.320
SAM WITWER: There was cult--

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.860
recruiting for cults and stuff.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.594
What is--

00:44:54.594 --> 00:44:56.010
JON PETERSON: As
for Dear, though,

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.593
William Dear the
private investigator,

00:44:57.593 --> 00:45:00.230
not only did he not apologize,
he really doubled down.

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:01.470
He wrote a book about this.

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:03.200
He was trying to get
movies made about his side

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.075
of the story of this.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.400
He ended up working with
the people like BADD.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.940
SAM WITWER: To defend the
parents that threw away

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:16.870
"D&amp;D" books, there was a "60
Minutes" special where they

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:19.330
said, very credibly,
they're like,

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:21.460
do you know what
role-playing is really for?

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.470
It's for behavioral
modification.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:25.494
We are redesigning
our personalities.

00:45:25.494 --> 00:45:27.160
Ask these kids what
"D&amp;D" is and they're

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.345
like, well yeah, you
know, you kill these guys,

00:45:29.345 --> 00:45:30.220
you take their stuff.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:31.410
They're like, look at this!

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:32.035
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:32.035 --> 00:45:34.537
This is what we want to
teach our children to do?

00:45:34.537 --> 00:45:37.120
JON PETERSON: Tom Radecki, whose
name some of you might know--

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.245
who was later a big critic
of video game violence--

00:45:39.245 --> 00:45:41.110
I understand had a
somewhat ignominious end.

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:42.890
He was one of the many enablers.

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:45.580
I guess he was trying to
provide a veneer of science

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.530
around some of this.

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:49.570
It was a very unfortunate time.

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:51.590
MICHAEL WITWER: This
gentleman right there.

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:54.550
AUDIENCE: So this is obviously
a very comprehensive book,

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:57.970
but is there anything that
didn't quite make the cut

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:00.529
that you each have a personal--

00:46:00.529 --> 00:46:02.320
KYLE NEWMAN: There was
thousands of images.

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:05.330
I'll say this is a
curated collection.

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:07.030
Like we were the
board of the museum

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:10.240
and we had to meet and discuss
what we were going to include.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.080
There is so much that was
on the cutting room floor.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.640
But that was the beauty of it.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.127
We had to just say not just
what was the prettiest,

00:46:18.127 --> 00:46:19.960
because sometimes you
take the ugliest piece

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.070
and you show it big.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.830
It was what was the most
disruptive, transformative--

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:25.280
what had people never seen?

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.160
Like page 40 is
the big eye that's

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.230
the precursor to the
beholder, and it's actually

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:30.938
more like a rope or
rooted to the ground.

00:46:30.938 --> 00:46:34.330
And it clearly says on the
side in a handwritten note,

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:36.970
"don't use, no."

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:37.954
That's in the book.

00:46:37.954 --> 00:46:39.370
So we wanted to
have room for that

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:42.202
and not just all the pretty art.

00:46:42.202 --> 00:46:44.410
AUDIENCE: You talked a little
bit about the open game

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:46.890
license and that contribution.

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.900
Kinda how the community grew.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:53.800
I was curious if you had any
opinions about the future

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:57.580
forward-looking-- since they
shifted off the OGL for Fourth

00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:58.690
Edition onward--

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:01.240
whether it's constricting
the community

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:05.022
or if it's controlling the brand
to keep it more consistent.

00:47:05.022 --> 00:47:06.730
JON PETERSON: There's
Adventurers League.

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:08.313
There's a variety
of ways that they're

00:47:08.313 --> 00:47:10.845
inviting the community to
participate and publish and be

00:47:10.845 --> 00:47:11.470
a part of the--

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:14.065
KYLE NEWMAN: DriveThru
RPG lets you self-publish.

00:47:14.065 --> 00:47:15.940
JON PETERSON: They
effectively put out an SRD

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.710
for Fifth Edition as
well, that you can just

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:19.410
download if you just
want the basic rules.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:20.785
I think that's
what they call it.

00:47:20.785 --> 00:47:23.950
So I think they have made
precisely the same style

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:24.460
of outreach.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:27.670
It just isn't licensed
quite the same way

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:28.762
that that was originally.

00:47:28.762 --> 00:47:30.970
There's a lot of complexity
around the different ways

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:33.090
that they choose to license
it, but it seems like people

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:34.840
really like the
opportunities they're

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.635
being given to contribute to the
brand under the rubric of Fifth

00:47:37.635 --> 00:47:38.540
Ed now.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:39.850
MICHAEL WITWER: Sage, can we
have three more questions?

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:40.558
Is that too much?

00:47:40.558 --> 00:47:42.479
SAGE: I think we
can do that, sure.

00:47:42.479 --> 00:47:43.520
MICHAEL WITWER: You, sir.

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.100
AUDIENCE: You brought
up heavy metal

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.766
briefly during the
Satanic Panic and how

00:47:46.766 --> 00:47:48.310
that correlated with all of it.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:51.400
However, I actually went
through a panel hosted

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.245
by Adam Koebel, who is
Sage's own [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:55.245 --> 00:47:57.370
and Luke [INAUDIBLE],, who
talked about the history

00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:00.259
of heavy metal with respect
to the origins of those brands

00:48:00.259 --> 00:48:02.050
and didn't actually
find much history there

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:03.640
amongst the actual creators.

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.860
However, yet it's
still clearly fused,

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.680
at least in [INAUDIBLE] in
the '90s, like "D&amp;D" and metal

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.170
100% of the time, all the time.

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:14.120
When you're going through
this whole history,

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:17.160
did you find a lot with
the more modern artists,

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.504
some of the artists
[INAUDIBLE] et cetera,

00:48:20.504 --> 00:48:24.440
who were really largely part
of both of these communities

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.476
and how much things have
interweaved over the years?

00:48:27.476 --> 00:48:29.350
JON PETERSON: Luke
actually reached out to me

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:31.570
before that panel, I
remember, and was asking me

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.389
if I could substantiate-- you've
got to see these to get it.

00:48:34.389 --> 00:48:36.430
MICHAEL WITWER: This is
kind of an example of how

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:38.430
metal and "D&amp;D" have coalesced.

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:40.180
And this is of
course the brainchild

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.460
of Joe Manganiello, who
does these shirts called

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:42.970
Death Saves.

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:44.180
You've probably all
seen them on Colbert.

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.429
KYLE NEWMAN: "D&amp;D" streetwear.

00:48:45.429 --> 00:48:47.980
You got some nice "Gamma
World" logo up there.

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:49.140
JON PETERSON: So you want to
rethink if you want a t-shirt?

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.750
SAM WITWER: Yeah, how
do you feel about it?

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:51.610
JON PETERSON: Pretty good.

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:53.359
MICHAEL WITWER: But I
mean, to your point,

00:48:53.359 --> 00:48:55.810
yeah, certainly these were
peanut butter and jelly

00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:56.410
somehow.

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:57.951
JON PETERSON: What's
the name the guy

00:48:57.951 --> 00:48:58.951
who did the Kiss covers?

00:48:58.951 --> 00:48:59.909
MICHAEL WITWER: Oh yes.

00:48:59.909 --> 00:49:00.470
Ken Kelly.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:02.011
We have this great
panel in the book.

00:49:02.011 --> 00:49:05.394
It's a painting that
is from an LJN box art

00:49:05.394 --> 00:49:06.310
from some of the toys.

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.510
KYLE NEWMAN: He
also did Micronauts.

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:08.140
MICHAEL WITWER:
That was provided

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:10.764
by a wonderful collector who was
hugely helpful in this project

00:49:10.764 --> 00:49:12.850
named Billy Galaxy in Portland.

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:15.220
And he had the original
painting of this LJN box art.

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.740
It was by Ken Kelly, who had
been hired by LJN to do it.

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.840
Ken Kelly was the same
guy who did "Love Gun."

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.120
The "Love Gun" cover for Kiss.

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.880
So these things really were
kind of the same community

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:27.430
of people that were involved
in it, who were doing the art.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:29.020
They were creating the visuals.

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.120
And they all kind
of went together.

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.703
KYLE NEWMAN: But it
wasn't internally.

00:49:31.703 --> 00:49:33.790
It wasn't like TSR at
the time was doing that.

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:35.560
I think it was
something that happened

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.509
at home and in your bedroom.

00:49:37.509 --> 00:49:39.550
People were starting to
put it like peanut butter

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:40.060
and chocolate together.

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:41.768
SAM WITWER: Yeah,
these were chess pieces

00:49:41.768 --> 00:49:46.060
that were placed on the board
by Satan himself to sort of--

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:46.669
There you go.

00:49:46.669 --> 00:49:49.210
MICHAEL WITWER: I think we have
two more before they kill us.

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.990
So you, sir, right there.

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:52.390
Yeah, with the beard.

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:53.862
No-- yes, you.

00:49:53.862 --> 00:49:55.750
JON PETERSON: You do
have a beard, sir.

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:57.250
AUDIENCE: In "Magic--
the Gathering"

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.624
there was a push
in the late '90s

00:49:58.624 --> 00:50:00.790
to make the game more
like, this is for boys,

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:03.370
and we're going to take all
that art we did in early '90s

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:04.540
with all the women
in it, and now it's

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.706
all going to be chain mail
bikinis from here on out.

00:50:06.706 --> 00:50:08.900
Was there a similar reaction
sort of phase in "D&amp;D?"

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:10.530
Where they pushed
against, sort of,

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:13.240
and then swung
back the other way?

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.060
JON PETERSON: I think when
Wizards acquired TSR and did

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.760
Third Edition, there
was a very decided push

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.389
to be more inclusive and
to show figures like--

00:50:21.389 --> 00:50:22.930
they had these iconic
characters they

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:24.280
used to represent the classes.

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:28.660
The monk class was represented
by Ember, who is female--

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:30.070
a woman of color.

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:32.350
I think they really made
a big push around it then

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:35.410
and they also made a push to
try to make armor look more

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:37.707
like it would look
in-universe if it were real.

00:50:37.707 --> 00:50:39.790
Which was kind of a reaction
against the more high

00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:42.630
fantasy-ish art of the 1980s.

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:45.340
I think since then they've been
pretty good about this stuff,

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:45.840
right?

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.280
I mean certainly Fifth.

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.570
These people have
absolutely no patience.

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:51.029
People like Mike
Morales, who you

00:50:51.029 --> 00:50:52.570
see in one of the
leads on Fifth now,

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:54.985
has no patience for anyone
who's trying to exclude anyone

00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:55.610
from this game.

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:57.400
MICHAEL WITWER:
Absolutely right.

00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:58.240
One more question.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.560
JON PETERSON: One more thing.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.780
Their figure is now
that 40% of players

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.041
are women now, by the way.

00:51:04.041 --> 00:51:05.790
MICHAEL WITWER: Yes,
all the way the back.

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:07.340
You, sir.

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:09.180
AUDIENCE: As "D&amp;D"
has evolved it's

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:12.850
been through a lot of
different incarnations of it

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:15.810
with different feels, for
whatever reason, right,

00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:17.720
as it was trying to
chase the market.

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.560
What I'm wondering
is which of you have,

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.120
among these different
incarnations

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.390
of "D&amp;D," its art and
the rules and whatever--

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:27.280
do you have one that
is your favorite?

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.530
That you want to mention
and talk a little bit about,

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:31.150
or just say something
about which one

00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:32.120
of its different eras--

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.370
MICHAEL WITWER: Which edition?

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:34.210
Or which piece of art?

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:34.690
I'm sorry.

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:36.273
AUDIENCE: Which of
the different eras.

00:51:36.273 --> 00:51:41.090
Because some have like a more,
you know, bikini art versus--

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:45.010
I just want to hear about which
era of the "D&amp;D" art or rules

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:47.110
or game is your favorite?

00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:48.760
SAM WITWER: Sort of
the Erol Otus era.

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.009
MICHAEL WITWER: Oh, Erol Otus.

00:51:50.009 --> 00:51:52.450
KYLE NEWMAN: Yeah,
we love his art.

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:56.080
JON PETERSON: We just had him
with us at Games of Berkeley.

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.730
MICHAEL WITWER: Just
a couple days ago.

00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:58.830
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:51:58.830 --> 00:51:59.831
That's about circa 1980.

00:51:59.831 --> 00:52:01.538
SAM WITWER: Do you
know who Erol Otus is?

00:52:01.538 --> 00:52:03.240
Do you know the art
we're talking about?

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:08.290
OK, so his art was
extremely colorful.

00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:10.960
Like it looked like
something out of a--

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.690
KYLE NEWMAN: It was exciting
new colors and shapes

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:15.060
that weren't as traditional.

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:19.467
I think he's like the El
Greco of "D&amp;D" fantasy art.

00:52:19.467 --> 00:52:20.300
He's pretty awesome.

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.050
MICHAEL WITWER: You can see his
shot from "Deities &amp; Demigods."

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:24.360
The first printing.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.860
If anyone knows the
Moldvay box set,

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:27.234
he was the one
that did the cover

00:52:27.234 --> 00:52:28.810
of this particular iconic piece.

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:31.240
No one does art like him.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.059
He was unique.

00:52:32.059 --> 00:52:33.600
KYLE NEWMAN: They
weren't putting him

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.740
in a box saying you have
to draw this or do that.

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:37.150
He was unhinged.

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:38.530
They just let him be him.

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:41.071
I think that's what's beautiful
about "Dungeons and Dragons,"

00:52:41.071 --> 00:52:42.520
it's like a catch-all.

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:44.920
It's not like "Lord of the
Rings" where it has one feel.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:47.027
It's a quirky catch-all
where anything goes.

00:52:47.027 --> 00:52:48.610
I think that speaks
to the game, which

00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:50.710
is you bring your
imagination, your group

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:53.590
can do it any way you
want at any rating system,

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:56.380
and you can take even
our structured product

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.900
and go off on a tangent
and make it your own.

00:52:58.900 --> 00:52:59.980
That's the beauty of it.

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.271
SAM WITWER: People like Erol
Otus definitely encouraged

00:53:02.271 --> 00:53:05.530
that, because there was a sort
of brutal edge to his artwork,

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:09.070
while at the same
time whimsy and humor.

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:10.720
The main player
characters always

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.450
looked like a bunch of wackos.

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:13.924
Just really weird.

00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:16.090
If you look in the book and
see any of Erol's stuff,

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:18.291
or if you look it up on Google.

00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:20.540
KYLE NEWMAN: I like AD&amp;D. I
wasn't allowed to play it,

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:21.680
but my older brothers played it.

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:24.050
So I lingered like Elliott
while they played and looked

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:25.800
through the book and
learned how to draw.

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.220
And I love Fifth
Edition because it's

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:31.420
taken all these things I
remember and repackaged them

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:32.422
in a fun way.

00:53:32.422 --> 00:53:34.130
I've gotten to play
with some new people.

00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:35.640
I've gotten my wife to try it.

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.270
So it's pretty cool that
at this point in the game

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:41.150
Fifth is doing something
that the other ones haven't,

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:42.680
and it's really connecting.

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:45.179
I think that's special, and I'm
having the best time playing

00:53:45.179 --> 00:53:46.957
Fifth Edition right now.

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:49.040
MICHAEL WITWER: So with
that we are going to wrap.

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:50.660
I want to give a couple
of thank yous if we can.

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:51.770
If you just indulge
us for a moment.

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:53.800
Firstly, thank you to
Google for having us here.

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:58.376
We are thrilled to be here.

00:53:58.376 --> 00:53:59.750
Again, knowing
that this may well

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:01.744
be broadcast on Google
Talks, we really

00:54:01.744 --> 00:54:04.160
want to thank first all the
artists and the designers that

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.690
made this game
happen over 45 years.

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:07.700
This is not our story.

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:08.540
This is their story.

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.410
KYLE NEWMAN: This
is their yearbook.

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:10.730
MICHAEL WITWER: This
is their yearbook.

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:11.330
That's good.

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:12.450
SAM WITWER: Did you
just come up with that?

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:13.520
That was amazing.

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.090
MICHAEL WITWER: Write that down.

00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:15.220
KYLE NEWMAN: That's
why I'm here.

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:16.205
Every once in a while.

00:54:16.205 --> 00:54:16.940
MICHAEL WITWER: WotC--

00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:19.189
Wizards of the Coast-- has
been an incredible partner.

00:54:19.189 --> 00:54:21.920
The access they gave us,
the support, the ability

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.190
to go and publish this book?

00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:24.362
That was them.

00:54:24.362 --> 00:54:26.570
In tandem with Penguin Random
House, Ten Speed Press,

00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:28.986
our publisher, they deserve
an incredible amount of credit

00:54:28.986 --> 00:54:31.522
for really letting us
do what we wanted to do.

00:54:31.522 --> 00:54:33.980
I can tell you, this book was
supposed to be a lot slimmer,

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.563
and we really said we can't tell
this story unless you give us

00:54:36.563 --> 00:54:37.910
450 pages oversized.

00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:39.354
Let's do it.

00:54:39.354 --> 00:54:41.020
Then a couple of
individual collectors--

00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:43.130
again, I really encourage you
