00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:12.190
Why Do Men's Bikes Have a Horizontal Crossbar
and Women's Usually Don't?

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.910
It would seem that having a slanted crossbar
like on women’s bikes would make much more

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.000
sense for men’s bikes, decreasing the chance
of racking the guy if he slips off the pedals

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or the like.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.779
However, there is actually a really good reason
to have a horizontal crossbar on a bike; namely,

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.259
the horizontal crossbar ends up adding quite
a bit of strength to the frame of the bike.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.550
This was particularly important in some of
the early bikes, which were often made of

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.780
significantly weaker materials than modern
day frames, occasionally even being made of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.780
wood.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.220
The problem with this horizontal crossbar
was that women all used to wear dresses.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.770
So when a woman wanted to get on a bike, she’d
have to lift her leg over the bike frame’s

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.859
crossbar, which was quite scandalous for the
time as it often exposed quite a bit of leg

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.269
and possibly some underwear under her dress.

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.930
Thus, bike makers began making bike models
just for women that slanted the top crossbar

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.290
down so that the women could mount and dismount
the bikes without lifting their legs very

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.290
high.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.460
Modifying the crossbar like that significantly
weakened the frames of the bicycles, but this

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.760
was considered acceptable as it wasn’t very
lady like for women to ride their bikes as

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.290
roughly as some men anyways.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.330
This tradition has continued to this day,
even though most women don’t go around riding

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.060
bikes in dresses or skirts anymore.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.700
For the most part, on modern bikes, this weakening
of the frame by slanting the crossbar isn’t

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.500
significant enough to cause any concern for
bikes, even on rough terrain, given modern

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.540
materials that the frames are made of.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.290
Indeed, many BMX bikes for men are now designed
with the slanted crossbar to reduce the chance

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.950
of injury while doing tricks.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.201
However, among higher end bikes made for women,
this tradition of not having a horizontal

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:55.220
crossbar is starting to go away, even though
the added strength from a horizontal crossbar

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:06.030
isn’t typically necessary anymore, particularly
with carbon fiber frames.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.560
On these high end bikes, the differences between
the men’s and the women’s bikes now tends

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.830
to be reflected in the design by accounting
for shorter torsos and arms on most women;

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:34.440
modified hip placement; modified seat design;
and the like.
