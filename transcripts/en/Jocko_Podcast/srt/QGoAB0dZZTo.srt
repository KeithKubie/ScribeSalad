1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,400
This is Jocko podcast number
one 11 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,560
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,630
So yeah,

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,460
almost two years ago I had a guy on the
podcast by the name of Jody medic and we

5
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:27,551
ended up talking for so long that we
actually turned one podcast into two

6
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:32,300
podcasts. The first one was a review
of his book, which had just come out.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,140
It was called unflinching,
the making of a Canadian sniper,

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,100
and then we did a second
podcast right after that.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,400
That was just us talking and discussing
some more of the details of where he had

10
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,910
his life had gone since
that book had come out.

11
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,930
And those podcasts are number 24 and
number 25 and if you haven't listened to

12
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:01,010
those yet, just stop here, go
back and listen to them first.

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,420
And in those podcasts we discussed Jodi's
early life and how he ended up in the

14
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:12,851
military and his sniper training in his
two deployments to Afghanistan and the

15
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:16,490
events of January 11th,

16
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,490
2007 when during an operation he hit a
landmine and lost both of his legs below

17
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:30,700
the knee.
And from there.

18
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,160
Yeah,

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,860
he struggled to stay alive,

20
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,970
but he did and he made it back to Canada
where he then struggled to recover from

21
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,790
his injuries and he struggled
to adapt to his new life.

22
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,650
And along the way he struggled to overcome
addiction to pain medications that

23
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,620
had been given to them so freely.

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,900
But he did overcome those struggles and
made a new life and wrote a book and got

25
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:06,840
elected as a member of the city
council of the city of Ottawa.

26
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,200
Yeah.

27
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,430
And he continued to raise his
young girls and take care of them.

28
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:17,200
And by all accounts, we're talking
about a model citizen. In fact,

29
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,310
I'd go so far as to say
a model human being,

30
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,293
but

31
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,740
things aren't always as they appear.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And although Jodie look to be doing
great by any measure behind that public

33
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:39,480
persona,

34
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,990
the

35
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,580
struggle continued.

36
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,800
And I saw a glimpse of it when Jody
came down to be on the podcast.

37
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:54,801
I first noticed it when I
made reservations for Jody
at a hotel by my house and

38
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,760
I just got a nice little hotel nearby
me so I could pick them up easy.

39
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,230
And didn't think much of it.

40
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,300
I gave him the hotel information than a
couple of days later he called me up and

41
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:10,990
said he needed to transfer to a different
hotel because the hotel that I had

42
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:15,991
made reservations at didn't
have handicap accessible rooms.

43
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,950
And of course I felt like a like a jerk,

44
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,530
but at the same time I didn't
really understand because
I'd seen all these video

45
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:31,531
clips of Jody walking around and and
actually running around and he'd gotten

46
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,000
second place in this TV show called the
amazing race where he's doing all these

47
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:41,770
different challenges and I saw pictures
of him and videos of him running and

48
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:45,850
driving cars and even riding motorcycles,

49
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,320
driving motorcycles.

50
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,800
So clearly there was something that I
didn't understand that was going on and

51
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,860
maybe he wasn't as mobile
as I thought he was.

52
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,020
And when I went to pick
them up at the airport,

53
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:00,640
I wasn't really sure what to expect.

54
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,490
I didn't know if he's going
to be in a wheelchair.

55
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:05,230
I didn't know if he's going
to need help getting around.

56
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:09,130
And as I drove through the pickup area
looking for me, he wasn't hard to spot.

57
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,250
He was standing at the curb,
big beasts s over six feet tall.

58
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,490
And he walked over to the car with
confidence when we really zero indication

59
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:25,000
that he was walking on two
prosthetic legs and you know,

60
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:28,150
so we recorded the podcast after
afternoon and it took forever.

61
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,220
It was like five hours or six hours.

62
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:32,500
And then we got done with that
and we went and grabbed steak

63
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,810
and the next day, you know, he said, hey
can, can you give me a tour of San Diego?

64
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,330
Can you show me, you know,
some of the sites around here.

65
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,330
And so we did that and
I took him down to the,

66
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,210
the buds compound where
the seal training is.

67
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:49,750
And then I took him to the seal
teams and we went to the USS Midway,

68
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:53,410
the aircraft carrier museum,
and we were walking all over that.

69
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:56,320
And then he wanted to go down to
the beach town where I live in.

70
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:59,080
So we walked around
there and it was awesome.

71
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,180
And he was enjoying it being down from
the cold, frozen Tundra of Canada.

72
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,810
And as we got towards the end of the day,
you know,

73
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:10,650
Jodie started walking a
little bit slower and,

74
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,700
and I noticed on his face he
had a look of discomfort, right?

75
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:18,790
That he was, you could see he was
trying not to really reveal it,

76
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,250
but it was there. And then
finally said, you know, can we,

77
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,340
can we sit down for a minute?
These things start to hurt after a while.

78
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,760
And he's pointing down at his legs and
said, of course. Yeah, no problem, man.

79
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,290
So we sat down for a little while and he
recovered a little bit and then we got

80
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,260
up and we walked a little bit
more. And then he said, hey man,

81
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,860
can we sit down again? And I
said, yeah, man, of course.

82
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,910
So then we sat down for a little while
and then when he got up again, he said,

83
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:45,610
hey, can we just head back to your house
and maybe sit or sit around there for a

84
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,640
little while? These things are starting
to hurt pretty good right now. You know,

85
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:53,030
the skin wears off and it
starts to bleed and you know,

86
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,980
it's doesn't feel good man. And
I said, yeah brother, no problem.

87
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,480
So we headed back to my house and,

88
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,600
and we went up on the deck and we
sat there and just kinda hung out,

89
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,413
talked and

90
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,460
yeah.

91
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,350
And it became clear to me

92
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,910
something I did know from my other
friends that have been wounded badly,

93
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,400
that it's a lot harder than it looks.

94
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:22,530
Yeah.

95
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,300
It isn't the bionic man
and it's hard to adapt.

96
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,930
The intermingling of human flesh with
mechanical parts is not a natural thing.

97
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:37,080
It's not a smooth thing.
It's a battle

98
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,200
and it's a battle that's hard for
us to perceive from the outside.

99
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,680
But it's a battle that takes
place every minute of every day,

100
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:50,540
usually behind the scenes

101
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,320
privately
because

102
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,500
yeah,

103
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,070
as soldiers,
as marines,

104
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,610
these men learn to suffer and
bear their burdens silently

105
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,370
and without complaints.

106
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,090
And it was here at my house that
Jody explained to me why he needed a

107
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,730
handicapped accessible room. He
said, yeah, you don't matter.

108
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,620
I get home and I gotta take my legs off
and then I got to crawl to the bathroom

109
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:26,070
to use the toilet and I got a crawl to
get in the shower and I need those little

110
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,480
handles to pull myself up.

111
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,990
Yeah,
it's a struggle.

112
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,900
And [inaudible]

113
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,440
Jodi suffered and struggled again,
not outwardly,

114
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,910
not in public,

115
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,323
but alone.

116
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,980
He pressed on and we kept in touch over
the last couple of years, you know,

117
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:56,130
text messages and what's
going on and did you see this?

118
00:07:56,131 --> 00:08:01,131
And I sent you that and I watched as
Jodi continued on his journey of his life

119
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,450
and he was awesome to watch and he
got back to Canada and he's started to

120
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:10,410
podcast and he continued with his
political career and he wrote another

121
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:13,230
bestselling book called Everyday Heroes.

122
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,463
And

123
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,470
you know, from a distance everything
appeared to be going great.

124
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,493
But again,

125
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,960
things aren't always what they seem.

126
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:33,120
And behind all that,
Jody was

127
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:38,130
struggling
and yeah,

128
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,480
a couple months ago I got a text,

129
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,450
a simple text from Jodi and it read,

130
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:52,010
Bro,
the enemy out flanked me.

131
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,303
Now

132
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,230
in military terms,

133
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,800
that's about as bad as it gets. It means
the enemy has attacked your weakness.

134
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,660
It means the enemy has the upper hand.

135
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:10,380
It means you have lost
momentum in the battle,

136
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,740
and it means you could
very likely be overrun.

137
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,250
And being overrun means that
you're going to get killed.

138
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,280
And I could see from that text
that Jody was at war again,

139
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:29,990
not on the battlefield,
but in his life.

140
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,740
But Jody's a soldier.

141
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,410
Yeah.

142
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,100
And Jody fought back because
that's what soldiers do.

143
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,170
Then a little while later,

144
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:51,171
he sent another text that read on finally
turning into the ambush and starting

145
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:52,740
to fight through.

146
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,040
He attacked the problems.

147
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,230
He's back on track again back on the path

148
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,650
and came down to visit me.

149
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,190
And after talking to him a little bit
and discussing what he's been through,

150
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,920
I asked him if he would come on
and talk about it. So other people,

151
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,000
not, not just veterans, but
everyone that struggles,

152
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,420
all of us can learn from what he's
been through and what he's overcome.

153
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,150
So here we are once again.
Then with that,

154
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,980
Jodi Jacko,
welcome back to the podcast.

155
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,450
Wow, you had me, uh, and me and I'll
get in the fields there for a minute.

156
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,380
Thank you. Yeah man, it's, um,
thank you for that. You work,

157
00:10:54,381 --> 00:10:56,350
you were talking to me last night about,

158
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,210
about the texts that you had sent me.
Yeah.

159
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,280
And you said, you know, there were some,

160
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,850
there was some heavy texts I sent
you in and I was like, really?

161
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,090
And you said yeah, and I go,
did I pick up on it? And you
were like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

162
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,500
I thought you did. Well No, when I
read through my clearly did. Yeah.

163
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,190
And just do the responses and the
conversation we were having, but that,

164
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,720
that first text that you sent
me, yeah. I was like, Damn.

165
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,780
And,

166
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,780
and then I of course I went and
I went back on your social media,

167
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:34,620
looked at what have been going through
and you dropped off social media. Yeah.

168
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,260
And so you had basically reached
out and said, you know, hey,

169
00:11:38,261 --> 00:11:41,920
brother needs lean,
a little air support over on this side.

170
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,480
And so what happened from,

171
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,840
I mean just you leave here from,
from the last podcast two years ago,

172
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,100
you go back to Canada. Yeah. You Start
Your podcast. That was great. Yeah. Great

173
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,770
podcast. Oh yeah. Uh, got, you know,

174
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,350
a lot of people were listening to it and
getting a lot of feedback from people.

175
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:03,550
A lot of people hit me like, yeah, Jody's
podcast is great. So you're doing that,

176
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,280
you're working on the other book that
just came, when did that book come out?

177
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,020
October last October. Last October. Hit
the shelves bestseller running. Boom.

178
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,880
Yeah. So when I was already, I was
already hadn't done a podcast since me.

179
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,460
Um, actually, uh, last podcast I did,
it was with some guys from cans off.

180
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,190
Uh,
they started their own company,

181
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,420
tactical beaver if is like supposed to
springboard us into the next podcast.

182
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:32,840
We had some other guys coming in and
some other cans off entrepreneurs and we

183
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:37,030
are starting to kind of shift to
supporting veterans in their business

184
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:40,990
opportunity cause it seems like we're
all becoming entrepreneurs are the guys

185
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:42,940
that will employ our friends
and things like that.

186
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,660
And that's what I want to focus on is
how do we help the troops after they go

187
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:49,900
through what I went through
because I had zero plan.

188
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,290
Nobody had really dealt with this
stuff in Canada since Korea. Really.

189
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,770
We had some guys in Bosnia in that,
but the, the chain of command and the,

190
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,250
and the government frankly lied about
the fact that Canadian forces were in

191
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:03,640
combat, uh, in, in the,
in the former Yugoslavia.

192
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,190
That all aside, the point is we
were, we were trying to lead by,

193
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:13,960
I always trying to lead by example.
Luke, my, my echo, uh, Luke was,

194
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:18,760
uh, was trying to help out
and he was doing his best
and he was seeing the wheels

195
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:23,380
fall off the Jody Mitic machine and you
kept trying to like put them back on and

196
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:27,070
gun tape them. And, um, just do
as best though because him and I,

197
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:28,450
it's not like we're like close buds.

198
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,670
Like we're not like besties
since we were kids or anything.

199
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:35,671
So he's trying to keep his distance and
keep that like Jody Mitic podcast is

200
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:39,520
Jody medics. And I'm, I'm
Luke. I could tell too.

201
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:42,400
And I kept telling my friends that,
you know, that we're close as well.

202
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:47,170
Like I can tell he really wants to help,
but he's not sure. And then one day, um,

203
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,770
so I had a kind of a perfect storm,

204
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,950
so I moved out of my house in
October last October 16 and you know,

205
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:00,160
I'll just get that out of the way.

206
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,810
That was the beginning really of things
going south. And it's not cause, uh,

207
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,790
my ex and I are enemies by any stretch.
We're still friends.

208
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:14,350
We have two amazing kids. We had amazing
life. It's just sometimes, uh, you know,

209
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,820
sometimes you'd units don't Mesh Right.
And that's just kinda the way it went.

210
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,300
You know, we both have different visions
of our future and, and things like that.

211
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:25,500
So,
but then you kind of got to put on the,

212
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,600
the face for the public, you know. Um,

213
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,230
and so I stopped going
to the gym at that time.

214
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:35,380
I stopped seeing my therapist just cause
he's on the other end of town and I

215
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:38,870
can't be bothered right now. I've
got too many other things to do. Um,

216
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,810
and even when I was here, like you
said, you saw, I forgot about that walk.

217
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,360
And you're right, I remember sitting
on the wall at visit. It, is it,

218
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,400
is it Ocean Beach Ob.
Yep.

219
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,880
And I love like the Air Americana,
that's what we call in Cam Americana.

220
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:58,610
History is amazing to me
in the California beach.

221
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,470
Each beach has its own history in the,
in the group I loved.

222
00:15:02,471 --> 00:15:05,360
And you're talking about and I'm looking
around at all these buildings built in

223
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:09,980
the forties, 50s, 60s. And um, and in
my mind I drove route 66 to get here.

224
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,640
Like I love the history of this,
of this country so much.

225
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:18,641
And then I was on route 66 until I saw
the pony express trail is to your left.

226
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,460
And I went,
okay.

227
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,900
Turned left and I would follow the pony
express trail down into Arizona. Um,

228
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,170
but even then, uh, like you said,

229
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:30,890
like the pain was really hitting me and
I'm terrified of the pills because of

230
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,970
becoming addicted. And so, okay,

231
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:39,140
what do you do for pain if
you're not taking pills? And
I'm not a weed guy. Like,

232
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:41,840
I know I talk about it and not everything,
but I don't know anything about it.

233
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,760
But I know a lot about Crown Royal,

234
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:48,020
my Jack Daniels and a and captain
Morgan and I are good buddies.

235
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,551
And uh,

236
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:54,551
so I found I went from having a
beer after work or in my case,

237
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,580
uh, I like cider. I know I get made
fun of for it, but booze, booze, boys.

238
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:02,570
So you know what I'm saying? Um, oh,

239
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:07,340
I can't wait to have that side or after
work or that, that a rum and coke, uh,

240
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,240
when I get to the get to the pub with
the, with the guys, two guys. Now,

241
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:14,150
the guys that you're talking about now
are your fellow people you're working

242
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:16,370
with in the government.
A lot of them are politicians,

243
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:18,350
but also just some of the boys that,

244
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,610
cause Ottawa is like the biggest
military posting and Canada,

245
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,460
but also all the cans offer in that area.

246
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:30,470
So I got buddies that are coming
back from deployment in Iraq, uh,

247
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,780
on and off. And they come in
for their home for a month.

248
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:36,580
They're gone for three home for three,
gone for a month. So whenever you get a,

249
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,970
you hear from them,
you run out.

250
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,330
And of course they just got back from
the sandbox so they wouldn't have a beer

251
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:46,060
or two. And you know, and I'm like okay,
because it might like I'm going going,

252
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,880
going, I get up at six,
put on my suit, go to work,

253
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,870
come home and I'm in pain the whole time.

254
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,030
And from the pain you saw two October,

255
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,110
2016 and then come spring
2017 now it's just,

256
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,830
it's reached points where I wouldn't,

257
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,860
but I was thinking about drinking
before work and it's not,

258
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:14,480
cause I'm like stressed out and I was
stressed out but is more like, oh man,

259
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:18,890
like my, cause I, there is a deadening
of the, of the pain for sure.

260
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,800
And it's like, well Uber Ride is only 12
bucks to get to work and this and that.

261
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:22,880
And,

262
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,880
or my staff drives right by my place to
go so I could have her pick me up and at

263
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,350
discipline kept me from
doing that for awhile.

264
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:36,130
And then I had a trip to Oregon to go
shooting at the Leopold shooting academy.

265
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:41,240
They opened there. That was
great. But before I left,

266
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,270
I think I took my legs off for a
solid three to four weeks and as in my

267
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:50,670
wheelchair and that kind of sucked
because my car isn't set up to drive,

268
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,060
you know, my place I got, which
is like a block from the house.

269
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:58,290
So it's not that far from the kids in,
in the acts and everything. So you know,

270
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,020
I'm seeing them a lot any way and stuff,
but

271
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,160
nothing else in my life is
set up to live without legs.

272
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:09,780
Even like where I keep my coffee in
the kitchen is for when I'm on my legs.

273
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,520
So I'm in my, I'm in my wheelchair
the first day and I'm like, oh,

274
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,820
I don't really make coffee when I'm in
my wheelchair. Do I? Oh, tongs, right.

275
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:22,260
So I get tongs out of the cupboard, reach
off, I can do this, whatever. Adapt.

276
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:25,110
And it's like, okay, time
to go to work. Oh shoot.

277
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,290
And then I did call my staff and she
picked me up already. Took an Uber,

278
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,560
but then I went to Oregon and that
was a week, like it was about seven,

279
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:36,750
eight, nine days, nine
days on my leg, straight,

280
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,730
excruciating pain the whole time or
whatever was happening in the doctor.

281
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,450
I finally went back and she said that
like my skin had reached a point where it

282
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:49,380
couldn't regenerate fast enough.
So we've just breaking down.

283
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,670
And then the way I like to wear my
legs was being rejected by the body.

284
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:57,000
So I like to wear with,
it gets called a suction as suction holds.

285
00:18:57,001 --> 00:19:00,600
So it's like a vacuum until you
release it with a, with a valve.

286
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:06,120
And my body was like, well we're done with
this. But I'm like, wow, no, me, no lake,

287
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,620
leg, leg sleeve, legs, sleeve takeaway,
mobility, Mino once. And so my,

288
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:14,970
you know that if you're going to be dumb,
you better be tough. Thing comes in,

289
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:18,060
you gotta be telling. Yeah.
And you know, and, and, and,

290
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,690
and I didn't have it and I'm not living
with, with a medic anymore, right.

291
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,230
So she's not there to be like,
hey, stupid, but yourself,

292
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,990
like take the legs off and
let someone take care of you.

293
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,500
My mom actually moved to Ottawa December
16 and I'm completely ignoring her

294
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,560
advice because you know what, mom, mom's
always going to try and look after you,

295
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:41,100
but come on mom, I'm
40 years old Jews. Um,

296
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,320
and I was pushing away against a lot of
the same things I would then in the same

297
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,370
day would tell people like, hey man, you
gotta let people look after you. You know,

298
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:52,350
cause I get texts, I've
probably same as you, right?

299
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:57,351
I get texts bbms I get dms on Instagram
and Twitter and Facebook on my fan page

300
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,680
and then the podcast page, uh, hey, what's
going on? Like, I need help with this.

301
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:05,340
And I'd be like,
don't be afraid to go get help.

302
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:08,220
Don't be afraid to reach out those around
you. Love you. Let them look after.

303
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,690
And I'm completely ignoring any of
this advice myself cause I'm like,

304
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,590
I kicked oxycotton when I was 22,
I think.

305
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:20,460
And on deployment I stopped smoking
just because I wanted to. Uh,

306
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,280
I drink on the weekend, I don't
need to drink. But meanwhile,

307
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:26,460
while I'm sitting there checking
these messages while having a drink,

308
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,630
I know and I look back and I'm like,
I'm so stupid.

309
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:32,430
But I guess sometimes
you got to go through,

310
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,940
there's a reason why you go
back to basics. Is there,

311
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,200
is there like in your mind
when you're going through that,

312
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:41,270
are you thinking yourself,
I could stop if I wanted to do every day?

313
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,940
Just don't want to, yeah, I don't, it's
not getting in the way of anything.

314
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,760
I'm still functional. I'm still
at work. I'm still doing. To me,

315
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:51,880
my main job was what I was elected to do.
Right.

316
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:53,830
And I have a four year in my mind it's a,
it's a,

317
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:55,750
it's Kinda like being in the
army where you're on four year,

318
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,180
four year commitments,
right? So I'm like, well,

319
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:01,690
right now I have a four year commitment.
I'm not drinking at work.

320
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,360
I mean at some point I did
start drinking at work,

321
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:09,190
but in politics and business as you know,
like sometimes after lunch,

322
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,360
instead of going back to the office,
you have a beer and you're still working,

323
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,840
you're still talking about issues,
you're still getting,

324
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:20,220
like I used to get a lot of advice
from, I shouldn't say used to. I,

325
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,560
I get a lot of advice from the other more
experienced politicians because that's

326
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:24,394
what you do.

327
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,210
And we all would have a beer or a cider
and then they'd go back to the office

328
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,280
and I'd stay and keep on the
phone and now I have one more,

329
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,110
you know? And then another group of
guys would come in from like, oh, hey,

330
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,440
you're still here. Like, you know, so
and so's already back at City Hall.

331
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,760
What kind of,
what kind of drunk are you happy?

332
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,710
I'm a happy go lucky I get a little
loud, but it's not like I'm like, Hey,

333
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:58,360
what's going on? Better? Um, but you know,

334
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:03,130
anyway, well I know it to your ass. No,
I'm actually just asking. You could,

335
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:05,920
you could still call on the phone and
be like, hey buddy, blah blah. You know,

336
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:08,260
some people when they
drink they get angry.

337
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,670
Some people I know they slur their speech
really bad and so you've got all these

338
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:13,504
different,

339
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,640
you drams when I drink I basically
just like am more of Jocko.

340
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,970
Yeah. I'm more Jody. Yeah. For the
most part I do slur, but even I could,

341
00:22:23,971 --> 00:22:26,140
I'd be like, ah, I'm
slurring my words. Okay,

342
00:22:26,141 --> 00:22:29,890
well I'll drink some water for a minute
and then I'll get it back or I'll have a

343
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:34,840
coffee. Um, and I'm good. I'm not,
I'm normally, and even when I'm like,

344
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,130
I rarely get fall over
drunk. Right. If ever,

345
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:42,610
but just let me rewind. I know that's
a long answer to a short question,

346
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:47,611
but so may I get back from
Oregon and I'm just like dying.

347
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,410
And then I had to go
real quick down to ebony.

348
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:54,130
Cause of part of my job with the city
is I'm the sports commissioner and I'm

349
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:59,131
desperately trying to get the crossfit
games to bring the eastern regional games

350
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:03,100
to Ottawa because I just think that'd be
awesome to have an Ottawa. We, you know,

351
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:06,330
we've got the UFC in Ottawa.
I was a part of that.

352
00:23:06,331 --> 00:23:08,440
And so I was really proud and
I said when I got the job,

353
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:11,380
I said I want to do two things in the
four years at the UFC and get the crossfit

354
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:14,110
games. So I'm still trying
to do the crossfit games.

355
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:16,660
I got less than a year to do it, but
I think we can do it. But anyway,

356
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:21,490
that's a lot of people that participate
in crossfit that listen to this podcast

357
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:25,420
maybe. Yeah, I've met a lot of them.
And you know what? The crossfit guys,

358
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:29,050
a crafty and Albany city itself, they
don't want to lose the crossfit games.

359
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:32,590
So they knew I was in town and
they started to sweeten the deal,

360
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:34,600
if you know what I mean.
And the crossfit games go well,

361
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:38,710
auto was offering us this. Albany, what
you got? Hey, it's business. I get it.

362
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:40,840
But you know what, I'm coming back. Um,

363
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:46,220
I got back from that trip that was about
a four day trip from Ottawa to Albany

364
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:49,430
and back.
And when I was here with you guys,

365
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:52,790
I didn't bring a wheelchair began.
That's what I meant by I crawl around,

366
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,950
which is why I could stay at your house.

367
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:58,250
But I don't want your kids seeing
a grown man crawl to the bathroom.

368
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,460
And it's not because I'm above crawling,
it's just,

369
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:04,250
it's one of those personal
things in my own space.

370
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,640
I'm not above it and around
like loved ones. Okay.

371
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,230
So that's why you want your own
space and even a and stuff like that.

372
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:14,880
So even when I visit my dad,
I get a hotel room, you know,

373
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,370
my dad loves me and I'm not,

374
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,940
but it's also my space or if I want
to crawl around naked, I can write.

375
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,150
And so anyway, that's why
that, so then I get back and,

376
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:31,100
um, I take the legs off and I'd just,
I can't put them back on. I look,

377
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:33,800
I would like, I don't know, I
said it on your show last time,

378
00:24:33,801 --> 00:24:37,340
but I have mornings where I look at
my prosthetics. I'm like, fuck, sorry,

379
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,290
sorry for swearing.
I know we were allowed,

380
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:42,620
but I'm trying to be a little bit bit
of a remand Deco, you know what I mean?

381
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,371
You're going to be an echo.

382
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:47,500
I don't want you having to edit
out things that I say. Okay. So,

383
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,900
um,
I took them off and I just looked,

384
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:53,930
I just threw him across the
room and I said I can't deal.

385
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:57,740
I have a wound in my left stumped.
I did I show it to you? No,

386
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:02,270
it's been there since April of 14

387
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,440
and it happened.
I remember the second it happened.

388
00:25:06,441 --> 00:25:11,441
My brother and I were doing an amazing
race thing post show in Alberta and we

389
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:16,490
did a little like, you know, go, Hey
Jodi and Corey from amazing raise woo.

390
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:19,190
We got a few bucks for it.
And we gave a speech to a,

391
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,700
some kind of convention and then I was
walking down the airport to the plane and

392
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:28,380
I felt something go on my foot.
It's,

393
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,690
and it's like having a hotspot when
you're on a rug merge or whatever except I

394
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:37,150
can't really shift what part of my
foot and walking on, I just can,

395
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,870
and it went from a little
tiny like breaking the skin
to something the size and

396
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:43,820
Canada. We have two knees, it's $2.

397
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,410
I know you guys still use the dollar bill
like a 50 cent piece and then back now

398
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:50,720
it's down to like a pinprick of scab.

399
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,520
But that's what are we talking now
where uh, almost four years. Right.

400
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,320
And I had to mitigate that the whole time
and it was painful and I got a couple

401
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:02,900
of, I got to infections
in the four years from it,

402
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,210
but that's where I was like that's it.
I need to let myself heal.

403
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:13,211
I need to like let my body
regenerate except now from that.

404
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:20,650
And it took me until fall late fall to
realize that when I did that I might as

405
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:26,030
well have stepped on another landmine.
And I went through,

406
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,880
it took me to late fall
to go cause I was like,

407
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,170
cause that's when things really went
south because you basically not even

408
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:37,070
basically because you lost your legs
again. Yeah, I lost my legs again.

409
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:42,440
Except because truly when you were down
here, even though you're in pain bro,

410
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:44,040
we were doing, you
know, we were walking up

411
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,570
and downstairs we were,
we're doing whatever.

412
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,120
We walked all over that aircraft carrier
over that aircraft carrier up and

413
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:50,970
downstairs we walked all over the seal
compound. We walked through, you know, we,

414
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,640
I loved it.

415
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,380
I went out on the beach when we walked
out on the beach where you guys torture

416
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:58,920
the, the recruits, trains
every step. I was like,

417
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,530
cause you've got to dig through the sand.

418
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,580
But to me that's hollowed ground burrow.
Like when you took me to the grinder,

419
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:08,940
I remember standing there like
this is the grinder. I'm Katie,

420
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:12,300
I'm Canadian army and but there's
some things where you go, you just,

421
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:13,590
you feel right.

422
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:17,280
If I brought you up to the recruit
spot and for basic and Canadian army,

423
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:20,840
you'd be, you'd feel, you get that feeling
like this is where soldiers are born.

424
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,160
There's been a lot of those little,

425
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:25,700
they have the little fins on
the grinder stuff like what,

426
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:30,470
what Jody's talking about is where are
they trained seals that first day in the

427
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,950
movies, right? Yeah, it's,
it's, and they have little fins,

428
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,820
so like little dive fins. There's
little 40 you know the marine corps,

429
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:42,000
they have boots. Yeah. Yeah.
He in the army, they have
boots painted on the ground.

430
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,190
They paint them on the ground. Well
in the ad, the grinder at buds,

431
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,130
they have little swim fins to
little tiny swim fins are painting.

432
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,750
There's a couple of hundred of them.
And that's when you get out there for PTU.

433
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:55,200
Stand onto your little set us when tents
and then as the days go by there's less

434
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:58,740
and less. He is great.
And then, and I've read,

435
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:03,150
I've read if I've read less
than 24 navy seal books from,

436
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,280
from the beginning to today. Right. Yours
included. I'd be surprised. I've read,

437
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,910
I've read the, uh, the old blurps
right. I've read about those guys.

438
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:14,640
I've read about the original rangers.
I've read about the Canadian,

439
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:18,630
I'm a American special service for us.
Actually when I was with rob,

440
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:22,800
my buddy from the green berets down in
Yuma, I was wearing a ranger up tee shirt.

441
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,680
That's like a special service
for us. Tribute, you know,

442
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:28,740
to me like that's our history.
That's the history of, of, of,

443
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,860
of soft and Canada in the u
s and, and then, you know,

444
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:34,130
in Buds and new Greenbury or navy seals.

445
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,990
The green berets are kind of created by
Kennedy at the same, see, look at me.

446
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:41,100
I'm a fucking nerd when it comes to
this stuff. So to me, you know, the, uh,

447
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,750
I haven't been there,

448
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,020
but I've heard about it because a lot
of my friends that had been there,

449
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,160
the Aussies, they have a parade ground,
like in the middle of their compound.

450
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:54,120
Have you been there? No, I've never
been to Australia. They're the,

451
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:59,130
the only time they use this parade ground
apparently is at memorial services for

452
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:02,580
their men. Yeah. And I believe
that no one walks on it.

453
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,610
It's just in the middle of their compound.
No one walks on.

454
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,500
In Canada we have a similar thing where
if you're on the parade square and it's

455
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:12,930
not parade,
like you're going on extra duty.

456
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,380
Like if the sergeant major catches
you on his parade square a,

457
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:19,920
you better be have a broom in your
hand or you better be on parade.

458
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,530
And if you're not like, cause
it's, cause it's usually like,

459
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,280
oh if I go from here to there,
it's right across the print screen,

460
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:27,660
but it's the short route and
it's like one of those tests,

461
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:32,090
right then the new guys in the
hallways of most units, the unit, uh,

462
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,050
emblem is in the floor and there's one
of those sergeants that just has nothing

463
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:40,010
better to do but to stand there
and watch and see who steps on the,

464
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,430
and even if you're like family

465
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,290
of one of the troops, oh my hair by
drip bro. And you get the knife hand,

466
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,570
it's awesome.
But when I was here,

467
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:52,960
I wasn't gonna not go see the
grinder cause my fucking legs hurt.

468
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,530
Don't be a pussy. And I, I'll be honest,
that first night after you dropped me off,

469
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,040
I had a couple of drinks
to ease the ease the day.

470
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:04,460
Like when we left your porch and you draw
me back at the, at the hotel. Yeah. Um,

471
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,680
I, I went and I had a few drinks at
the hotel bar, you know, and I, and I,

472
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,810
I was actually toying with talking to
you about this stuff back then because it

473
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:18,240
was bugging me then and I'm like, okay,
what do I do? Who do I talk to? Tacos?

474
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,180
A kind of guy echoed is the kind of
energy you want to be around. And like,

475
00:30:22,181 --> 00:30:23,620
you know,
and that's one of this part of this,

476
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:27,730
this trip for the last 10 days I've
been on is just kind of like refining.

477
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,530
So a lot of my Canadian and American
friends that have kept me on,

478
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,120
on the straight and narrow
or as I mentioned, you can
did for Jody Mitic and um,

479
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,970
you tell bro, it's a constant
wrestling match, right?

480
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,530
The little evil and the good angel,

481
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:43,390
except a lot of times they high
five each other. And Go, okay,

482
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:48,220
let's see what happens.
And um, and yeah, man,

483
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,560
so when the legs came off,
so no car.

484
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,510
So now my mommy Uber or my staff
or my ex are driving me around,

485
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:00,940
all happy to do it all. Not like holding
it against me, but at the same time, man,

486
00:31:00,941 --> 00:31:05,050
I, I'm out of sandwich meat. Hmm, okay,

487
00:31:05,051 --> 00:31:08,430
now I need to go to the store.
Hey Mommy can,

488
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,180
can you drive my car and take me
to the store? And then that's,

489
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,290
I kind of turned my hat backwards and
kind of like, you know, tried to like,

490
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,110
you know,
cowboy up and do it.

491
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,240
But I took me again until then.
My daughter turned nine,

492
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:27,250
September 19th,
I think it was her,

493
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,260
I missed a lot of her birthday from being
hung over and she was at this awesome

494
00:31:32,261 --> 00:31:36,520
trampoline place and I'm in a wheelchair
and I remember getting there and being

495
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:39,910
like, all I want to do right now
is jump on trampolines with my,

496
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,730
with my little girl and I can't,
a and B,

497
00:31:42,731 --> 00:31:46,150
I'm an hour and a half late for her party.
Uh,

498
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,380
because I decided to have too many
drinks last night and that was when I was

499
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:55,120
like, what the fuck is really wrong with
me? Because I couldn't really get it.

500
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,370
And then what is,
what is the

501
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:02,080
escalation? Right? So you were
down here with me. Yeah. You know,

502
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:05,920
we worked hard. We cause it's, it
is, you know, do you want a podcast?

503
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,430
Like when we do sit there and talk to
each other about intense stuff for five

504
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:11,830
hours, then we went and
ate, we stayed up late.

505
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,730
We get up early the next day we go do all
the stuff that we did and you get done.

506
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,990
You have a couple of drinks,
right?

507
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:22,330
What does that escalation look like over
time? Where you're like, you know what?

508
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,330
You're not even saying like, oh, I don't
know if I should have drinks. You're like,

509
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,350
hey, as soon as Jocko gets in his car,
I'm getting some drinks right now.

510
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,730
It's something that you recognized.
Is it something that you just,

511
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,080
you just said to yourself,
you know what?

512
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:37,180
This is gonna make me feel better right
now and I've got to go to God. God,

513
00:32:37,181 --> 00:32:40,190
I don't remember exactly
what month I was here. Do you

514
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,070
like, I don't remember. No, I know it
was a warm month and ah, and Canada leg.

515
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,940
It was cool.
But it was spring or fall.

516
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,960
Well we started in December.
It was 24 podcasts in that

517
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,300
December of what?

518
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,560
2015 so must've been
spring Fort 15, 16. Yes.

519
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:02,090
16 so I,
cause I remember in Canada wasn't cold,

520
00:33:02,091 --> 00:33:04,250
but like we were wearing still
wearing down vests with food,

521
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:07,820
with hoodies and stuff. Uh, when I
was doing my quick podcast for I left.

522
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:11,240
So at that time I was,
it was just,

523
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:14,120
the pain was just kinda like have a
couple of drinks before bed. Right.

524
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:17,270
But even that was bugging me and
that's what I mean like when I was,

525
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,010
but then like if,
if,

526
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:25,000
if it had been this spring where we
had met, yeah, I would've been like,

527
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,430
like this the whole time.
And like as soon as Jocko has gone,

528
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,010
I might've just like last night when we
had dinner, I might have just been like,

529
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,270
fuck it,
I'm having drinks.

530
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,700
I don't care if Jack was here because
being around someone like you,

531
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,220
like I used to be the guy who could,
I don't need to drink.

532
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:43,040
I'd go months and be like, oh yeah,
I haven't had a drink. Like you know,

533
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,440
I'll have a drink and,

534
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,900
and you don't drink and you haven't drank
since you were like in your twenties I

535
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:48,670
think you said.
No,

536
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,700
I haven't drank since I retired. Oh, okay.

537
00:33:51,701 --> 00:33:54,220
So last time I felt
the effects of alcohol,

538
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,970
which I felt quite strongly that the
basically the day I retired. Yeah,

539
00:33:57,971 --> 00:33:59,260
you're the day I retired,

540
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,760
which was October 1st,
2010 you know,

541
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:07,090
of course me and the boys were,
went out, we had a bunch of drinks.

542
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,780
I woke up in the morning cause I still
wake up early and I woke up in the

543
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,710
morning and I was like,
well yeah,

544
00:34:11,711 --> 00:34:14,110
that's done because I got
other stuff I got to do now.

545
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,500
And basically when I no longer had
we'll call them friends to drink with.

546
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:24,550
Yeah. Then I was like, yeah, well I'm done
with that. And I just ever since then,

547
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,220
just haven't really,
I've had,

548
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,790
and another thing is sometimes people
think I'm like offended if they have

549
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:33,880
drinks or whatever and I'm here, I'm not,
you know, I remember actually I went,

550
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:38,860
I was on the first podcast I was on was
Tim Ferriss and we got done with the

551
00:34:38,861 --> 00:34:40,750
podcast and he,
you know,

552
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:44,020
we went out to grab some food because I
was staying the night at his house and

553
00:34:44,021 --> 00:34:47,740
we went out and we got some food,
we've got some steak. And he's like,

554
00:34:47,741 --> 00:34:51,030
do you mind if I have a glass of wine with
this? And I was like, Bro, I don't care.

555
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,883
You.
Yeah,

556
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:56,140
yeah. Like a reformed alcoholic. You
just decided one day you're like,

557
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:58,900
my dad one day he was like, Eh,
this gets in the way of work.

558
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,770
Yeah. That's Kinda, that's kind of my
attitude isn't really. Yeah. I mean,

559
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:06,070
if I want to drink something that tastes
good, then I'll drink chocolate milk,

560
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,280
which I love the taste of. Yeah.
The Jocko white tea. Right. I mean,

561
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,850
that stuff makes me feel
good and I just, um, yeah.

562
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:14,740
And people ask me about a lot and I need,

563
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:16,930
it's something that I need to address in
the podcast because the other thing is

564
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,600
just, I might as well dive into this
a little bit right at this moment,

565
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:23,860
but when I was a kid,
I was into hardcore music I was into,

566
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,460
and the type of music that I listened
to was against drinking and against like

567
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:34,300
it was, yeah, yeah. We're
talking straight edge.

568
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:37,950
We're talking minor threat.
Yeah. Really? Yes, absolutely.

569
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,930
And so it was almost, and I was,
again, I was never really, I'm very,

570
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:47,550
I'm very,
I'm not a real good follower.

571
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,410
So any time there's some kind of a
movement going on, I'm always like saying,

572
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:56,310
wait, why is this move and going, why am
I always questioned? I don't just jump in.

573
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,240
I'm hard to get on board
with something like that.

574
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,830
So it was around, I wasn't
like, so there's a, there's
a thing with straight edge.

575
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,310
Okay. So this, this thing was
called straight edge. It started in,

576
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,920
I'd say you'd see the,
the epicenter of it was in Washington DC.

577
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,390
The first band really to coined
the term was minor threat,

578
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,390
which is a punk band,
a heartburn if I've heard of them,

579
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:23,280
I assumed they were partiers. No, not at
all. No. And so one of the things that,

580
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,340
one of the symbols of straight
edge was, uh, you know,

581
00:36:26,341 --> 00:36:29,460
when you go to a bar or when kids
used to go to bars for a show for a,

582
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,900
for a music show,

583
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,830
if they were too young to drink once when
the bounce all looked at their ID card,

584
00:36:34,831 --> 00:36:36,840
that they'd put a big x on their hands.

585
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:41,910
And so the straight edge I'm symbol
was they'd put the x's on their hands,

586
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,230
meaning look,
I don't drink.

587
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,210
And it's actually funny cause I took my
two of my kids to see the white buffalo

588
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:53,130
the other night in San Diego and it
was awesome. And, but when they came,

589
00:36:53,131 --> 00:36:57,960
when they show their ids, they got the x's
on their hands. And I was like, Oh yeah,

590
00:36:57,961 --> 00:36:58,794
it always is.

591
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,540
So what the straight edge kids would
do is they would draw big x's on their

592
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:07,010
hands, meaning, hey look, I'm
not drinking. So there was that.

593
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:11,410
And then that of course morphed
into like a gang. And there was no,

594
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,160
by the time I was, uh,
you know, middle teenager,

595
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:19,161
there was hardcore gangs that would
assault people that drank and would get

596
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:25,350
crazy and vinyls guys and together with
the Juggalos. Yeah. So it just, so,

597
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:30,090
so, so when I was a kid I was
okay and I wasn't like a full on,

598
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,210
I wasn't drawing. I don't think, I know
I never like had x's on my story, but I,

599
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:38,490
but I understood philosophically,
right. What was being said, right.

600
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:43,110
Which was, look, I want to
win. Right. I'm hardcore,

601
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,990
I want to be stronger,
I want to be aware,

602
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,530
I want to be alert and drinking and
doing drugs doesn't give me any of those

603
00:37:49,531 --> 00:37:53,280
things. So at that, at that,
so sorry, but even at that age,

604
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:57,300
you understood the fuel that goes into
the machine affects the performance. Yes.

605
00:37:57,301 --> 00:38:02,250
He, I didn't get that as a young man.
Yes. So here I am. And, and it was,

606
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,600
you know, I was disciplined and you
know, I had a before the seals. Oh yeah.

607
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,700
I had a band,
a hardcore band.

608
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:13,140
The name of my hardcore
band was rage of discipline.

609
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,200
That was the name of my hardcore
band. That was af. That's what,

610
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,370
that's what Bronson's children.

611
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:20,250
Cause my first band when I was like
13 was called Bronson's children.

612
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,390
But then as I got older I
got more hardcore than it
became a rage of discipline.

613
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:26,970
There was also about nine, it's
brunch. These children Bronson,

614
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,140
she bronzes Charlesville he didn't drink,
I don't even know.

615
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:35,110
Oh [inaudible] name.
We do know Charles Bronson was a bad ass.

616
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:35,944
And when I was a kid

617
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,910
I thought Charles Bronson
was the man because he's the
baddest man on the planet.

618
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,180
He was a tail gunner in a,
you know,

619
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,350
bomber in World War II. And he grew
up in the mines when he was a kid,

620
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:50,050
when he was 10 years old or 11 years old,
he was working in the mines.

621
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,370
And until he was old enough that
he used to have to wear a dress,

622
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:56,890
cause he didn't have parents that
have money to buy him clothes.

623
00:38:56,891 --> 00:38:59,170
So you had to wear one of his
sister's dresses down to the mind.

624
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,050
So then he went to World War II
and then he became, and you know,

625
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,680
he's just had great movies and he always
played this stoic character that was on

626
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:07,660
emotional. And so I was, you know, hey,

627
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:11,470
when I grew up I to be Charles Bronson
of course. So then we had a band,

628
00:39:11,471 --> 00:39:14,440
it was called Bronson children.
Well, as we got more hardcore,

629
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,860
eventually that name morphed
into rage of discipline,

630
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:21,400
of which Elgin James was the guitarist,
who's another buddy of mine.

631
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,270
That echo is met,

632
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:25,870
who will come on the podcast at some
point and tell his crazy life story,

633
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,730
which I'm a big part of in the
beginning until I joined the military.

634
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,000
The military Jocko stories.
Yeah.

635
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:39,010
So I'll be tuning into that one long
story. Then I joined the military. Yeah.

636
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,770
So when I joined the military,
what do I want to be? I want to be,

637
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,660
I want to be a seal.
I want to be a frog man.

638
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,090
I want to be the best frogman I can be.
I show up at a seal team.

639
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,380
Guess what frogman do frogman drink.
Okay, cool. I didn't know that.

640
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,740
Now that I know that,
give me a,

641
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,250
give me a shot of Jagermeister
cause I'm ready to rock and roll.

642
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,370
And that was sort of how you proved
yourself and that's what we did.

643
00:39:57,371 --> 00:40:00,460
And I was immature and dumb and,

644
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,990
and despite everything I just said
about like, Hey, I'm a little bit,

645
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,320
I'm hesitant to really follow,
well now I'm in the seal teams,

646
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:11,920
this is my dream job and this is what
I want to do. Maybe you don't buy in,

647
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,960
you're not in. Yeah.
And it's like it's not,

648
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:17,190
I don't even know if it's it just
like that's the way it is. Yeah.

649
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,220
My first drink I was 17 right
after I finished basic training,

650
00:40:21,221 --> 00:40:24,790
I show up at the regimen and they're
like, all right, what are you drinking?

651
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,570
And I'm like,

652
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:30,140
cause my family is full of alcoholics
on both sides and it's nothing against

653
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:31,420
them. Like, you know, Grandpa was,

654
00:40:31,421 --> 00:40:35,320
my other grandpa was and Grandpa's Grandpa
was and you know, one of my uncles,

655
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,920
nothing. Okay. They might hear this but
we all know what you do. Okay. Right.

656
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:42,970
So not a big deal, but um,
and dad, but dad was one of
those guys, he was like, well,

657
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:46,060
that just doesn't affect me. And me
personally, like you as a kid, I'm like,

658
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,470
I don't really see the interest.

659
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,890
Like what I gotta throw up on
myself and whatever, whatever.

660
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,730
And I was one of those kids that say no
to drugs, actually worked on, you know,

661
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:56,800
like now I'm older and I'm like,
man,

662
00:40:56,801 --> 00:41:01,450
I should've been smoking weed since I was
like 12 and shit. But, um, I still don't,

663
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:04,570
but I did. I just like, you
see the effects on people.
Like when I was a Bouncer,

664
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:07,390
I'm like, yeah, like the guy who
smoked weed, we're really mellow.

665
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:10,360
And the guy that had coke and drank, like
they were the ones who are the problem.

666
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,630
But, um, when I get to the regimen,

667
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,200
the first night of parade is done and
they're like, Hey, what are you drinking?

668
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,320
And I'm like, well, I'm 17.
They're like, this is an army
mess. Like it's okay, just,

669
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,920
we'll worry. We're all going to keep
an eye. Like you're welcome to look.

670
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,990
I'm not trying to tell the world
like, Hey, underage people drink,

671
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:27,280
but hey Andrades people drink.

672
00:41:27,281 --> 00:41:30,370
But it's an environment full of people
that are there to look out for each other.

673
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:34,460
Anyway, so I had a couple of drinks and
I'm like, okay, this is the way it is.

674
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,020
And same thing. Yeah. Work Monday to
Friday, you work your ass off, you,

675
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:42,810
you go hard as you can. Like you
go hard in the paint, right, your,

676
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:47,720
your tires or are stripped at the
end of the day. Friday rolls around.

677
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:52,670
Okay. We don't see it. 8:00 AM
Monday morning boys and uh, you know,

678
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,120
if you're going to drink, don't
drive. But if you do drink driver,

679
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,000
that's what you got told when you, when
you're dismissed for the weekend. Right?

680
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,960
Yeah. And so basically have
fun, blow off the steam,

681
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:06,530
don't hurt anybody and take care of
each other basically what you're told.

682
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,670
So the seal teams definitely is a culture.

683
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,730
It was even more when I first got in
because now you're talking about the old

684
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:17,600
Vietnam guys and it wasn't a war
going on and it was just, hey,

685
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:20,300
what are you going to do if
there's no war going on and you're,

686
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,450
you're a frog man, what are you
gonna do? Well, we drank and I'm not,

687
00:42:24,451 --> 00:42:27,960
I'm going to look down on, I mean, we had
a great time. It was funded. We, you know,

688
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,350
it was, it was fun. It was
what you did was what we did.

689
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,660
And I'm not even trying to say
anything negative about it,

690
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,010
but that's what it was. And
unfortunately, there's a lot of guys,

691
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:38,923
I shouldn't even say a lot.

692
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:43,990
There's a decent number of guys
that don't do well with alcohol man.

693
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:46,760
Yeah. And it ruins, their lives are
ruins their careers. And that sucks.

694
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:51,140
It sucks to see. I never really had
any issues. I drank when I drank.

695
00:42:51,141 --> 00:42:54,860
It never interfered with my one here
at the time in any way. And you know,

696
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:59,510
that was it. It wasn't a huge deal. And I
mean, of course, I mean when I'm talking,

697
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,710
when I was 1920 2122,
I mean we drank all lot.

698
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,630
We drank all lots of weird how your
body legs, you're at that age. Yeah.

699
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:12,860
And you got up the next morning, the
next morning PT like it was nothing we,

700
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:17,750
and that's what we did. Um, but then like
I said, and even now, you know, when I,

701
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:22,780
when I go out and hang out with some of
my old buddies or actually it's more not

702
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:26,050
want to just go and hang out with
some of my old buddies, you know,

703
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,610
we probably don't even, you
know, maybe have a beer.

704
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,940
But when I go out and see the young guys,
the young guys are getting after it,

705
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:35,330
I don't look down on them at all. I
think, you know, fine getting after it.

706
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,280
I've found, I've found when I hung out
with my buddies that are still serving,

707
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,700
you're not in the gig anymore.
You're not doing the job.

708
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:45,110
So you're a little out of shape.
Your,

709
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:48,170
your drills are a little rusty
maybe or whatever. I find on,

710
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:51,620
I'm around guys my age
that are still operational.

711
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,690
I can't keep up with them drinking or
because it's part of the training is part

712
00:43:56,691 --> 00:44:00,260
of the culture. I've fallen off.
And even like before I was in,

713
00:44:00,261 --> 00:44:04,220
I didn't really drink. And then when
it got out I stopped drinking as much,

714
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,900
you know, and it's not like, again guys,

715
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:10,040
we're not Jocko and aren't saying the
military were all functional alcoholics.

716
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,460
What we're saying is it's just what we do.
And you know,

717
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,290
and remember the job that
we volunteer to do, we,

718
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:20,930
we volunteered or run into gunfire, uh,
you know, for our countries and for fun,

719
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,000
like let's face it,
a lot of us think it's fun.

720
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,680
I thought it was the best time of my life,

721
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:29,870
but he's still got a blow off that steam
and booze is really good at lubricating

722
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:33,840
the, the, you know, the, the, the,
the machinery of blowing off steam.

723
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,330
So when I, when I started drinking
for pain though, as where I realized,

724
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,060
cause even the pills bro, like,
let's go back to my pills.

725
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,030
I didn't know I was addicted to
the pills until I watched uh,

726
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,970
intervention and Billy was addicted
to Oxycontin. I was, like, I said,

727
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:52,830
I said this on the show last time.
Oxycotton that sounds familiar.

728
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,930
And I pick up the pill bottle that's next
to me and I go, Oh, I'm on Oxycontin.

729
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,630
And then they say the doses,
he takes her this, I'm like,

730
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:04,560
I'm on three times the dose he's on.
And I'm like, that's when I went,

731
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,750
I can get addicted to pills I get,

732
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:11,751
it was so foreign to my brain that
doctors doctor meet me and pain doctor go

733
00:45:11,971 --> 00:45:15,720
here, soldier would take this and I
go, okay. And I take it no more pain.

734
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,320
Go fight more. You know?
That's, that's good.

735
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:24,060
Going back to the alcohol
thing is one more thing for me.

736
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,180
I was just about to say
this was, I said, hey, look,

737
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:30,630
went back in the day before the war
started, there was like nothing else.

738
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:33,930
Like yeah, there's nothing better to
do. Who's going to get drunk? Now,

739
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,010
the younger guys,

740
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:40,010
they're smarter than we were and
they have a reason to be doing,

741
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,260
they have a reason to be there and they
have a reason not to drink. They're like,

742
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,750
hey bro, I'm going to go fight a war.
You know, like I want to be in shape,

743
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:48,810
I want to be better, I want to be
faster. I don't want to get in a fight.

744
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:51,630
I don't want to get a Dui.
So they're smarter than they are.

745
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:56,690
And that part of the culture is
slowly changing and I think it's good.

746
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:01,800
I think it's awesome. I think it's awesome
and I hope it continues. Um, again,

747
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:02,520
I think it's,

748
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,720
it got overemphasized when I first
came in over emphasized in the 90s.

749
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:10,320
It was like, but it was a way because we
weren't fighting anyone else. Exactly.

750
00:46:10,321 --> 00:46:14,010
So you drank to be a man and then you
fight each other and have another platoon

751
00:46:14,011 --> 00:46:14,761
shows up.
You fight.

752
00:46:14,761 --> 00:46:18,230
Those fucking guys have another squad
shows up or another company. Alright.

753
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,790
Band together. I know we were just
fighting, but we'll get back to that.

754
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,860
But there's a wreck.
It was an armored regimen over there.

755
00:46:22,861 --> 00:46:24,270
We're going to go fuck those guys.
Others,

756
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,300
there's something that I've been
thinking about on this subject,

757
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:31,800
which is in the military, right?
Yeah. And even in life as a human,

758
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:37,020
you want to prove that you're ready
to sacrifice yourself for the cause.

759
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:38,850
I'm,
I'm willing to make the sacrifice.

760
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:44,210
Well in a bazaar and kind of
unfortunate way proving to Jody that,

761
00:46:45,901 --> 00:46:50,370
you know what, watch this, Jodi, I'm going
to drink 16 show. You're not firewall.

762
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:52,260
You're nice. I'll,
you're not, I don't care.

763
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:55,950
I would have the parts bitch and then
we'd go, oh, then I prove light up.

764
00:46:55,951 --> 00:47:00,830
18 line up 18 army versus navy. Let's
go. That's how it's fuck away. It goes.

765
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,840
Echo, Echo. You played football. Yeah. You
were talking about that earlier about, uh,

766
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,200
are on the show.
I was listening to do.

767
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:10,470
You were taking a shit with no stalls
and you're saying, yeah, and football.

768
00:47:10,471 --> 00:47:13,440
We'd rip the doors off the stall and
that's how it, oh, well I don't care.

769
00:47:13,441 --> 00:47:16,650
Watch me. Shit. What's, what's
more aptly the word now?

770
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:22,080
What's more apt to happen now as a guy
to be like, hey, I can clean and jerk,

771
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:26,580
you know, two 85 what can you get?
And, and, and so the guys are,

772
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,370
they're focused on something that fit
is focused. They're blown out. Shoulders

773
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:34,750
and knees. Yeah, we'll talk
about that later. But so,
but I get what you're saying.

774
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:35,980
Cause in the Canadian Forces,

775
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:39,820
we hadn't had a war since
Korea and we had the,

776
00:47:39,821 --> 00:47:44,800
what combat we had as I was coming in was
being downplayed. We had guys take it,

777
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:47,920
we had a guy, and this is
history, this is proven.

778
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,530
He took an RPG round through his chest,

779
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,750
like just killed him
obviously and everything.

780
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:56,350
But his family is told he was killed in
a rollover because our government was

781
00:47:56,351 --> 00:48:00,340
like, they're supposed to be peacekeeping
wasn't in the former Yugoslavia.

782
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:04,210
And I know a guy who took a sniper round
through the chest as a tank commander.

783
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:06,400
He was told to shut the fuck up,

784
00:48:06,401 --> 00:48:09,520
take your pension and your benefits
got full benefits. Like it didn't,

785
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,270
they didn't downplay what you've got
if you're wounded. They just said,

786
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:14,730
don't you dare tell anybody.
We had a,

787
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:18,940
we had a unit come home
after like fighting some of
the most intense combat in

788
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:22,750
Europe since World War Two when the
Croats are trying to go through a service

789
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,610
area and ethnically cleanse.

790
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,440
And this is in the 90s when the Canadian
like rep for peacekeeping really got,

791
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,450
which was known since Egypt,

792
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:36,220
but came back because our units and the
French Foreign Legion units where the

793
00:48:36,221 --> 00:48:37,001
only units that were like,

794
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:40,180
fuck you are not moving if you're
going to f ethnic cleanse through here,

795
00:48:40,181 --> 00:48:40,901
you're going through us.

796
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:45,310
Whereas all the other UN units ran away
and they were in four or five days of

797
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:48,190
like intense combat, bunch of
wounded, know killed thankfully,

798
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,230
but the government and the,

799
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:53,440
and the and the chain of command where
like shut your fucking mouth, go home.

800
00:48:53,441 --> 00:48:55,900
Like nothing happened.
That's real. That's real bro.

801
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,960
Google made act pocket Canadian Forces.

802
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:03,730
And you'll read all about these dudes
who just like basically were like hanging

803
00:49:03,731 --> 00:49:06,430
out, drinking coffee, smoking
butts, and telling war stories that,

804
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:11,290
that never happened to be an in a war
and going, Holy Shit. A buddy of mine,

805
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,780
um,
he's gonna get mad at me.

806
00:49:13,781 --> 00:49:18,760
He put out a book called shadow keeper or
ghost keepers. I'll, I'll get the name,

807
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:22,450
sorry. And I'll, I'll, and he
was the first Canadian unit.

808
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:23,730
Him and his unit were the first Canadian.

809
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:27,760
It's into Bosnia and the shit they
saw and the things they went through.

810
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:30,610
It's a great book by the
way. It goes. Keepers. Um,

811
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:34,080
why would he be mad at you for talking
about it? I'm forgetting the name wrong.

812
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:39,670
Sorry about that. But the point is
that at that time he was told like,

813
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:43,420
you don't tell, we don't, we don't
Brag is what the line that was told.

814
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,950
But really the government
back home was like,

815
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,680
we didn't know this was going to happen.
Well,

816
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:53,080
you don't piece keep without busting
heads. Like there's a reason if you,

817
00:49:53,081 --> 00:49:56,520
if I want to go kill that
guy and you're in my way, um,

818
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:58,960
well guess what I'm going to do?
I'm going to try and go through,

819
00:49:58,961 --> 00:50:03,010
you write like this concept
of peacekeeping and you
know, it was like, you know,

820
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:05,560
like the guy with the Billy club. All
right. Okay. Everybody keep it down here.

821
00:50:05,561 --> 00:50:06,010
See like,

822
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:09,130
that's kind of what the politicians
thought because we were college kids

823
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,860
sometimes. Yeah. But even
then, every now and then, yes.

824
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:15,010
Smack one over the head with that
Billy club like, and I think,

825
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:19,330
and I remember my first tour in Kosovo,
even we trained for crowd control.

826
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,040
We trained for
a whole lot of things,

827
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:27,980
but then the final training
exercises when we all went, oh,

828
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,250
because the Russians rolled in and
took over the airport in Kosovo.

829
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,330
I don't know if you remember that.
Yeah.

830
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:37,670
And we did a live training
exercise to a joint, um,

831
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:41,510
uh, armored, a full combat team exercise,

832
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:45,230
like main battle tanks
firing. And like, I'd never,

833
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,670
my Dick was rock hard and you were a five.
We've got 500 rounds on each other.

834
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:53,090
We're just like bullets flying
everywhere and like, uh, like Ray,

835
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,150
the range control safety was like minimal,
right?

836
00:50:56,151 --> 00:51:00,470
Cause they're like trying to simulate
real combat. And then we got, but anyway,

837
00:51:00,471 --> 00:51:04,150
the point is that when you don't have
anything to point your soldiers at,

838
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,950
they turn on each other. And that's
what we were getting at earlier.

839
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:12,410
But to round out the whole, like what
soldiers board soldiers are a danger echo.

840
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:16,160
I think if you've been around a
group of active navy seals, I think,

841
00:51:16,161 --> 00:51:19,400
or maybe even army guys, like if they
got nothing else to fight though,

842
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:23,780
just fight each other like we used to
whenever we're waiting for a plane to go

843
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:28,040
on a trip like this upon my youngest,
like it would start off with, okay,

844
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:32,390
let's see, you can hit that pole
over there with a rock. Yeah. Right.

845
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,280
And then all of a sudden
it's like, okay, let's see.

846
00:51:34,281 --> 00:51:38,360
You can hit the light with the Rock and
then all of a sudden it's, hey, let's see,

847
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:42,710
you can hit that car tire with a rock.

848
00:51:42,711 --> 00:51:46,510
And pretty soon years hired, is it
whoever you bunch of idiots. Right.

849
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,270
And pretty soon you're either having
a rock fight, right, which is,

850
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:53,000
which is not smart because you're hocking
rocks the size of baseballs at each

851
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:57,330
other or whatever. Yeah, and
we were talking about wisdom,

852
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:02,390
the newer guys see how we did it. But they
have an enemy though. Yeah, absolutely.

853
00:52:02,391 --> 00:52:03,224
Like they have,

854
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:07,850
we have a perpetual enemy that is not
going away and so I see the guys that are

855
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:11,300
in my unit now, they come
in and they're like, okay,

856
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:14,690
what supplements are going to keep me at
my best? Zack? Like they read my book,

857
00:52:14,691 --> 00:52:16,880
they go, okay, so Jody, you'd
stopped drinking coffee.

858
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,910
How many days before you deployed?
I'd be like, well at least five days.

859
00:52:19,911 --> 00:52:23,030
So it's out of my system because when
I'm out there getting after the enemy,

860
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,320
I don't want to be having
a caffeine crash, but if I
need it, I want that piece.

861
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:30,140
Did you ever get that wake
up gum in your rats? No.

862
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:34,640
It's like four cups of coffee in one
or two cups of coffee and like when you

863
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:38,660
need it, like I would keep that
in my pocket till the very end.

864
00:52:38,661 --> 00:52:42,500
Like the Hilo might be coming to pick us
up and if I didn't take it, I was happy.

865
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:46,130
But sometimes, yeah, you take that in
the middle of a mission and you're like,

866
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:47,990
okay, I got two more days in me. Right.

867
00:52:47,991 --> 00:52:51,430
But the point is like they have
something to aim themselves at. Right.

868
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,130
Is at the beginning we didn't. But even
then, booze wasn't a big deal to me.

869
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,840
It was just what we did.
Like you said,

870
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:02,180
fast forward to this fall that would
just pass and I realize I'm crashing.

871
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,010
I felt like 52 or something.
You saw something. Oh you,

872
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,230
cause I kind of caught you off.

873
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,770
You were talking about seeing the
program where they show addicted people.

874
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:12,620
What's that program called?
Intervention interaction.

875
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,490
When I first got wounded in oh seven and
that's when I realized I was addicted

876
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:19,430
to the pills but not addicted.
Like I need a pill.

877
00:53:19,431 --> 00:53:22,670
It was like my body would just start
reacting and I would be like, oh,

878
00:53:22,671 --> 00:53:23,930
I'm itchy for some reason.

879
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:28,110
And then that's when I started easing off
and I never took a pill after father's

880
00:53:28,111 --> 00:53:31,200
Day 2011. Uh, but even
that you read the book,

881
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,830
I ended up buying pills from a
guy in an alley once and I went,

882
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:36,240
what the fuck is it like,

883
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,200
and the system is treating me like
an asshole because I want more pills.

884
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,480
And then they're like, yeah,
if you want more appeals,

885
00:53:42,481 --> 00:53:44,640
you've got to come to the hospital
everyday. You get your dose. I'm like,

886
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,080
I'm not a fucking junkie dog.

887
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:49,380
I just don't let the dose you're giving
me isn't enough to keep me from feeling

888
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:54,480
like shit and like, and then a mitigating
my stress with the pills. So maybe,

889
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,780
okay, so go to more therapy and that's
when I started rebuilding in 2011.

890
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:03,090
So come the fall. I'm still not
on my legs. I, this is 2011,

891
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,640
2011 is when I quit the pills.
Got It.

892
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:07,800
And that's why I thought
booze wouldn't be a problem.

893
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,240
Cigarettes aren't a problem. Boozes or
problem. You'd feel like problems. I mean,

894
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:14,220
you'd quit pills, whatever.
It was like, oh, whatever.

895
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,080
When the time comes for you to quit booze,
you'll just quit.

896
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,280
That's when I'm ready. I'll be done
with it. Got It. And, but what I, what,

897
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:25,230
what happened and if you're a politician,
the most important thing, federal, uh,

898
00:54:25,231 --> 00:54:27,480
state, uh, municipal.

899
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:31,470
So Canada state would be
provincial budget money.

900
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,980
Money is the big thing that everybody
worries about in private live and

901
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:39,610
everything else. So when are
we talking about right now?
Sorry, you're already bad.

902
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:43,200
You're behind on bouncing around a
little bit. I'm just saying in my mind,

903
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:48,230
2017 wasn't that big a deal as far as
the drinking because I'd kicked all these

904
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:54,660
other habits and I,
whether it's real or not,

905
00:54:54,661 --> 00:54:58,890
I had an army psychologist once tell me
I had an auntie addictive personality

906
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,890
because I guess like you,
like to me it's like, okay,

907
00:55:01,891 --> 00:55:03,570
well what's going to
help me function better?

908
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,840
What's going to get me to the
next day without too many issues?

909
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:08,030
And if I want to have a few drinks,

910
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,530
I'm gonna have a few drinks and I can
cause tomorrow morning I don't have to be

911
00:55:10,531 --> 00:55:12,900
anywhere until 9:00 AM anyway.
So whatever,

912
00:55:12,901 --> 00:55:14,430
if I'm a little hung
over when I get there,

913
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:18,840
I'll have a coffee and a glass of water
or Gatorade and an Advil. Not a big deal.

914
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,630
Fast forward to again,
my daughter's birthday last fall.

915
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,560
Oh daddy can't be there yet cause I'm
still hung over. Right. I got my car,

916
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:34,110
I and I, and it was when I realized
I'm going through, I was like,

917
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,950
I felt this before because I kept
asking myself, what the fuck?

918
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:41,460
Why do I keep screwing everything up?
And then the budget's process started.

919
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:44,040
That's where I was going with this.
And that's where I remembered.

920
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,970
I'm not cause your Jocko, you're not a
private citizen anymore. You know that,

921
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:52,020
right? What do you mean? Well, if
you fell off Instagram tomorrow,

922
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:54,240
there's a million people out
there. I'd probably be like, well,

923
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:58,680
where the fuck is Jocko?
And I was posting less.

924
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,250
I was being less upbeat and what I did
post the few last couple of podcasts,

925
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:07,170
even going back to the
spring on one of them,

926
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:10,830
we got loaded and we said it was for fun,
but I like,

927
00:56:10,831 --> 00:56:15,390
I needed a drink myself. Um, and uh,

928
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:20,130
I'm starting to miss budget and budget
is money. That's what everything runs on.

929
00:56:20,131 --> 00:56:22,500
The city of Ottawa has a three
and a half billion dollar budget.

930
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:28,230
Why isn't counselor Munich at the budget
meeting for the Community Protective

931
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:32,170
Services Committee, Community
Protective Services Committee. Oh,

932
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:35,380
he's not feeling well. His legs are
bugging him. Stuff like whatever.

933
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:39,610
My staff said, I'm tell it, they're asking
me what's going on boss. And I'm like,

934
00:56:39,611 --> 00:56:41,620
yeah, I just, I need
you to buy me some time.

935
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:45,070
But that's when the media and
the voter goes, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

936
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,820
We get it. You like to write
books and you like to do podcasts,

937
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:50,260
you'd like to shoot guns and you,

938
00:56:50,261 --> 00:56:52,690
you know you're a dude and we
and we accept you as who you are.

939
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:55,120
But our four year commitment,

940
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:58,870
the biggest part of that commitment is
making sure that money is spent properly

941
00:56:58,871 --> 00:57:02,830
and on the things that we want it spent
on and we elected you to be that voice.

942
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:08,430
Why aren't you at that
meeting and personal private
matters can only get you so

943
00:57:10,091 --> 00:57:13,420
far during like the most important
part of of your job, right?

944
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,010
While either go on medical leave or be
at the meeting is basically what I was

945
00:57:18,011 --> 00:57:22,750
told. Right. Get a doctor's note
or be here. And that's when uh,

946
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:27,010
I ended up doing that radio interview in
December when it really came to a head

947
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,820
and when I had to really admit
to myself like I'm border,

948
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:35,850
I think I was in my mind I was
borderline alcoholic I guess.

949
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:39,220
Um,
but I was,

950
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:43,870
I was just not able to deal
with that failure in myself.

951
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:47,530
How much,
how much were you drinking at the peak?

952
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:52,531
It was a 40 ounce of whatever I get
my hands on sometimes it was like to

953
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:56,830
remember one time it was
two 26 ounce bottles of Rye,

954
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:01,780
of crown royal was my brand of choice
and a, if that wasn't around again, Jack,

955
00:58:01,781 --> 00:58:05,530
Dan Lynn, you're drinking, you're getting
done with work and that's it. You know,

956
00:58:05,531 --> 00:58:09,070
at this point I just waking up in
the morning and drinking at work.

957
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,840
Like I was just,

958
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:14,600
I knew in the morning I couldn't go
and then you feel like shit because you

959
00:58:14,601 --> 00:58:17,860
drank all day. So what do you do
that you go for the hair of the dog?

960
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,110
And that just turns
into a perpetual circle.

961
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:22,450
And then the wounds I was
talking about earlier,

962
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,370
they're not healing because my body's full
of alcohol. And a friend of mine said,

963
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:31,030
you know what, my dad used to have that
problem because he drank too much too.

964
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:35,200
And he would like cut his hand working
on like a woodwork and the shed and it

965
00:58:35,201 --> 00:58:37,060
would be there for like
six, eight, nine months.

966
00:58:37,061 --> 00:58:39,460
And then he'd sober up for a couple
months and then it would go away.

967
00:58:39,461 --> 00:58:41,320
But then he'd fall back and I went,

968
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,340
you're dad the maniac you've told me
stories about. And she was like, yeah.

969
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,970
And I'm like, okay. So this
is really becoming a problem.

970
00:58:48,971 --> 00:58:52,600
So now I'm dealing with the internal
struggle of I'm a complete failure of a

971
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:55,930
human being. I've met, failed
my kids, I failed the voters,

972
00:58:55,931 --> 00:59:00,160
I failed like friends of mine,
like Jocko and Echo, who, you know,

973
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:04,900
we expect certain things from each other,
right? Or we think we do. And you could,

974
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,150
you could have a terrible day.
And I would never judge you for it,

975
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:09,310
but you don't know that until it happens.
Right.

976
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,930
And even if you know that you
still don't want to admit it,

977
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,240
nevermind to Jocko or echo,
how about to yourself? Right.

978
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,760
And again, I'd stopped meditating,
I'd stopped going to my therapist,

979
00:59:22,761 --> 00:59:25,010
I'd stopped going to the gym,
I'd stopped podcasting,

980
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:29,360
I'd stopped writing really even though,
and then during the book tour in October,

981
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:31,970
and I know I'm rewinding a little bit,
but I,

982
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,950
the last thing I want to
do is go on the book tour.

983
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:38,060
But the book is coming out and that's a
commitment that I signed and you know,

984
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:39,380
you're dealing with all this and I,

985
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,290
and I did the tour in my wheelchair
and everybody's like, oh,

986
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:44,810
you're doing so much better cause you're
okay with being in the wheelchair.

987
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:49,040
And I'm like, yeah, cool. Close the hotel
room door and like opened a drink, right.

988
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:49,874
Have a drink.

989
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:56,090
So December was the
worst month of my life.

990
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:59,030
Getting blown up was easy in my opinion,
dealing with this shit.

991
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:04,630
But what I didn't do in 2007 was actually
deal with the fact that I was blown

992
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:08,720
up, frankly. I was so
like, yeah, recover, be,

993
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:13,670
be useful to the regimen, be useful. The
Queen Bee get better for the country. Um,

994
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,680
put prosthetic legs on life as normal
ish. And then now I'm like, okay,

995
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,510
first of all, now, dude, you're
40, uh, second of all your,

996
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,070
you have kids that are now like,

997
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:29,150
where the f like I would see them and
they'd be like, we miss you. Like,

998
01:00:29,151 --> 01:00:33,530
where have you been? Like, why
aren't you around more? And like you,

999
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,830
you don't live far away. Like
what's your excuse because, oh,

1000
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:41,240
because I'm ashamed of you seeing me
all dealing with the next day of being

1001
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:44,450
drunk and stuff, you know?
And, and it really, it really,

1002
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:48,260
it really became,
I understand now I've,

1003
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:51,560
I've always been sympathetic to
addicts since my oxycotton days,

1004
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:56,561
but now I get how depression
can really make you into

1005
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:06,350
someone not worth saving in your
own mind. And I get, I get it.

1006
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:09,710
And I've, I've never dis, uh,

1007
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:14,770
I've never thought hatefully or anything
of friends that have committed suicide

1008
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:20,360
or have gone down that path of depression
that you just, if you're not in it,

1009
01:01:20,361 --> 01:01:23,090
you don't get it. And you go, man,

1010
01:01:23,091 --> 01:01:27,110
why can't you just like read a book or
listen to some comedy or not drink today?

1011
01:01:27,111 --> 01:01:29,690
Like have, I'll sit with you and
have a water and you're like,

1012
01:01:29,691 --> 01:01:31,220
you just don't get it.

1013
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,330
And I was doing a lot of this
on my self isolation too,

1014
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:37,640
because you don't want
anyone seeing you like this.

1015
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:42,110
And then the few people that do
hang around are often in the same,

1016
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:47,180
in one of the levels of, of
fuck up of life. Fuck up.

1017
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,303
And so,

1018
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:49,781
you know,

1019
01:01:49,781 --> 01:01:53,800
I've talked about this before where it
sounds like you're describing exactly.

1020
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:57,670
I talk about how like people get into a
place where they're basically in a storm

1021
01:01:57,671 --> 01:01:58,121
right there,

1022
01:01:58,121 --> 01:02:02,170
there's a storm all around their head
and no matter which direction they look,

1023
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:05,020
they just see clouds and thunder
and rain and horror. Right.

1024
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:09,700
And everybody that's outside that storm
looks at him and they go, well yeah,

1025
01:02:09,701 --> 01:02:11,710
you're in a storm. Just come over
here and you'll be out of the storm.

1026
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:13,360
Just move over here and
you'll be able to storm. Yeah.

1027
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:17,290
Just put down the drink or you know,
you start working out again or whatever.

1028
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:20,250
You just move over here and you'll be out
of the store. Yeah, but, but that person

1029
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:24,120
can't see, they can't see the directions.
Everything around them is a storm.

1030
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:29,150
They don't understand how me coming over
there is like climbing a mountain and

1031
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:33,510
not to give anyone shit but maybe a little
bit of Shit if you know who you are.

1032
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:38,310
Hey Man, uh, one to watch UFC
tonight at my place. Yeah. Cool.

1033
01:02:38,311 --> 01:02:42,870
Except hey bro, I'm in a wheelchair.
I can't even get into your front door.

1034
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:46,740
Can you come to my place where I can get
around and take a piss without getting

1035
01:02:46,741 --> 01:02:50,070
out of water bottle and you know like
being embarrassed in front of your wife.

1036
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,320
Yeah. But you live all the way over there.
Like we've already got plans and shit.

1037
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:59,930
Like, well cool. What about
next weekend? Eh, that Kinda,

1038
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:04,460
that didn't help as well because people
like, they don't like even coming here,

1039
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:07,980
you're like, aw, this is
buddy carry up the stairs. And
I'm like, yeah, I trust you.

1040
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:08,940
But at the same time,

1041
01:03:08,941 --> 01:03:12,570
like some of my friends offering to carry
me into their house or like 140 pounds

1042
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,890
soaking wet, never been lifted a weight
in their life and nothing against them.

1043
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:21,360
But it's like you want me to trust my
physical safety or you could just come to

1044
01:03:21,361 --> 01:03:24,780
my place like, like, and they
don't get it and I don't,

1045
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,880
I'm not mad at anyone about it.
It's like a,

1046
01:03:26,881 --> 01:03:28,800
it's like that saying like
I don't hate them about it,

1047
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:31,470
but at the same time it's Kinda
like, all right, cool man.

1048
01:03:31,471 --> 01:03:35,970
I'll just watch the fight and we can
text and I'll be at my place alone again.

1049
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,980
Right. Like, cause I didn't leave my dog.

1050
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,600
Isn't that the place where
I'm at right now? Right.

1051
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,070
So that all thing just kind
of fell into a big blender.

1052
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:48,000
And in December. Um, how long did that,

1053
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:53,410
so did this, when you got back in your
wheelchair, you gave up the leg? Yeah,

1054
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,250
this is me. This is May. So in
May when you get, like I said,

1055
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:59,010
can we went on that long trip, you went
to Albany, you come back from that,

1056
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:02,670
now you're now you're like
dumbed down with my prosthetics.

1057
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:04,290
They're freaking killing me.
Yeah.

1058
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,650
And I'm getting in a wheelchair
back in the wheelchair.

1059
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,130
Is that sort of like now you're just,
you're not,

1060
01:04:10,131 --> 01:04:12,900
you're just gaining momentum
going downhill. I, yeah.

1061
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:16,200
Well that and but that's a crazy thing
is I thought I'm starting to climb up

1062
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:21,240
because I'm like finally admitting I
can't wear my prosthetics cause I would

1063
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:24,660
like walk into council,
which is the big,

1064
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:27,990
like every two weeks you do the big
meeting and that's where all like all

1065
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:31,470
everything you went to the bar and drank
about and then went to the office and

1066
01:04:31,471 --> 01:04:33,390
like argued behind the
scenes with each other.

1067
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:36,030
Now you sit down and you
go all those in favor, Aye.

1068
01:04:36,031 --> 01:04:40,200
All those against the nay and then
it's passed a resolution passes.

1069
01:04:40,201 --> 01:04:43,320
And now it's illegal to eat ice
cream on bank street on Sundays,

1070
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,830
which is a bylaw in Ottawa that I'm going
to actually try and get changed by the

1071
01:04:46,831 --> 01:04:51,090
way from like 18 hundreds but
the point is that's the big show.

1072
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,110
Like if all the other training,
right,

1073
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:56,610
that's the live fire exercise
or that's the actual op, right?

1074
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,930
So that's what your work for.

1075
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,920
So when I started missing those at the
end of the year when we're pat like the

1076
01:05:01,921 --> 01:05:04,290
budget is the thing that
if without budget you have,

1077
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,480
you guys just had a government
shutdown over budget. Yup.

1078
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,150
That's what you're trying to avoid. And
that's when the media who, you know,

1079
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,090
they're doing their job,

1080
01:05:12,091 --> 01:05:17,091
but Jody Mitic and a headline gets clicks
and now Jody Mitic the guy everybody

1081
01:05:17,471 --> 01:05:21,040
loves, oh he's fucking
up. What's going on here?

1082
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:25,150
One guy even made a video called no show
medic because I'd missed like four or

1083
01:05:25,151 --> 01:05:28,600
five meetings, but the meetings
I'd missed were the ones out.

1084
01:05:28,601 --> 01:05:31,780
Like you could miss every other meeting
throughout the year and nobody would

1085
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:34,510
give a fine fuck of a rolling donut.

1086
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:38,170
Which is a saying out of a book,
a series of books I love but,

1087
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:43,210
but I miss these three
meetings. Oh No. Oh no man.

1088
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:46,870
Like these are the meetings we really
voted for you to be at where you at?

1089
01:05:46,871 --> 01:05:47,681
No show medic.

1090
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:50,710
And this guy is trying to make a name
for himself as a political commentator,

1091
01:05:50,711 --> 01:05:52,510
whatever. He's an
asshole. But the point is

1092
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,290
to say that shit to my face.
Um,

1093
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:02,030
the point is he's right though.
Where is no show medic and now in Ma,

1094
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:06,130
cause that's what I was in my head
already. Right. And then I'm like, okay.

1095
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:09,850
So I thought if I said personal family
matters or personal health matters,

1096
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:13,330
they get it. They know me, they know
I've dealing with stuff along the way.

1097
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,010
But they're like, yeah, we get it man.

1098
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:17,740
But if you don't tell us what's going
on and then we're going to assume you're

1099
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:21,490
just fucking being lazy cause why else?
Why shouldn't we?

1100
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:23,470
And I went,
okay.

1101
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:26,830
And a and a reporter buddy of mine
and I sent you a couple of texts.

1102
01:06:26,831 --> 01:06:30,730
That's when I, and I, when you said that
earlier I, my skin went like, you know,

1103
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:35,500
we've got the goosebumps because I
forgot I sent that and I was starting to

1104
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:37,840
think like, okay, I
gotta go back to basics.

1105
01:06:37,841 --> 01:06:42,430
I gotta remember who I am and
what I was and my own advice.

1106
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,770
And that's why I went,
oh yeah,

1107
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:49,920
I got too comfortable in my pity in the
enemy now is on my left flank and I have

1108
01:06:50,231 --> 01:06:53,660
zero defense is on the left flank.
And what do you,

1109
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:57,040
instead of fighting a
shitty losing rear guard,

1110
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:00,310
you turn and you face the fucking,
you face the battle.

1111
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:04,070
So I turned and a reporter friend of mine,

1112
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:07,420
and for the record reporters
are not really friends.

1113
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,090
Those friends that you kind of keep at
arm's length and you're always ready to

1114
01:07:10,091 --> 01:07:12,400
punch, but you never know,
right? You're not really punched.

1115
01:07:12,401 --> 01:07:17,040
But I'm not threatening anyone with
violence. UPC World Weirdos. But the,

1116
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:20,830
he said, he called me on a
personal note and he said, hey man,

1117
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:25,270
here's what's being said in the, in
the, in the media world about you.

1118
01:07:25,271 --> 01:07:29,070
And this is what could be going to
headline if you don't say anything soon.

1119
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:33,880
And I, Oh man, okay, well some of
that's true. Some of that's made up,

1120
01:07:33,881 --> 01:07:38,080
but that's what you do when you don't
know. And I said, all right, uh,

1121
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:39,790
can I come on your show?
And he's like,

1122
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:43,360
well that's what I was just about to
ask you if you want come on my show.

1123
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,700
And that's Evan and we,

1124
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:49,660
and then we went and we talked about it
and he was very kind to me, he's rough.

1125
01:07:49,661 --> 01:07:54,310
He's a tough dude. He's a tough a
reporter, but at the same time, very fair.

1126
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:59,050
And he hit me with a few with a
few shifts and I hit him back.

1127
01:07:59,051 --> 01:08:03,460
But what I did was I got it all out of
my system because it's basically you feel

1128
01:08:03,461 --> 01:08:06,670
like you're holding, nevermind, I'm
keeping a secret from Jocko and echo.

1129
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:12,640
I'm keeping a secret from 40,000 residents
who trusted me to be their counselor.

1130
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:16,100
Then there's all the fans of Jody
Mitic that are out there and all the

1131
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:21,101
supporters who are all amazing and who
all are willing to support you through

1132
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:22,730
the best and the worst of times.

1133
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:27,730
But they can't support you without
anything that they like to them.

1134
01:08:27,921 --> 01:08:31,310
I just stopped podcasting for no reason
and I've stopped being positive on

1135
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:35,870
social media. So what, like what did you
just decide? Is this the real Jodie now?

1136
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,300
Is that who like were
you faking it before?

1137
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:40,730
Like that's some of the messages I got.
Like all,

1138
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:43,040
obviously you've figured out that
you can still make money and be,

1139
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:46,830
be the asshole you actually are. And I
was like, Oh shit. Like Jesus, it may,

1140
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,020
maybe I am that asshole.

1141
01:08:48,021 --> 01:08:53,021
But when I did my buddy show a
huge weight went off my shoulders.

1142
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:54,830
I shouldn't say buddy,
but you know,

1143
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:58,550
but the point is that that was the
beginning of me turning into the,

1144
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:03,440
into the fight instead of running.
And I had a couple of setbacks, so,

1145
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,100
so hold on. So this show that you
did and you, you said you listen.

1146
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,700
I did listen to it, but um, the,

1147
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:14,300
the premise of the show was what you did,
for lack of a better word,

1148
01:09:14,301 --> 01:09:18,020
as you took ownership of everything
that was going on. I even laughed a,

1149
01:09:18,021 --> 01:09:21,020
I was laughing right before I went
online. I went onto the show. I said,

1150
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:24,800
I'm doing a jock when I'm taking extreme
ownership, extreme ownership. You went,

1151
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,270
so you went on there and you said,
look, I'd like a baby. By the way.

1152
01:09:29,271 --> 01:09:33,950
Anyone who thinks I'm a tough guy, I been
drinking too much yet. What do you like,

1153
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:36,740
what were the facts that, what were
the things that you took ownership of?

1154
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:38,960
Was that night? That was
the major thing, right?

1155
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:43,790
The booze caused a lot
of the lack of energy,

1156
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:48,791
lack of a t attempted it at attendance
went down because it's one thing to be

1157
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:51,201
buzzed.

1158
01:09:51,201 --> 01:09:55,990
It's another thing to be completely
hung over and fucked up and show up for

1159
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:57,860
meeting. Like you, you
didn't know yourself.

1160
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:00,800
I know myself and I know like if
I go in there like this right now,

1161
01:10:00,801 --> 01:10:04,850
people will be like, he is
completely fucked. Right.

1162
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:09,200
And I know I'm swearing a lot and
I apologize, but you avoid that.

1163
01:10:09,201 --> 01:10:10,370
And then so I said,
okay guys,

1164
01:10:10,371 --> 01:10:13,190
well here's why I missed this meeting and
here's why I missed that meeting cause

1165
01:10:13,191 --> 01:10:17,200
I've turned to an old friend,
crown royal instead of my,

1166
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:21,620
my therapist and my doctors and my friends
and my family and my supporters and

1167
01:10:21,621 --> 01:10:26,390
all the things that made me
able to cope from 2007 to 2017.

1168
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:31,780
So for basically a decade I forgot
about and I left behind like never mind,

1169
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:36,710
never mind the g like stopped the
gym, stop talking to me, therapist,

1170
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,240
stopped talking to my kids, stop talking
to my ex, stop talking to my mom,

1171
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:44,450
stopped talking to my
dad, my friends. Again,

1172
01:10:44,451 --> 01:10:49,451
I've self isolating and there are times
when I'd want to pick up the phone and

1173
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:52,910
just call like you or rob or um,

1174
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:57,170
or some of my friends at home or some
of my sniper buddies and just be like,

1175
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,393
I don't know what to do.

1176
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,070
And now you're man Echo, right? Sure.

1177
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:08,570
Imagine trying to make that call. Yeah.
And I'm not saying it's a man problem,

1178
01:11:08,571 --> 01:11:10,880
I'm saying it's a
definitely a human problem,

1179
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:14,640
but I'm the guy,

1180
01:11:14,641 --> 01:11:19,110
everybody thinks I get told you're the
poster child of success post injury.

1181
01:11:19,111 --> 01:11:22,080
And I'm like, in my head I'm
like, I'm a fucking bullshitter.

1182
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:25,740
Like that's how you feel. And
I'm like, whether I am or not,

1183
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:31,020
I've been lucky and I've made a few decent
decisions on for my own accord and I

1184
01:11:31,021 --> 01:11:35,220
am where I am through hard work
and discipline and now what?

1185
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:39,420
And now I feel like I'm losing
it all because I have, I
have, I've been faking it.

1186
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:44,520
Was this just a ride that I was on and
now I'm done and I want to get off the

1187
01:11:44,521 --> 01:11:47,700
thing. The things that go through
your head now. First of all, I,

1188
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,730
I was never suicidal. I had never
thought, never crossed my mind.

1189
01:11:50,731 --> 01:11:52,170
I don't know why it just didn't.

1190
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:55,890
But I did have one thought
one day where I went,

1191
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:59,130
I think I understand why some
guys take that path though.

1192
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:03,750
I had a such a day one day
where it was in December and I,

1193
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,240
it wasn't like I thought, oh, things
would be better if I was dead.

1194
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:09,120
It was like I just,
I was at such a low moment and I went,

1195
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:11,820
I think I get it.

1196
01:12:11,821 --> 01:12:16,290
Why sometimes guys take that path
because it's just like, you know,

1197
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:20,520
like it was just such an extreme
combination of everything from all sides.

1198
01:12:20,521 --> 01:12:24,450
And I went, I think I kind of get it now
cause it before, I don't know about you,

1199
01:12:24,451 --> 01:12:27,720
but I've, I've tried to figure out why
some of the guys go that route and,

1200
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:31,950
and I just can't. But that moment
I went, oh okay. I kind of get it.

1201
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:36,060
And it was, it wasn't like I
thought solution for myself,

1202
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:40,320
but I just is very quick as it took
about two minutes of in and out.

1203
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,660
And it stuck with me though,
because I went,

1204
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:47,490
that's the first time I've ever had
any thought like that. Right. And then,

1205
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:52,320
so my daughter's birthday is late
December and I missed that one too.

1206
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,970
And then
New Year's Eve.

1207
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:02,960
And I've already made plans to go and
do an assessment that would tell me how

1208
01:13:04,201 --> 01:13:07,350
terrible of an addict I am as a,

1209
01:13:07,351 --> 01:13:10,350
as an alcoholic because that's
what you are. You're an addict.

1210
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:15,710
And I'm going to Aa Kinda sorta and
my have a sponsor who's all over me.

1211
01:13:16,171 --> 01:13:18,030
He's a great guy and I
won't say his name here,

1212
01:13:18,031 --> 01:13:22,240
but he knows who he is and he's
a beautiful human being. Um,

1213
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:24,180
and he's trying to get on top of me.

1214
01:13:24,181 --> 01:13:27,450
And Luke is trying to get on top of me
and my mom and my ex and my friends and

1215
01:13:27,451 --> 01:13:30,300
they're all trying to just be like, okay
man, like we get it. Now we've heard,

1216
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:33,600
we've heard your call is loud and
clear now. How do we help you?

1217
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:38,490
And then it's trying to like mitigate
that and then Ah, it's, you know,

1218
01:13:38,491 --> 01:13:43,110
it's Christmas. I'll have a few drinks. I
know I told the world this, but you know,

1219
01:13:43,111 --> 01:13:46,440
I can handle it. I'm not,
I'm not that bad. And then
the next morning you're like,

1220
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:49,140
oh man.
But then New Year's Eve,

1221
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,800
I had some company that came
out cause they're like, we
heard you man. We're here.

1222
01:13:52,801 --> 01:13:55,560
It's New Year's Eve. Let's hang
out. Let's be floods. Have Fun,

1223
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,270
we'll have a few drinks. We're all here
to keep an eye on. You can't get that bad.

1224
01:13:59,271 --> 01:14:03,600
We know who you are.
And the next morning it's like I did what?

1225
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:07,920
Because now all the pressure's
on now to get better.

1226
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:12,580
And I was here in radio interviews where
there I was headline news in Ottawa for

1227
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:16,390
a couple of days where they went.
Wow. Real brave of him to say that.

1228
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:19,870
Now how's he going to get better? Guys
are talking about me. I have to retire.

1229
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:22,630
Are resigned from politics.
Uh,

1230
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,500
in Canada with the gun laws
as they are a public city,

1231
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:31,150
anyone can call in a threat on
anybody who owns guns, right?

1232
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:35,350
So some gun hating citizen,

1233
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:39,700
and I'm not hating them for this, I'm just
hating them for being a dick. He said,

1234
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:40,450
oh,

1235
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:44,530
I can get a prominent gun owners guns
taken away if I call the police and say,

1236
01:14:44,531 --> 01:14:47,440
I think he's a threat to public safety.
And that's all you have to do.

1237
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,930
It's completely anonymous,
which is bullshit.

1238
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:52,960
And anyone can do it against
anyone that's a gun owner.

1239
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:58,120
And so now the police call and they say,
listen, we have to do an investigation.

1240
01:14:58,121 --> 01:15:00,790
So like, so that actually
happened. So this was,

1241
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:04,390
this was right before New Year's Eve.
So I'm like freaking out.

1242
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:08,500
I am losing my shit. And because I'm
like, I don't know how it works now.

1243
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:10,750
They're very understanding,
but they have to do the check.

1244
01:15:10,751 --> 01:15:15,430
They look once the investigation
started real or not, or, um,

1245
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:20,200
substantiated or not, we gotta
go through steps. One does that.

1246
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:24,970
Okay, so they go inspect
the guns. The guns are safe,

1247
01:15:24,971 --> 01:15:26,850
the guns are where they're supposed to be.
Everything's locked out,

1248
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:30,730
everything's proper, Dah, Dah, Dah,
Dah, Dah, Dah. Talk to my family. Nope,

1249
01:15:30,731 --> 01:15:34,660
he's never been threatening with them.
That I love the law. And then like,

1250
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:38,110
and then, and then in the new year's eve
rolls around and I have this terrible,

1251
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,901
this is the last I,

1252
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:43,901
the last drop of booze I had was new
year's eve and we started with a small

1253
01:15:45,611 --> 01:15:50,611
bottle and I drank it all myself
and this past New Year's Eve,

1254
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,350
just passengers, he evicts sold
towards today 2022, 23 days ago.

1255
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,710
And the next morning,
uh,

1256
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:03,100
I got a little bit of a lowdown about
what I was like and I call him evil Jody.

1257
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
And he came out once in 2005 after
my first deployment to Afghanistan,

1258
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:15,640
before my second one where I got
wounded and I was bouncing at the time.

1259
01:16:15,641 --> 01:16:18,880
And I was, you know, having some
little bit too much fun in life maybe.

1260
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:23,530
But I was also drinking too much
for the wrong reasons at the time.

1261
01:16:23,531 --> 01:16:27,880
And a lot of us were because we had
the cane forces, we hadn't dealt with,

1262
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:32,370
you know, combat a lot. Right. Like I
said, and a lot of us were green, uh,

1263
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:36,610
when we went into Afghanistan
the first time. So maybe a lot,

1264
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:40,210
like you said, a fair
number of us, me included,

1265
01:16:40,211 --> 01:16:44,290
where maybe choosing the wrong ways.
Um,

1266
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,510
I was still meditating and all that,
so mitigated a little bit. But this,

1267
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:52,390
I call them evil Jody, he came out,
my friend, why? One of my buddies who,

1268
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:57,610
uh, still talk to, he's a
police sniper now, but he, he
pulled me aside and he said,

1269
01:16:57,611 --> 01:17:01,810
hey man, like I've never ever
seen you act like that ever.

1270
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:05,410
No matter how drunk you were,
what was going on or how angry you were,

1271
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:09,160
who pissed you off? What the fuck
was that about? And I went, oh,

1272
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:12,650
that sounds like grandpa or whatever.

1273
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:17,150
So I locked him in a cage and I used
to joke that, you know, Oh, don't let,

1274
01:17:17,151 --> 01:17:20,270
don't let the caveman man out of
his cage. And then, but that night,

1275
01:17:20,271 --> 01:17:22,250
so the 25 days ago or whatever it was,

1276
01:17:22,251 --> 01:17:25,490
he got out and I didn't
hurt anybody and anything,

1277
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,460
anybody said things you
don't shouldn't and I maybe

1278
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:34,880
made actions that you shouldn't. Yeah.
And for me the biggest thing is when you,

1279
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:38,960
you realize that you had no control over
what's happening and how about not even

1280
01:17:38,961 --> 01:17:41,030
remembering. Yeah. Well that's
what I'm saying. You don't want,

1281
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:44,210
my dad did all these
things. I said, what to who?

1282
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:48,380
Oh my God. And you're just like
your thing. I, and I called,

1283
01:17:48,381 --> 01:17:51,770
so I called one of the people that
was there and I said, I am so sorry.

1284
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:55,250
And he was like, been there, done that
dude. You gotta get your shit together.

1285
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:58,310
I'll be here when you're done,
when you're ready or I'm here tomorrow.

1286
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:02,690
He was such a great guy
about it. And I went, oh,

1287
01:18:02,691 --> 01:18:06,500
so the world doesn't hate you for being
a fuck up. And I at that helped too.

1288
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:12,890
We talked about this last night, like
who, when you mitigate, um, crisis,

1289
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:18,140
David Letterman or tiger woods, whoever,
like don't follow the Tiger Woods' book.

1290
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:22,280
Go with David Letterman on it. Explain
what David Letterman did cause I did. So,

1291
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:26,600
yeah, so in, in, in a, in a
nutshell, David Letterman got,

1292
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:30,310
he got caught in an affair on his
wife, David Letterman by the way, is a,

1293
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:34,730
is like a talk show host at night and uh,
yeah,

1294
01:18:34,731 --> 01:18:38,660
he's not anymore, but I guess he was
and he was pretty popular at some point.

1295
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:42,860
Yeah. He was already texting. Some
people don't know is a, is a golf player.

1296
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:47,420
So he yeah, if you haven't heard of him
he's like, yeah, he's like half black,

1297
01:18:47,421 --> 01:18:51,930
half Thai. And you know, he swung a
golf club pretty good for a minute. Um,

1298
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:56,870
but he got caught cheating on his wife
too. But so David Letterman got, uh, uh,

1299
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:00,830
blackmail letter right before one
of his shows and the guy said,

1300
01:19:00,831 --> 01:19:03,980
I know what happened. That it ended
up having an affair or something.

1301
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:08,360
He had had one or he was
having one and it was like,

1302
01:19:08,361 --> 01:19:13,280
pay me $40,000 a week for the rest
of my life or this or something.

1303
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:17,300
I'll tell the world. And David
Letterman went, alright, I fucked up.

1304
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:21,080
And he went out. And He, and I
don't remember because I did see it,

1305
01:19:21,081 --> 01:19:23,570
but I don't remember exactly how it went.
But basically,

1306
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:26,360
usually they do a monologue, these
guys for their show. And he went,

1307
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:27,920
instead of today's monologue,

1308
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:32,870
I'm gonna look into the camera and I'm
going to say I cheated on my wife and she

1309
01:19:32,871 --> 01:19:34,460
knows about it and we're working on it.

1310
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:37,340
And somebody else found out and they
thought they were going to get money from

1311
01:19:37,341 --> 01:19:40,160
me. So he looked in the
camera went, fuck you.

1312
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:43,730
The police are coming to your house
right now. And to the rest of you,

1313
01:19:43,731 --> 01:19:48,200
I apologize. I'm sorry. Am I have to
my wife? I apologize. And I understand.

1314
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:49,540
If this is a problem for us,

1315
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:54,140
then we will have to deal with it again
because of who I am. It's world news.

1316
01:19:54,141 --> 01:19:58,460
And does he? He owned
it. He owned all of it.

1317
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,760
And uh, the other day he
interviewed this guy named Obama.

1318
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:05,010
You might've heard of him on his
new show on Netflix called, uh,

1319
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:08,940
I forget what the next guest or
something. And he was on, he's, he,

1320
01:20:08,941 --> 01:20:13,250
he's still seen as a good dude.
Right. Cause he own it. Any,

1321
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:16,110
any worked through it and he,
and he didn't not talk about it.

1322
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:21,470
And then there's what tiger woods
did, which is runaway hide, uh,

1323
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,370
not admit anything.
And he,

1324
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:28,380
tiger woods went through four or five
years of just complete chaos in his life

1325
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:32,760
before he finally even, I think now
he still places in the bottom 50.

1326
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:35,970
I think he's at the PGA.
He still plays,

1327
01:20:35,971 --> 01:20:37,800
but he probably just plays
to pay the bills now.

1328
01:20:37,801 --> 01:20:42,801
He was worth $1 billion at one point and
he lost it all because of not owning a

1329
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:43,773
fuckup.

1330
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:47,310
You'd probably still would have lost a
lot of it because his wife took half.

1331
01:20:47,311 --> 01:20:51,180
But regardless, sponsors dropped
him. He himself as a human being,

1332
01:20:51,181 --> 01:20:55,860
couldn't look himself in the
mirror, I'm sure. Right. And
Blah, blah, blah. So I said,

1333
01:20:55,861 --> 01:20:58,710
okay, well this is my tiger
woods or David Letterman moment,

1334
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:03,450
like going on the radio. I thought,
was it, now we're two weeks later,

1335
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:08,040
whatever it was. Yeah. Like two
weeks later. And I'm like, well,

1336
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:12,960
either I never drink again or I continue
down the path of bullshitting myself

1337
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:17,130
into saying, well, I'll just get
better when I'm ready. And, uh,

1338
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:20,970
this journey I've been on for
since I left, uh, what did I leave?

1339
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:24,570
I forget Jan,
18 or 19.

1340
01:21:24,571 --> 01:21:27,130
I left Ottawa and I've just been driving.
I've,

1341
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:32,340
I wanted to drive route 66
since I was a teenager. And, uh,

1342
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:36,390
you know, I talked to the kids, I
talked to Atlanta, I talked to my mom,

1343
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:37,950
I talk to everybody
that matter and I said,

1344
01:21:37,951 --> 01:21:42,951
I'll be back first city council is
January 31st after our Christmas break

1345
01:21:43,591 --> 01:21:46,650
anyway.
And I said I'll be back.

1346
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:50,940
I'm going to go visit some people that
are going to look me in the eye and tell

1347
01:21:50,941 --> 01:21:55,410
me if I'm full of shit or not. You
guys be in some of them. And, uh,

1348
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:59,640
when I get back, I'm going to my
therapist. I already have an appointment.

1349
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:02,730
My, uh, my doctor's for my legs,

1350
01:22:02,731 --> 01:22:05,850
cause I'm going back to basic training
to learn how to use prosthetics again.

1351
01:22:05,851 --> 01:22:07,560
So I don't go through those issues again.

1352
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:11,730
I'm gonna talk about my addiction issues.

1353
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:15,120
I'm going to talk about why I'm not.
I'm going back to the gym.

1354
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:20,090
I have a diet plan already have
a trainer waiting. Um, I'm,

1355
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:21,810
I'm going back to the base.
I'm back.

1356
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:25,110
I'm in basic training to be a
human being again. And I, I was,

1357
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:30,000
I was laughing this morning listening
to your show about the basic training at

1358
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:33,960
Marine Corps base in Parris Island
because I was like, fuck man, I just,

1359
01:22:33,961 --> 01:22:35,700
I keep doing this every
three or four years.

1360
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:40,680
I got to go back and relearn what it's
like to be Jody Mitic because I am

1361
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:44,140
evolving.
B,

1362
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:47,640
I had to evolve beyond the soldier and
then I had to print it a citizen and then

1363
01:22:47,641 --> 01:22:50,460
out. Now I'm a turning into
something else. I think, uh,

1364
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:55,490
because I had a plan until I was 44 I
thought at 25 years in the army or 28th

1365
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,280
was 27 years, retire, become a contractor,

1366
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,410
teach shooting for the rest of my life
and just be that grumpy old guy that,

1367
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:09,220
you know. Well, if you want to know about
shooting, you talked to that guy. Be Good,

1368
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:12,130
decent money, right? I didn't want
to get rich. I just wanted to have,

1369
01:23:12,131 --> 01:23:13,600
pay my bills and hang out with my,

1370
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:18,610
my dream retirement was going to be to
hurt Alpacas around on my horse with my

1371
01:23:18,611 --> 01:23:22,900
rifle, shoot coyotes and, and listen
to like gangster rap and read books.

1372
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:26,130
Like that was it. That was
what I wanted to do. But,

1373
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:29,920
but life has a funny way of pointing you
in directions that maybe you need to go

1374
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:31,330
in there. You didn't
know you had to go. And

1375
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,440
I'm back on the Jocko podcast,

1376
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:39,550
spilling my whole life and
my soul out for everybody.

1377
01:23:39,551 --> 01:23:44,500
And I hope somebody to learn this.
If we keep one troop from like,

1378
01:23:44,501 --> 01:23:47,830
listen, I have, even if you're on the
road where you know you're fucking up,

1379
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:52,420
pull over, call in air
support, like Jocko said,

1380
01:23:52,421 --> 01:23:54,490
like you got,

1381
01:23:55,060 --> 01:24:00,000
we have so many resources we
don't know about. And uh, you
know, we all, uh, I'm the,

1382
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,190
I'm the lone wolf. Well, even
the lone wolf runs in a pack.

1383
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:07,420
And I think that that's how I've, I've
thought like, you know, the soft guys,

1384
01:24:07,421 --> 01:24:10,330
you know, we're all Alphas
but we're in teams, you know,

1385
01:24:10,331 --> 01:24:13,670
and I rolled in a team of three hardcore
guys. There's me and my boys and,

1386
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:18,070
but we at the same time I knew I had
artillery support, I had air cover,

1387
01:24:18,071 --> 01:24:18,671
I had this,

1388
01:24:18,671 --> 01:24:22,270
I had another sniper team covering the
flank over there and Ricky platoon over

1389
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:26,100
there and you're never alone.
And even last night, like I,

1390
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:30,220
I felt bad.
I sh I'm still in a tee shirt.

1391
01:24:30,221 --> 01:24:33,720
I drove in all day from the tee shirt I
wore the day before and he showed doc,

1392
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,280
I've never seen Jocko dressed
up and I'm like, Oh shit,

1393
01:24:36,281 --> 01:24:39,910
Jocko is like in a button down
shirt and he's wearing shoes.

1394
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:42,520
Let's not get crazy.
I had on a pair of jeans,

1395
01:24:42,521 --> 01:24:47,000
van's a tee shirt and a flannel shirt
that's, you were dressed up, dressed up.

1396
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,560
But I'm like, technically I'm like,
I'm like, okay. So I haven't seen it.

1397
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:56,560
Seen you in two years ish,
give or take a few months we've talked,

1398
01:24:56,561 --> 01:24:59,290
but it's not like we've been on the
phone for hours and been like, hey bro,

1399
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:01,390
what's going now? Like, you
know, you were busy dudes.

1400
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:05,830
We kept in touch the way guys I guess
do. But we sat down and I'm like, okay,

1401
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:10,030
do I eat dinner and then
tell him tomorrow or,

1402
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:15,160
and I just basically threw up all over
you and you and you were awesome and I

1403
01:25:15,161 --> 01:25:16,810
love you for it and I appreciate it.

1404
01:25:16,811 --> 01:25:21,811
But I needed that hour of just talking
about myself and I felt bad about it

1405
01:25:22,961 --> 01:25:26,350
because I'm like, I haven't even
asked him how his kids are. You have,

1406
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:28,810
I have friends that'll do,
you were willing to do that.

1407
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:30,850
And I've done that for hundreds of guys.

1408
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:35,770
But then when it's you doing the talking
man, it's tough and I get it now.

1409
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:40,750
I get it now more than anything. So
guys, you need, you gotta pull over,

1410
01:25:40,751 --> 01:25:45,751
you gotta like you just gotta take a knee
and let somebody else take point for a

1411
01:25:46,421 --> 01:25:50,560
bit. And that's just the way
it is. You know, all your set,

1412
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:55,570
you said you kind of understand
when people feel suicidal,

1413
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,340
you know when you said that,
no,

1414
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,930
I know and I've said that a
bunch of times since it happened,

1415
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:05,330
but what's your question? Sorry.
Let me like, do you, do you,

1416
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:09,190
cause I think about that too sometimes
where that's the only time that we were

1417
01:26:09,191 --> 01:26:12,230
at that thought. I don't think about
me. I'm thinking like other people,

1418
01:26:12,231 --> 01:26:14,570
like what does it take to be like,
you know what I'm going to in my life.

1419
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,800
My question is, do you think that
it's like that feeling is like,

1420
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:21,950
it's almost like this immense
boredom with the, you know,

1421
01:26:21,951 --> 01:26:25,640
how like you just don't have,
it's not like this pain that I got to end.

1422
01:26:25,641 --> 01:26:28,190
It's more that like there's
really no reason for me to,

1423
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:31,010
it's like you're going up this
hill but the hill isn't that steep,

1424
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:35,200
but it's just so wrong. Yeah. You know, I
think that's part of it. Yeah. Like it's,

1425
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,010
it's like from what I've read,

1426
01:26:37,011 --> 01:26:40,520
the few suicide notes that I've
seen when you know, when you find,

1427
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,140
like we had one, uh, I don't know if I
talked about it on the show last time we,

1428
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:46,730
I was teaching on a sniper
course and one of the guys,

1429
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:51,680
I was talking to him at one moment about
what we're going to do Saturday cause

1430
01:26:51,681 --> 01:26:53,990
they're all guys you work
with, right? It's kind of like,

1431
01:26:53,991 --> 01:26:55,320
I'm sure it's the same as the seals.

1432
01:26:55,321 --> 01:26:59,810
So a lot of them that come on to sniper
course anywhere guys you've picked out

1433
01:26:59,811 --> 01:27:03,620
of the platoons and then you know,
even if they pass,

1434
01:27:03,621 --> 01:27:04,910
you still have a meeting where you go,
okay,

1435
01:27:04,911 --> 01:27:08,000
do we really want to work with echo guys?
Like I know we gave him the badge,

1436
01:27:08,001 --> 01:27:10,940
but are we going to let them
into the teams? And then,

1437
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:12,740
so this is one of the guys sold,
you know,

1438
01:27:12,741 --> 01:27:16,100
I'm getting to know him a little bit more.
He's from the other battalion and a,

1439
01:27:16,101 --> 01:27:19,280
yeah, cool man. I know this girl in town
and this and that and okay, right on.

1440
01:27:19,281 --> 01:27:23,660
And 20 minutes later, we're like, where
the fuck did he go? We're doing roll call.

1441
01:27:23,661 --> 01:27:26,660
Where the fuck is he? And we found
him hanging from one of the, you know,

1442
01:27:26,661 --> 01:27:30,920
the pavilions are out in the training
area, forget shade during lectures.

1443
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:34,190
So he was out there and we find this
letter on his pillow and I'm reading and

1444
01:27:34,191 --> 01:27:37,980
it's about they, they feel like they're
in this pain that's never ending. Yeah.

1445
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:40,700
And I don't think it's boredom.
I think it's just this,

1446
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:43,360
it's The no light at the
end of the tunnel feeling.

1447
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,390
Yeah. Yeah. As you were
asking that question, um,

1448
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:50,260
that the word I wrote down was,
was cause we've been talking about,

1449
01:27:50,261 --> 01:27:54,190
or we've heard from it from the
last couple podcasts that we did,

1450
01:27:54,430 --> 01:27:56,320
and it's the same thing you just said.
It's hope.

1451
01:27:56,830 --> 01:27:59,350
So when you don't have any
hope that this is going to end,

1452
01:27:59,351 --> 01:28:02,530
when you don't see any light at the
end of the tunnel. And like I said,

1453
01:28:02,531 --> 01:28:05,560
when you're, when you're stuck in
this storm and everywhere you look,

1454
01:28:05,561 --> 01:28:08,510
you don't see the light at the end of the
time, you don't see that the cloud end,

1455
01:28:08,511 --> 01:28:11,200
somewhere in the book thundering
lightning will subside.

1456
01:28:11,201 --> 01:28:14,710
You just are in a storm no matter where
you look. There's a storm and they say,

1457
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:16,540
you know, if there's no hope
of getting out of this storm.

1458
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:19,750
And I think that's where,
that's where they started having those.

1459
01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:22,230
Luckily though, when it, when
the thought entered my mind,

1460
01:28:22,231 --> 01:28:26,220
like I get it and what I,
again,

1461
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:30,960
I never thought of suicide, but I had the
thought go through my brain where I go,

1462
01:28:30,961 --> 01:28:34,290
I get why some people might
see this as an option.

1463
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:39,810
Cause I did see like, cause I'm texting
him, I'm texting rob, I'm texting. Uh,

1464
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:44,640
you know, my, my buddies in the cans
off. Um, uh, at my regimental friends,

1465
01:28:44,641 --> 01:28:46,500
my mom, my dad, my brother,

1466
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:51,230
most of the people that should be aware
there's a problem. We're aware. Yeah.

1467
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:56,580
So I still had lots of light coming in,
but it was my, now it's your choice.

1468
01:28:56,581 --> 01:29:00,090
Are you going to go towards it or are
you gonna stay floating where you are,

1469
01:29:00,091 --> 01:29:02,040
I guess is a like are you going to reach

1470
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,050
for the line or are you going
to sit there and be like, Eh,

1471
01:29:04,051 --> 01:29:06,370
it's just at an arm's reach. Yeah, I know.

1472
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:09,990
I talk about detachment all the time
and this is like another situation where

1473
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:12,870
obviously when you're,
when you're

1474
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:18,900
wrapped up in those kinds of
emotions, right? You, you,
you can't see anything else.

1475
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:24,060
Somebody that's outside, they're perfectly
clear, can help guide you out of that.

1476
01:29:24,061 --> 01:29:26,160
Even though it's going to be hard.
And there's things that knock,

1477
01:29:26,161 --> 01:29:27,060
understand and all that,

1478
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:30,780
but they can at least they know that
they're outside that and they can see it

1479
01:29:30,781 --> 01:29:34,140
just like on the battlefield. Somebody
that's at elevation, you know,

1480
01:29:34,141 --> 01:29:38,490
you get getting, rebuilding
her position. Yeah. Some guys
go left, go, left, go left,

1481
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:43,230
go right. And you're like, fuck. Yeah. So
if you can reach out to somebody that can,

1482
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:46,800
that has a little bit better,
uh, altitude on the battlefield,

1483
01:29:46,801 --> 01:29:51,210
but you're in then end. If you can
reach out to them, say, hey man,

1484
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,660
I can't see what's going on,

1485
01:29:52,661 --> 01:29:55,770
and all I see is darkness point me in
the right direction and they're going to

1486
01:29:55,771 --> 01:30:00,660
tell you some dumb shit like, hey, okay,

1487
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,810
let's get you to a doctor.
Let's get you stopped drinking.

1488
01:30:03,811 --> 01:30:05,640
Let's get you in the gym again.
They're gonna tell you some stuff.

1489
01:30:05,641 --> 01:30:09,530
That sounds stupid. It sounds
well, it sounds way too easy. Yeah,

1490
01:30:09,531 --> 01:30:12,420
it sounds way too easy.
You think it's that easy fro a fuck.

1491
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,770
But you know what I what I like
what you said is you're like, man,

1492
01:30:16,771 --> 01:30:20,430
I keep having to go back to bootcamp.
Yeah. And it's like, that's really,

1493
01:30:20,431 --> 01:30:23,130
if you think about what bootcamp is,
what is bootcamp? They're like, okay,

1494
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:26,670
put your shoes on like this. Make
your bed like that. Eat this food,

1495
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:30,210
do this workout. That's what they do. They
get you on the program that Lee, it's,

1496
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:32,180
it's at least a success and it,

1497
01:30:32,210 --> 01:30:36,810
and it leads to having your
life somewhat sorted out.

1498
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,270
And once you get that, then you
look around and you go, okay,

1499
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:42,900
now these bigger problems. I, if
I can control these little things,

1500
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:44,550
I can control this,
this thing that's a little bit bigger,

1501
01:30:44,551 --> 01:30:46,710
and if I can control that, I control
this thing that's a little bit bigger.

1502
01:30:46,711 --> 01:30:49,110
If I can control that, I control this
other thing that's a little bit bigger.

1503
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:50,280
But when you're not,
you know,

1504
01:30:50,281 --> 01:30:53,490
it's the same thing I talked about all
the time with the sh the Chechens and the

1505
01:30:53,491 --> 01:30:54,740
Russians not,
you know,

1506
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:58,380
failing on that first war and it all
started when they stopped shaving all at

1507
01:30:58,381 --> 01:31:00,480
the same thing with your personal life,
when you,

1508
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:03,480
when you disregard these,

1509
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:06,860
these fundamental things that
you would do in bootcamp. Yeah.

1510
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:10,260
When you start letting them go,
well then if the little things fall apart,

1511
01:31:10,261 --> 01:31:12,900
then the bigger things fall apart.
But contrary to that,

1512
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,760
when you put the little things together,

1513
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:18,370
you can start putting the bigger things
together and have you're doing right now,

1514
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:22,620
podcasts I've talked about, what did I
stopped doing? I stopped, oh well fuck,

1515
01:31:22,621 --> 01:31:26,910
I'm gonna eat pizza tonight and sit my
prescribed diet that I've done for years

1516
01:31:26,911 --> 01:31:30,480
and it makes me feel good and keeps me
in good shape because fuck it today.

1517
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:32,820
And then the next day it's
like, well, I did it yesterday.

1518
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:34,320
I'm going to have cocoa
puffs for breakfast.

1519
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:38,610
And it was just a downward spiral of,
ah, I don't need to go see my therapist.

1520
01:31:38,611 --> 01:31:41,540
He's all the way on the other 10 is town.
And I know my life sucks right now.

1521
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:44,730
Don't want somebody to tell me that
my life sucks are, you know, hey,

1522
01:31:44,731 --> 01:31:49,320
what do you talk about with a therapist?
What do they talk about?

1523
01:31:49,321 --> 01:31:53,970
What do you do there? So I'm
assuming you've never know, uh,

1524
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:57,660
honestly,
like you just bounce life off them.

1525
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,130
Or what I'm saying is if you
got a guy that's listening

1526
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:04,840
right now, yeah. That's like, oh, is
it embarrassing? Not even embarrassing.

1527
01:32:04,841 --> 01:32:06,520
If you've got a guy that's listening
right now that's going, well,

1528
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:10,120
what the hell would a therapist tell
me? Why would I not just, you know,

1529
01:32:10,121 --> 01:32:13,060
write in a journal or, or do something
like that? Do that too. Okay.

1530
01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:16,600
I write in a journal, which I
again, which I stopped doing again.

1531
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:20,980
The writing in the journal is like
yourself check cause I go back,

1532
01:32:20,981 --> 01:32:24,830
I was reading through my journal, I kept
a journal throughout the year, Kinda,

1533
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:27,100
but you know,
not as often as you should.

1534
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:30,550
And I was reading through it and I'm
like, wow, I'm even bullshitting myself.

1535
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:33,220
And this,
my last therapy session,

1536
01:32:33,221 --> 01:32:37,570
which is right before the
downward angle started,

1537
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:41,920
um, he said a few things to
me that needed to be said.

1538
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:46,270
And I kind of took it to heart. Like I
was like, Oh shit. But basically he said,

1539
01:32:46,271 --> 01:32:50,080
you're putting a lot of work into
be in Jody medic. And I was like,

1540
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:53,530
fuck you man. You don't even
know. You don't even know.

1541
01:32:53,531 --> 01:32:57,610
But to like listen, like this is over
a year ago. And right now I'm like,

1542
01:32:57,611 --> 01:33:00,880
I'm still like, ouch, that
hurt. But he was right.

1543
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:05,020
And it took me this whole time to get
to the point where I'm leveling off now.

1544
01:33:05,021 --> 01:33:08,560
But therapy is, you know, um,

1545
01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:14,950
I think I said this to you last night,
it's like tiger woods, tiger woods,

1546
01:33:14,951 --> 01:33:18,940
bad example on how to mitigate crisis
but had a golf coach his whole career.

1547
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:22,360
And guess when he started sucking,
when he stopped seeing his golf coach.

1548
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:26,410
No one is an expert on life.
Um,

1549
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,660
I didn't have PTSD when I got wounded.

1550
01:33:28,661 --> 01:33:33,310
I was cleared to different therapists and
a psychiatrist both said clear to PTSD,

1551
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:37,630
massive depression, which is normal
for losing even a loved one. Right.

1552
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:41,290
And when they you, when you lose a limb
they say it's like losing a loved one.

1553
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,260
So two loved ones died when
it, but whatever, whatever.

1554
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:49,930
But PTSD can come back. We in Canada
we call it operational stress injury,

1555
01:33:49,931 --> 01:33:52,900
which I was diagnosed with,
which is like an injury.

1556
01:33:52,901 --> 01:33:55,480
So if you sprain your ankle or
break your ankle, it's an injury.

1557
01:33:55,990 --> 01:34:00,910
One heals differently from the other right
left alone. They both lead to failure.

1558
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:05,440
Your ankle will completely deteriorate
and fall off and have to be cut out of

1559
01:34:05,441 --> 01:34:09,670
the body or replaced if you
don't treat it, if you're,

1560
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:13,960
um, I dunno, what do you guys
call the Humvee or what do
you call it? Truck. Yeah,

1561
01:34:13,961 --> 01:34:16,720
Humvee. Humvee. Palmer. If
you're a hammer blows and axle,

1562
01:34:16,721 --> 01:34:20,770
do you yell at it and tell, just toughen
up and go have a fucking drink? No,

1563
01:34:20,771 --> 01:34:22,550
you send it in for fucking maintenance.
Yeah.

1564
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,790
And I used to say this
to troops all the time.

1565
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:26,350
I'll say it again and I've said it before.

1566
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:30,640
I've said this to colonels and generals
like, Dude, man, if you need maintenance,

1567
01:34:30,641 --> 01:34:33,640
go and go to the fucking maintenance shop.
Which is in our case,

1568
01:34:33,641 --> 01:34:37,720
the fucking mind guy. I had a talk
with the chief of defense staff,

1569
01:34:37,721 --> 01:34:42,610
which is our not sect of a chief of staff,
of the chairman of the joint chiefs.

1570
01:34:42,611 --> 01:34:46,870
Yeah. And we were talking about combat
units and I said, well, you know,

1571
01:34:46,871 --> 01:34:51,550
and we were both getting on the floss
philosophy, nickel situs things. Um,

1572
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:55,660
Samurai used to meditate and practice
and they do practice calligraphy to

1573
01:34:55,661 --> 01:34:59,030
perfect it.
And the tea ain't a warrior.

1574
01:34:59,031 --> 01:35:03,140
Monks of Europe would
meditate or pray and fast.

1575
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:04,220
Um,

1576
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:09,220
the Mongolian hoards even had their
ceremonies where they purge the demons and

1577
01:35:10,311 --> 01:35:14,990
let it, uh, what do our modern soldiers
do? There's no self reflection.

1578
01:35:14,991 --> 01:35:19,690
There's no meditation. There's no, we got
to start from basic training. I've said,

1579
01:35:19,691 --> 01:35:22,250
and I don't know if I said this on the
last podcast, if I did, I apologize.

1580
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:25,970
I forgot my own advice again.
What's rice?

1581
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:29,570
Rice for your body. Oh, rest.

1582
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:32,900
Ice Compression.
Elevation.

1583
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:35,740
That's taught to you the first day
of basic training because you're on,

1584
01:35:35,741 --> 01:35:38,990
I remembered it. Ah, right.
But that's your vehicle, right?

1585
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:41,630
And your vehicle is your body
that gets you into combat,

1586
01:35:41,631 --> 01:35:44,210
which is where the unit needs you,
which is where your country wants you.

1587
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:45,950
What's race for the mind?

1588
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:50,660
And this is where we all as a society
have to go back and think about these

1589
01:35:50,661 --> 01:35:55,630
things like Jujitsu. Jujitsu
is, it is, it is surfing.

1590
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:58,760
But this is my point.
So when you go to a therapist,

1591
01:35:58,761 --> 01:36:03,080
if you have no Jujitsu in your life,
you don't have surfing,

1592
01:36:03,081 --> 01:36:05,870
you don't have calligraphy,
you don't know how to meditate.

1593
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:10,430
This could be the beginning of you
learning how to be of the beginning of

1594
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:14,060
learning rice for your mind. And that's
how I look at it. But even still,

1595
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:19,100
I know enough about medicine that I can
take care of myself for the most part

1596
01:36:19,101 --> 01:36:20,180
without going to the doctor.

1597
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:23,570
But guess what now and then I hit
something and I go, fuck, I need a doctor.

1598
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:29,240
So therapy doesn't mean you have to
go every week on order like clockwork,

1599
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:31,460
but have someone that you're,

1600
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:36,410
that's your therapist or
your psychiatrist or whoever,

1601
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:41,650
whatever level you need or you qualify
for and your benefits and that doesn't

1602
01:36:42,111 --> 01:36:46,700
mean you go see them all the time.
I had a guy that I saw when I had to,

1603
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:51,890
but a lot of it is up to you to the
individual is still a big part of this.

1604
01:36:51,891 --> 01:36:54,530
I as an individual,
this is where it hit me really hard.

1605
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:59,530
And when you heard the emotion in my
voice on the radio that day I stopped even

1606
01:36:59,691 --> 01:37:04,691
paying attention to myself and I
as an individual failed myself,

1607
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:10,130
my friends, Mike, Sorry, myself, my
family. So my daughters, my aunts, my mom,

1608
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:14,180
my dad, everyone who loves me for
who I am, no matter what I do.

1609
01:37:14,570 --> 01:37:19,550
And then I failed everyone around
me that, um, my friends, you guys,

1610
01:37:19,551 --> 01:37:23,270
and this is how you feel because
I didn't as an individual,

1611
01:37:23,271 --> 01:37:25,370
take ownership of the problem.

1612
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:30,740
So now I am and I'm going back to
therapy and born back to the gym.

1613
01:37:30,741 --> 01:37:33,140
I'm back on my diet. I know
I don't look it, but hey,

1614
01:37:33,141 --> 01:37:36,980
I'm on the road and you know those little
powdered donuts in the little thing

1615
01:37:36,981 --> 01:37:40,160
with a coffee while you're
driving. Delicious. Outstanding.

1616
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:42,830
You're talking about the chocolate
covered ones are the those ones too.

1617
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:47,230
I found those ones at a gas station and
like Texas somewhere and they are gone.

1618
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:51,170
That's a pro. We don't have those things
in Canada. They have them in America,

1619
01:37:51,171 --> 01:37:54,530
but Dunkin donut donuts might
be better than Tim Hortons.

1620
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:55,920
I'm going to go ahead and
say they're better. Oh,

1621
01:37:55,921 --> 01:37:57,570
Danny Canadian then wants to fight me.

1622
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:02,710
Tim Morton's is owned by a Brazilian
company now. So whatever the point is, um,

1623
01:38:02,730 --> 01:38:05,220
I'm getting back to that life that led me,

1624
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:09,540
that kept me in check because getting
your legs blown off as a rough go.

1625
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:15,360
And I'll tell you that right now, but
it's not impossible. But like any injury,

1626
01:38:15,361 --> 01:38:17,670
I have a spot in my back,
like mid back,

1627
01:38:17,671 --> 01:38:22,140
just below the shoulder blades that I hurt
when I was 14 and I felt didn't basic,

1628
01:38:22,141 --> 01:38:23,400
I felt that throughout my whole career.

1629
01:38:23,401 --> 01:38:27,480
But you work on the muscles around it
and you learn to mitigate its impact on

1630
01:38:27,481 --> 01:38:30,480
your daily life.
Mental injuries are the same.

1631
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:33,780
And I can tell you I was cleared of Ptsd,

1632
01:38:33,781 --> 01:38:36,090
which is like the extreme mental injury.

1633
01:38:36,091 --> 01:38:38,640
But I did have a mental
injury and I forgot that.

1634
01:38:38,641 --> 01:38:43,641
And then I had physical injuries on
top of it that I basically ignored.

1635
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:47,040
You know, like even the mayor of
Ottawa, he'd be like, hey Jody a,

1636
01:38:47,041 --> 01:38:48,360
your Olympian today,
what's going on?

1637
01:38:48,361 --> 01:38:50,280
I didn't think you're gonna
make it to this event.

1638
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:54,410
This is before the wheels fell off
I go, yeah, Mary, uh, you know,

1639
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:57,000
I was feeling a little pain and I
know I don't have to be here today,

1640
01:38:57,001 --> 01:38:59,940
but then I remembered, yeah, I'm not
a pussy, so I'm here. And he'd laugh.

1641
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:03,810
They're like, oh, Jody, you're
unique collocation, that's for sure.

1642
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:05,520
But what I'm saying is like,

1643
01:39:05,521 --> 01:39:09,180
I'm too stupid to stay home tonight so
that tomorrow morning I can feel better

1644
01:39:09,181 --> 01:39:11,760
and go to the gym and play with my
kids like that. You know what I mean?

1645
01:39:11,761 --> 01:39:15,000
Like it's too, too, too
tough to be that dumb.

1646
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:20,830
A lot of this clearly is ego.

1647
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:25,510
Oh Bro, you go as a motherfucker.
And it's funny because,

1648
01:39:25,511 --> 01:39:26,950
and I talk about this all the time,

1649
01:39:26,951 --> 01:39:31,951
but like obviously you wouldn't be who
you were and have done what you've done

1650
01:39:33,731 --> 01:39:36,640
if you didn't have an ego that drove you,
that made you want to be the, I mean,

1651
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:41,380
why would anyone subject themselves
to going to sniper school of, yeah,

1652
01:39:41,390 --> 01:39:44,650
it sounds like a cool job. It's, it's
a shitty job at socks. It's hard to do,

1653
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:47,230
but guess what? Your Ego, you're like, I
want to do that. I want to do the best.

1654
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:50,710
Donny Walberg shows you the sexiest part
of the job, which is shoot bad guys,

1655
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:55,360
which is like so rare by the way.
Like yeah,

1656
01:39:55,450 --> 01:39:59,410
the rest of the job saw so,
so you wouldn't have done,

1657
01:39:59,411 --> 01:40:03,160
I mean that the books, the politicians,
the pocket, everything that you've done,

1658
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:05,350
there's, there's some element
of ego that drives it.

1659
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:08,350
Obviously you want to serve and it will,
you wouldn't be if it was just pure ego,

1660
01:40:08,650 --> 01:40:11,680
you wouldn't be able to do it either
because you have to have the will to serve

1661
01:40:11,681 --> 01:40:15,760
and a desire to serve your
country and your brothers in arms.

1662
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:18,700
So that's true too.
But to take it to the next level,

1663
01:40:18,701 --> 01:40:20,900
you've got to have some
ego driving and then what?

1664
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:26,060
That's that thing that can drive you to
success can also drag you down when you

1665
01:40:26,381 --> 01:40:29,560
start saying, I can do anything. I can
get through this. I can get through this.

1666
01:40:29,561 --> 01:40:31,450
I don't need any help.
I can keep on this path.

1667
01:40:31,451 --> 01:40:34,810
I can quit drinking whenever I want. Those
are all things that your, your, your,

1668
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:36,180
your,
your ego is your

1669
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:40,590
biggest enemy, but you are your
own biggest critic as well.

1670
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:44,760
Jocko, I'm sure you have these
thoughts like any other human being.

1671
01:40:44,761 --> 01:40:47,280
Like if I fail anyone today,

1672
01:40:47,281 --> 01:40:51,720
the person I don't want to fail is
myself because you have an expectation of

1673
01:40:51,721 --> 01:40:54,580
yourself. And I know, I know enough
about you and I've, you know,

1674
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:56,140
we are the enough of the same guy.

1675
01:40:56,141 --> 01:40:59,950
As much as we are different that the
biggest person I'm trying to live up to

1676
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:04,440
expectations or my own. So when you
get up at 4:00 AM every day again,

1677
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:08,470
God dammit. I wish I could, but I'm
not built that Bro. I like to sleep.

1678
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:13,270
I don't have to, if I don't want to do
anyway. But they'd see, listen, right now,

1679
01:41:13,271 --> 01:41:17,140
like I can get up at three 30 the fuck
wanted to. Okay. I just don't want to,

1680
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:21,370
I don't have to. I can get all my shit
done in eight hours. Cake Jocko. Uh,

1681
01:41:21,371 --> 01:41:24,700
but your ego is the one that goes,
I can do that.

1682
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:26,980
And then your critic is the one
that goes and he can't bitch.

1683
01:41:28,210 --> 01:41:30,610
And if you fail,

1684
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:33,880
the first critic that's they're looking
at is the one when you look in the

1685
01:41:33,881 --> 01:41:37,060
mirror and you go, I would do
it, man. I would fucking do.

1686
01:41:37,061 --> 01:41:40,700
I would look in the mirror. I stopped
like the like, cause you know I like,

1687
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:41,740
I keep a bit of a beard.

1688
01:41:41,741 --> 01:41:45,700
Most Times my beard got big and then it
started growing in here and that's when

1689
01:41:45,701 --> 01:41:49,240
you know something's up with somebody
when the group, no, I'm serious right now.

1690
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:52,900
I know. That's like, cause I
wouldn't look in the mirror. Yeah,

1691
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:56,080
because when I looked in the
mirror, I, I saw somebody who went,

1692
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:01,480
you drank last night again, didn't
you? Fucking loser. Good job. Yeah.

1693
01:42:01,481 --> 01:42:03,970
Why don't you shower and go and work.

1694
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:06,741
So this,

1695
01:42:06,741 --> 01:42:09,580
this started coming in because even if
I looked in the mirror is just enough to

1696
01:42:09,581 --> 01:42:13,420
be okay. I'm not a complete mess.
Run out the door. My hair grew.

1697
01:42:14,370 --> 01:42:16,420
It's, it's, it's weird
man. I can, I'm going,

1698
01:42:16,450 --> 01:42:18,240
I'm trying to write this down because I,

1699
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:22,630
even if it doesn't come out
for anybody but myself, it's,

1700
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:24,040
yeah,

1701
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:27,820
I didn't go through with the legs losing
the legs and I did go through losing my

1702
01:42:27,821 --> 01:42:31,510
legs again, but whole other thing,
bunch of stuff was happening,

1703
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:35,470
like realizing,
I know I said to soldier is dead,

1704
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:40,860
but maybe I didn't really realize and
I had all these people looking up to me

1705
01:42:43,181 --> 01:42:47,080
and also turning to me to have,
okay,

1706
01:42:47,081 --> 01:42:50,530
hey my buddy's in trouble.
Go talk to Jodi,

1707
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:54,220
this guys that she's in trouble like and
you're taking on all this other stuff.

1708
01:42:54,221 --> 01:42:58,900
And honestly man self, I
don't know what they call it.

1709
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:03,100
Self care I think is what they call it.
Self care is your first priority.

1710
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:05,160
Self-Aid we call it self self.

1711
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:07,210
But that's like your first
person you got to take care of.

1712
01:43:07,211 --> 01:43:09,850
And luckily my daughters are
so awesome that, you know,

1713
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:13,030
I talked to them on the trip every day
and like you okay when you get back. Yeah,

1714
01:43:13,090 --> 01:43:15,580
we'll, we'll, we'll kick it off
right where we left it off. But

1715
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:21,100
they're the first ones that are going
to forgive you if you asked for it.

1716
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:25,360
And so I've asked my daughters, I told
him daddy's going through some stuff.

1717
01:43:25,361 --> 01:43:28,480
Right. You've noticed they're both
like, yeah, cause kids don't get,

1718
01:43:28,580 --> 01:43:30,940
you don't give a shit echo.
You've got kids, right? Yes. Yeah.

1719
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:33,200
How many you got again to their,

1720
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:36,190
their first ones going to tell you when
they were the first ones to tell me like,

1721
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:39,340
hey, how come you're not coming around
as much as you said you would like.

1722
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,940
God dammit. Daddy's really busy. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. You've always been busy.

1723
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:46,960
We want to go to the park.
Um, but yeah, man, I'm on,

1724
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:49,870
I'm just trying to rebuild everything and,
and stay,

1725
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:53,210
stay on the finally I think,

1726
01:43:53,211 --> 01:43:57,680
I hope when I'm 50 I'm not going through
something again because by then I'm

1727
01:43:57,681 --> 01:44:00,050
just going to be tooled to want to
deal with Shit, you know? I'm like,

1728
01:44:00,051 --> 01:44:01,670
I'm not saying that's old,
I'm just saying like,

1729
01:44:01,671 --> 01:44:04,340
you should have your shit together
by the time you're 50 I think.

1730
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:08,720
Or maybe I will, but at least I'll have
these lessons learned over the last,

1731
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:12,200
since 2007 or so.
You're trying to write these down.

1732
01:44:12,201 --> 01:44:14,120
You mean you're writing down what
you're going through right now?

1733
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:18,920
I'm writing it down and also because I am
in the position I'm in, right? You know,

1734
01:44:18,921 --> 01:44:22,520
we're, we're authors now out of
anything else, like we talked,

1735
01:44:22,521 --> 01:44:24,470
we talked about this last night,
doesn't make us artists,

1736
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:28,250
but Kinda does write writing is an art.
Um,

1737
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,420
but people, if people can learn
from what I'm going through,

1738
01:44:32,421 --> 01:44:34,820
and I know others have
written books and done the,

1739
01:44:34,821 --> 01:44:36,020
gone through the exact same thing,

1740
01:44:36,021 --> 01:44:40,250
but we all have a unique way of presenting
things. Maybe I turn it into a lesson,

1741
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:42,740
maybe I turn it into something I read.

1742
01:44:42,741 --> 01:44:45,500
Like I've read your book
four times since it came out.

1743
01:44:46,010 --> 01:44:48,200
I'm rereading Tim Ferriss's book again,

1744
01:44:48,201 --> 01:44:52,430
a four hour work week because that's the
direction of life that I would like to

1745
01:44:52,431 --> 01:44:56,210
go in politics or not
like doing it your way,

1746
01:44:56,211 --> 01:44:59,840
but in a way that's smarter, not
harder. And in the army, right?

1747
01:44:59,841 --> 01:45:03,050
We learn there's the smart way.
There's the hard way.

1748
01:45:03,051 --> 01:45:05,180
And then there's the
army way or in the navy,

1749
01:45:05,181 --> 01:45:08,600
I'm sure it's the same and
sometimes none of them make sense,

1750
01:45:08,930 --> 01:45:13,790
but you get it done. But I, you know,
I want to spend more time on myself,

1751
01:45:13,791 --> 01:45:18,680
my kids, my loved ones,
my friends. And I think,

1752
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:19,390
and I said,

1753
01:45:19,390 --> 01:45:22,370
it sounds a little conceited and a
little bit egotistical and a little bit

1754
01:45:22,371 --> 01:45:25,550
selfish, but I've realized
that getting my legs blown off,

1755
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:27,430
maybe I've earned the right to just do it,

1756
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:31,250
kind of what I want a little bit
more than I did in the last 10 years.

1757
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:34,220
And I want to hang out with my friends,

1758
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:38,780
do something constructive for society
still. But if I want to go shoot,

1759
01:45:38,781 --> 01:45:42,220
I want to go shoot. If I want to
drive my car across America long,

1760
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:43,100
I just want to do that.

1761
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:47,300
And I think I've earned the right to have
a little bit of flexibility in life to

1762
01:45:47,301 --> 01:45:51,500
just throw my kids in the car and go,
well, I actually know you've earned that.

1763
01:45:51,501 --> 01:45:53,730
Right. And, uh, I told you that
the first day I met you whenever,

1764
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:56,420
when you were talking about what you're
doing. And I was like, man, you're,

1765
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:59,570
you're doing way more than I'd
be doing. You know, I'd be,

1766
01:45:59,571 --> 01:46:01,790
I'd be spending a lot of times my kids,
but you know,

1767
01:46:01,791 --> 01:46:05,450
you have goals and aspirations and,
and you've achieved those, you know,

1768
01:46:05,451 --> 01:46:08,480
and you've done a great job up there
and, and so that's good. You know,

1769
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:12,530
it's awesome to see. And if that changed
directions and now you can focus on,

1770
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:17,180
you know, taking care of your family,
taking care of yourself, which yeah.

1771
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:19,670
Have you earned it? How? Yeah,
you've earned it, man. Well,

1772
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:25,610
I think what we always forget and what
I forgot and I've continuously have to

1773
01:46:25,611 --> 01:46:29,570
remind myself is I'm the beginning
and the end of everything in my world.

1774
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:34,850
And that sounds like a self, uh, what do
you call itself? Self fulfilling prophecy?

1775
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:38,870
No, no, no, no. Self involved.

1776
01:46:38,871 --> 01:46:39,980
A little too self involved.

1777
01:46:39,981 --> 01:46:44,450
But if I'm not up and ready to go at 8:00
AM my kids don't get to school on time.

1778
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:46,050
And if my kids are late,

1779
01:46:46,051 --> 01:46:49,320
their teacher's mad at them and then it's
a snowball in their life. If I'm late,

1780
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:53,850
they wonder where I am. If, if I'm not at
the office, my staff has to tell someone,

1781
01:46:53,851 --> 01:46:57,540
hey, where's counselor medic? Uh, he's not
here right now. Where is he? I don't know.

1782
01:46:57,930 --> 01:46:59,940
Or they may have to make
them a bullshit excuse.

1783
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:04,890
And even if you tell them your job is
to lie for your boss, no, no, it's not.

1784
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,860
Your job is be on to work on time Jody.

1785
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:13,240
So self care and self help
and all that stuff is,

1786
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:17,100
and taking care of yourself
is the beginning of taking
care of everyone that you

1787
01:47:17,101 --> 01:47:18,720
feel you have a duty to.
Yeah.

1788
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:23,400
And that's ultimately what I wanted to
talk about here and what I want. You know,

1789
01:47:23,401 --> 01:47:24,360
so you know,
when I,

1790
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:26,880
when I bust your balls about getting
up at three 30 in the morning,

1791
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:31,170
that's what Jocko does to make sure that
everything in Jockos life falls into

1792
01:47:31,171 --> 01:47:33,180
place for those. You have four kids, Bro.

1793
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:34,890
I don't know how you
keep up with them all.

1794
01:47:35,310 --> 01:47:38,550
I only have two and I can barely
do it. And, and so what I'm saying,

1795
01:47:38,551 --> 01:47:40,410
when I go back to my,
having my legs blown off,

1796
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:45,000
earns me the right to be
a little bit selfish about
what I do with my time. Well,

1797
01:47:45,001 --> 01:47:47,010
I'm going to be selfish and
take care of myself more,

1798
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:51,640
which I haven't for a decade.
Well, I would expand that to,

1799
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:55,110
to really to everybody.
I'm going to tell you what I mean.

1800
01:47:55,800 --> 01:48:00,370
You owe it to yourself, everybody,
whether you've been wounded or not, right.

1801
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:03,330
Wherever you are in life,
because the fact of what you just said,

1802
01:48:03,331 --> 01:48:07,140
you got to remember this.
If you don't take care of yourself,

1803
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,380
you can't take care of the
other people around. Right? And,

1804
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:13,280
and so you have to take care of yourself.
My simple thing,

1805
01:48:13,350 --> 01:48:16,690
and my wife knows this about me,
like if I don't work out, I'm,

1806
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:21,180
I'm not. Uh, I'm not, I'm not, I'm
not the same person right now. Good.

1807
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:25,950
[inaudible] you know, but, but really,
if I'm not taking care of my health,

1808
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:30,540
then everything else kind of
starts falling apart. And so yeah,

1809
01:48:30,541 --> 01:48:32,880
you've got to take care of yourself.
And if you don't take care of yourself,

1810
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:34,980
then you can't take care of
the people that you care about.

1811
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:37,170
And so that's the duty really.

1812
01:48:37,171 --> 01:48:40,020
And that's what I wanted to talk about
a little bit today and what I was saying

1813
01:48:40,021 --> 01:48:43,590
before about if you're feeling it
pull over and that's the thing,

1814
01:48:43,591 --> 01:48:46,710
like you can't expect anything
of anyone else if you can't,

1815
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:50,490
if you can't show up at work on time,
like why should you,

1816
01:48:50,491 --> 01:48:53,850
your staff and if you don't
take care of yourself then,

1817
01:48:53,890 --> 01:48:58,020
then why should you expect to
take care of anyone else. And

1818
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,790
we all have support, you know, and
I'm, I'm, I know him, I don't know,

1819
01:49:02,791 --> 01:49:06,200
I'm hammering this little
too hard, but dude, I'm, I'm,

1820
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:08,940
I'm learning a hard lesson
here and I'm trying to avoid,

1821
01:49:09,330 --> 01:49:11,850
we all I think have to learn
it, but there's like, there's,

1822
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:15,330
you can learn it harder than others and
I think I'm learning it the really hard

1823
01:49:15,331 --> 01:49:18,750
way because I am a public person,
like,

1824
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:22,740
like a private in a,
in Canada we call them blogging.

1825
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,820
Blogging is like Smith in the army so
if blogging is having a rough time,

1826
01:49:26,821 --> 01:49:29,190
he doesn't have to go on
the radio until the world.

1827
01:49:29,191 --> 01:49:31,650
He doesn't have to go on the
Jocko podcast and tell the world,

1828
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:35,580
but he has to tell somebody and
that's the biggest thing you think.

1829
01:49:35,610 --> 01:49:39,570
You think it's scary to go to a therapist
who is a trained professional like

1830
01:49:39,930 --> 01:49:43,800
think of a therapist like going to the
rifle range and learning from the masters

1831
01:49:43,801 --> 01:49:45,350
sniper.
That's what you're doing.

1832
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:48,250
You're going to learn how to
shoot except for for your mind,

1833
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:52,360
would you not go to the range to learn
from a master sniper if you want to be a

1834
01:49:52,361 --> 01:49:54,100
better shot,
of course you fucking would.

1835
01:49:54,101 --> 01:49:57,580
I F I'm a master sniper and I'd go to
the range and learn from Masters Navy

1836
01:49:57,581 --> 01:50:02,200
right now. That's what a therapist or
psychiatrist or psychologist or counselor,

1837
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:06,190
any of them are professionals
in the mental game of life.

1838
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:09,820
Now I'm not saying all are equal as well.
If you don't like one,

1839
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:11,650
fire him and get a different one,

1840
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:16,570
but start there and start looking for the
help that's available and don't put it

1841
01:50:16,571 --> 01:50:20,470
all on yourself. And again, if you think
that's embarrassing, going to a stranger,

1842
01:50:20,471 --> 01:50:23,650
which is actually pretty easy when
you actually get in the room and start

1843
01:50:23,651 --> 01:50:24,940
talking,
you find you might,

1844
01:50:24,941 --> 01:50:28,960
they might have told you to shut
up because the hours up. Um,

1845
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:33,880
try going on the radio or
the Jocko podcast or writing
a book like a, you know,

1846
01:50:33,881 --> 01:50:38,881
I put out a lot of my warts in that book
too and I'm still learning and I've got

1847
01:50:40,661 --> 01:50:45,430
all these resources so you know, it's not,
it's not, it's not. No one's too proud.

1848
01:50:45,431 --> 01:50:48,610
No one's too tough.
And I'm about done like talking.

1849
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:50,350
Let's talk about something
fun right now bro.

1850
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:54,880
No, it's all good man. I
think you know I'm, I'm,

1851
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:56,960
as we were talking and I didn't,

1852
01:50:56,961 --> 01:50:59,270
I didn't know if we were gonna do a
podcast or not when you came down here.

1853
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:00,460
I didn't know if you want
to talk about in this stuff,

1854
01:51:00,550 --> 01:51:03,120
we're just going to hang out.
I appreciate this cause the whole drive,

1855
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:06,640
I've been thinking and talking to
myself and listening to other podcasts,

1856
01:51:06,641 --> 01:51:08,410
I'm like,
I needed to do this.

1857
01:51:08,510 --> 01:51:12,390
Yeah, and really like what
you're saying is going to,

1858
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:16,040
it's obviously it's going to help people,
especially the idea,

1859
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:19,700
and I'm glad you talked about this a
little bit, you kind of food in there,

1860
01:51:19,701 --> 01:51:21,560
but like looking at
yourself in the mirror,

1861
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:25,040
looking at yourself in the mirror and
saying to yourself, you know what?

1862
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:26,870
I need some fire support here.

1863
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:30,230
I'm going to reach out and I'm going to
get it from some people and there's not

1864
01:51:30,231 --> 01:51:32,360
a damn thing in the world in
the world wrong with that.

1865
01:51:33,110 --> 01:51:38,000
And that's how you sort of,
that was the thing.

1866
01:51:38,001 --> 01:51:40,130
That was the thing that made
you go, okay, I need help.

1867
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:41,300
I'm gonna go make this happen.

1868
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:45,800
And so it may be that can help some
other people that aren't feeling too good

1869
01:51:45,801 --> 01:51:49,460
right now. Go look in the mirror and admit
to yourself, you've got some problems.

1870
01:51:49,550 --> 01:51:51,260
Maybe the problems are a
little bit bigger than you.

1871
01:51:51,470 --> 01:51:53,600
We've been in combat situations
that were bigger than us.

1872
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:56,300
You have to call in fire support.
There's nothing wrong with it.

1873
01:51:56,301 --> 01:51:57,950
There's no shame in it.
Go make it happen.

1874
01:51:58,010 --> 01:52:01,280
Yeah. And uh, and take care
of yourself. Take ownership.

1875
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:06,660
Extreme ownership. I like
the way you think. Ah, know.

1876
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:11,100
Um, yeah, I think that's a good place,
man. I think that's a good place to chill.

1877
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:13,860
If we want to talk about something
different, we can do that really easily.

1878
01:52:13,861 --> 01:52:17,460
All we do is we just ask echo to talk
for a little bit. Yeah. Getting some,

1879
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:21,570
some philosophy stuff. Charles.
Yes. You, uh, you know,

1880
01:52:21,571 --> 01:52:24,630
we want to talk about something good.
Can you talk about something good?

1881
01:52:24,631 --> 01:52:29,631
Like maybe how to support ourselves and
if someone wants maybe how someone could

1882
01:52:29,881 --> 01:52:34,380
support this podcast if they want,
which we should,

1883
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:38,610
yeah. Juggle Krill oil and
joint warfare. Here's the thing.

1884
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:41,160
You know how like my joints have
been hurting me lately. Yeah.

1885
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:45,920
And sometimes you can be to some joint
warfare for sure. Yeah. It helps.

1886
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:50,370
Not In a non drug fair far
pharmaceutical way. It's good. Yeah.

1887
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,670
It's interesting.
But it does work,

1888
01:52:52,671 --> 01:52:54,830
especially if you're getting
physical and whatnot.

1889
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:59,630
General joint disintegration
or degeneration. Degeneration,

1890
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:01,890
not disintegration. Yeah, I don't,

1891
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:05,430
I don't know how much you would tell with
this integration. Nonetheless, Jocko.

1892
01:53:05,431 --> 01:53:08,360
Some supplements, they're good
supplements. Therefore your joints.

1893
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:12,470
One is Krill oil. Super Krill
oil. The other one's called joint.

1894
01:53:12,471 --> 01:53:17,030
Where for glucosomine could
Jordan. Yes. Curcumin and curcumin.

1895
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:20,450
Desperate like cartilage. It's
all right. It's joint war. No,

1896
01:53:20,451 --> 01:53:25,040
cause you know how like when your
meniscus or like your elbow like big words

1897
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:29,120
just talk about, I'm telling you this
is, this is the truth, the real deal.

1898
01:53:29,630 --> 01:53:32,600
So if I take this,
the knee I tweaked the other night,

1899
01:53:33,250 --> 01:53:37,470
this will help it with the meniscus
around my kneecap. Yes. The, the,

1900
01:53:37,471 --> 01:53:40,430
the joint warfare will
I'm into it. Yeah. Fully.

1901
01:53:40,970 --> 01:53:44,450
Also what we kind of talked about earlier,

1902
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:47,720
Jocko discipline preworkout
we call it pre workout,

1903
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:51,200
but it's a pretty mission
cause as cognitive enhancers.

1904
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:58,400
Pretty mission. I love this.
Jodi's checking it out, fired
up about it nonetheless.

1905
01:53:58,401 --> 01:54:02,360
That's good. That's good for anything
you're about to do. So we say pre workout,

1906
01:54:02,361 --> 01:54:06,900
it can be pre study, pre
exam, pretest, three,

1907
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:11,420
uh, three podcasts, podcast, whatever
you, whatever you like. It's good.

1908
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:16,160
Unless you can get two scoops. Don't
be a pussy. Take two scoops guys.

1909
01:54:16,161 --> 01:54:20,020
I come on led. What are we saying here?
Sorry. Sorry. No, not at all. I had,

1910
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:24,560
I had a real long right.
The other night of of work.

1911
01:54:24,561 --> 01:54:29,320
Did you take them and I took three. Yeah.
Yeah. What do you normally take? Two.

1912
01:54:29,950 --> 01:54:33,300
Two. So what do you, what are
you weighing in now to 20 no,

1913
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:39,120
probably two 32 32 scoops
is enough for you? Yeah,

1914
01:54:39,170 --> 01:54:42,100
yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So I'll
stick to two scoops for now. Yeah.

1915
01:54:42,230 --> 01:54:44,750
But I might ramp it up to four
if I really have to be careful.

1916
01:54:45,530 --> 01:54:48,770
Make sure you have something
to do like a project.

1917
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:52,640
Like don't just take like writing a
bucket. Yeah. That's due to right. No,

1918
01:54:52,641 --> 01:54:55,850
that's a great time. Yeah. If you have
to. Right. And then do you find it,

1919
01:54:55,851 --> 01:55:00,440
does it make you jittery? No,
no, no. [inaudible] smooth.
But you got the energy.

1920
01:55:00,620 --> 01:55:05,000
It's got caffeine is pretty low. Caffeine
is very low. The same caffeine is Jocko.

1921
01:55:05,001 --> 01:55:08,570
White tea is the same amount, so per
scoop. So you'll get double that.

1922
01:55:08,571 --> 01:55:10,010
But it's not.
It's 15 milligrams,

1923
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:15,350
so it's meant to not make you all jittery
because you can't, that's not good.

1924
01:55:15,351 --> 01:55:18,680
Everything else I'm reading in here and
what little I do know about nutrition.

1925
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:23,500
This is all stuff for focus and
longterm, like energy release. Yes.

1926
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:28,310
The only thing missing that I, I don't,
I don't know. Science is B vitamin.

1927
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:32,140
Is that in there already?
Missing it. That's what I know.

1928
01:55:32,410 --> 01:55:36,280
So turning 40 means I have to wear
glasses now too, by the way. Perfect.

1929
01:55:36,281 --> 01:55:37,114
I know what to smaller,

1930
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:41,690
my perfect just in case sniper vision
I think is good for long distance,

1931
01:55:41,691 --> 01:55:45,660
but now I'm like my dad. I'm like,
yeah, you got to find the sweet spot.

1932
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:47,090
That's what it is in there,
right?

1933
01:55:47,210 --> 01:55:51,000
Because your eyes can't like f l
two S or whatever. I'll be taking,

1934
01:55:51,001 --> 01:55:53,580
can I have a case? You can have that
right. The street. I'll just keep,

1935
01:55:53,790 --> 01:55:56,700
I'll just keep this right here.
Actually. That's good. And surprisingly,

1936
01:55:56,701 --> 01:55:57,390
tastes good.

1937
01:55:57,390 --> 01:56:00,990
You wouldn't expect doctors to be like
[inaudible] very hyper about making

1938
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:05,400
things taste tastes like crap.
Then my life is hard.

1939
01:56:05,401 --> 01:56:09,690
Food should be tasty. Yeah. I dig it
and I understand that. But you would,

1940
01:56:09,740 --> 01:56:11,520
why chalk then you can drink.

1941
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:14,980
So you're saying it's out of character
for me to watch them in line.

1942
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:18,360
I think that's the dichotomy of you,
cause I heard that before.

1943
01:56:18,361 --> 01:56:21,890
Even like with how you said you don't
drink coffee, you're like, I just,

1944
01:56:21,891 --> 01:56:25,050
I don't like the taste of coffee. Why
would I drink? I'm like, oh, all right.

1945
01:56:25,051 --> 01:56:28,160
You don't like there's taste not rough.
You don't like the taste.

1946
01:56:28,161 --> 01:56:31,770
You don't like the taste. Right.
And I made fun of when I did drink,

1947
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:36,180
my friends who drink beer because that's
Canadian is to drink beer and I'm like,

1948
01:56:36,181 --> 01:56:39,900
beer tastes like shit. I'll drink
cider. Ooh, the apple juice. I'm like,

1949
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:43,370
it's got more alcohol than beer bitch.
Like it's what,

1950
01:56:43,390 --> 01:56:46,500
what do you like if he doesn't
like coffee? He likes white tee.

1951
01:56:46,501 --> 01:56:49,930
I think white t sucks, but
I'm not Jocko, we got this,

1952
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:55,430
I'm making this protein powder right
now and like criteria number one was you

1953
01:56:56,381 --> 01:56:57,690
had has to be good protein and all that.

1954
01:56:57,690 --> 01:57:02,370
But the strong second criteria was
it's got to tastes so damn good.

1955
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:07,980
Which I forget you're drinking protein.
I the first sample tasted really good.

1956
01:57:07,981 --> 01:57:10,920
Like I was shocked at how good the first
substrate. We tweaked it a little bit.

1957
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:15,090
The second sample came back. It tastes
even better. I mean, one, hang on,

1958
01:57:15,091 --> 01:57:18,000
how much sugar we talking,
there's no sugar. Oh No,

1959
01:57:18,001 --> 01:57:21,120
there's no guy that used to be
the trick. Just proteins. So good,

1960
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:23,910
but it's 30 grams of sugar,
no sugar,

1961
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:26,910
and then the F we've got
one more coming back,

1962
01:57:26,911 --> 01:57:31,460
but the second iteration of it
tastes delicious and equity.

1963
01:57:31,461 --> 01:57:35,430
The samples left no echoes yesterday.
He's like, he's like, well, you know,

1964
01:57:35,431 --> 01:57:37,140
I don't never really liked
protein powder, and I'm like, Bro,

1965
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:39,450
this has nothing to do with you
wanting to drink protein powder.

1966
01:57:39,451 --> 01:57:41,680
You'll be drinking this like
you want a drink. It'd be like,

1967
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,830
it'd be like chocolate milk. It's so good.
Yes. Yeah, so we'll see about that one.

1968
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:48,840
That one.
It's where can you get all this Shit Echo?

1969
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:52,170
The proof is going to be
in the pudding as they say,

1970
01:57:52,710 --> 01:57:54,960
or Jim [inaudible] dot com
that's where you get it.

1971
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:58,350
also@originmain.com you can get you,

1972
01:57:58,351 --> 01:58:02,610
we'll get Keith rash guards
is for Jujitsu by the way.

1973
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:06,900
Oh yes sir. Made in America.
I know Jody is from Canada.

1974
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:11,160
Better than made in somewhere else. Yeah,
I know a lot of us have a candidate.

1975
01:58:11,161 --> 01:58:14,190
We don't have time to make geese
and stuff like make it in America.

1976
01:58:14,191 --> 01:58:16,110
There's 10 times more people down here.
Yeah,

1977
01:58:16,111 --> 01:58:20,380
I dig it and all this stuff on there.
It's made in America. That's good. Yep.

1978
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:22,800
Go there.
See if you want something,

1979
01:58:22,801 --> 01:58:26,370
get something good way to
support also fitness gear.

1980
01:58:27,650 --> 01:58:31,530
Jocko got a new kettle bell that
is heavier than mine. Does it?

1981
01:58:31,531 --> 01:58:35,150
His head is it, is it, is it your
little head that you got on this?

1982
01:58:35,151 --> 01:58:37,350
They might as well be doing.
My Dad is the greatest.

1983
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:38,940
If nothing else comes from this,

1984
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:42,810
from this little Avatar of you because
I want him to Jocko approved like an

1985
01:58:42,850 --> 01:58:47,530
amulet of your head. Yeah. This shirt.
It has one right in the back. Okay, cool.

1986
01:58:48,570 --> 01:58:51,250
Yeah, it's good. Yeah. They'd
kettle bell should be his head.

1987
01:58:51,251 --> 01:58:55,180
Cause the reason he got it was
because I had a heavier Kettlebell by

1988
01:58:55,181 --> 01:58:59,260
happenstance. By the way, I didn't
get there. Everyone just, sorry.

1989
01:58:59,261 --> 01:59:01,930
Is this a Kettlebell I can buy from Jocko?

1990
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:05,080
Jocko bought a bag or your
kettle was about to say,

1991
01:59:05,081 --> 01:59:07,780
which it reminds me every time I'm
about to talk about kettlebells.

1992
01:59:07,781 --> 01:59:10,680
Kettlebells I have, you know the ones
from Onnit. Yeah, I got all of them. Yeah,

1993
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:15,220
me too. Except I don't have
the big foot one, two bad eggs.

1994
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:18,610
I can't pick that one up. It's just
too heavy. Yeah. Prosthetics. Yeah.

1995
01:59:18,611 --> 01:59:21,490
No I dig it and I haven't picked
up anything for over a year anyway.

1996
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:25,210
So that's what I was trying to imply to
Jocko that like since mine is heavy I

1997
01:59:25,211 --> 01:59:28,160
can pick it up. He can't pick it up,
et cetera. Two pounds. Everything is.

1998
01:59:28,510 --> 01:59:32,290
So that's why he got the heavier one.
Roger that. Yeah, I'm tracking now.

1999
01:59:32,291 --> 01:59:35,370
I'm dragging her in six pounds.
Yeah. Congratulations. Yeah.

2000
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:39,280
Cause this was a custom made kettlebell.
No. Got It from rogue fitness. Rogue,

2001
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:42,340
right? Yeah. My boys at rogue fitness.
But it's like made in America.

2002
01:59:42,341 --> 01:59:46,840
It's like the boring round one. You know,
you said you have the, um, I got the ones.

2003
01:59:46,841 --> 01:59:49,540
Yeah. That's why I thought you meant
the Jocko was coming out with a,

2004
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:52,830
with a Kettlebell. I, she will obviously
it's going to be shaped like Jockos.

2005
01:59:52,930 --> 01:59:54,430
[inaudible]. That's my, that's my,

2006
01:59:54,431 --> 01:59:59,080
because they could do that and now I think
a product was just born. Yeah. Maybe.

2007
01:59:59,081 --> 02:00:03,010
Actually someone, someone said that a
couple of times. Anyway. I agree. I agree.

2008
02:00:03,190 --> 02:00:05,740
It was the longest commercial.
Everybody, it's not a commercial you,

2009
02:00:05,741 --> 02:00:09,520
we deviated from the commercial to
Roger, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No,

2010
02:00:09,521 --> 02:00:13,060
we're supposed to do that.
Okay. That's part of the
Deere, right? I know. I forgot.

2011
02:00:13,061 --> 02:00:16,120
I told you I'm in basic training
for life again. Nonetheless.

2012
02:00:16,330 --> 02:00:19,000
Back to the kettlebells.
If you get kettlebells.

2013
02:00:20,230 --> 02:00:20,720
Yeah.

2014
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:24,400
In a way that's not competitive with
your friend or if it's competitive with

2015
02:00:24,401 --> 02:00:27,160
your friend, whatever, the ones from
on it. That's the cool ones. Judy,

2016
02:00:27,161 --> 02:00:30,340
as a whole set. I have the whole set.
If you have the whole set, you're cool.

2017
02:00:30,341 --> 02:00:35,170
Like us, not like Jocko. Also
when you get Jody's new book,

2018
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:38,530
of course chocolate's book.
Any of the books we read,

2019
02:00:38,630 --> 02:00:40,270
go or go over on the podcast.

2020
02:00:40,510 --> 02:00:45,190
I made it easy for you got a section on
the website? Yeah. Books from the website.

the way. Nice. Speak through there.

2022
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:52,240
Get them through there. Real easy.
A good way to support as well.

2023
02:00:52,390 --> 02:00:54,430
That'll take you to Amazon.
Just say sorry real quick.

2024
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:59,140
Unflinching the making of a Canadian
sniper and everyday heroes. Yeah,

2025
02:00:59,141 --> 02:01:00,800
my two books. They'll both
be on the website. Yeah.

2026
02:01:00,890 --> 02:01:05,140
Write down your website and they are
available through Amazon and what's the

2027
02:01:05,141 --> 02:01:09,060
kindle? They have recalls on kindle.

Well I'll have it all on the website,
so yeah, when you get that boom,

2030
02:01:16,721 --> 02:01:19,450

for you. Fence, good way to support.

2031

Amazon to buy your weed whackers and what

2032
02:01:24,401 --> 02:01:28,120
else? We buy an Amazon. Go ahead

as far as subscribing those,

2036

02:01:43,821 --> 02:01:47,150
Some people they listen to Google play.
Can you subscribe on Google play though?

2039
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:51,590
Okay. That's what I was getting at. I
don't know where else I get to spend.

2040
02:01:51,610 --> 02:01:55,340
It's the same thing. Yes, I do that and
then now there's different apps now.

2041
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:59,660
Like they're basically stopped.
You're confusing. This is, okay.

2042
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:02,000
Consider it this way and I,
this is, I'm new to this too.

2043
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:05,300
Where iTunes when you think podcasts.
Yeah,

2044
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:07,940
I iPod podcasts.

2045
02:02:08,150 --> 02:02:12,080
So podcasts are exclusive to iTunes.
It just feels that way. Right.

2046
02:02:12,110 --> 02:02:15,320
Where do you listen to podcasts? Well,
on iTunes obviously. Here's the thing,

2047
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:19,430
podcast, the podcast, just cause I
tuned has, it's like if you watch out,

2048
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:23,900
if I just went to the website, what's
your website again? Jocko podcast.com.

2049
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:27,800
So if I go to Java, podcast.com could
I listen straight from the podcast?

2050
02:02:27,801 --> 02:02:32,690
From the story? From the website? Yes. On
my computer. Yes. Bob's, your uncle. Boom.

2051
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:36,560
There it is here. And uh, I
did. Yes, I did not know that.

2052
02:02:36,561 --> 02:02:40,220
There's basically all these different
ways to listen to it and it whatever way

2053
02:02:40,221 --> 02:02:41,660
you choose to listen to it,

2054
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:46,670
there's where you subscribe in the event
of these things offering the subscribe

2055
02:02:46,671 --> 02:02:49,640
option, which I think they all do. I'm not
sure cause I don't explore all of them.

2056
02:02:50,270 --> 02:02:54,560
It's just how it works. So what I'm saying
is if you want to subscribe, subscribe,

2057
02:02:54,590 --> 02:02:57,830
good way to support also on Youtube, which
we have a youtube channel by the way,

2058
02:02:57,831 --> 02:03:02,150
Judy medic Roger that not just
the video version of this podcast,

2059
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:07,180
but excerpts and various creative
videos here and there and some outtakes.

2060
02:03:11,090 --> 02:03:15,440
By the way, I'm not many, but a
few. I'll put more up there. Also,

2061
02:03:17,150 --> 02:03:20,900
Jocko has a store, it's called
Jocko store chocolate store.com.

2062
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:24,410
Obviously that's where we get,
or we make these shirts.

2063
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:28,560
Jody see this shirt Jocko has on right
now the victory MMA and fitness. Yeah.

2064
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:32,180
He always says that turned on by the
way. He does that. Well, not last night.

2065
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:36,020
That's why I was there was underneath
my Roger that. Yeah, I was gonna say,

2066
02:03:36,021 --> 02:03:38,540
how did you even recognize?
That's why I wore my friends.

2067
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:41,720
So this is a tactical beaver
shirt and it's a Canadian company.

2068
02:03:41,721 --> 02:03:46,500
Started by cans off guys could dudes. I
was going to wear this last night. Yeah,

2069
02:03:46,730 --> 02:03:47,300
but I didn't,

2070
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:50,900
I thought jogger would show up and tee
shirts so I stayed in a t shirt. Yeah.

2071
02:03:50,901 --> 02:03:54,170
Yeah. And anyway, so now he's in
a tee shirt and I'm in the color.

2072
02:03:54,220 --> 02:03:56,330
You're all dressed up. Damn man. Anyway,

2073
02:03:56,530 --> 02:03:59,810
that's the tactical beaver was my
last podcast. If you listen. Yeah,

2074
02:03:59,990 --> 02:04:03,560
they were on the show. It's good. It was
pretty dope. You know what else is dope?

2075
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:06,770
The shirt Juncos on and the shirt
I have on with chocolate hit on it.

2076
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:10,280
And if you want this shirt,
Jocko,

2077
02:04:10,281 --> 02:04:12,290
store.com there's a lot of
shirts on their disability.

2078
02:04:12,310 --> 02:04:16,130
I have a green and black
one in my suitcase back in
the hotel of that one. Boom.

2079
02:04:16,131 --> 02:04:20,480
I thought it'd be weird where and your
shirt hanging out with you though. Yeah,

2080
02:04:20,570 --> 02:04:22,430
I thought so.
But there's a deeper meaning.

2081
02:04:22,431 --> 02:04:25,430
I think the fact that Jockos head
is on my shirt and I'm sitting now,

2082
02:04:25,431 --> 02:04:27,470
you're part of this show,
so you gotta wear it. Oh,

2083
02:04:27,471 --> 02:04:32,120
I'll wear it if there's an echo shirt.
I need five immediately.

2084
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:37,070
I have four friends and myself that want
that shirt. Oh, all right. There you go.

2085
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:40,800
You got it. Sorry man. I've been, I've
been unplugged since May. Basically.

2086
02:04:40,990 --> 02:04:44,220
Sorry man. You got to unplug sometimes.
That's my, that's it. You know what?

2087
02:04:44,221 --> 02:04:48,720
And that's going back. Yeah. I think plug,
I'm going on Facebook while personal.

2088
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:52,520
I'm going to keep the business side,
but you got personal stuff is goes anyway.

2089
02:04:52,670 --> 02:04:55,980
Can finish what you're doing. I'm sorry.
I know you're part of what we're doing.

2090
02:04:57,270 --> 02:05:00,270
I'm not gonna read a list of things
that you should or should not do.

2091
02:05:00,271 --> 02:05:02,880
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna ask you about it.
I'm massive Jocko about it. Chocolate.

2092
02:05:02,881 --> 02:05:05,690
Tell me to hurry up. I may or may not
hurry up and whatever. That's how it,

2093
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:07,890
that's how it always
works. Nonetheless, Jocko,

2094
02:05:07,891 --> 02:05:11,580
store.com any shirt you
want and I need to shout,

2095
02:05:11,581 --> 02:05:13,560
I'm going to go into that
right after the show. Yes.

2096
02:05:13,830 --> 02:05:18,300
There's also some patches on there,
some hoodies, rash guards, hats,

2097
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:20,810
women's stuff on their kids.
Stuff on there. It's a good,

2098
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:25,920
good thing he's a beanies are on their
way. If you go like well, you figure well,

2099
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:28,440
beanies could very well be on there.
They're on there.

2100
02:05:28,470 --> 02:05:32,080
Do you wear a beanie when it's
cold outside? When it's cold out?

2101
02:05:32,130 --> 02:05:36,260
It's not a fashion statement
for you. Okay. Just checking.
I was here to win, man.

2102
02:05:36,270 --> 02:05:40,710
Here. The wind, no fashion. No, sure. It
looks good though, Bro. For sure. Anyway,

2103
02:05:40,770 --> 02:05:43,950
chocolate store.com I'm not saying go
buy something. I'm not saying that,

2104
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:46,290
but you should,
but if you like something,

2105
02:05:46,570 --> 02:05:48,930
you get something that's a
good way to support. Also,

2106
02:05:49,340 --> 02:05:52,140
I don't know if you know about this. You
might, I dunno. Psychological warfare.

2107
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:55,710
Is that ringing a bell? I
mean, I know what it is.

2108
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:59,280
Is this something that's an
unfortunate statement? Yeah,

2109
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:03,930
so psychological warfare is an
album that we created with tracks.

2110
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:08,970
Jocko turn. Ah, playlist. Yes.
A platelet playlist. Yeah.

2111
02:06:09,570 --> 02:06:14,250
I prefer mixtape. Mixtape. Yeah. Yeah.
Mix tape of Jocko was hurt. Yeah,

2112
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:17,170
essentially. But here it's for a
specific reason. Right, right, right.

2113
02:06:17,210 --> 02:06:21,920
It's not him playing the
Ukulele. Ukulele. No, indeed.

2114
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:26,680
It's him telling you how to get
through certain weak moments. Oh,

2115
02:06:26,700 --> 02:06:31,080
is it his is his moment,
his videos? No. No. Better.

2116
02:06:31,170 --> 02:06:34,620
More specific. So here, here's what it
is. Good. I'm actually glad you don't.

2117
02:06:34,621 --> 02:06:38,190
You don't know the specifics of it
because they'll can talk about it for 28

2118
02:06:38,191 --> 02:06:41,370
minutes. It's actually number one
on iTunes by the way. But you know,

2119
02:06:41,580 --> 02:06:45,150
oh that guy downloaded that. I never
listened to it though. Sorry Bro.

2120
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:45,691
You don't need it.

2121
02:06:45,691 --> 02:06:48,500
I just wanted to for my friend
[inaudible] you gave the support. Yeah,

2122
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:51,000
that's okay. But I probably should
have let it support you too.

2123
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:54,330
I probably should have this really what
it's for to support you. I used to,

2124
02:06:54,510 --> 02:06:55,343
you know how like,

2125
02:06:55,820 --> 02:07:00,240
you know when you work out and you
don't feel like working out or you go to

2126
02:07:00,241 --> 02:07:03,210
workout and you don't feel like Philly
that for the last 18 months with,

2127
02:07:03,211 --> 02:07:06,510
you know what? I'll do it tomorrow. Yeah,
I've been saying that his last October.

2128
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:09,560
All right, with you. Well they over
2016 I've been saying that. So they got,

2129
02:07:09,690 --> 02:07:12,450
I thought that was my biggest
weakness. I come to Jocko, I said,

2130
02:07:12,451 --> 02:07:15,210
what are you doing? You don't feel
like working out. I mean I know. Cool.

2131
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:20,160
Your top work out. Yeah. And then will
show, but there's more to it than that.

2132
02:07:20,161 --> 02:07:23,550
It's not that simple. You know?
And he explained it. I said,

2133
02:07:23,551 --> 02:07:26,300
you know what we're going to do? We're
going to record that. And is that,

2134
02:07:26,570 --> 02:07:29,700
that was the birth of the psychological
warfare. Exactly what it is.

2135
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:32,340
I did download it actually
when it came out, I just,

2136
02:07:32,370 --> 02:07:35,530
I forgot I even had it look at the tracks.
Here's what you do.

2137
02:07:35,830 --> 02:07:38,680
Look at the tracks and be like,
cause it's not just missing workout.

2138
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:43,210
It's like procrastination, uh,
on a pro at that now. Yeah.

2139
02:07:43,211 --> 02:07:46,600
So like I got my black belt
and procrastination bro. Yeah.

2140
02:07:46,601 --> 02:07:49,990
So consider one that you're like,
okay, not only will it help,

2141
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:54,610
it will 100% get you through it, Roger
that it's been the case for me anyway.

2142
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:57,430
Get in.
You can get that on iTunes of course,

2143
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:02,010
and anywhere where they sell
mp3s, Amazon music, whatnot.

2144
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:03,593
It's a good one.

2145
02:08:03,730 --> 02:08:06,850
Couple other things on Amazon.
You can get Jocko white tea.

2146
02:08:07,150 --> 02:08:11,740
It's no big deal unless you want
to dead lift 8,000 pounds minimum.

2147
02:08:11,770 --> 02:08:14,300
Then you drink Jocko white tea and
you're there. No questions asked.

2148
02:08:14,530 --> 02:08:18,220
100% guaranteed that though
if you want to get some books,

2149
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:20,890
you can get Jody mix books.
There's two of them.

2150
02:08:21,010 --> 02:08:26,010
Unflinching the making of a Canadian
Canadian sniper and also his latest book,

2151
02:08:26,171 --> 02:08:27,310
Everyday Heroes,

2152
02:08:27,490 --> 02:08:31,660
which is war stories from the generations

2153
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:34,120
edited by Jodi.

2154
02:08:34,150 --> 02:08:38,200
You get way of the warrior kid so you
can teach kids to do the right things in

2155
02:08:38,201 --> 02:08:42,940
their lives.
You know things like beyond the path,

2156
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:46,420
it's all, I'm going to say discipline
equals freedom field manual.

2157
02:08:47,590 --> 02:08:50,680
That book. Yeah. It's about

2158
02:08:52,330 --> 02:08:54,910
getting on the path and staying on
the path. That's what it's about.

2159
02:08:55,130 --> 02:08:58,300
Not going to say anything else about
that one. I will accept for that.

2160
02:08:58,300 --> 02:09:02,650
The audio version of that book
is not on audible. It is on

2161
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:09,070
anywhere. You can get an MP three which
means iTunes, Amazon music, Google play,

2162
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:12,580
and then of course the first book,
extreme ownership,

2163
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:17,230
combat leadership. There's a
new version out. It's black,

2164
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:22,420
which makes it a little bit cooler.
You can get that. Learn how to lead.

2165
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:26,350
Also beyond the books and the podcast.
If you need leadership,

2166
02:09:27,130 --> 02:09:30,700
let's say leadership guidance
and direction at your company,

2167
02:09:30,701 --> 02:09:32,800
at Your Business or at your team.

2168
02:09:33,610 --> 02:09:35,890
I have a leadership and
management consulting company.

2169
02:09:35,891 --> 02:09:40,330
It's called echelon front and that is what
we do. We'd come to your organization.

2170
02:09:40,331 --> 02:09:45,331
We assessed the situation and we get
problems solved through leadership.

2171
02:09:47,140 --> 02:09:47,973
It's me,

2172
02:09:48,250 --> 02:09:53,250
it's my brother Leif Babin that wrote
extreme ownership with me who was one of

2173
02:09:53,771 --> 02:09:57,880
the platoon commanders that served
with me in the battle of Ramadi.

2174
02:09:58,510 --> 02:10:03,510
It's JP Denelle who was the point man
and the lead sniper of Delta platoon in

2175
02:10:07,601 --> 02:10:10,120
the battle of Ramadi.
It's Dave Burke,

2176
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:15,280
who was an f 18 marine corps
fighter pilot, top gun pilot,

2177
02:10:15,281 --> 02:10:18,250
top gun instructor, top
gun, senior instructor,

2178
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:24,060
F 16 pilot f 18 pilot f
35 pilot f 22 pilot first.

2179
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:28,150
He sounds like he's pretty
good at his job. He's not bad.

2180
02:10:28,570 --> 02:10:32,350
He's the first operational squadron
commander for the [inaudible].

2181
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:36,140
He's the only man in the world
qualified to fly all those aircraft.

2182
02:10:36,380 --> 02:10:40,190
But none of that matters because what
he did was cool was he was on the ground

2183
02:10:40,191 --> 02:10:45,191
with us in the battle of Ramadi as a
Anglico team leader with his team and was,

2184
02:10:47,330 --> 02:10:52,250
uh, with what, what is an Anglico?
It's, it's the guys that call for fire.

2185
02:10:52,460 --> 02:10:56,270
They, yeah, they're Jay tax book.
The Marine Corps has Anglico,

2186
02:10:56,300 --> 02:11:00,000
but they call it Anglico air naval
gunfire liaison. Roger that. Yup.

2187
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:03,170
And that's what he did for us.
Outstanding Guy.

2188
02:11:03,650 --> 02:11:07,460
He's been on the podcast number
60, number 69, I believe.

2189
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:14,030
So he's part of the echelon front
team as well. Also on top of that,

2190
02:11:14,031 --> 02:11:19,031
there's the muster is the
leadership seminar with us,

2191
02:11:20,630 --> 02:11:24,440
the Echelon Front team again,
uh,

2192
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:28,550
in 2018 we're only doing two masters.

2193
02:11:28,610 --> 02:11:30,560
People think we're going
on with rock and roll tour.

2194
02:11:30,620 --> 02:11:32,080
We're not going on a rock and roll tour.

2195
02:11:32,081 --> 02:11:35,300
We're not going city to city is
not going to happen in Cleveland.

2196
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:38,270
It's not going to happen in Milwaukee.
It's not going to happen.

2197
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:42,500
It's not going to happen in San
Diego this year. It's an alert.

2198
02:11:42,550 --> 02:11:44,810
Can we go to places?
It's going to happen in Washington DC,

2199
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:48,290
May 17th and 18th so that's where you go.
If you're on the east coast,

2200
02:11:48,291 --> 02:11:52,040
east of the Mississippi,
you come to DC, what day?

2201
02:11:53,090 --> 02:11:57,290
May 17th and 18th if you're
west of the Mississippi,

2202
02:11:57,980 --> 02:12:02,980
you come to San Francisco October
17th 17th and 18th that's it.

2203
02:12:03,110 --> 02:12:04,640
Like I said,
we're not going anywhere else.

2204
02:12:04,820 --> 02:12:08,900
So the reason is because we
don't have time to do them.

2205
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:12,590
It's to get all the echelon front
team together and set it all up.

2206
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:16,010
It's very hard to do because we're working
with clients all over the country and

2207
02:12:16,011 --> 02:12:20,000
all over the world.
So we can't just do musters all the time,

2208
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:23,510
so that's where we're doing two of them.
If you want to come sign up,

2209
02:12:23,930 --> 02:12:27,290
all the four of them we, we, that
we've had so far have all sold out.

2210
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:31,280
These are going to sell out to
100% so if you want to come,

2211
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:36,500
you've got to go and register to attend
extreme ownership.com can I reserve two

2212
02:12:38,601 --> 02:12:42,950
spots where you knew in
Washington? Yes, you can. All
right, cool. Cool, cool. We do.

2213
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:47,990
Yeah.
Jody plus one until then,

2214
02:12:49,190 --> 02:12:50,060
until the muster.

2215
02:12:50,540 --> 02:12:54,860
If you have questions or answers for us
or you just want to check in and share

2216
02:12:54,861 --> 02:12:59,360
your wins. I noticed people do that now
on social media. You share the wins. Yeah,

2217
02:13:00,110 --> 02:13:04,070
I got this promotion.
I overcame this little situation.

2218
02:13:04,071 --> 02:13:05,480
They give a little brief on the situation.
Hey,

2219
02:13:05,481 --> 02:13:08,840
I had this guy that was acting wrong. I
took ownership and boom, problem solved.

2220
02:13:09,560 --> 02:13:11,930
I lost weight,
I gained weight.

2221
02:13:12,230 --> 02:13:17,230
I got a stripe on my white belt in
Jujitsu and I'm proud and I am proud.

2222
02:13:19,310 --> 02:13:22,340
I'm stoked when you get that stripe
on the white belt or the blue belt.

2223
02:13:22,670 --> 02:13:26,720
Sometimes people get the black belt brown
belt. But what we see is progression.

2224
02:13:26,950 --> 02:13:30,590
Yeah. Like I said, people lose weight.
People gain weight. People stay clean.

2225
02:13:30,930 --> 02:13:34,320
People stay off the sauce.
People stay off the drugs.

2226
02:13:34,530 --> 02:13:38,970
People stay on the path. And if you want
to check in with us about that stuff,

2227
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:40,770
you can do it on Twitter,

2228
02:13:41,310 --> 02:13:46,310
on Instagram and on Dat
Pham Bull Hace Blah.

2229
02:13:49,020 --> 02:13:53,010
Jodi is at Jody Mitic,

and I am at Jockowillink Echo.

2232
02:14:04,530 --> 02:14:09,210
Any closing thoughts? No. Thank you for
coming on and it's great to see you again.

2233
02:14:09,510 --> 02:14:13,560
You too bro. Mr Jody Mitic,
you got anything else?

2234
02:14:14,130 --> 02:14:17,310
Tiago, thank you for giving
me the mic back for five
minutes. No, I'm just kidding.

2235
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:21,750
Uh, I just want to say thanks to
you, uh, for bringing me on today.

2236
02:14:21,810 --> 02:14:26,130
Uh, I know you did this cause you
didn't have to cause you wanted to and I

2237
02:14:26,131 --> 02:14:29,820
appreciate that and I need to do
this. Let go of, uh, as always,

2238
02:14:29,850 --> 02:14:33,570
you should stop drinking, by the way. Um,
I mean, now that I'm a reformed drinker,

2239
02:14:33,630 --> 02:14:36,850
that's the, that's the, that's the,
that's the answer to everything. Yeah.

2240
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:40,600
Just stop it. Just stop
drinking. Surprisingly. It's
the, it's the big answer.

2241
02:14:40,601 --> 02:14:43,020
It's a good, a lot of philosophy.
I agree with, you know,

2242
02:14:43,021 --> 02:14:45,660
if you look at that study that comes out,
I forget who does it.

2243
02:14:45,661 --> 02:14:50,370
I think it's the UN at the
most destructive force on
earth is alcohol above coke,

2244
02:14:50,380 --> 02:14:54,780
heroin, speed, crack at all. Put together.

2245
02:14:54,810 --> 02:14:56,670
Booze is still 10 times worse,

2246
02:14:56,671 --> 02:15:00,610
like when it comes because it's
available to everybody. Right? Yeah. Um,

2247
02:15:00,750 --> 02:15:04,380
I should thank everybody that been
with me through this. You know,

2248
02:15:04,381 --> 02:15:07,500
sometimes you think you're
alone and you're not a,

2249
02:15:07,510 --> 02:15:10,950
I've had friends and family that
have not stopped. Basically,

2250
02:15:10,951 --> 02:15:13,350
you feel like they're bugging
you, but they're not. They're
keeping an eye on you.

2251
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:18,540
Um, uh, and all the supporters and
the fans and the, and just the,

2252
02:15:18,541 --> 02:15:22,080
the, the Jody Mitic fans. Thank
you for being there for me.

2253
02:15:22,081 --> 02:15:26,550
Thank you for being honest with
me and thank you to my friends.

2254
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:30,360
And my family for putting
up with me. And, um,

2255
02:15:30,540 --> 02:15:35,310
I fell off the path if I lost
my bearing pretty bad. Uh,

2256
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:40,340
but now I've reoriented the
map and I'm back on track and,

2257
02:15:40,441 --> 02:15:44,490
uh, give me, give me some
time. The Jody Mitic podcast,

2258
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:46,830
we'll be back up and
running in short order.

2259
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:51,000
Give me six weeks ish and we should
have to be pumping out some episodes.

2260
02:15:51,570 --> 02:15:54,270
Who knows? Maybe I'll fly Jocko up
to Ottawa and we'll do an episode.

2261
02:15:54,271 --> 02:15:54,751
I don't know.

2262
02:15:54,751 --> 02:15:59,400
The point is something will be
coming and there's a few hardcore,

2263
02:15:59,401 --> 02:16:03,450
I'm talking granite hard fans that have
like stuck it out and they send us at

2264
02:16:03,451 --> 02:16:06,090
least a tweet a week to be like,
where are you bitches at?

2265
02:16:06,630 --> 02:16:09,090
And we're coming back
quick. Um, just real quick,

2266
02:16:09,091 --> 02:16:12,060
shout out to my friends at tactical
beaver. If you want some of their stuff,

2267
02:16:12,061 --> 02:16:15,810
just go on tactical beaver.
Yes, like the animal. Uh,

2268
02:16:15,811 --> 02:16:19,100
you can get some of their gear.
It's pretty cool. A Canadian twist,

2269
02:16:19,101 --> 02:16:20,880
a Canadian flavor.
And if you're,

2270
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:23,970
if you're the one guy in your unit
that has it and you're not Canadian,

2271
02:16:23,971 --> 02:16:28,770
you might be a, you might be popular
for a minute. But, um, and uh, you know,

2272
02:16:29,020 --> 02:16:30,410
and the last thing,
uh,

2273
02:16:30,490 --> 02:16:35,200
goes out to my kids ala and
Kira Ala's nine peanut curious,

2274
02:16:35,201 --> 02:16:39,670
six squeaky. Uh, they're waiting
for me at home very patiently.

2275
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:42,250
And uh,
as soon as daddy's home,

2276
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:45,250
we're going to go to Jujitsu
because daddy needs to learn too.

2277
02:16:45,251 --> 02:16:47,050
And I know you guys don't like it now,

2278
02:16:47,051 --> 02:16:52,000
but when you're older you will appreciate
it. And for the rest of everybody else,

2279
02:16:52,001 --> 02:16:55,240
um, we're going to look in the camera
for a minute. Echo. You can edit that in,

2280
02:16:55,241 --> 02:16:56,670
right? Sure. Um,

2281
02:16:57,980 --> 02:17:02,410
I know I've said sorry before I'll
say it again and again. Thank you.

2282
02:17:02,470 --> 02:17:06,040
I will say over and over
again for supporting me and
it's because of people like

2283
02:17:06,041 --> 02:17:10,540
Jocko and rob who you'll meet who's a
green baret and some other very special

2284
02:17:10,541 --> 02:17:14,960
people in my life that I am found a
reason to get back to being myself in.

2285
02:17:15,110 --> 02:17:19,130
Yeah. And uh, and that's about it.
That's all I can say. Thank you man.

2286
02:17:19,730 --> 02:17:20,570
Awesome brother.
Well,

2287
02:17:20,571 --> 02:17:24,950
it's awesome having you back on again
and you'll be coming back on again and

2288
02:17:24,951 --> 02:17:28,920
again as you continued on this,
this journey on

2289
02:17:29,430 --> 02:17:32,370
better and I and we can just keep
burrowing down and helping others.

2290
02:17:32,420 --> 02:17:35,070
It's all good. My next book
comes out, I will come back.

2291
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:40,090
That's awesome. And so thanks for coming
on. It's awesome to see you again.

2292
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:41,020
And like I said,
we'll,

2293
02:17:41,021 --> 02:17:45,490
we'll keep doing this for the
next 20 years and finally,

2294
02:17:45,491 --> 02:17:50,491
thanks to all the service men
and women out there right now.

2295
02:17:52,190 --> 02:17:52,720
Okay.

2296
02:17:52,720 --> 02:17:54,340
Right now,
think about that right now.

2297
02:17:54,341 --> 02:17:59,341
Right this moment in time there's men
and women out there on the front lines

2298
02:18:00,101 --> 02:18:01,660
face to face with evil.

2299
02:18:03,150 --> 02:18:08,150
So thanks to you all for protecting
us and our freedoms and to the police,

2300
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:12,600
law enforcement,
firefighters,

2301
02:18:12,601 --> 02:18:15,990
paramedics and the rest
of the first responders.

2302
02:18:16,770 --> 02:18:21,770
Thanks for your service and your
sacrifice to keep us safe here at home.

2303
02:18:22,850 --> 02:18:23,140
Yeah.

2304
02:18:23,140 --> 02:18:26,500
And to everyone that's out there grinding,

2305
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:31,210
working,
driving trucks,

2306
02:18:31,450 --> 02:18:34,870
pouring concrete,
hammering on a project,

2307
02:18:34,871 --> 02:18:37,450
building bridges or building software,

2308
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:42,600
sewing some garments or
sewing of field farmers,

2309
02:18:44,170 --> 02:18:47,140
factory workers, engineers, electricians,

2310
02:18:47,170 --> 02:18:52,170
plumbers at pilots and ground crew and
cooks and waitresses to everyone out

2311
02:18:52,841 --> 02:18:57,841
there working hard and listening to
this and just trying to get yourself a

2312
02:18:58,781 --> 02:19:03,340
little bit better today
than you were yesterday.

2313
02:19:05,620 --> 02:19:08,500
Thanks for listening.
And

2314
02:19:10,030 --> 02:19:13,120
as you meet struggles

2315
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:18,760
and as you struggle to stay on the path,
first of all,

2316
02:19:19,060 --> 02:19:21,370
remember you don't have to fight alone.

2317
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:24,580
Reach out to your comrades in arms,

2318
02:19:26,900 --> 02:19:28,040
call for

2319
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:29,900
fire,
support when you need it.

2320
02:19:30,110 --> 02:19:34,220
We win wars because we stick
together and when we stick together,

2321
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:36,710
we can overcome any enemy

2322
02:19:39,050 --> 02:19:42,110
and the struggles that you face.

2323
02:19:43,290 --> 02:19:44,123
Yeah.

2324
02:19:44,310 --> 02:19:47,460
When they, when they do try to flank, you

2325
02:19:50,060 --> 02:19:53,990
do what Jody did.
Do what a soldier does.

2326
02:19:54,290 --> 02:19:58,580
Turn into the ambush,
turn toward the enemy,

2327
02:19:58,581 --> 02:20:01,280
fire and attack.

2328
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:08,110
And until next time,
this is Jody,

2329
02:20:08,111 --> 02:20:11,500
medic and echo and Jocko

2330
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:13,330
out.
