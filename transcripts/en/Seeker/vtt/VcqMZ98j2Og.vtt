00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.689
A new discovery into how our cells work might
be able to restart our age!

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:11.080
But you'll have to get some cells from you
as a baby... so... that might be tough.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.800
Hey gang, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.120
We are all getting older from the moment we're
born.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.000
Eventually, we'll all die.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.160
But HOW we get there and the upper LIMIT of
human life is the subject of a study in Genome

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.050
Research published last week.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.719
The researchers got ahold of blood from one
of the oldest known humans, Henny van Andel-Schipper.

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.180
She was the oldest person in the world when
she died in 2005 at the age of 115, wow...

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.640
that's... that's pretty old.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.250
She was born in the 19th century and lived
til the 21st.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.489
Anyway, aging is a pretty complicated process,
but in essence scientists believe it has to

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.809
do with telomeres.

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.160
Telomeres are sort of like the tips on the
end of your shoelaces, but for chromosomes,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.180
they maintain your genetic material and keep
it from mixing with other chromosomes.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.970
Over time, the telomeres shorten, which causes
what's called somatic mutation.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.410
It happens naturally over time, it's completely
normal.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.190
Apparently, Ms. Van Andel-Shipper was an organ
donor, because doctors were able to collect

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.320
tissue from her brain, blood, kidneys, arteries,
liver, lung heart, spleen, aorta, and even

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.750
a breast cancer tumor she had when she was
100! Way to go Henny!

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.320
The telomeres in her brain were similar in
length to those of a newborn, because brain

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:39.410
cells don't divide that often; but telomeres
in her red blood cells were 17 times shorter!

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.280
The doctors figured her blood genome had gone
through at least SIX HUNDRED mutations over

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.440
her lifetime, maybe more!

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.400
Basically, what happens is as the blood cells
are created from stem cells, new stem cells

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.790
have to come up to replace them.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.780
We're born with about 20,000 stem cells to
do this job.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.470
Over time, the stem cells mutate -- because
telomeres -- but just like in X-Men, mutation

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.560
can be good or bad.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.270
Sometimes we get a good cell, and other times
we get cancer.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.780
We don't ever get telepathy... at least not
yet... anyway...

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.379
So as Ms. Van Andel-Shipper aged, her stem
cells divided and divided and mutated and

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.379
divided.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.859
By the time she was old, most of her white
blood stem cells could be traced back to TWO

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.049
mother cells.

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.800
This indicated most of those 20,000 had burned
out or died.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.840
She was running on fumes for a long time...

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.540
Eventually they just... burned out.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.810
Knowing ALL these things, why can't we give
her a refill?

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.079
Obviously, we can't UNmutate the thousands
of generations of Henny's blood, because...

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.340
a copy of a copy of a copy is never as good
as the original.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.239
But what if we had the original?

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:53.060
What if when we're born, stem cells are removed
from our brand-new bodies and saved to start

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.299
the stem-cell telomere shortening over; like
hitting the reset button on aging!

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.750
Maybe there's something to that "bathing in
the blood of young virgins" thing...

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.739
Anyway, lots more research is needed, but
this is the first time every somatic mutations

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.829
have been studied in such a way, and it can
teach us a lot about how the human body ages,

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.499
why, and what we can do about it.

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:14.499
What do you think?

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.739
What would you do if you could live for 200
years?

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.249

DNews every day of the week!

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.069
If you' like me are a little skeeved out by
biology stories and nature stuff you should

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.420
totally check out my friend Catie Wayne's
show Weird, Gross and Beautiful -- they wanted

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.120
to call the show Weird and Gross, but she
was all like, "NO WAY!," because if you look

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.620
even nasty nature things are pretty... somehow.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:54.989
Watch it to find out how!

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.059
Thanks for tuning into DNews, you're all the
bestest, come find me on twitter at-tracedominguez

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:00.319
and say hi!
