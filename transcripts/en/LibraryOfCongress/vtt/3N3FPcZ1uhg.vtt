00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.400 position:56%
I'm Tomoko Steen here at the Library
of Congress Research Specialists.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.860
And today's event is sponsored
by Science, Technology,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.400
and Business Division here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.030
Today's topic is One Health.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.880
How many of you know
about One Health?

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.330
That's pretty good.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.130
I thought it's a new concept,
but it's actually not new.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.820
So the speaker is going to explain

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.190
that it's actually
not a new concept.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.490
We are very, very lucky
to have today's speaker.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:12.090
She's an expert, not only the
One Health, but she's a director

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.800
of the FDA as well as the
advisor still right now

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.840
for the George Washington
University's Milken Institute

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.720
of Public Health.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.670
And she'll go back, but
this year she wants to share

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.430
with you her knowledge
on One Health.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.480 position:56%
I think it's nice to connect between
public and federal government.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.350
So I'm sure that you know what FDA
is, right, this audience I guess.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.690
[ Laughter ]

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.500
Yeah, it's Food and
Drug Administration.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.540
So she'll go back and
serve as a director again.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.360
But it's nice to have this
public and government,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.900
and also maybe company
private sector communication.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.370
That's a very important thing.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:14.470
And President Obama has been
really pushing this concept.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.320
Today's speaker -- actually,
you have the name here.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.700
I actually knew her name from
her work before I met her.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.240
So Bernadette Dunham.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:38.970
Dr. Bernadette Dunham has done her
veterinarian degree from Canada

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.120
and came here and did a
Ph.D. at Boston University.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.530
And she has served at the
university as well as government.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.760
And she has been bridging
academic and the public sectors.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.260
So she's such a catalyst
in communicating very well,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.310
and very, very friendly person.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.280
So with her approach, she will
explain exactly what One Health

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.650
is today.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.560
So without further
ado, please join me

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.510
in welcoming our speaker,
Dr. Dunham.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.120
[ Applause ]

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.420
&gt;&gt; Bernadette Dunham:
Well, good morning.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.720
Thank you, Dr. Steen, very much.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.210
And thank you for the invitation to
be here at the Library of Congress.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.760
It's really an honor
and I'm thrilled

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.590
to see so many in the audience.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.540
So with no further ado,
I am thrilled to be able

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.180
to address a number of aspects
of what we now call One Health.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.980
I'm going to cover a number
of examples and wrap it

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.190
up at the very end with
an exciting opportunity

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.820
to address an annual
One Health Day event.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.520
So the concept of One
Health, it isn't new,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.460
as you just heard from Dr. Steen.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.120
Considering the fact that
over 2,500 years ago,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.680
it was actually Hippocrates who
urged physicians to consider

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.310
where their patients
lived, the foods they ate,

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.750
the waters they drank,
their lifestyles,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.610
and the seasons of the year.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.320
And then Dr. Virchow, father
of pathology, stated that,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.460
"Between animal and human medicine,

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.840
there are no dividing
lines nor should there be."

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.130 position:56%
And then Dr. Schwab, also coined the
term "one medicine" in his textbook

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.870
of "Veterinary Medicine
and Human Health" in 1965.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.380 position:56%
The American Veterinary Medical
Association had a task force in 2008

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.350
which really started
to set the framework

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.070
for how we can really start
to embrace One Health.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.270
By definition, One Health
is the collaborative effort

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.220
of multiple disciplines
working locally, nationally,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.220
and globally to obtain
optimal health for people,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.630
animals, and the environment.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.550
Why do we want to look
at One Health?

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.910
Worldwide, about 75 percent of
all emerging infectious diseases

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.120
in the past three decades
have originated in animals.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.840
Environmental health can
affect human and animal health

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.590
through contamination, pollution,
and poor conditions that often lead

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.630
to new infectious agents.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.470
And the world population
is projected to grow

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.920
from a current 7.4 billion
to 9 billion in 2050.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.430
We have to be aware of how we
provide adequate healthcare,

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.060
food and water for this
growing population.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.380
Our health professions
and related disciplines,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.060 position:56%
and institutions must work together.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.460
And there's always that
benefit that we experience

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.980
from the human/animal bond

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.450
to help impact the health
of people and animals.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.430
Three groups that I'm going to
highlight have evolved over time.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.170
One is the One Health
Initiative, it started in 2006.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.650
And it basically is that forte
of recognizing that human health,

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.410
animal health, and ecosystem
health are inextricably linked.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.220
And One Health does seek to promote
and prove and defend the health

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.380
and well-being of all species
by enhancing cooperation

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.210
and collaboration between
physicians, veterinarians,

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.500
and other scientific health and
environmental professionals;

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.510 position:56%
and promoting strength in leadership

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.700
and management to achieve
these goals.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.190
And they have the umbrella,
as we say, for One Health,

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.110
of which here are a
number of examples --

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.100
and I'm going to touch
on a few of them today --

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.840
that come to mind when
you say, "Well,

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.710
what exactly are we talking about?"

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.480
And you can have anything
from zoonotic threats

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.630
to comparative medicine and
translational medicine to looking

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.430
at the environment as
well as our public issues.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.160
Another group that has
evolved, starting in 2009,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.080
is the One Health Commission.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.040
And they really focus with
their charter to educate

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.070
and create networks that can
help improve our health outcomes

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.280
and well-being for humans,
animals, and plants,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.210
promoting an environmental
resilience

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.840
through a collaborative
global One Health approach.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.440
And then most recently in
2011, the One Health platform,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.800
also a global group, has been
formed to try to further the forum

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.350
of stakeholders that we
have in really looking

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.030
at potential future
outbreaks of zoonoses,

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.790
emerging infectious diseases
in animals and people,

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.300
and antimicrobial resistance,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.070
and the ecological
factors surrounding them.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.760
Right now, this map
that was generated

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.100
by Dr. Monith [assumed spelling],

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.620
displays the potential initial
numbers that we're looking

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.560
at that are both arthropod-borne,
rodent-borne, as others,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.500
to give us zoonotic infections.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.500
And as you well know, Zika
is certainly rolling off

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.080
of everybody's tongues today.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.780
It is the next one to be added
as an arthropod-borne infection.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.260
Put this up because in fact,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.780
we really do now live
in a global village.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.780
So if I look at Zika virus,

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.830
it absolutely exemplifies
One Health so well.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.430 position:56%
It really does need and showcase
how we bring together entomologists,

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.720
physicians, veterinarians,
virologists, wildlife biologists,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.470
environmental experts,
universities, governments,

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.840
public health organizations,
world health organizations.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.010
Why? Because we have so much to do

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.400
to address this very
important issue.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.250
Zika virus infection
is often asymptomatic,

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.450
and it can cause mild
illnesses such as just a fever

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.560
or a rash, or some joint pain.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.160
But most recently, and what
has been in the newspaper

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.530
and caught everybody's
attention, is the fact that now --

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.140
and CDC just recently concluded --

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.170
Zika virus infection during
pregnancy can cause microcephaly

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.900
and other severe fetal
brain defects.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.710
It's possibly also associated
with autoimmune illnesses

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.430
like Guillain-Barre Syndrome.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.940
And that's under investigation
as well.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.060
But as of today, there
isn't a commercial vaccine,

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.830
nor a specific antiviral agent
to treat Zika virus infection,

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.710
so our basic research and vaccine
development needs to continue.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.980
There's also no approved yet
diagnostic test cleared by FDA

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.980 position:56%
to help us detect Zika virus, be it
for blood, urine, or saliva samples.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:02.150
And the mosquito, Ades genus, the
vector needs to be controlled.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.360
And what are the ways
that we can do that?

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.700
Some are looking at removal

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.100
of water-containing
sources: insecticide sprays.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.290
And now we have the potential
for genetic engineering

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.120
of these mosquitos to
suppress mosquito population.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.760 position:56%
And society has to take a look at
all of these potential technologies.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.040
And then how do we enhance the
risk communication and education

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.260
to help the public
avoid mosquito exposure?

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.160
We do need enhanced
surveillance systems collecting,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.770
analyzing the data to assist

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.840
in whatever our public
health strategies will be.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.280
We also still have yet to
determine the non-human reservoirs

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.580
for Zika virus.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.430
Originally, in the Zika
forest in Africa was

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.230
where a monkey had been
looked at that did have access

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.480
and was detected to
having positive Zika virus.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.910
But now if you come over to
South America, we don't know

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.840
yet for sure what the animal
potential reservoir is,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.470
so this is why we need
further research.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.400
And most importantly,
because of the devastation

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.260
of what this virus can do
with newborn infants --

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.000
-- those that have microcephaly,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.380
they're going to need potential
medical care for their lives.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.790
And that really means we have
to have infrastructure local,

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.800
at national levels, the
financial commitments,

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.770
and the government engagement in
policy development that takes place

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.180
in order to address this real
challenge that we're facing.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.620
That's just one.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.480
There's a number of the
other mosquito-borne diseases

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.370
that I know you're
very familiar with.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:28.660
If we talk about transmitting
Dengue, Chikungunya, Yellow fever,

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:33.570
Zika viruses from the Aedes
specimen of the mosquitos;

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.630
the one thing that we're not aware
of -- you may not be aware of --

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:41.100
is Yellow fever internationally
is actually potentially rising.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.150
And the one thing that is occurring
is we don't always maintain

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.560
sufficient of our vaccine
stockpiles.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.880
So if Yellow fever was to take off
in an urban area right about now

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.680
in certain parts of the
globe, are we really prepared

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.610
to be able to address that?

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.230
So those are the questions that
are surfacing on a global level

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.610
that we need to be aware
of as we hear and track

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.070 position:56%
and see what diseases are surfacing.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.230
You're also familiar with West Nile
virus, equine encephalitis virus.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.410
We also have Japanese encephalitis
virus being transmitted.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.510
And of course, we have an
[inaudible] transmitting malaria.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.200
And that's a constant
struggle still;

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.650
we have not yet overcome malaria.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.970
And then for a lot of folks that
may have some cats and dogs,

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.640
we have a mosquito transmission

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.800
of dirofilaria immitis,
which causes heartworm.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.620
And a quick aside, we
have a number of products

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.550
that you can treat your dog with,
for example, to prevent heartworm.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.780
What's interesting is certain
dogs have a genetic propensity

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:44.050 position:56%
to carry mutation in a very
important protein that prevents them

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.300
from metabolizing correctly
the Ivermectin type

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.160
of drugs that we use.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.970
And a quick analogy, if Tommy and
Mary come into a veterinary clinic

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.740
with their Collie/Collie-cross
dogs and you want

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.510
to treat both those dogs to prevent
heartworm, there's a potential

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.490
if you don't screen,
that you might end

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.170
up causing the loss of Tommy's dog.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.530
Well, that'll be heartbreaking.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:10.480
Well now, we can test, and
again, bringing back in the idea

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.760
of understanding from genomics,

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.930
the fact that we have
personalized medicine for people

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.520
and we can have personalized
medicine for animals.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.250
So now with screening, we can
say Tommy's dog cannot receive an

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.340
Ivermectin-based product, we'll use
something else and he'll be fine,

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.770
and he will be protected
against heartworm.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.050
So medicine is touching
both sides right now.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.700
And of course, emerging
diseases of global health

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.000
and agricultural concerns.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.300
You're certainly very aware

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.850
that we've had numerous
links over the years.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.660
Certainly, H1N1 has been a crisis.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.870
Back in 2009, we had
a major outbreak.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.080
And we're looking at influenza
from birds, from swine,

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.700
and [inaudible] a potential for
them again to jump from species

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.370
to species and potentially
then hit humans

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.660
and cause some major
important issues.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.720
SARS occurred in 2003, the severe
acute respiratory syndrome,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.410
with people in direct
transmission back and forth.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.590
Ebola. We had another major
outbreak, as you saw in 2014.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.140
We're still addressing
those issues right now.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.620
And again, how do we intervene?

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.920
How do we track?

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.970
How do we respond quickly enough?

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.470
MERS also surfaced, and that
again was your Middle East

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:18.780
respiratory syndrome.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.370
The potential there is
even looking at camels --

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.650
is there a source that can
go back as a zoonotic entity?

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.850
And I mentioned West
Nile virus earlier.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.700
Certainly when that hit New
York, that was an eye-opener.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.610
Again, we've had Zika, so how
do you handle these vectors

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.910
such as mosquitos?

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.120
And then we had bovine
spongiform encephalitis,

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.580
also called mad cow disease,
outbreak in '86 from Europe.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:44.200
And then what have we taken for
policy steps to prevent that?

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.540
And E.coli O157:H7 has
had devastating results

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:51.450
when it first broke out when we
had the issue with the [inaudible].

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.190
We've come a long way, but
we're still facing these issues.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.250
They're with us and
they're challenging.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.990
So how about something local?

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.290
Lyme disease.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:03.180
I think many of us, certainly in
the eastern coast, but it crosses

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.890
so many areas, have heard and
maybe have even had Lyme disease.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.700
It's caused by a spirochete,
it's called bacteria,

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.190
Borrelia burgdorferi, and
it's transmitted by ticks.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.720
Well, you think about where
we live, we move into so many

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.090
of the wooded areas
anymore where deer hang out.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.530
But you know what,
they're also capable then

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:23.830
of transmitting diseases back.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.130
And the ticks that are there,
very quickly will be able to pick

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.750
up some of these problems.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:34.270 position:56%
And they can touch people, they can
touch dogs, horses -- cats rarely --

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.580
cattle and mice are known
to be able to succumb

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.880
to Lyme disease just
like you and I can.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.020 position:56%
Many times, you'll just have
nothing more than flu-like symptoms,

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.820
but it also forms both in
early and a chronic form.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.040 position:56%
And if any of you have had it or if
you've had friends that have had it,

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.380
it's very, very, very difficult.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.180
It's constantly being treated.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.090
And people are not happy
when they have Lyme disease.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.000
And it can touch all of
us: children and adults.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.970 position:56%
With dogs and horses, very similar,
you'll have shifting leg lamenesses,

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.960
swollen joints, lethargy,
fever, and [inaudible].

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.160
We do fortunately have
a vaccine for dogs.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.470
And people say, "Well,
what about me?

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.730
Why don't you have
a vaccine for me?"

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.090
And this gets back again
to the research and working

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:17.200
with our companies to say we do
have a need for a specific drug

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.880
or a vaccine to be developed.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.860
And I believe there
is still work to try

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.600
to get us there, but
we're not there yet.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.540
So your dogs, at least
you can protect them.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.880
And when it comes to
treatment, it's an antibiotic,

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.040
and one that's very
typical and used in horses,

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.760
dogs, or people: Doxycycline.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.040
Well now, what about
white-nose syndrome in bats?

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.290 position:56%
Why would I want to talk about bats?

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:42.540
Because it's an example of how
we do live in a global world.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.470
And it actually was humans

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.110
that brought particularly
this fungus over from Eurasia.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.440
And the bats that we have in North
America had never been exposed

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.740
to this before.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.110
And when they did, it
really hit in 2006.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:00.060
This particular fungus impacts
the bats when they're hibernating,

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.060
and literally will
lead to their death.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.400
And we've lost a lot of bats.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.320
So you may say, "Well,
they're just bats.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.140
Why are you bothering with that?"

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.440
Because they're very important.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.210
People often don't realize.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.070
They help with pest control.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.150
They night fly, so they'll
take a lot of insects

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.700
that can often damage
agricultural crops.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.840
And they're very important
in pollination,

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.560
from deserts to rainforests.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.560
The nectar-feeding bats are really
critical in helping pollinate,

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.530
and then also for seed dispersion.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.960
There, they can help scatter seeds.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.110
And often times, if you've
had deforestation in a forest,

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.320
they can be the ones to
help restore it again.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.010
So knowing we've lost so
many, now going forward,

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.820
I still think we're going to see
some significant ecosystem impacts

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.860
because of the loss of a very
important pollinator that we have.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.270
And once again, it's bringing
together your scientists, managers,

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.770
lawmakers, and the public at large
to try to address this issue,

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.840
identify where we're
seeing it, and hopefully see

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.890
if the bats can themselves develop
immunity, which often they can

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.420
and have in other countries.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.200
But when you first get hit with
something, often it's decimated

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.070
to that particular species.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.100
And everybody also has
heard a lot about honeybees.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.000
Bee colonies -- they
continue to fall.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.880
There was a report just
this month both by the --

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:16.130
University of Maryland released the
survey and USDA released a survey.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:20.590
And here in the United States, the
beekeepers have lost 44 percent

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.490
of their colonies just
the last year.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.930
Once again, why are we concerned?

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.730
They're bees and you don't
want to get stung, right?

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.030
But it's more than that.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.350 position:56%
Not only do they make the honey that
you like, but they're tremendous

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.430
for pollinating so many crops
for the foods that we need.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.580
And I think once again, it's being
aware of this, because we need

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.360
to help make a difference
identifying the problem

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.250
and come up with solutions.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.560
There's been a variety of
factors that people have looked

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.560
at because we haven't pinned
everything down specifically

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.600
under what we call
colony collapse disorder

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.100
where typically you'll see
a loss of the worker bees.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.630
Very few are dead, but the
hives are basically empty other

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.660
than the queen bee and any
of the brood that remains.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.220
But if the worker bees aren't
there to bring back in and continue

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.270
to take care of them, then
of course you have nothing.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:09.270
The other aspect has
been the varroa mite.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.270
This particular mite
has been devastating.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.540
It will continue to
weaken the bee, and again,

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.800 position:56%
fungus and infections can come in
and further decimate the bee colony.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.450
But again, they're so
important for pollination

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:26.170
that we may not see them actually
doing everything they do every day,

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.880
but we really see the
impact when all

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.520
of a sudden you don't have a crop.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.950
And therefore, when you think
about feeding the world,

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:35.390
it also becomes very important to
sustain and address these issues.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.230
So a lot of research
is ongoing right now.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.620
And then finally, if you take
a look at monarch butterflies,

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.420
once again, what do they do for us?

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.720
They're a sentinel.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.550
They're one more example of how
things are changing over time.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:52.020
And when we change the habitat,
when we use insecticides,

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:56.120
many times we can see how the
impact is to a certain species.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.730
And monarch butterflies have one
major source of food: the milkweed.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.940
Well, you think about weeds and
you say, "Let's cut the area.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.610
Let's clear up the fields,"
but you're also taking away one

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.240
of their key sources of food.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.630
Also, the extreme weather changes
that we've seen have impacted.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.520
So as we can watch
sentinels, it's important

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.270
because it can open our
eyes, we may be able

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.690
to intervene sooner
before ramifications come

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.600
up on major impact to
us and other animals.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.700
I'm going to shift into the oceans.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.600
We also have a number of marine
environmental sentinels there.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.010
For those of you that love to
go down and see coral reefs

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.980
and scuba dive and appreciate the
beauty as you see it all the time,

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.660
or even in aquariums, you like
to look at a healthy coral reef.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.380
But as you've heard
and as you're seeing,

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:43.530 position:56%
many of these reefs are now really
succumbing to oceanic acidification.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.240
And what are we as society doing?

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.040
When you think about the impacts we
have from water and how we have --

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.930
traveling back and forth
through the oceans with some

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.110
of these huge transport vehicles --

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.910
sometimes you have horrible
ocean spills of oil.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:00.730
What is happening as we
continue around our coastal areas

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.080
that can further add
to the acidification

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.460
and impact these coral reefs?

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.020
We're the ones that can
help make a difference.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.460 position:56%
And together, bringing in the
experts and potentially new research

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.270
and scientific technologies,

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.190
hopefully intervene
to turn this around.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.270
One piece of news, when
I talk about environment,

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.300
is even today in the newspaper,
there was a very good note

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.510
that for the Chesapeake Bay
-- in fact, from last year,

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.570
they've managed to reduce some of
the land runoff on agriculture,

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.500
and in fact, the Bay is
starting to now improve

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.200
as they're monitoring
different aspects.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.500
And that's encouraging.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.800
So where there's a
will, there's a way.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.680
We can make a difference.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.360
Healthy green sea turtles.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.100
They've been around for
centuries and they're beautiful.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.390
But you know what,
they're also succumbing

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.120
to a number of new issues.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.700
Fibropapillomatosis is a
very devastating disease

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.250
in a green sea turtle.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.860
You and I are familiar
with the papilloma virus.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.400
Typically you'll get a
wart, but more importantly,

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.700
you can get cervical cancer.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.520
So we have developed vaccines
which I think is very important.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:08.050 position:56%
But for the sea turtle, it's because
they're seeing so much stress now

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.640
because of the impact on the
environment of the coastal habitat,

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.040
when they develop this
particular papilloma virus,

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.470
it's herpes five virus,
then you'll see --

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.120
as you can see in this
particular picture --

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.860 position:56%
it looks like growths, and they are.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.950
But they end up obstructing
swimming, feeding, buoyancy,

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.440
and sometimes they can actually
lead to the death of the animal,

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.160
and also blind them if
it grows over their eye.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.140
So once again, it's a sentinel.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.400
And yes, we can individually
intervene and treat some

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.710 position:56%
of these animals, but it's awareness

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.180
that as the environment is
being stressed and polluted,

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.050
we're impacting so many animals.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.040
And I think it's important that we
take a look at the oceans as well

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.600
as what we're doing here
on the land or in the air.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.130
So climate change.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.510
Everybody has a different
view on climate change.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.580
I think there's a lot of
good evidence out there

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.520
that we are certainly
seeing some major changes.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.030
Most recently, we've seen
an awful lot of change,

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.340
certainly across the United
States, with hurricanes, tornadoes,

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.510
in areas that normally we didn't,
or frequency that's increased.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.250
It's absolutely amazing.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.610
Flooding has occurred.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.730
The devastation that
occurs to society

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.540
when we deal with major floods.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.190
Yes, we're seeing rising sea
levels because there's evidence

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:21.740
that in fact we have
melting glaciers

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.330
and ice fields impacting
polar bears, sentinels.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.630
What's happening?

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:27.930
Who's measuring this?

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.230
What's the documentation?

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.300
And what, if anything,
can we do about it?

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.040
And I think we need to be concerned

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.270
because even though sometimes you
getting overwhelmed by thinking,

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.140
"What can I possibly do?"

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.320 position:56%
In fact, there's a lot that together
we can do as we become aware

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.010
of some of these opportunities.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.950
We've seen increases
of wildfires, too.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.660
And that's devastating not only for
the environment and the wildlife,

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.300
but as you've seen,
certainly like California,

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.530
it's touching where
people want to live.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.600
And we love the wildlife,
we want to live out there.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.310
These are beautiful,
beautiful -- it's a country --

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.810
and yet, there's a lot that
can happen that can turn this

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.060
into devastating situation.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.740
And we've seen increased
dryness and drought.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.470
So we as we see this, an example
with drought would be well,

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.450
you need to have crops,
you need to have food.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.080
Today, more and more we're seeing
genetically engineered crops,

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.970
some of which now can
withstand the drought;

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:22.330
some can withstand certain pests.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.580
So are we ready to accept that?

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.910
What's the science behind that?

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.210
The modification behind that?

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.510
The policies?

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.670
And more importantly, how
do we monitor all of this?

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:35.110
So as we are moving -- sometimes
science can move much quicker

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.780
than what we're ready to adopt --

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.310
but I think it's important that
we sit and look at that science

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.260
and the policies that should
be developed to handle this.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:46.940
And more importantly, to do
it together in a global venue.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:51.220
Most recently, the White House
just released in April their report

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.980
on some of the health risks
that come from climate change.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:58.550
And they did this because they're
focusing again on how individuals,

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.260
communities, organizations,

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.590
and governments can proactively
manage some of the health risks

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.660
that we see with climate change.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.370
The first one that comes to mind
is absolutely air pollution and all

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:10.930
of the allergens that we see.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:14.560
So how can we take technologies
and still provide and develop --

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.130
clean fuel, for example -- and
not have to have air pollution?

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:19.430
Concentration in cities.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.250
You take a look at some
countries and people have masks

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:22.550
on every day just to walk

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.640
around because the
pollution can be so severe.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.000
So people in countries
want to evolve,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.920
you want to have economic
change, but sometimes that brings

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.940
with it some very big important
challenges to the health.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.260
So how do we continue
to advance the economy

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:41.610
but also minimize the
negative impact to our health?

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.290
Yes, the extremes of heat
and cold come into play,

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:48.040
and how well do we handle that, and
what does that do to your health.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.650
We just highlighted a
minute ago just some

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.910
of the intense extreme events
that we've talked about.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.210
How do prepare?

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:55.890
How do you handle some of those?

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:57.990
That's going to be a
challenge for all of us.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.370
And yes, with this, we see increase
of some vectors that can survive

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.290
in countries that they
hadn't before.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:07.970
Or as usual, we travel, animals
travel, and microbes travel.

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.430
And as I showed you already,
introduction of new species

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:11.950
that can challenge our health

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:14.880
and animals' health,
and are we ready for it.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.650
Water-related illnesses.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.570
Nothing more than mentioning Flint,
Michigan and lead in the water.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.460
We've seen the reaction of that.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.400
And how do we do and
monitor the infrastructure.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.540
And infrastructure takes dollars,
it's old, it's breaking down.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:32.070
How can we intervene to make
sure we can keep things safe

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:35.060
so people can have
access to safe water?

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.890
Threats to food safety/nutrition.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.860 position:56%
Even just looking at the pollinators
I mentioned to you can minimize.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.240
Will we still have the
food supply we need?

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.570
And all of this really
stresses our mental health.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:48.500
People have a lot of angst
when they're being stressed,

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.630
and that's going to
impact your health.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:54.500
And I think it's always been true:
there are certain populations

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.160
that are going to suffer
a lot more than others,

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.470
and there are certain countries
where if they're not well off,

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:02.220
they will be the ones to suffer
the most than those of us

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:07.540
that are very fortunate and
can possibly handle this.

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.940
Another good report --
this came out this year --

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.050
preventing disease through
healthy environments.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.610
This is the World Health
Organization

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.070
that just released this.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:20.350
And again, taking a look
at, in this global world,

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:24.490
how much can we potentially turn
around through the environment,

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:26.480
some of the risk factors
that we have evolved,

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.410
that we have actually been
part and parcel of causing.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:33.420
And the good news is that even
though 23 percent of global debts

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:38.060
and 26 percent among children
under five, they're related

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.280 position:56%
to modifiable environmental factors.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.570
So if we can reduce air
pollution, if we can assure access

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.490
to safe water, if we can have
the basic sanitation that, again,

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:49.790
we often take for granted

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:53.890 position:56%
but in other countries they don't
have that, and access to clean fuel.

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:57.840 position:56%
The pictures here and in the report
can really highlight how we can make

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.560
a difference, but it's
at a cost, and it's going

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.680
to take society working together.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.010
It's going to take us helping
and lowering the pillars

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:09.110
so that internationally, we
can learn from each other,

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:13.460
we can assist, and we can get to a
sustainable level and minimize some

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.860
of those factors and
get the benefits

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.180
that we want from today's
technology.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.480
Switching gears.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.780
Translational biology.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.120
Now, very close to my heart, how
do we advance One Health here?

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.680
Well, many of you may have pets.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.650
Many of you may have had
friends, or yourself,

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.370
who might have been
touched by cancer,

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.210
and many of your pets may also
have been touched by cancer.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:37.880
The Institute of Medicine,
last year,

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:42.880
held a workshop entitled The
Role of Clinical Studies for Pets

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:47.230
with Naturally Occurring Tumors
in Translational Cancer Research.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:50.300
The National Cancer Institute has
what we call comparative oncology

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.600
trials consortium.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.550 position:56%
And this has been set up solely for
the infrastructure to take a look at

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:58.200
and investigate clinical
trials for our pets

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.250
that have the naturally
occurring tumors.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.060
And how learning from them --

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.250
and I'm going to show you in
a minute some similarities

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:10.640 position:56%
that can easily be translated to and
help in fact address human cancers.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.600
And there's a benefit because
it's a win on both sides

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.460
when we can have interventions
through drugs,

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.000
surgery for pets as
well as for people.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.300
And right now we have

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.780
over 20 academic comparative
oncology centers.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.110
So maybe you've had a Scottie dog.

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:28.430
Well, in this day and
age of genomics

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:31.680 position:56%
and understanding the sequencing of
the genome, we learned an awful lot.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.250
Well, Scottish Terriers
are 19 times more likely

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:38.080
to develop bladder cancer
[inaudible] the transitional cell,

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.070
carcinoma, it's a BRAF
gene mutation.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:45.130
And in people with the same
tumor, it's a BRAF gene mutation.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:47.870
And at the meeting, it
was just so thrilling

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.130
to see your board-certified
human oncologists,

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.740
your board-certified veterinary
oncologists looking and talking

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.570
to each other and saying, "Really?

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:56.350
I had no idea."

00:28:56.350 --> 00:29:00.100
"Fabulous, because now we
can talk and work together."

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.150
At the same time, Dr. Rod
Page, who I have here,

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:08.360
he's with the Flint Cancer
Center at Colorado State.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.800
He was one of the key folks to
work and encourage the Institute

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.910 position:56%
of Medicine to put this workshop on.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:19.710
And he's also been fabulous in
highlighting where we can learn

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.350
from our pets that have
spontaneous tumors.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.160
Take a look at osteosarcomas.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.660
Devastating on both cases.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:31.210
And many times limbs are amputated
to try to treat an osteosarcoma.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:34.340
Once again, at this particular
study, when you take a look

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.910
at the clinical trials and the
tissues from dogs or from people,

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:41.620
you'll find again that gnomically,
they're very, very similar.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.270
So the venue there would be could
we take a look and develop a drug?

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:48.270
And you could be using this
literally for your dog to be able

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:53.110
to hopefully extend their life
as well as their quality of life,

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.690
and then glean from that
information that can move forward

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:56.990
to hopefully attain

00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:00.040
and get successful drug
approval on the human side.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.550
So this is a very exciting
opportunity.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.730
Our pets don't live as
long as us, so therefore,

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:07.790
you can have information gathered
in a much shorter time period.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:09.550
So there's a win there.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.560
And then curiosity.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.080
Are you aware of the fact that
elephants rarely develop cancer?

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.700
Well, actually, taking a look

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.190
at potentially some
evolutionary-based medicine,

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:21.600
a number of researchers
have looked at this.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.110 position:56%
And one thing that was very curious,
they found that elephants have

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:28.800
about 20 copies of
what we call TP53.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.670
This encodes for a protein, p53,

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:35.440
that's a very crucial
tumor suppressor gene.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.740
Well, they have 20 copies.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.040
But guess what?

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.340
You and I only have one.

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.170
Is that possibly why?

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.060
It's most interesting to see that.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.050
So once again, understanding
different scenarios.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.460
And as genomics opens up the door
more and more, we can take a look

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.560
at what's behind some of the
tumors that we're looking at

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:57.450
and how cancer is evolving, and how
can we intervene and hopefully come

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:00.340
up with better ways of
potentially addressing cancer,

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.680
which touches so many of our lives.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.610
That just showcases a number of
the trial consortiums that we have.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:10.640
Another example, cranial
facial reconstruction

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.870
through regenerative technology
can benefit animals and people.

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.870
So for the dog side.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:20.160
Often, dogs will get malignant
and sometimes even benign tumors

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.570
of the mandible, and
they'll undergo surgery.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:25.230
This little diagram on the
bottom shows a dog's skull.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.490
And if you can look
there, you'll see it looks

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.380
like just a regular
plate, but there's a mark

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.750
that shows you the section of the
jaw that's trying to say, fuse.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:36.370
So if it had just been a clean
break of a bone, you could do that.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:37.870 position:56%
You plate -when your bone is broken,

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:39.860
you can just plate
it and it'll heal.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:43.000
Sometimes, whole sections
of the jaw are removed.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.350
And when that happens, they've
often gone and used bone grafts

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:49.460
in the past, but the
results really weren't ideal.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.620
Now you fast forward with today's
technology and understanding

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.150
of science, and in
fact, on the human side,

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:59.420
FDA has approved two spinal
fusion products for use in people,

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:04.270 position:56%
and it consists of what we now call
recombinant human bone morphogenetic

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:07.350
proteins, for short, RHBMPs.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:10.330
What they really are, they're
special growth factors,

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:14.270
and they can absolutely help induce
formation of bone and cartilage.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:18.740
So now, we can treat
people and dogs similarly.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.220
And you'll be able to take, in this
case, if there had been a tumor

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:25.300
and you took it out, the two
pictures on the bottom show

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.330
if you'd just use a collagen
matrix, you can see it's still kind

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:29.820
of bluey/purple in the middle.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.620
It has really got all of the
bone forming very nicely.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.640
But if you do the collagen and
you then also add the RHBMPs,

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.930
you can see it looks like
bone all the way through.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:41.700
Much quicker, you get a
really good reconstruction,

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.660
and the benefits are fantastic.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.800
So again, One Health advances both.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.320
I can't resist.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.980
We see this, and we often
times are guilty of it.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:56.040
I for one do have a
slightly overweight pussycat.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:00.210
It's too easy, with our treats, to
have our little pets become obese.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:03.370
And we're just about as bad
sometimes if we're not careful.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:06.110
But the issue then is the health.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.030
And the health that
really comes from obesity

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:11.010
or being overweight
really is type 2 diabetes,

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.580
because that's one we can
change through exercise,

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:17.060
through eating healthy, we
can improve and minimize that.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.120
But it also can stress
us across the board

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.330
from cardio respiratory disease,
you can have hip problems

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.560
and knee problems, and of course
cancer is a potential as well.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.260 position:56%
So as you can see from the diagram,
sometimes nothing more than just get

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.960
up and take your dog for a walk,
go for a walk yourself, exercise.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.820 position:56%
And even though it's so nice to stop
by and get these fast food sometimes

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.410
that are processed, trying to focus

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:41.970
on healthy dieting is
something we can all embrace.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.820
And that'll be good
because that'll help us all.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:49.590
So after talking about One
Health, how are we starting

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:52.290
to bridge this back into
academic curriculums?

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:56.370 position:56%
And I'm very, very thrilled that
just this past year, the Association

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:59.040
of American Veterinary Medical
Colleges with the Association

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.270
of Preventive Teaching and Research

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:05.400
under the Healthy People Curriculum
Task Force has developed 15 case

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:10.120
studies to showcase literally
how One Health can be brought

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.940
into the academic situation.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.240
They're available online.

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.750
They're fabulous case studies
for you to take a look at.

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:20.020
But the whole goal there is to
really help our students be able

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:24.120
to get the knowledge and skills
needed to really address potentials

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.870
for transmission of human and
animal disease, how to prevent it,

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:30.820
how to address the health
issues once they've surfaced,

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.780
and what policies need to happen.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:37.280
And then under that One Health
principle, recognizing who needs

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.710 position:56%
to be invited to the table so we can
drop the pillars and work together.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.170
And that's really the
biggest challenge

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:46.010
in how One Health can
hopefully minimize that.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:49.330
So the 15 case studies,
I've listed them there.

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:51.390
Do take advantage of taking a look.

00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:53.650
They're very enlightening
and interesting,

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:57.760
and anybody can read them and
appreciate some of these examples.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.060
They really are good.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:04.500
And the wrapping up, we always
thought, when we had discovery

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.760 position:56%
of penicillin, that we had the magic
bullet and we were not going to have

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.870
to deal with any kind of infections
again; but that's not true.

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.360
Because even Sir Alexander
Fleming --

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.400
discovery of penicillin also
receiving the Nobel Prize,

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.020
cautioned resistance is a natural
counterpart to antibiotics.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.170
Welcome to the world of microbes.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:27.260
And this now, once again, is
an international global issue.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.130
Over the past decade, I think
we've seen some major concerns.

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:33.600
Nothing could be more heartbreaking
than to have an infection

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.660
and to have the physician tell
you, "I'm so sorry, I have nothing

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.660
to treat you or your family with."

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.830
And even more heartbreaking to
see that member of the family die.

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:46.170
So this is not to be taken
lightly; it's very serious.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.850
And we all have to be involved.

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:51.610
Are we capable of developing
some new antibiotics?

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:54.210
For the longest time
after this development,

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:55.510
we didn't think we needed them.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:57.560
They focused on virology
and vaccines.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:02.070
Now come fast forward, we
don't have in the armamentarium

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:05.570
of drugs a lot of new antibiotics.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:11.360
So as we understand the genome
of the microbe, are there ways

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.350
that we can come up with new
development of procedures

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:16.950
to treat these particular microbes?

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:20.870
This brings us all together:
public health, agriculture,

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.260
research, national security.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.070
I mentioned it earlier,
it's so true,

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:29.330
international travel has
really opened up the capability

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:32.490
of having these microbes
and the resistance

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:35.390
that they carry come over here.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:38.840
You could have an injury
when you're walking in India

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.180
and get an infection, and come
back home here and all of a sudden,

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.020
boom, you have an infection.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.320
And guess what?

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.360
It's a microbe and we don't have
that particular to treat it with.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.990
That's devastating, and
that has actually happened.

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:55.720
So we do need to be very cautious
and we all have to be stewards --

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.560
when I say stewards -- of
how we use these products,

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.100
be it for our own health,
taking care of our kids,

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.400
taking care of our animals.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.330
And more importantly, major
changes that I'm very proud

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:11.080
of at FDA is we really [inaudible]
in the case of how historically,

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.410
some very important
antimicrobials were being used

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.310
in production agriculture.

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:19.410
Way back when, some of our food
animals received these products

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.710
and they seemed to do very well.

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:24.840
They grew, they stayed
healthy -- well, that's nice.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.260
But that definition is
not good enough today.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.720
You need to know why are
you using an antibiotic,

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:33.680
what species is it being used
in, what dose range, how long,

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.590
and what pathogen are you treating.

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:39.110
And it really needs to be
properly handled through physicians

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:41.620
for people and for
veterinarians for animals.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.860
And so now we have made those
changes and we're seeing all

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.030
of that happen with a proper label.

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:50.870
And by January 2017 on
the food animal side,

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.140
any of these medically
important antibiotics will

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.790
in fact have proper labels.

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:58.200 position:56%
And the idea of thinking they could
have been used for growth promotion,

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.460
feed efficiency will
not happen anymore.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:02.860
So again, there needs
to be very cautious use

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:05.180
of these very important products.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.840
Along those lines, we did have
an executive order to try to come

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.410
up with a game plan of combatting
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:16.290
And it pleased me again to see

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:20.320
that in fact number two is
strengthen the national One Health

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.680
surveillance effort
to combat resistance.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:26.500
Again, we do need to study this,
we need to be surveilling this,

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.300
and we need to be able to
accelerate the research

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.940
to give us the tools that we need.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.540
Potentially even vaccines
can help as well here.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.250
But it's also going to improve
international collaboration

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:41.000
and sharing of information
that we see.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.440
Center picture says it all.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.350
No words are needed.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:47.530
When we have the benefits of
the human/animal interactions,

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:52.080
via from service dogs to our
service animals, to the love

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.380
and companionship that
our animals give us.

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.120
They really don't ask for very
much, but they give so much.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:01.370
Really, really does help all
of us with our mental health,

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:04.940
and I think so important,
companionship all the way through.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.870
They are jewels, and
therefore, we want to make sure

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.020
that we take care of them.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.490
But also, we need to be aware
of when they can be the ones

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:16.210
to transmit some potential
harmful diseases to us.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.770
So wrapping up, politics
has to get involved.

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:25.320 position:56%
If we're going to have these pillars
drop down, we need people to help

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.440
at the level of the government.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.780
Most recently, there was
the One Health Act of 2016

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.080
that was introduced by Congress.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.760
And if this happens, it's
sole focus is to do just that.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.890 position:56%
So how do we get federal agencies to
work together to try to address some

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:41.400
of these infectious diseases?

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.800
How do we prevent them?

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.050
Could we get grants so that
instead of just a silo of I'm going

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.290 position:56%
to get a grant from this one agency,
and I'm going to go over here

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:51.540
for a separate grant for a
different agency, but yet,

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.000
we want to work together.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.710
We need to have the granting
agencies be able to acknowledge

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:59.270
and say it's OK for different
backgrounds to apply for a grant

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:00.990
and work together,
and most importantly,

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:03.120
to publish together and
to make that easier.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:09.210 position:56%
When I think about where do I go for
a competitive grant for a disease

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:14.000
in a cat or a dog,
pretty hard to find that.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.550
ONH is really going to
focus on the human side.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:20.930
USDA is really going to focus
on more so the food/animal side.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:22.440
So there's areas.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.280
And EPA will be doing
your environmental side.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.770
But when something crosses and
it's a health issue for both sides,

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:32.060
then hopefully we can
encourage the granting agencies

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.170
and Congress to open up the doors.

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.280
And then of course,
internationally, how do you deal

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.580
with the World Bank/World
Health organization?

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:41.920
Because we do need to take a look
at sharing data, working together,

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.440
and learning from each other.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.110
So this morning I took
advantage in a very short moment

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:50.490
to give you examples of so
many opportunities that come

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.060
under that wonderful
umbrella of One Health.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:56.320
And these have highlighted
through the talk examples.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.220
There's many more that
I'm sure each one

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.280
of you could add do an
entire presentation on.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.500
But I think it's heightening
that awareness,

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.450
and bringing this together
is really the goal.

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:08.880
And most recently, to let
you know, there is going

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.100
to be an international symposium
on One Health in Mongolia in June.

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:15.310
There is going to be a
second global conference

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:17.580
on One Health in Japan in November.

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.920
And then in December,
Melbourne is going

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:24.480
to host the convention
on One Health EcoHealth.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.840
So I'm really pleased to
see this being embraced

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.430
in so many broad brushstrokes.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:33.830
And finally, there
is a desire to see

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:38.710
that we can maybe have even
annually a One Health Day.

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:41.170
So the very first one we've
chosen is November 4th,

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:44.450
and it's an international
campaign which has been coordinated

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:46.910
by the three groups I highlighted
at the start of the talk --

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:48.550
the One Health Commission,
One Health Initiative,

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.600
and One Health Platform
Foundation --

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.430 position:56%
to really bring attention around the
world for how these interactions are

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:57.960
so crucial, and that we
benefit by working together.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.190
And this campaign is going
to highlight literally

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:04.010
around the world a number
of projects ongoing,

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:05.900
they can be small,
they can be large.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:10.150
But it's the idea to show
with inspiration so many ways

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:11.820
that we can work together.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.890
And by working together,
I truthfully believe

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:18.440
that we can make a difference and
we can attain health for people,

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.160
animals, and for our environment.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.510 position:56%
And I thank you so very much for the
opportunity to speak with you today.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:28.170
[ Applause ]

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:30.980
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: [Inaudible]
ask questions

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:35.710
and the speaker is
going to [inaudible].

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:44.680
&gt;&gt; I wondered what you thought of
the Olympics in Brazil and what --

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:51.870
but I know that the low end has
got our people in short shorts,

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:58.210
where the Japanese have
the parachute long clothes.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:02.910
Do you think it's safe for
people to -- and the Olympics.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:05.470
&gt;&gt; Bernadette Dunham: So the
question what do we think

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:08.580
about attending the Olympics to be
held this year in Brazil knowing

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.470
that Zika virus is a concern.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.450
And the clothing that
various members

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:15.600
of the Olympic teams coming
internationally should

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.070
or should not wear.

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:19.790
This is definitely a
major issue of concern.

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:27.310
And I think aspects of how one can
protect oneself courtesy of yes,

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:29.220
you know, various insecticide
sprays.

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.650
Clothing certainly is true.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.500
So if I was going to have
shorts, I'd definitely want

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:37.580
to make sure I had some
repellant on my skin, for example.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.590
I think is Brazil is doing a
tremendous job on communicating

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:44.100
to enhance awareness
of what people can do.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.090
They're really, really
focusing, I think right now,

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:51.390
heavily on both the
insecticide spray,

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:53.080
they actually have some potentials

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.800
for reducing the population
of mosquitos.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.400
But it's still something that
you have to take responsibility

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.520
for your own health
and be very cautious.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.550
And I do think there's
a number of entities

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:06.990
that allows us to ensure that.

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:10.320
So each person should be
aware and then make a decision

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.860
as to how they want to go forward.

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:14.090
And I think all of the
Olympic teams in the countries

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.100
around the world are
paying attention to this

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.750
to try to minimize the problem.

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:22.810
And by far, if we did have
the capability, as I said,

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:24.700
for diagnostics to
be able to fine tune,

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.190
it would help a tremendous amount
to reassure someone, you know,

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:28.910
having been exposed or not.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:33.180
So in the meantime, Zika has
been around for a little while,

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:38.130 position:56%
but most recently it's been the
major, major scare for the potential

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:41.550
for this transmission of the
microcephaly in pregnant women.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.950
And many times, as I mentioned,
if we did we get exposed,

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:45.830
you will develop some
antibodies towards it,

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:47.380
so you'll probably be fine.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:51.040
But it's the pregnancy that
becomes the biggest issue of all.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.120
And then as you know, the
potential sexual transmission

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.650
of this becomes an issue.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:59.060
So education, education,
education is needed right now,

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:02.070
and then having people make
informed and safe decisions.

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:03.370
Does that help?

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:04.670
&gt;&gt; Great. Thanks.

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:05.970
&gt;&gt; Bernadette Dunham:
You're welcome.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:07.270
Yes, sir.

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:10.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So there's been a lot of emphasis
in recent years on using viruses

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:13.770
to treat certain illnesses like
[inaudible] with brain cancer.

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:22.660 position:56%
So can you talk a little bit about a
One Health perspective on the future

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.190
of that type of treatment?

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:30.940 position:56%
Can using a virus to treat a disease
cross species in a way that some

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.980
of these other things
can [inaudible]?

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.850
&gt;&gt; Bernadette Dunham:
So the question is,

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:38.010
moving back into the
medical side, can we use some

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:41.080
of the various viruses that we
looked at and can they be used

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.940
to prevent and treat
certain diseases.

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:48.420
And I think that is one area
that is becoming very exciting

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.750
because we are using
many times a virus vector

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:54.170 position:56%
to transfer in a treatment modality.

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.920
We have to be very careful
that some of the viruses

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.990
that we use are not
going to cause illness.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:02.470
And that perfection of
the dose needs to be

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:04.590
and is being looked at right now.

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:08.210
So it's a very good
tool, but coordination

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:11.230
and still the research
is exciting opportunities

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:12.970
which I think the future
is going to unfold more

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.270
and more as we go forward.

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:16.740
So yes, it's a good question
and it's definitely being looked

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:21.330
at with potentials that
could be very beneficial.

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:22.630
Yes, sir.

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:25.670
&gt;&gt; How do you relate One Health
to [inaudible] you have lots

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:31.370
of people [inaudible] nowadays,
like, basically refugees and just

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:34.320
for the climate reasons, and
this has affected disease

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.620
around the world?

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:39.020
Does this tie in to this also?

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:42.010
&gt;&gt; Bernadette Dunham: So the
question is how do we look

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:45.010
at the population of people in
different countries and refugees --

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.340
&gt;&gt; Population [inaudible].

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.500
&gt;&gt; Bernadette Dunham: And then
where they're concentrated,

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.520
and we're looking at
potentials for climate change,

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:55.160
how does that overall fall
under the One Health umbrella?

00:46:55.160 --> 00:47:02.300
&gt;&gt; More or less having basically
people coming from one country

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.410
to another without being
screened for diseases.

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:05.710
&gt;&gt; Bernadette Dunham: OK.

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:07.570
Having people travel from one
country to another without being --

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:09.000
&gt;&gt; Particularly refugees.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.350
&gt;&gt; Bernadette Dunham:
Without being screened.

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:13.330
And that is definitely the
challenge that we're facing.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:18.390
When I mentioned the concern
even with Yellow virus and where

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:22.140
that could go, the
scenario is just that --

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.820
what's the screening
capability that we have?

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.420
People do travel back and forth.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:29.980
You may not even get sick but be
exposed, and then go back home

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.460
to your country and be able

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.660
to be potentially transmitting
this infection.

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.710
I think more importantly, it's
just that heightened awareness

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:39.950
of what are the various
diseases that are

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:42.450
in certain countries
that we're aware of.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:47.630
And through that type of
surveillance, be able to caution

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:49.890
if someone is then
traveling to another country

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:54.890
where that disease is not known,
then are setting them up to have

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:58.390
that new disease nestle in
and challenge our health

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:01.530
or potential health of animals.

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:03.880
This is the whole idea
behind One Health

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.870
which is surveillance is a major,
major important part of that,

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:11.080
and are we aware of what is
happening in various countries.

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.730
How do we assimilate
that information?

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:17.900
The more that we can, the more that
we can advise or be on the lookout

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:24.130
when someone is traveling that
we can hopefully follow them.

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:30.470
People often times may not want
to say, "Well, I have been exposed

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:33.000
to said disease, therefore
I can't travel.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.830
Many times, they may stay silent,
and that can do a lot of harm.

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:38.860
So it's turning it
around to be supportive

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:42.300
and to showcase how together
we need to protect your health

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.520
and the health of other people.

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:48.810
It's really back to can we
afford infrastructure wise

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:51.590
for these diagnostic tests if
that's what it's going to be.

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:54.730
So the surveillance is one
that information that we have,

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:58.700
if we can find ways of sharing
that and minimizing the cost,

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.480
that's another one that will
open up the doors for being aware

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.480
and hopefully taking
advantage of One Health.

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.780
Does that help?

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.080
&gt;&gt; Then to follow up,
what sort of related --

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:12.320
where you have say Dengue in the
low lying areas of the country,

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:17.870
but the internal parts [inaudible]
the same set of diseases.

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:21.130
Are things changes whereas
there's more interactions

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:24.080
so the highlands will
get the lowland diseases

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.380
and vice versa [inaudible]?

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.490
&gt;&gt; Bernadette Dunham: So
the question is with Dengue,

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:30.720
which you see typically around your
coastal areas if you come inland

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:34.350
or higher elevations, would you
therefore see the transmission.

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:36.660
Part of that goes into
the vector itself

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.250
in the transmission capabilities.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:41.820
So right now, the mosquito is very
happy all on the coastal areas,

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.840
but how far north can
it go or survive?

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.260
That would be an issue
to track and see just

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:49.570
where that mosquito is
basically surviving.

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:54.000
But then if you have been
exposed to Dengue and you travel

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.130
into the Colorado Mountains,
your potential is

00:49:57.130 --> 00:49:59.220
for you and probably you alone.

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:00.520
Then whether or not --

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.250
-- another mosquito is capable of
picking that up and then surviving

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:05.780
and transmitting it in Colorado,

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.360
this is where you need the
surveillance and understanding

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.410
of the various vectors
such as mosquitos

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:12.350
and what they will
or will not transmit.

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:15.020
They don't always transmit
each one of these diseases;

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:17.040
that needs to be looked into.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.340
Same with the ticks.

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:21.040
Different ticks will transmit
certain diseases or not.

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:25.320
But this again is opening up
everybody's eyes to an awareness

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:28.410
that we probably didn't have
before, and with that awareness,

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:31.960
what are potential new tools that
we need to have to be able to track

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.990
and see what's happening.

00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:38.300
Or does there need to be a
specific host that can sustain

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:41.710
that particular disease so that
then a vector can come along

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:44.150
and continue to transmit it.

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:46.260
Aedes is in Asia, but in fact,

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.150
we haven't had Yellow fever
breakout in a major way.

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:50.450
So potential is there.

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:51.750
And you say, "Well, why hasn't it?"

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:54.110
And I think it's very
important that we look at areas

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:57.970
where Aedes is surviving, yet
you don't have specific diseases.

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:00.930
And yet it's a great transmitter
of that, and you have to say why.

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:04.100
So this is I think that
awareness of surveillance,

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.110
and these questions
need to be asked,

00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:08.810
and then bring our researchers
and our entomologists together

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:10.310
to understand more about this.

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:14.680
Because if we can learn from
certain locations or environments,

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.660
maybe we can modify
those and have them

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:22.800 position:56%
as interventions in other countries.

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:27.120
Thank you.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.420
Yes, ma'am.

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:39.170
&gt;&gt; What impact can One Health have
on bioterrorism and agroterrorism,

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:42.470
is it just raising
awareness of the issue

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.770
or bringing together
governments to make sure

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:50.580
that they don't utilize those
tactics; what does One Health do?

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:54.820
&gt;&gt; Bernadette Dunham: So the
question is One Health and how

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:59.880
that would handle bioterrorism
across the board.

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:03.670
So many of the biological
entities that are used

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:08.020
in bioterrorism are those exactly,

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:12.490
the zoonotic entities
that we talked about.

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:15.380
Anthrax was used here
up on the Hill.

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:19.520
The potential for some
of these viruses is huge.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:23.510
It's that awareness
again of why nations need

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:27.210
to understand the devastation
that would occur

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:29.860
through a biological agent
that if that transmission,

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:33.390
especially being transmitted from
people to people for example,

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:37.540
is huge, then in this global world,

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:40.330
it doesn't take much
to have that spread.

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:44.640
And that annihilation is
horrific to even think about it.

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:49.830
So it think it's more
important, and this is why as even

00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:54.100
with the nuclear weapon discussion,
the devastation is so huge,

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:58.810
everybody needs to do everything
they can to prevent that.

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:05.000
So the education of what
these biological viruses

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:10.410
and agents can do is one that
we would hope would be forefront

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:17.150
and the government agencies to
say we're not going to go there.

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:24.750
A lot of good can come from so
much of the research that we have,

00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:33.440
and the understanding of so many
of these important entities.

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.670
But you're right.

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:47.290
You flip the coin and they can
suddenly become the most horrific

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:54.590
agents that we've ever seen if
we don't have a way to intervene.

00:53:54.590 --> 00:54:07.570
For some of these agents, we
may or may not have a treatment

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:10.020
or a vaccine, and how
long does it take

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:14.540
to develop those interventions,
is it a challenge?

00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:18.270
And then how do you stockpile
so that you're prepared?

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:19.570
So I agree with you.

00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:22.560
I would hope that our nations
internationally can work together

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:27.460 position:56%
and avoid going there, but it's only
through that heightened awareness.

00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:32.210 position:56%
And that gets back again to then how
do you do the surveillance to track

00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:37.130
and see what's happening, and
only through us acknowledging

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:39.330
that we do live together
in this world.

00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:42.000
So what's going to happen just

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.700
across the ocean can
still impact us.

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:49.670
That mindset, I think is
starting to change more and more.

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:52.050
That's a good question.

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:53.350
Thank you.

00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:54.650
Yes, ma'am.

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:55.950
&gt;&gt; Does FDA have any
cooperative programs

00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:58.700
where they assist developing
countries with developing processes

00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:01.170
for drug approvals or for
diagnostic test approvals?

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:04.730 position:56%
I mean, there are a lot of neglected
[inaudible] diseases out there

00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:08.610
that we don't have here, therefore,
there's no incentive for a lot

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:09.910
of [inaudible] activity here.

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:12.040
But certainly FDA has expertise
that could be shared by helping

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.400
out countries that do
have these problems.

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.700
&gt;&gt; Bernadette Dunham: The question
is does FDA have programs whereby

00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:16.000
the staff that has
this knowledgebase

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.300
of the drug approval process,
can they assist other countries

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:18.710
where in fact they do have diseases
that we might not have here,

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:20.010
and can they assist
in developing programs

00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:21.310
for drug approval in
the other countries.

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:22.610
And there's a number
of groups where we look

00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:23.910
at international harmonization
literally for human drugs

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:25.210
and animal drugs on how
countries can share information

00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:26.780
and work together and have the
pharmaceutical companies literally

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:28.080
be able to go through
the process of bringing

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.380
to fruition approved products
in different countries,

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:30.680
taking advantage of
that knowledgebase.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.030
Many times, we have workshops and
sessions to go to other countries

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:34.040 position:56%
to showcase examples of how they can
develop their own regulatory program

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.340
for drug approval.

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:36.640
And the companies themselves
often participate

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:37.940
to enhance that awareness.

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.240
Wherever we can, I think the
part that's so critical --

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.540
and we see this even with HIV --

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:41.840
so we have potential products
that can be used to treat people,

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.140
but then how do we make those
available and affordable

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.440
when you're looking
across the world?

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:45.740
And that's going to bring
the countries together

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.040
to address these issues as well.

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.340
So there is that capability.

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.640
And a number of governments
will come here and visit with us

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:50.940
and learn how do you do A, B, C, D,

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.240 position:56%
E. And if we can show them different
venues at different levels --

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:53.540
so what exactly do you need?

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:54.840
It may not be the same as a
different country over here.

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:56.140
You may want the full
monty; you may not.

00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:57.440
And we can help, and
other countries can help

00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.740
that have full regulatory programs
onboard to work with countries

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.040
that are coming forward
and developing their own.

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:01.340
Thank you.

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.640
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Please join me
to thank again for Dr. Dunham.

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.940
