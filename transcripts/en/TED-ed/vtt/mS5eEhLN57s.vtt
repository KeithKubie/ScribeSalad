00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.960
You’ve discovered a doorway
to another realm,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.880
and now you and your brother 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.220
are off exploring the wonderful
world of Paradoxica.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.210
Fantastically paradoxical creatures crawl,
run, and fly around you.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.700
And then you see the troll.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.610
It’s catching all the creatures
in an enormous net.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.930
You bravely step forward
and demand it let them go.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.470
The troll laughs.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.370
“If you’re such a
fan of paradoxes,” it says,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.040
“then I’ll make you an offer.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.440
If you say something true,
I’ll release all these creatures."

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.640
You’re about to say, “You are a troll,”

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.060
but before you can,
the troll grabs your brother.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.480
“If you say something false,”
he continues,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.890
“then I’ll release your brother."

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.792
Your statement can 
only be a single sentence.

00:00:56.792 --> 00:01:01.452
And as you can see,
I hate paradoxes more than anything.

00:01:01.452 --> 00:01:04.782
If you try to cheat
by saying something paradoxical,

00:01:04.782 --> 00:01:06.847
like, ‘this statement is false,’

00:01:06.847 --> 00:01:10.517
then I'll eat your brother 
and the creatures."

00:01:10.517 --> 00:01:14.049
What true/false statement
can you say to force the troll

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.529
to free your brother
and the paradoxical creatures?

00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:19.102
[Pause the video now if you
want to figure it out for yourself!]

00:01:19.102 --> 00:01:20.502
Answer in: 3

00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:23.312
Answer in: 2

00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:26.072
Answer in: 1

00:01:26.072 --> 00:01:28.822
This seems like an impossible situation,

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:30.972
but incredibly, you can say something

00:01:30.972 --> 00:01:34.432
that will force the troll to
release all its prisoners.

00:01:34.432 --> 00:01:37.452
This is an example of coercive logic,

00:01:37.452 --> 00:01:42.462
invented by the great logician 
and puzzle creator Raymond Smullyan.

00:01:42.462 --> 00:01:45.922
The trick Smullyan came up with
involves saying a statement

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:51.152
whose truth or falseness depends on
what you want the troll to do.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:54.242
Your statement still
has to be carefully crafted.

00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:56.292
For example, if you were to say,

00:01:56.292 --> 00:01:59.102
“You are going to free the 
creatures and my brother,”

00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:03.762
the troll could respond, “that’s false… 
I’m only going to free your brother.”

00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:07.262
Similarly, if you said, “You will free 
the paradoxes,”

00:02:07.262 --> 00:02:11.442
the troll could say, “That’s true,” 
and free the paradoxes.

00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:16.462
But watch what happens if you say,
“You will free my brother.”

00:02:16.462 --> 00:02:18.202
The statement can’t be false,

00:02:18.202 --> 00:02:21.442
because if it were, the troll, 
by its own rules,

00:02:21.442 --> 00:02:23.452
would have to free your brother.

00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:27.432
That would make the statement
paradoxically true and false.

00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:29.422
But the troll hates paradoxes

00:02:29.422 --> 00:02:32.162
and would never willingly create one.

00:02:32.162 --> 00:02:35.952
So his only option 
is for the statement to be true.

00:02:35.952 --> 00:02:38.132
If “you will free my brother” is true,

00:02:38.132 --> 00:02:40.462
then the troll 
has to release your brother.

00:02:40.462 --> 00:02:44.872
And by its own rules, the troll
has to free the creatures as well,

00:02:44.872 --> 00:02:47.382
since you said a true statement.

00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:51.052
By wielding just 5 words
like a logical scalpel,

00:02:51.052 --> 00:02:54.502
you’ve forced the troll
to free all its prisoners.

00:02:54.502 --> 00:02:56.492
As the troll stomps off in anger,

00:02:56.492 --> 00:02:59.922
the paradoxes cheer you
for winning them their freedom,

00:02:59.922 --> 00:03:03.389
and promise to lead you to the
treasure at the top of the stairs.

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.819
If you can reach it.
