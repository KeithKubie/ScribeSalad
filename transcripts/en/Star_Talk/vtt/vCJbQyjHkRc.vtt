00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.320
Neil: So do you you count yourself as having geek street cred?

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:11.300
Trevor: I don't know what geek street cred is. I feel like geek and street don't mix. Geek lab cred?

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.240
Trevor: You know what...
Neil: In South Africa did you have science teachers?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.860
Trevor: I did. I had one of my favorite teachers
and probably my best teacher was my

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.460
science teacher Mr. Pilate and he was... he
just made everything seem simple like he

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.620
You know you know when those teachers can teach you a thing like

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.890
Neil: Not all teachers can do that!

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.149
Trevor: And he... I would get better marks at
science than I would at most subjects

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.719
and I think it was just he made me
understand what it was all about.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:45.900
Neil: That's good, yeah that's good. So then you became
a comedian. Apparently he wasn't influential enough!

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.080
Trevor: Well, what happened actually was my math

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.040
teacher was horrible and because he failed me,
Neil: That cancelled out...

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.860
Trevor: No, and then I couldn't I couldn't go and
study in university I couldn't do

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.300
because in South Africa if you
don't do math you can't do science

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.080
anymore and so because I failed at math they basically went "you fail at science"

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.530
and I used to get an "A" for
science. I could have been you.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.720
Neil: But, see, math is the language of the universe.
Trevor: So what I was speaking

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.159
was a dialect? How does that work? I was
passing at science that's all I know and

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.460
you just sent me back. I couldn't speak a
language of the universe.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.860
Neil: So you went the comedian track instead of the
scientist track.
Trevor: Yes.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.260
Neil: That's good, but how about just general geek, are you a geek sympathizer?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.100
Trevor: I don't know. I feel like geeks run the universe look at you! You have your number one on the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.939
book selling list! Geeks are running
Silicon Valley, running TV shows.

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.880
The richest people in the world! I don't
think you need sympathy if you're a geek

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.640
now. I feel like it's the other way
around because imagine if you are on the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.290
cusp of geek vs. jockness. Yeah right
those are time when jock was everything.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.720
Neil: Yes, and they give us wedgies. 
Trevor: Right, and then what happened was geek all of a sudden tipped that.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.120
Neil: Yeah, because the jocks needed us to fix their computers.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.880
Trevor: But now imagine if you were jock
just pre-tech boom, like and then you just

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.890
just jocked at the wrong time.
Neil: Oh that'd be bad.
Trevor: Imagine that.
Neil: You're homeless now.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.860
Trevor: Now you're struggling and then you're like man I

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.910
used to give that guy wedgies.
Neil: I'd like that verb - jocked at the wrong time.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.700
Trevor: Yeah, you jocked at the wrong time. You could have geeked at the wrong time.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.860
You could have geeked in the dark ages! That's the wrong time to geek.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.280
Neil: Total wrong time to geek.
Trevor: The worst time to geek!

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.750
Imagine you trying to be a scientist in the dark ages.
Neil: No, I'd be burned upside down at the stake.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.260
Trevor: And just because you were black, mostly. That would it be like

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.920
most of it and then they'd be like oh
yeah and he was a scientist. I don't even

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.220
know what that was! I'm glad we burned
him.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.870
