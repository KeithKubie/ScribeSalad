00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:11.168
Marina: My first performance
was not in a (laughs)

00:00:11.168 --> 00:00:13.034
It was nothing to do with art,

00:00:13.034 --> 00:00:15.563
but I consider it was
the first performance.

00:00:15.563 --> 00:00:18.980
I really, really was very ugly as a child

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.813
and I had this terrible
haircut over the ears

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:24.419
and I wore orthopedic shoes
and I have a child face

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:25.815
with a huge nose.

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.810
It was impossible for me to even
look at myself in the mirror.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.299
I always asked my mother if she can go

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:33.655
to the doctor with me
and we operate the nose

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:35.104
and every time she would slap my face

00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:36.738
and say, "Out of the question."

00:00:36.738 --> 00:00:39.357
One day, I really made this perfect plan.

00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:42.115
I was absolutely fascinated
with Brigitte Bardot,

00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:43.948
so I took photographs from newspaper

00:00:43.948 --> 00:00:47.237
and I had all the photos of
Brigitte Bardot in my pocket

00:00:47.237 --> 00:00:51.037
and I had this plan of spinning
around fast, fast, fast,

00:00:51.037 --> 00:00:53.040
falling on the edge of the bed was sharp,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.317
break my nose,

00:00:54.317 --> 00:00:55.541
then we go to hospital,

00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:58.487
then I have Brigitte Bardot
photos already in the pockets,

00:00:58.487 --> 00:01:01.823
so in the case of, "There's
no time. We can fix it."

00:01:01.823 --> 00:01:03.819
I spin around, I miss the whole thing,

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:05.487
I almost gave myself a cut

00:01:05.487 --> 00:01:09.485
and all the photographs of
Brigitte Bardot fall on the floor

00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:12.439
and my mother arrive in the
room and just slap my face.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.517
It was end of the Brigitte Bardot story.

00:01:14.517 --> 00:01:18.517
I consider this pretty much
as the first performance.
