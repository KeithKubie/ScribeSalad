00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.210
A small multiple, sometimes known as a trellis or

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.860
a lattice plot is a series of charts laid out in a grid.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.680
They often represent common data faceted by different categories.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.090
In this case we have engineering,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.580
operations, accounting, HR, IT, and manufacturing.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.940
On the X axis we have different months of the year.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.960
And on the Y axis we have different salary expenses for each department.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.960
I really love small multiple plots because you can embed any type of chart and

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.080
they generalize to any type of comparison.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.140
Here we've embedded line plots to show how

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.520
salary expenses vary over months of the year for each department.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.430
But we could have just as easily embedded different histograms, maps, or

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.920
even pie charts.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.450
The small multiple was popularized in coin by Edward Tufte,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.470
a leader in the field of data visualization.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.900
We'll learn more about him later in the lesson.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.930
And we'll hear about him throughout the course.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.970
Box plots are another technique to visualize multiple distributions in

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.850
one graphic.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.560
Just like a small multiple, a series of box plots allow us to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.760
visualize different distributions all in one graphic.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.690
The box plot was invented by John Tukey and

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.670
comes from the field of exploratory data analysis.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.180
While small multiple and box plots are often used for

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.390
exploratory data analysis to learn how your data's distributed.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.430
They can also be used to convey certain points and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.860
relationships between your data and your variables.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.640
For example, in the box plot here, we have a series of experiments, one,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.930
two, three, four, and five, measuring the speed of light.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.360
And for each experiment we take a series of measurements that are visualized as

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.070
a single box plot.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.550
Here we can see the quartile ranges, and the mean.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.290
And we can plot these side by side to see what we likely believe the speed of

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.570
light to be after a series of experiments.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.780
We can see here, the true speed of light is actually plotted in the red line,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.150
and is quite a bit lower than all the experiments shown here.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.020
Just one last point on the difference between EDA and data visualization,

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.230
typically in EDA you're trying to discover some information about your data for

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.580
yourself, whereas with a data visualization you're trying to

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.700
communicate some information about your data to others.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.240
Depending upon your intention, you can use both box plots and small multiples to

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.910
either learn more about your data or try to convey something to others
