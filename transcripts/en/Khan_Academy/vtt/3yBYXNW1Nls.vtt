00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:01.900
Voiceover:The first thing
I want to do in this video

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.797
is given the information
given about this triangle.

00:00:04.797 --> 00:00:06.481
Figuring out the unknowns,

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:09.353
figuring out the length here this value a,

00:00:09.353 --> 00:00:12.089
figuring out this length in orange, b,

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.491
figuring out the measure of this angle

00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:16.859
which we'll call alpha in
figuring out in radians

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.578
and figuring out the
measure of this angle,

00:00:18.578 --> 00:00:20.540
right over here in blue
that we could call beta.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.369
I encourage you to pause the video now

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.598
and given the information that we have

00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:26.326
try to figure out these unknowns.

00:00:27.787 --> 00:00:29.694
Assuming you've given it a try,

00:00:29.694 --> 00:00:32.582
so let's see what we can determine.

00:00:32.582 --> 00:00:34.876
We know two of the side lengths

00:00:34.876 --> 00:00:38.162
and they're the same, they
both have side length two

00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:41.660
and they've given us one of
the angles right over here,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.819
this yellow angle has a measure
of pi over three radians.

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:46.772
One thing that jumps out of me

00:00:46.772 --> 00:00:48.996
is that this is an isosceles triangle.

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:52.799
An isosceles triangle has two sides

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.220
that have the same length

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.457
so this side is congruent to
that side right over there.

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.321
That means that the base angles,

00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:02.055
the corresponding base angles

00:01:02.055 --> 00:01:03.315
are also going to be congruent

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:04.116
and that's just because

00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:05.707
this is a property of isosceles triangles.

00:01:05.707 --> 00:01:07.238
These two are congruent

00:01:07.238 --> 00:01:09.099
so the two base angles
are going to be congruent.

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:13.157
That means that beta is also equal to

00:01:13.157 --> 00:01:15.981
pi over three radians.

00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:19.374
This is also beta is also equal to

00:01:19.374 --> 00:01:23.404
pi over three radians.

00:01:23.404 --> 00:01:25.943
Now let's think about ...

00:01:25.943 --> 00:01:28.949
Now what else we can
attempt to figure out.

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:31.846
Well if we know beta is pi over three

00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:33.213
and we know this angle in yellow

00:01:33.213 --> 00:01:34.556
is pi over three radians,

00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:37.524
we can figure out what
this angle over here

00:01:37.524 --> 00:01:38.693
in white is

00:01:38.693 --> 00:01:40.781
and I don't know, let's call that angle,

00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:42.860
the measure of that angle let's call it x.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.460
If we're thinking in terms of radians

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.794
x plus, this angle plus
pi over three radians,

00:01:49.794 --> 00:01:53.610
plus pi over three radians,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.841
this is the sum of the
interior pi over three.

00:01:57.841 --> 00:01:59.712
This is the sum of the interior angles

00:01:59.712 --> 00:02:01.717
of this larger triangle right over here,

00:02:01.717 --> 00:02:04.104
they're going to sum up to pi radians.

00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:06.433
If we're thinking in degrees
it would be 180 degrees

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:09.276
so those are going to
sum up to pi radians.

00:02:09.276 --> 00:02:11.228
What's x going to be

00:02:11.228 --> 00:02:13.040
and this one you can
almost look straight at it.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.777
You say, this is going to be pi over three

00:02:14.777 --> 00:02:16.705
but if you want to solve a
little bit more systematically

00:02:16.705 --> 00:02:19.133
you can subtract these two from both sides

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:25.086
and you get x is equal to,

00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:30.813
I'll rewrite this orange
pi is three pi over three,

00:02:30.813 --> 00:02:35.906
this is the same thing as
pi, minus pi over three,

00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:39.641
minus pi over three,

00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:42.129
which of course three pi minus pi minus pi

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.294
is going to be pi over three.

00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:50.712
These angles measure is
also pi over three radians.

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:53.132
Now that's interesting
because these shows us

00:02:53.132 --> 00:02:55.066
that this is actually
an equilateral triangle.

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:57.939
All of the sides, when all of the sides

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.871
have the same angle measure that means …

00:03:00.871 --> 00:03:04.696
when all the angles have
the same angle measure

00:03:04.696 --> 00:03:06.792
that means all the sides
are going to be congruent.

00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:09.203
If this side is two, this side is two

00:03:09.203 --> 00:03:14.522
then that means that this
entire side right over here,

00:03:14.522 --> 00:03:18.787
this entire side right
over here is equal to two.

00:03:18.787 --> 00:03:22.666
Now what else can we
attempt to figure out.

00:03:23.666 --> 00:03:24.907
Well let's see

00:03:24.907 --> 00:03:27.012
we know this is pi over three radians.

00:03:27.012 --> 00:03:31.842
We know that this is pi,

00:03:31.842 --> 00:03:32.775
we know beta is pi over three,

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:34.071
we know that this is …

00:03:34.071 --> 00:03:36.022
If we're thinking degrees 90 degrees

00:03:36.022 --> 00:03:37.716
which is the same thing as pi over two

00:03:37.716 --> 00:03:39.559
so if we know these two
angles of a triangle

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:41.070
we can figure out what alpha is.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.996
We know that alpha, let me write it here.

00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:50.079
Alpha plus pi over three,

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.136
plus this right angle which
in radians is pi over two.

00:03:56.198 --> 00:03:57.288
We'll do in white.

00:03:57.288 --> 00:04:00.970
Plus pi over two, that's
this angle right over here,

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.992
plus pi over two are going to equal …

00:04:03.992 --> 00:04:06.015
or the sum of the interior
angles of a triangle ...

00:04:06.015 --> 00:04:08.906
Remember we're looking at
this triangle right over here

00:04:08.906 --> 00:04:10.827
that's going to be equal to

00:04:10.827 --> 00:04:13.040
if we thought in degrees it
would be 180 degrees in radians

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.621
it would be equal to pi.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.154
We get alpha,

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:23.587
alpha is equal to pi which
is the same thing ...

00:04:23.587 --> 00:04:25.234
Let's see I'll find a
common denominator of six.

00:04:25.234 --> 00:04:27.774
We can write that as six pi over six,

00:04:27.774 --> 00:04:31.869
minus pi over three which
is the same thing as

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:34.567
two pi over six.

00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:36.186
I'm just subtracting this from both sides

00:04:36.186 --> 00:04:37.528
and I wrote it like that.

00:04:37.528 --> 00:04:39.706
Minus pi over two which
is the same thing as

00:04:39.706 --> 00:04:41.918
three pi over six

00:04:41.918 --> 00:04:45.837
and that's going to be equal to

00:04:45.837 --> 00:04:47.874
six minus two minus three is one.

00:04:47.874 --> 00:04:49.765
That's going to be equal to pi over six.

00:04:49.765 --> 00:04:53.139
Alpha is pie over six

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:57.203
so let me write that alpha is
equal to pi over six radians.

00:04:57.203 --> 00:05:02.853
This over here is pi over six radians.

00:05:02.853 --> 00:05:04.323
Now what's interesting about that

00:05:04.323 --> 00:05:07.582
is that shows that alpha is exactly half

00:05:07.582 --> 00:05:11.451
of this pi over three radian,
white angle over here.

00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:13.656
That has measure angle at alpha

00:05:13.656 --> 00:05:15.153
and this one also has alpha,

00:05:15.153 --> 00:05:16.916
a measure of alpha radians.

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:21.039
Pi over six plus pi over
six is pi over three.

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.529
Now what's interesting about that is

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.946
that gives us confidence
that this thing over here

00:05:26.946 --> 00:05:31.690
is going to be bisecting
this side over here

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.549
that this length

00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:37.047
is equivalent to this
length right over here.

00:05:37.047 --> 00:05:39.195
We are bisecting this angle

00:05:39.195 --> 00:05:41.355
and so when we get to the other side

00:05:41.355 --> 00:05:43.792
and this is an isosceles triangle,

00:05:43.792 --> 00:05:45.817
we could actually now prove

00:05:45.817 --> 00:05:48.546
that these are congruent triangles

00:05:48.546 --> 00:05:51.632
that you have a side, an angle and a side,

00:05:51.632 --> 00:05:53.449
side angle side.

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.995
This side corresponds to that side

00:05:55.995 --> 00:05:58.569
so these two sides need to be congruent.

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.322
Now because these two sides are congruent

00:06:01.322 --> 00:06:02.567
we know this has length b

00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:03.971
then this has also length b

00:06:03.971 --> 00:06:07.446
so we know that b plus b is equal to two,

00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:12.315
or we could just say b is equal to one.

00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:20.028
Now we could use that
information to solve for a

00:06:20.028 --> 00:06:21.736
using the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:06:21.736 --> 00:06:24.869
This is a right triangle
so we could say a squared

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:27.782
plus b squared which is one squared

00:06:27.782 --> 00:06:32.395
is equal to two squared,

00:06:32.395 --> 00:06:35.989
or we could say, let's say a squared

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:39.557
is going to be equal to
two squared minus one

00:06:39.557 --> 00:06:42.193
so it's going to be equal to three.

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:44.325
I just subtracted one from both sides

00:06:44.325 --> 00:06:46.577
and so we would have a

00:06:46.577 --> 00:06:53.158
is equal to the square root of three.

00:06:53.158 --> 00:06:55.853
If you remember your
special right triangles

00:06:55.853 --> 00:06:58.525
from geometry class your
30, 60, 90 triangles

00:06:58.525 --> 00:07:00.128
you'll recognize that this is one of them

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:02.125
but instead of calling
it a 30, 60, 90 triangle

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:05.957
we could call it a pi
over six, pi over three,

00:07:05.957 --> 00:07:09.262
pi over two radian triangle

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.853
but it really is in degrees 30, 60, 90

00:07:11.853 --> 00:07:14.775
and we see it has a properties
of the 30, 60, 90 triangle

00:07:14.775 --> 00:07:16.664
where the shorter side

00:07:16.664 --> 00:07:20.659
or the side opposite the
pi over six radian angle

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:23.323
has half the length of the hypotenuse

00:07:23.323 --> 00:07:27.398
and then the longer non hypotenuse side

00:07:27.398 --> 00:07:30.163
is square root of three
times the shorter side,

00:07:30.163 --> 00:07:32.159
the side opposite the 60 degree angle

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:33.823
or the pi over three radian angle

00:07:33.823 --> 00:07:35.678
has the length of square root of three

00:07:35.678 --> 00:07:37.737
times the shortest side.

00:07:37.737 --> 00:07:40.159
Just like that we were able to figure out

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:42.174
all of the missing information in this.

00:07:42.174 --> 00:07:44.657
Now given that, what I want to do

00:07:44.657 --> 00:07:48.167
is figure out what the
sine, cosine, and tangent

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:50.056
of alpha actually are

00:07:50.056 --> 00:07:51.919
and I could have done it for alpha

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:54.089
or I could have done it for beta

00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:55.419
but I'll just do it for alpha

00:07:55.419 --> 00:07:57.229
and actually I'll leave
it as an exercise to you

00:07:57.229 --> 00:07:58.373
to do it for beta.

00:07:58.373 --> 00:07:59.776
Let's figure out

00:07:59.776 --> 00:08:01.278
so the sine of alpha

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.937
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:08:03.937 --> 00:08:05.431
and try to think of what this is.

00:08:05.431 --> 00:08:07.619
Well the sine of alpha is the same as

00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:09.254
sine of pi over six,

00:08:09.254 --> 00:08:12.027
and remember Sohcahtoa definition.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.763
Let me do Toa in a different color.

00:08:18.763 --> 00:08:21.408
Sohcahtoa.

00:08:21.408 --> 00:08:23.696
Sine is opposite over hypotenuse

00:08:23.696 --> 00:08:25.593
so for this angle right over here

00:08:25.593 --> 00:08:27.340
the opposite side is one,

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.548
so it's equal to one over the hypotenuse,

00:08:30.548 --> 00:08:32.339
one over two.

00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:35.479
Sine of pi over six is one half.

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:37.614
Now what is cosine of alpha

00:08:37.614 --> 00:08:41.979
or what is cosine of pi over six?

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:44.460
Well cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.531
so the adjacent side to this angle,

00:08:47.531 --> 00:08:49.761
that's not the hypotenuse,
it's square root of three

00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:52.347
and the hypotenuse once again is two.

00:08:52.347 --> 00:08:54.775
The cosine of pi over six

00:08:54.775 --> 00:08:57.349
is square root of three over two

00:08:57.349 --> 00:09:05.637
and then finally for the
tangent of pi over six,

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.856
we could just take it
to sine over the cosine

00:09:10.856 --> 00:09:13.187
or we could say it's the
opposite over the adjacent.

00:09:13.187 --> 00:09:16.479
The opposite is one,

00:09:16.479 --> 00:09:18.514
the opposite angle to alpha is one

00:09:18.514 --> 00:09:20.612
and the adjacent is square root of three

00:09:20.612 --> 00:09:22.580
so it's one over the square root of three

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.426
and if you don't like irrational
numbers in the denominator

00:09:25.426 --> 00:09:27.179
we can multiply it by
the square root of three

00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:28.411
over the square of three

00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:35.692
to get square root of three over three

00:09:35.692 --> 00:09:37.385
and we are done.

00:09:37.385 --> 00:09:39.925
We have figured out a
lot about this triangle.
