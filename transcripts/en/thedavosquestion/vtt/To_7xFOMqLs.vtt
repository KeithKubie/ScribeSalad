00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.590
ï»¿The most pressing issue to me is Social
Responsibility.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.000
So, we have 20 people here

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.670
that are social entrepreneurs

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.020
selected by the trust foundation that try
to combine

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.820
social responsibility and business.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.390
So, how can we move towards

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.590
a more responsible world?

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.891
Because it can be very romantic by saying
"we have to change this, we have to change

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:37.891
that"

00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:40.670
what about Climate Change? What about this?"

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.530
But at the end of the day

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.749
the person who is fighting or struggling for
a new system,

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:57.569
or for clean energy, or for women who are
mutilated since birth.

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:02.829
These are basically the real issues that nobody
discusses.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:14.690
So, let's take time, and do our mission in
life because our life is our mission.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:23.730
So the question is, are we doing enough, to
try transform our lives into our missions?
