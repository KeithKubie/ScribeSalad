00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.940
My very first job in the game
industry was porting a popular PC

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.380
flight simulator to the Amiga computer.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.980
This was ages ago.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.590
There was a steep learning curve.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.044
I'd been programming for
maybe ten years,

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:14.590
since junior high school by this time.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.270
But this was my first real
professional programming experience.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.640
I was learning about 93 new
things every single day.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.430
And there were new tools to understand
and libraries and systems to integrate.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.810
Hardware issues and near faces,
not to mention the game itself.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.920
It had been written for a completely
different computer architecture

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.520
by some super smart industry vets
including one of the company founders.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.810
Oh, and did I mention, I didn't know
anything about flight simulators?

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.010
Well, I remember one of
the first issues I ran into.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.970
There's a problem with the 3D renderer.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.520
On a PC, it worked great.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.120
It was pretty much bulletproof,
super fast.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.060
It had been used in several titles and

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.080
it just kept getting better
as it was refined over time.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.320
On the Amiga, though,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.930
the renderer was brand new,
never been used in production.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.270
And, there was a glitch.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.820
Sometimes, unpredictably, a polygon
would tear and it would just blow up and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.590
overwrite half a screen.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.910
Looked terrible.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.520
And since I hadn't written the code and
had no idea how our 3D engine worked,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.640
I wasn't sure how to debug it.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.510
I turned to one of those super smart
industry vets, one of the creators 3D

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.230
engine in fact, and asked him for
advice on tracking down this bug.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.259
And he said,
I would just step through all the code.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.030
Well, from my point of view,
this was insane.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.230
I just didn't see how I
could possibly learn and

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.620
understand how the system
worked from top to bottom,

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.520
which is essentially what he
was telling me I needed to do.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.310
To step through the system and
figure out which part wasn't working,

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.820
I had to know what each and
every part did when it was working.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.480
He was right though, and it was hard.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.340
But I learned more than just
how that 3D engine worked.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.230
I learned that I could tackle
a really hard problem and solve it.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.070
You can always look for the easy answer,

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.810
but it's important that you not
give up if there isn't one.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.780
You have what it takes to succeed, even
if it doesn't seem like it at first.
