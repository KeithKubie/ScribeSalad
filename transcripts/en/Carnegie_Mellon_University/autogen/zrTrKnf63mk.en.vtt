their work week is half of ours and
their retirement age is 20% less and so

their retirement age is 20% less and so

their retirement age is 20% less and so
on so it creates a lot of tensions

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890
on so it creates a lot of tensions
 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.990

they're not really that much better so

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.030
they're not really that much better so
 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.370
they're not really that much better so
in the short term I would say they're

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380
in the short term I would say they're
 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.520
in the short term I would say they're
better in the long term the problems

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.530
better in the long term the problems
 

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.070
better in the long term the problems
that Europe is having have become more

acute and when the problems are more

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120
acute and when the problems are more
 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.990
acute and when the problems are more
acute they let's say require more

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000
acute they let's say require more
 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.480
acute they let's say require more
attention and because of that there's

from governments and so on for science

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:05.170
from governments and so on for science
 

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:08.130
from governments and so on for science
and for innovation in science now it

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:08.140
and for innovation in science now it
 

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.599

component when it comes to some of these
 

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.500
component when it comes to some of these
scientific endeavors and it seems to be

yes maybe they're not interested in it

00:40:59.880 --> 00:40:59.890
yes maybe they're not interested in it
 

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.290
yes maybe they're not interested in it
or maybe they just don't have exposure

schools and in Carnegie Mellon and other
 

00:43:14.929 --> 00:43:16.599
schools and in Carnegie Mellon and other
leading schools have really integrated

00:43:16.599 --> 00:43:16.609
leading schools have really integrated
 

00:43:16.609 --> 00:43:17.859
leading schools have really integrated
entrepreneurship requests to the

00:43:17.859 --> 00:43:17.869
entrepreneurship requests to the
 

00:43:17.869 --> 00:43:19.179
entrepreneurship requests to the
curriculum which is great and really

00:43:19.179 --> 00:43:19.189
curriculum which is great and really
 

00:43:19.189 --> 00:43:21.489
curriculum which is great and really
important but in Europe there's still a

00:43:21.489 --> 00:43:21.499
important but in Europe there's still a
 

00:43:21.499 --> 00:43:24.640
important but in Europe there's still a
big segmentation between engineering

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:24.650
big segmentation between engineering
 

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:26.620
big segmentation between engineering
schools and the design schools in the

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:26.630
schools and the design schools in the
 

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.709
schools and the design schools in the
business schools it's starting to change

00:43:28.709 --> 00:43:28.719
business schools it's starting to change
 

00:43:28.719 --> 00:43:30.939
business schools it's starting to change
but it really does need to change

00:43:30.939 --> 00:43:30.949
but it really does need to change
 

00:43:30.949 --> 00:43:32.620
but it really does need to change
because many of these entrepreneurs

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:32.630
because many of these entrepreneurs
 

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:34.479
because many of these entrepreneurs
these high-growth entrepreneurs they

00:43:34.479 --> 00:43:34.489
these high-growth entrepreneurs they
 

00:43:34.489 --> 00:43:36.399
these high-growth entrepreneurs they
come from science engineering medicine

00:43:36.399 --> 00:43:36.409
come from science engineering medicine
 

00:43:36.409 --> 00:43:39.099
come from science engineering medicine
design they they don't often come from

00:43:39.099 --> 00:43:39.109
design they they don't often come from
 

00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:41.109
design they they don't often come from
the business schools and so there needs

00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119
the business schools and so there needs
 

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:43.870
the business schools and so there needs
to be this integration across where the

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:43.880
to be this integration across where the
 

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.399
to be this integration across where the
business school students are taking

00:43:45.399 --> 00:43:45.409
business school students are taking
 

00:43:45.409 --> 00:43:47.380
business school students are taking
classes with the others and it's

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:47.390
classes with the others and it's
 

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:48.190
classes with the others and it's
happening now

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200
happening now
 

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.539
happening now
at Carnegie Mellon I think there's a

00:43:49.539 --> 00:43:49.549
at Carnegie Mellon I think there's a
 

00:43:49.549 --> 00:43:51.579
at Carnegie Mellon I think there's a
culture there but in Europe there's not

00:43:51.579 --> 00:43:51.589
culture there but in Europe there's not
 

00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:53.380
culture there but in Europe there's not
that culture and so it's really

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:53.390
that culture and so it's really
 

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:56.680
that culture and so it's really
important to change that there is some

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:56.690
important to change that there is some
 

00:43:56.690 --> 00:44:00.010
important to change that there is some
