00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.840
What Khan Academy
is today could best

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.140
be described as a
tool or a resource.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.120
It's right now if you go
to the site we have videos,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.360
we have interactive
exercises, we

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.380
have dashboards for teachers.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.460
And so depending it could
be used as a teacher

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.470
to help their students.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.240
It could be used by
a homeschooler who

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.920
wants to learn
something independently.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.390
It could be used
for an adult who

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.180
wants to review things that
might be relevant to whatever

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.884
their exploring at the moment.

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:29.300
But one thing I'd
like to be clear

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.700
is we don't view this as the
end all of what we think one,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.010
this could be, and
even how students

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.290
should experience learning.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.730
We think that this is
really just version one.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.450
And it's a very
primitive version right

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.010
now of a tool that
will eventually

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.635
empower a true interactive
vision of education.

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:52.510
And the other thing I
want to make very clear

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.290
is we don't see it is an
either or proposition.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.246
We don't see it as a virtual
versus physical a amazon.com

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:00.920
versus Barnes Noble.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.330
We see it as a
virtual and physical.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.740
Or even better, how do we
use the tools and resources

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.960
of the virtual?

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.760
How do we use those to
actually empower the physical,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.550
to make the physical the
best possible experience.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.720
And in this vision of what the
total education experience can

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.600
be we have a couple
of core philosophies.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.639
The first is the idea
of mastery learning.

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:30.430
And I'll write it in
quotes because mastery

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.450
can mean different things
to different people.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.830
To us this is the general
idea that students

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.820
should have deep conceptual
understanding of core ideas,

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.640
of more fundamental ideas,
before they are pushed ahead

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.130
to the more derivative ideas,
or the more advanced ideas.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.220
And so if you think of a
traditional progression

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.345
in mathematics, although
we think that this applies

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.640
beyond just mathematics,
traditional progression

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.450
in mathematics you start
off with arithmetic.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.100
And then you go to algebra.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.842
And then you go through
trigonometry, and geometry,

00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:04.550
and all the rest.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.000
But you eventually
end up in calculus.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.880
And what we believe is happening
for too many students--

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.210
and this is why so many
students end up having trouble

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.840
with algebra and
definitely calculus--

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.380
is they are not getting mastery
of the more fundamental ideas.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.320
We believe if
students have the time

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.380
to really build a strong
foundation in arithmetic,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.880
including exponents
and whatever else,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.072
then by the time algebra
comes around they

00:02:31.072 --> 00:02:32.530
will have a better
intuition there.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.720
They will have a better
chance of understanding it.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.010
And if students have a
conceptual deep understanding

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.724
of algebra, then calculus is
going to make a lot more sense.

00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:42.140
If you do it the
other way around,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.590
if you just push
students through

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.360
so that they get through
with 80% 90% understanding,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.074
then what they essentially
end up doing just to survive

00:02:50.074 --> 00:02:52.240
is start doing a superficial
level of understanding.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.690
They start kind of
pattern matching their way

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.230
through algebra or calculus.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.280
And not only does
that harm you later on

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.920
as you keep building
on it, it also

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.300
makes it almost impossible
to use these things

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.040
in your everyday life.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.820
In our minds.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.950
It's much more valuable to have
a deep understanding of algebra

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.720
and being able to see the
world in an algebraic way,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.750
than just getting
through algebra

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.590
and kind of
understanding calculus,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.910
but being able to apply or
really fundamentally understand

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.076
neither.

00:03:20.076 --> 00:03:21.450
The other idea--
and this kind of

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.930
gels with
mastery-based learning.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.430
You kind of can't
have mastery-based

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.040
learning, at least in our minds,
without a kind of self paced

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.855
reality.

00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:32.980
Because if we really want
students to master things

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.380
we really have to give
them the time and the space

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.100
to master those concepts.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.044
If everyone else has mastered
it and they're ready to move on.

00:03:40.044 --> 00:03:41.960
There's no reason why
we have to move them on.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.730
We should let them
work at their own pace.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.160
The other big thing
about self-paced learning

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.090
is that it creates
student ownership.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.160
And this is a huge,
huge, huge thing.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.750
Probably the most
important thing

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.770
that you can learn while
you were learning in school

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.050
isn't necessarily any one
of these subject areas,

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.450
figuring out how to solve
a system of equations

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.590
or take an integral.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.130
The most important thing
to learn is how to learn.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.270
How do you take
ownership of something?

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.780
How do you, to some degree, how
do you become your own guide?

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.450
How do you set your own goals?

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.310
And this can only happen
in a self-paced environment

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.150
where, with mentorship, with
people who can guide you,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
you can say, look, this
is what I want to learn.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.204
This is how I want to
go about learning it.

00:04:28.204 --> 00:04:30.120
And this is what I'm
going to do to get there.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.500
And my goal is mastery.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.504
My goal isn't just to get by.

00:04:34.504 --> 00:04:36.170
The other thing we
believe strongly in--

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.740
and we're been working
with many, many schools.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.240
We've been working
with many schools

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.050
across all of this,
including just how we

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.220
define our tools
and our resources.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.820
--is the idea of students
teaching students,

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.650
or we could call it
may be peer-to-peer

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.420
teaching and learning.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.570
And there's an
obvious benefit there

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.429
of if you have other
students around,

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:57.720
maybe some who've gotten a
little bit further ahead who

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.590
can tutor you.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.360
You have more access to people
who might be able to help you.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.250
But we think it's at least
as powerful for the student

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.780
getting tutored as it is for
the student doing the tutoring.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.820
Because it's one thing to
do a lot of problem sets

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.420
and to kind of go
through subjects

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.670
in the traditional way.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.650
But to truly get
mastery of something,

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.800
I think most teachers
would agree with this,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.200
you really have to teach it.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.980
You really have to be able
to distill it, and explain

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.330
it, and help mentor
other people to it.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.100
And on top of that you'll
build other soft skills, which

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.540
are at least as important like
ownership, as these other kind

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.240
of tangible skills,
the skills of empathy,

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.200
the skills of being able
to listen to someone,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.150
the skills of being
able to guide someone

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.470
without making them feel
intimidated or insecure.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.420
And then finally, the fourth
guiding principle for us

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.890
is the idea that
students-- and this

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.930
is very core to the
physical experience--

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.830
that when students are together
they should be interacting.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.334
So it should be interactive.

00:05:59.334 --> 00:06:00.750
And when we talk
about interactive

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.380
and we're not talking
about computer interactive.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.890
We're talking about
physical interactive.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.570
They should interact
with other human beings.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.611
They should talk to them.

00:06:06.611 --> 00:06:07.420
They should smile.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.730
They should see them.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.710
And it should be inquiry based,
or exploration based, inquiry,

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.530
exploration.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.930
And this is super key to
everything we believe.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.810
And this is why we are
actively experimenting

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.380
with summer camps
that are driven

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.260
all around this part
of the experience.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.200
It's because we
believe that in order

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.084
for a student to
truly internalize

00:06:29.084 --> 00:06:31.000
all of these things--
and it all goes together

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.230
with especially
the idea of mastery

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.210
--they need to struggle
with the ideas.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.740
They need to experience
them tangibly.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.452
And for example,
we have students

00:06:39.452 --> 00:06:41.410
they do things that are
implicitly probability.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.330
But they don't know.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.142
They think they're just
doing a simulation.

00:06:44.142 --> 00:06:46.600
They think that they're just
playing some type of the game.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.800
But by doing those simulations
and those games, later

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.570
on when they are exposed
to kind of the more

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:58.040
formal academic ideas around
probability or expected value,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.460
they now have a tangible
understanding for them.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.200
They now have an intuitive
understanding for them.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.190
And they also see the value in
the more formal representation

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.000
of it.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.030
So hopefully this gives a big
picture of what we are about.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.404
We are a tool and
a resource today.

00:07:13.404 --> 00:07:15.320
But the whole goal is
to keep [? iterating. ?]

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.960
And we want people to use it
in any way that they see fit.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.529
It could be part of
a formal program.

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:20.570
It could be a supplement.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.670
It could be used as
a review of somehow.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.330
But our real goal is how
can we optimize this tool.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.180
How can we improve this
tool so that we can really

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.710
drive these values to make
a truly holistic education

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.077
experience?
