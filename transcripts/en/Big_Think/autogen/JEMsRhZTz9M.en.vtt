00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.530
One question is how are happiness and habits
related?

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.280
And I’ve been researching and writing and
thinking and talking to people about happiness

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.280
for years.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.590
And what I started to notice was that habits
play a really important role in happiness.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.480
Because a lot of times when I would talk to
people there was some big happiness challenge

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.050
in their life that I realize was actually
related to some core habit.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.480
And it wasn’t that they didn’t think or
know that if they got more sleep they’d

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.079
feel better or that if they didn’t spend
so much time on the Internet during work they’d

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.000
be more productive, or whatever.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.150
They had identified the change that they wanted
to make but for some reason they weren’t

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.670
able to stick to that change.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.380
They weren’t able to make that change happen
no matter how much they wanted to.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.540
They could see that there was a happiness
gain out there but they weren’t able to

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.210
translate it into action.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.320
And that got me very focused on the issue
of habit change.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.290
So how is it that we specifically change a
habit so that we can make these desires, these

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.440
aims that are so pressing in our lives – how
can we translate it into real action, real

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.659
change in our everyday lives.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.600
Because the fact is, you know, for most of
us there’s a lot of low hanging fruit.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.490
There’s a lot of things – just part of
our ordinary day – things that don’t take

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.450
a lot of time, energy or money that if we
could do them they would make us happier.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.759
Well we really have to get ourselves to actually
follow through.

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.899
And so that’s where habits come into play
because habits are the thing that allow you

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.990
to make those changes and just put them on
automatic pilot.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.030
They’re just part of your everyday life
and they make you happier.
