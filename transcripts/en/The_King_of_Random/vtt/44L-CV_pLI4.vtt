Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.955
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop

00:00:01.955 --> 00:00:02.610
Not too long ago,

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.790
We showed you how to take a simple recipe and mix it with liquid nitrogen

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.440
To make your own ice cream

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.660
It got me thinking that maybe there are some other things

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.300
You could mix liquid nitrogen with for other kinds of desserts

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.800
So I want to see if we can take soda and mix it with liquid nitrogen

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.580
To make our own slushies

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.460
This process I think is going to be pretty straightforward

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.260
We're gonna pour some of our soda into our bowl

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.670
And then slowly add liquid nitrogen while stirring until we get the consistency we want

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.400
Unless it doesn't work in which case this is going to be a really dumb video

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.180
I bet it'll work

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.780
It's liquid nitrogen

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.280
Eventually something will freeze

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.860
That's the goal

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.780
All right

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.840
Here we go

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.640
I want to fill this cup with our slushie once it's all frozen

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.680
So I'm just gonna use this cup to measure how much soda to put in

00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:48.860
Should work about right

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.180
Let's just try splashing in a little bit of liquid nitrogen and stir it up

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.820
Spatula is a really good tool for keeping stuff off of the walls

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.399
But I think I want something that will do a little bit better of a job of mixing liquid nitrogen into the soda

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.160
Let's try the beater attachment to a hand mixer

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.379
I could use the hand mixer itself

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.720
But I think that might just be so vigorous that it splashes soda and liquid nitrogen everywhere

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.479
That's not my goal today, so I'll just use this by hand

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.840
And see it fills up with vapor very quickly unless I blow it all out

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.160
We're already starting to get some frozen slush along the sides of the bowl

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.540
Guess that's when I want my spatula

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.160
And you can see that. There is some slush already beginning to form down inside the soda

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.180
This is looking like it's gonna work really well

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.620
But you can see it's definitely gotten thicker it's to the point where I can sort of pile it on top of itself

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.140
Which I think is a very good sign

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.580
If you're getting pretty good results. Let's give this a taste and see how it's doing

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.540
That's really good, it tastes like a slushie... made from soda. It-

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.079
Almost all of the fizz is gone from this

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.060
Tastes really good though

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.760
Let's keep adding a little bit of liquid nitrogen and try and get it like a really stiff consistency

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.160
It's looking pretty good

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.340
There's nice and thick

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.760
Kind of like...

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.360
it's actually almost I think more of a snow cone consistency at this point

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.360
more snow cone less slushy

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.980
That's really good

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.969
It's nice and frozen easy to pick up with a spoon has the same taste in the soda like I said

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.220
I think it's lost all of the carbonation at this point

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.030
But it's quite good

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.720
Let's try and scoop it back out of the bowl into my cup and see if we can get a nice cup full slushy.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.600
UH! Had so much liquid nitrogen on the bottom of our Bowl that it started to freeze some parts of it completely solid

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.660
Less slushy and more ice cube

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.600
I think that works very well

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.420
We now have a cup of slushy

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.480
Tastes great

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.760
The consistency is really nice like it's super...super smooth

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.140
I don't think I've ever had slushie where the consistency was that smooth almost creamy if ice can be creamy

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.040
Yeah I really like that if you've ever just tried freezing soda

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.580
Other than just exploding out of the can or bottle that it's in it sort of seems to separate a lot of the time so

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.350
You have just a chunk of

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.139
Almost unflavored ice and then sort of just syrup on the sides that didn't really freeze as much

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.280
This is very evenly mixed up so it really has the same taste as in soda

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.520
Maybe I'll try it with some other flavors

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.980
There you have it using soda and liquid nitrogen to make yourself some delicious frozen slushies it works very well

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.789
It goes very quickly and overall I think it's a fantastic result

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:46.120
I was a little bit surprised that it completely seems to get rid of all of the carbonation in the slushy

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.340
It starts out very fizzy of course since it's soda

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.499
But by the end, it's just got a smooth texture with no fizz to it

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.140
I'm wondering if it would work to make this same idea

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.060
But using dry ice to cool down the soda instead of liquid nitrogen

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.720
Maybe the dry ice that has been cooled down in the liquid nitrogen, so it's very powdery and extra cold

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.080
I think the dry ice would then help recarbanating soda as it froze it

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.200
Or maybe it would still be so cold that the carbon dioxide can't dissolve into it

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.510
I'm not sure

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.320
