digitization is in my opinion one of the

digitization is in my opinion one of the
 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.220
digitization is in my opinion one of the
significant opportunities we have in our

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230
significant opportunities we have in our
 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.749
significant opportunities we have in our
in our times we saw how digitization

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759
in our times we saw how digitization
 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.340
in our times we saw how digitization
radically transformed the music industry

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350
radically transformed the music industry
 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.029
radically transformed the music industry
and the result is pretty significant

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
and the result is pretty significant

that you have more an easier consumption
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.439
that you have more an easier consumption
of music today and a fraction of the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449
of music today and a fraction of the
 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.170
of music today and a fraction of the

cost in terms of delivery this was just
 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.509

the first industry to go through a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519
the first industry to go through a

radical transformation due to
digitization we have for the first time

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
digitization we have for the first time
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.670
digitization we have for the first time
in history an opportunity to reach

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680
in history an opportunity to reach
 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.139
in history an opportunity to reach
billions of people directly on their

billions of people directly on their
 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.900
billions of people directly on their
mobile device we have an incredible

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910
mobile device we have an incredible
 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.229
mobile device we have an incredible
opportunity to share knowledge and

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239
opportunity to share knowledge and

analysis of individual patients can

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030
analysis of individual patients can
 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.680
analysis of individual patients can
allow for a very targeted individual

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690
allow for a very targeted individual
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.349
allow for a very targeted individual
therapy proposal and would that of

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
therapy proposal and would that of
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.709
therapy proposal and would that of
course increase party efficiency and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
course increase party efficiency and
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.130
course increase party efficiency and
improve people's lives dramatically this

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
improve people's lives dramatically this
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380
improve people's lives dramatically this
will happen in all industries in my

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390
will happen in all industries in my
 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.230
will happen in all industries in my
opinion and therefore this is now a

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
opinion and therefore this is now a
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.830
opinion and therefore this is now a
moment when leaders need to embrace the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
moment when leaders need to embrace the
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.960
moment when leaders need to embrace the
opportunity need to rethink their

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970
opportunity need to rethink their
 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.719
opportunity need to rethink their
business models and basically need to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
business models and basically need to
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:29.420
business models and basically need to
become IT companies in every industry

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430
 
 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.700
 
in my opinion the digitisation is the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710
in my opinion the digitisation is the
 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.190
in my opinion the digitisation is the
biggest opportunity we have to make sure

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200
biggest opportunity we have to make sure
 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.399
biggest opportunity we have to make sure
that every person on this planet gets a

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409
that every person on this planet gets a
 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.459
that every person on this planet gets a
relevant education first and foremost we

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469
relevant education first and foremost we
 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.179
relevant education first and foremost we
have an incredible knowledge that has

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189
have an incredible knowledge that has
 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.340
have an incredible knowledge that has
been collected through billions of

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350
been collected through billions of
 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.679
been collected through billions of
people adding their knowledge to the

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689
people adding their knowledge to the
 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.230
people adding their knowledge to the
Internet and secondly for the first time

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240
Internet and secondly for the first time
 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.539
Internet and secondly for the first time
in history we can reach people

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
in history we can reach people
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.050
in history we can reach people
everywhere at basically zero costs we

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060
everywhere at basically zero costs we
 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.020
everywhere at basically zero costs we
made some experiments at sa P where we

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030
made some experiments at sa P where we
 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.080
made some experiments at sa P where we
have taken our learning platform and

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090
have taken our learning platform and
 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.249
have taken our learning platform and
offered open classes not just in a

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259
offered open classes not just in a
 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.949
offered open classes not just in a
physical classroom but actually in a

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959
physical classroom but actually in a
 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.280
physical classroom but actually in a
virtual classroom would the engagement

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290
virtual classroom would the engagement
 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.660
virtual classroom would the engagement
that you will see in a physical

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670
that you will see in a physical
 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.850
that you will see in a physical
classroom and the results are just

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860
classroom and the results are just
 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.059
classroom and the results are just
amazing we are reaching more than 10,000

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069
amazing we are reaching more than 10,000
 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.360
amazing we are reaching more than 10,000
students in one training class more than

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370
students in one training class more than
 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.309
students in one training class more than
two and a half thousand students are

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319
two and a half thousand students are
 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.910
two and a half thousand students are
graduating from the class and that based

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920
graduating from the class and that based
 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.720
graduating from the class and that based
on one effort so in that sense you could

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730
on one effort so in that sense you could
 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.580
on one effort so in that sense you could
argue that the digitisation is the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590
argue that the digitisation is the
 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.979
argue that the digitisation is the
biggest opportunity we have to make sure

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989
biggest opportunity we have to make sure
 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.539
biggest opportunity we have to make sure
that everyone everywhere in the world

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549
that everyone everywhere in the world
 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:46.610
that everyone everywhere in the world
get the relevant education

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620
 
 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.240
 
I strongly believe that it is our duty

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250
I strongly believe that it is our duty
 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.530
I strongly believe that it is our duty
as leaders to transform and inspire not

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
as leaders to transform and inspire not
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.320
as leaders to transform and inspire not
based on a threat but an opportunity and

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330
based on a threat but an opportunity and
 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.720
based on a threat but an opportunity and
we have enormous opportunity right now I

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
we have enormous opportunity right now I
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.030
we have enormous opportunity right now I
believe the most difficult question is

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040
believe the most difficult question is
 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.119
believe the most difficult question is
how can we initiate transformation a

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129
how can we initiate transformation a
 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.039
how can we initiate transformation a
radical transformation of companies that

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049
radical transformation of companies that
 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.670
radical transformation of companies that
are successful at changing a company

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680
are successful at changing a company
 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.460
are successful at changing a company
that's in trouble is always easy because

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470
that's in trouble is always easy because
 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.819
that's in trouble is always easy because
there is no other choice so I think that

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829
there is no other choice so I think that
 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.470
there is no other choice so I think that
is the key question that we need to ask

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480
is the key question that we need to ask
 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.360
is the key question that we need to ask
ourselves and the difficult question is

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370
ourselves and the difficult question is
 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.300
ourselves and the difficult question is
how can I change it's kind of if it

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310
how can I change it's kind of if it
 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.460
how can I change it's kind of if it
isn't broken consider fixing it and

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470
isn't broken consider fixing it and
 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.649
isn't broken consider fixing it and
that's I think is very relevant in the

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659
that's I think is very relevant in the
 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.440
that's I think is very relevant in the
moment way now where the digitization

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450
moment way now where the digitization
 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.839
moment way now where the digitization
offers so many new opportunities but we

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849
offers so many new opportunities but we
 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.960
offers so many new opportunities but we
also lack the skills to get it done we

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970
also lack the skills to get it done we
 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.780
also lack the skills to get it done we
need to take the lead I believe we are

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790
need to take the lead I believe we are
 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.210
need to take the lead I believe we are
lucky to be leaders in a world or

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220
lucky to be leaders in a world or
 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.670
lucky to be leaders in a world or
radical change but we also have an

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680
radical change but we also have an
 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.150
radical change but we also have an
obligation to be proactive in leading

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160
obligation to be proactive in leading
 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.290
obligation to be proactive in leading
that change and creating
