NASIR KHAN: Hello everyone, and
welcome to another episode

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.090
of Google Wallet Developers
Live.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.740
My name is Nasir Khan.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.280
I'm a developer advocate
with Google Wallet.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.540
Today's topic, we have a
very exciting lineup.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.240
We're going to talk about
recently announced Google

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.220
Wallet InstantBuy
API for Android.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.240
And we have one of our
partners, Expedia.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.710
Dan Lew is here from Expedia.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.420
Welcome, Dan.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.620
DAN LEW: Hello.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.200
NASIR KHAN: And we also have
Nagesh, who is a developer

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.940
programs engineer
here at Google.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.170
NAGESH SUSARLA: Hey.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.820
NASIR KHAN: So one of the main
issues with Google Commerce

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.420
really is the form factor.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.350
So wherever you're trying to
book anything or trying to buy

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.580
anything on a mobile device,
you run into an issue where

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.890
you have a small device, you
have to enter your name and

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.330
address, your credit card
details, your billing address

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.920
and so forth.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.710
And no matter what you're
buying, physical supplies,

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.460
office supplies, t-shirts, even
booking at Expedia, you

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.550
have to go through
that process.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.970
So the recently announced
Android API, InstantBuy API,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.150
is trying to solve that problem
in a very elegant way,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.000
reducing the friction the user
has and just gets them to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.900
really what they want--
to purchase something.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.520
So first of all, Dan, welcome
come to Google again.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.820
And can you tell us a little
bit about Expedia, what is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.670
happening there, what's new,
what's latest, and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.270
what you guys do?

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.810
DAN LEW: Oh yeah.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.620
I mean, Expedia is a well-known
international

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.400
travel company.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.830
And we help anyone book hotels
and flights and car rentals

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.480
and activities and
even cruises.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.800
NAGESH SUSARLA: So
Dan, you have a

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.790
fantastic app here on Android.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.990
And what can you accomplish
with it?

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.020
DAN LEW: So what our application
handles at the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.150
moment are hotel and flight
searches as well as bookings.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.510
So you can go through the entire
process from start to

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.310
finish in terms of getting a
hotel stay for the night or a

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.960
flight if you need
to get away.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.650
And we also just recently
released a new version of the

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.910
application that includes
itineraries.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.930
So anything that you book
through Expedia, either

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.470
through the app or on the
website, you can look up on

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.150
your device afterwards.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.030
NAGESH SUSARLA: Nice.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.910
So the launch screen of the app
looks pretty fascinating.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.310
It has the hotels and the
flights scrolling

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.150
at different speeds.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.900
How do go about implementing
it?

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.845
I mean, I'm very curious.

00:02:28.845 --> 00:02:30.820
DAN LEW: Oh yeah, this was
super fun to work on.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.830
And it's essentially two list
views side by side.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.170
And there's a handler that
automatically scrolls them up.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.200
But what's really unique is that
they're linked to each

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.580
other, at a different rate of
scrolling on each of them.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.230
And whenever you click and start
scrolling one, it will

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.895
take over touch events for both
of them and pass touch

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:52.390
events from one to the next, so
that they're both linked in

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.140
their scrolling.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.415
NAGESH SUSARLA: Nice.

00:02:53.415 --> 00:02:55.250
NASIR KHAN: Very nice.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.540
NAGESH SUSARLA: Very nice.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.890
NASIR KHAN: So Dan, you've also
integrated Google Wallet

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.470
with this app.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.570
DAN LEW: Mm-hmm.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.160
NASIR KHAN: So what was
the motivation?

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.690
Why did you guys decide to do
that in the first place, and

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.890
how did you go about it?

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.410
DAN LEW: Well, it's very related
to what you were

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.500
talking about earlier,
which is that--

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.520
I mean, we allow you
to book hotels and

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.780
flights through the app.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.340
And these things require a lot
of information from users.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.120
And so it becomes a very painful
process right near the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.480
end, where you've decided on
the hotel that you want to

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.490
book for tonight, but now you
have to enter your name and

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.290
your billing address and your
credit card information.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.975
And we want to really reduce the
amount of friction that it

00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:32.150
has for users.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.820
And in addition, Google Wallet
comes with every

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.320
Android phone now.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.300
So whenever you--

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.200
any new users to the application
will already have

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.470
all this information
they can pre-fill.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.590
NASIR KHAN: And could you
show us that experience?

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.050
DAN LEW: Yeah.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.030
So let's just select a random
hotel on the left.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.530
And so I'm at this point where
I'm checking out the hotel and

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.100
seeing if it's where
I want to stay.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.220
And I've read through the
details, and I decide this is

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.940
the one for me.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.350
So I Select it.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.660
And at this point now is the
normal checkout screen, except

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.920
for now we have the Buy
with Google button.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.490
And so when I click on that,
it'll bring up a page with my

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.750
different credit card that I
have saved in Google Wallet.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.279
So I can either pick one that
exists now or add a new one.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.050
And I click Continue.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.320
And it will pre-fill all of that
data into the booking.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.080
And now all I need to do
is slide to purchase.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.140
And the hotel booking
will be complete.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.260
NAGESH SUSARLA: That's
very awesome.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.610
So when customers purchase for
the very first time, a chooser

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.450
is shown with the check box
where they can indicate if

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.390
they want to use Google
Wallet for future

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.985
purchases with Expedia.

00:04:42.985 --> 00:04:45.670
Now if that is selected, the
next time they go through the

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.170
purchase flow, the chooser
is not shown.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.050
Can you show us that flow?

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.820
DAN LEW: Sure.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.090
So we finished booking
our first hotel stay.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.540
And so now we can look at a new
search and see if there's

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.980
another hotel we want
to stay at.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.320
And by the way, this is our
little hanging tag animation

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.650
that we like to show.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.080
We like to show animations so
that people don't get too

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.360
bored while they're looking
while we're gathering data.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.766
So let's stay at the
Courtyard tonight.

00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:18.645
I guess we'll book a whole
bunch of hotels.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.710
The free cancellation's good,
because we're booking all

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.630
these things.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.830
So again, I've now
gotten through.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.180
I've selected the room.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.170
I'm checking out the details.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.450
I scroll to the page from
before, and all that data is

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.050
already entered.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.820
NASIR KHAN: And that's because
you'd selected a check box in

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.470
the first time around.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.810
DAN LEW: Mm-hmm.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.520
NASIR KHAN: Very nice.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.950
DAN LEW: And so all I have to
do this time is slide to

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.690
purchase, and we're booking
that hotel as well.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.995
NASIR KHAN: Fantastic.

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:51.080
That was really smooth.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.940
So just by a couple of clicks,
next time around, you're just

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.580
able to book a hotel without
any entry really.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.150
DAN LEW: Yup.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.900
Although if you wanted to, it's
a pretty open platform.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.810
And so if the user wanted to
book a hotel on behalf of

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.340
someone else, they could
change the name of the

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.830
traveler on it.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.380
So while it does pre-fill that
information, it also gives you

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.450
the ability to customize what
information's sent as well.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.350
NASIR KHAN: Great, great.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.230
Just to keep things in
perspective, so if I could

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.640
take you back in time to the
time when Google Wallet wasn't

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.270
there or maybe to a flow where
you don't use Google Wallet,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.105
how does that experience
look like?

00:06:24.105 --> 00:06:24.570
DAN LEW: Sure.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.820
So we can look at the flights
portion of the app right now,

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.090
which we do not have Google
Wallet enabled for.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.410
And so again, this
is kind of our

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.560
animation that we're showing.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.925
And so I'm going to pick
just any given flight.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.990
And with flights, it's a lot
worse than hotels, because the

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.930
amount of data you need to
book a flight is actually

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.630
greater than you need
for a hotel.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.840
And so I'm going to have to
enter in my name, I'm going to

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.640
have to enter in my phone
number, and I'm just going to

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.930
make all this data up and go
as quickly as possible.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.870
And even then, like if you're
actually having to fill this

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:09.890
out, it takes a while.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:10.980
I have to enter in--

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.420
I have to know the gender
for TSA purposes.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.540
And that's just the easy part.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.770
Now I've got to do the payment
information, and I have to

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.780
enter in my address and
where I live and a

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.660
state and a ZIP code.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.800
And now I have to enter a
credit card number and

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:36.420
expiration date and the name
that's on the credit card that

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.320
I'm booking with, in case it
happens to be different from

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.320
the person who's actually
travelling on this flight.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.960
And now, only at this point can
I then slide for booking.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.030
And so that's like 10, 15
different fields I had to

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:47.810
enter data for.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.570
So clicking a button
is way easier.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.210
NAGESH SUSARLA: Yeah, that looks
pretty painful to have

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.010
to type in your credit card,
your billing address, and all

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.330
the other details.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.900
And that's really what Google
Wallet is here to solve.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.240
And talking about integrations,
how easy or

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.450
difficult was the integration?

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.140
How has the experience been
so far, the Google Wallet

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.100
integration?

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.270
DAN LEW: I mean, payment
processing is an inherently

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.830
complicated issue.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.710
And so the initial happy path
from start to finish took just

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.100
about a day or two to finish.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.720
But then there's handling all
these situations where like

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.390
maybe their credit card's out of
date, or you need to handle

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:29.200
that daily transaction within
or something like that.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.470
And so overall, it's taken about
two or three weeks to

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.309
fully integrate the

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:34.980
application with Google Wallet.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.440
But it's completely worth it,
because it makes the checkout

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.470
flow so much easier.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.130
NASIR KHAN: Yeah, two to three
weeks is pretty awesome given

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.030
that you're doing
all that stuff.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.059
If you were to do it--

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:45.070
I mean, you've pretty much
done the app yourself--

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.430
been first on yourself--

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.850
so the payment processing part
must have taken quite longer

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.620
than two, three weeks at the
integration [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.120
DAN LEW: Oh yes, certainly.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.530
I mean every time we have to
deal with payment, it becomes

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:54.780
a complex issue.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.920
NASIR KHAN: So in terms of the
benefits, of course, you

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.090
already talked about it.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.890
Is there anything else that
you want to share with our

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.820
developers in terms of
any tips and tricks

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.540
that you came across?

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.215
Anything that you think made it
easy for you to integrate

00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:15.610
with Google Wallet?

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.730
Or in Android apps in
general, anything

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:18.300
that you want to share?

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:18.830
DAN LEW: Oh, sure.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.380
I can talk about some Google
Wallet tricks that we used.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.300
One is that there's a lot of
life cycle events that you

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.320
need to handle on a regular
basis throughout your

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.000
application for Google Wallet.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.740
And so I found it very handy
to create a Wallet fragment

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.480
that kind of handled many
of the common cases.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.770
For example, like initializing
the connection and

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.100
disconnection from Google
Wallet itself.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.580
And so even though we had six
or seven different places in

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.510
the app using Google Wallet,
I could keep

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.330
reusing this common logic.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.570
And the other thing is that
it's kind of a two-step

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.770
process, where the first step
you make an estimate of how

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.100
much you think it's going
to cost for the user.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.440
And that's when you get a lot
of the initial data back.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.580
You can't actually
book anything

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.680
with it at that point.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.270
But you can actually check all
that information as soon as

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.070
you have a pretty
good estimate.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.530
And so if you send all that
data earlier, rather than

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.150
later, when the user clicks the
Buy with Google button, we

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.410
can instantly fill out
all that information.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.890
If you wait until you get to
that point, then you might

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.400
have to be waiting spinning
a little bit while you

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.640
give that data back.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.440
NASIR KHAN: And then have a
magical user experience.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:26.870
DAN LEW: Yeah.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.140
NASIR KHAN: Get instant
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.720
DAN LEW: So if you set it up--
so if the users add all the

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.840
stuff to their cart and they
click Check Out, maybe you

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.060
don't know the taxes
and shipping

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.270
information at that point.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.690
But if you start doing that
processing right then, you can

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.960
already have the result back
once they're ready to book.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.570
NASIR KHAN: Great.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:44.990
NAGESH SUSARLA: Awesome,
that sounds awesome.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.660
Well, thank you so much, Dan,
for taking the time to share

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.550
your thoughts on Google
Wallet integration.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.310
And it looks fantastic.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.180
And folks, if you're booking
your next travel, be sure to

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.930
check out the Expedia app and
Buy with Google Wallet.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:01.910
Thank you.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:02.100
NASIR KHAN: Thank you.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:02.450
Bye.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.700
DAN LEW: Thanks.
