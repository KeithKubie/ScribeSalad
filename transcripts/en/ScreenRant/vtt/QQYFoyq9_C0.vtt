00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.780
Acting seems like a fun job.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.110
Movie stars lead a glamorous life that potentially
can lead to millions of dollars or awards

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.110
recognition.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.070
Starring in a massive motion picture is a
great way to raise your profile and earn the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.359
adoration of millions of fans across the globe.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.660
Yet, there’s a dark side to acting.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.400
Making a film is not an easy task, and can
sometimes be extremely dangerous.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.249
Here are 10 movie sets that almost killed
their actors.

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.320
The Hunger Games : Mockingjay – Part 1

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.940
Panem’s Hunger Games are a dangerous event
for its participants, and that includes the

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.420
actors playing the tributes.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.609
When running through a tunnel, star Jennifer
Lawrence encountered a malfunctioning smoke

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:44.140
machine, which filled the whole area up with
smoke.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.059
Lawrence couldn’t breathe and reportedly
narrowly escaped suffocating to death.

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.429
Fortunately, the crew was able to rescue her
and Lawrence only suffered from nausea and

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:52.429
vertigo afterwards.

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.820
It could have been much worse, and a horrible
crisis was averted.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.530
Turns out even when you rehearse sequences
and plan them out, things can still go wrong.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.649
Maze Runner: The Death Cure

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.320
The star of this young adult franchise, Dylan
O’Brien, suffered some injuries while filming

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.060
The Death Cure, falling off a set piece.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.360
He reportedly broke a cheekbone or an orbital
socket, but in actuality it was far worse

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.360
than that.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.890
O’Brien’s condition is so bad that principal
photography had to be put on hold until he

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.140
makes a full recovery.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.800
The rest of the cast and crew have been released
from the film until an unspecified time, meaning

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.970
the Death Cure’s release date will most
likely be postponed as schedules are reworked.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.510
Hopefully O’Brien recuperates soon and the
film gets back on track.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.820
Thor: The Dark World

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.380
Lady Sif is a powerful Asgardian warrior,
but Jamie Alexander is a mortal human.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.270
The actress learned this the hard way while
filming Thor: The Dark World.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.090
Alexander took a nasty fall after slipping
on a metal staircase and wasn’t able to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.460
work for about a month.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.340
She displaced a disc in her spine, chipped
11 vertebrae, and dislocated her shoulder

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.870
among other injuries.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.840
Thankfully Alexander made a full recovery
and was able to complete the movie without

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.840
any further issues.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.340
With Alexander returning for Thor: Ragnarok,
hopefully she can get through production cleanly.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.650
Back to the Future Part III

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.740
Michael J. Fox is so believable as Marty McFly,
it’s hard for people to separate the two

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.450
– including his own director!

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.930
In Back to the Future 3, there’s a scene
where Marty is being hung by the neck in the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.930
Old West.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.920
During filming, Fox shot a take where he didn’t
use a box for safety and was actually hanging

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920
in the air.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.739
He was off a bit on his timing and ended up
passing out.

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.510
He was unconscious for 30 seconds before anyone
realized something was wrong and removed him

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.720
from the rope.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.940
Great Scott, indeed.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.050
Now You See Me

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.550
Sometimes movie magic can go wrong.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.230
During a scene in which Isla Fisher’s character
has to escape from a water tank before piranhas

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.780
are dumped on her head, the actress could
not escape from her chain.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.700
The chain got stuck and Fisher had to really
swim down to the bottom for the sequence.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.290
Everyone was so enamored with her performance,
nobody noticed that the actress was actually

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.290
drowning.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.600
Luckily, the tank came equipped with a safety
switch, which Fisher used and received help

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.670
from a stuntman.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.410
Fisher isn’t back for the sequel, and we
have to wonder if this experience is a reason

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.410
why.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.410
Inglorious Basterds

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.180
For the sequence in which Hans Landa chokes
Bridget von Hammersmark to death, Quentin

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.420
Tarantino did not want Diane Kruger to be
in any unnecessary danger and decided to “strangle”

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.860
his actress for real.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.710
Ironically, Kruger went unconscious as a result
of Tarantino’s actions.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.730
The director was so into the scene, he nearly
asphyxiated Kruger during shooting.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.030
This is the take that made the final film,
and you can clearly tell Kruger is not acting

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.030
in the moment.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.630
This is a woman literally struggling for her
life, and thankfully it was only her fictional

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.880
character who lost that struggle.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.430
The Expendables 3

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.209
Action star Jason Statham is well known for
doing his own stunts, and he certainly wasn’t

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.490
going to back down in the presence of legends
like Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.821
During filming for The Expendables 3, the
brakes on Statham’s truck failed and it

00:03:31.821 --> 00:03:33.130
went falling into the sea.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.630
Luckily, the doors had been removed before
Statham started driving, and he dove out of

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.590
the vehicle into the water to safety.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.870
The actor could have died, as the truck sunk
60 feet into the Black Sea and became impaled

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.870
under water.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.020
We love Statham’s commitment to his roles,
but never want to say anything bad happen

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.380
to him.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.380
Die Another Day

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.310
Working on a James Bond film involves hours
of filming physical action sequences, but

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.950
it was one of the quieter moments that threatened
Halle Berry.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.680
While shooting a romantic scene with Pierce
Brosnan, Berry cut a piece of fig and placed

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.680
it in her mouth.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.840
She shared the fruit with Brosnan while they
were kissing before she started choking on

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.840
it.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.190
The lighting was so dark that nobody could
tell what was going on.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.980
Fortunately, Brosnan realized something was
wrong and performed the Heimlich on his co-star,

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.870
possibly saving her life.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.650
The actor is a hero on the big screen, and
off it.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.650
Gangs of New York

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.989
There are method actors, and then there’s
Daniel Day-Lewis.

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.860
The Oscar winner is famous for completely
transforming himself for each film role, taking

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.729
the concept of disappearing into a character
to lengths few have ever seen.

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.240
While filming Gangs of New York, the actor
would only dress in clothes from the 1863

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.879
time period, even when he wasn’t shooting
scenes.

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.580
This caused Day-Lewis to catch pneumonia.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.270
He attempted to fight through it since no
cure for the illness existed in the mid-19th

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.789
century, but was told he could die if he didn’t
seek treatment.

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.530
Fortunately for movie fans everywhere, he
agreed to take medicine.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.370
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.340
Stunt doubles are aware of the risks their
profession presents, and sometimes they suffer

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.509
truly heartbreaking consequences.

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.610
While filming an action sequence in which
Harry would appear on a broomstick, Daniel

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.419
Radcliffe’s double David Holmes was hanging
from wires in front of a green screen.

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.210
One of the wires snapped and Holmes crashed
face first into a wall and fell down on the

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.210
crash mat.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.600
He was conscious immediately following the
incident, but lost feeling in his legs, which

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.330
turned out to be a permanent condition.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.020
Radcliffe took the injury hard and offered
Holmes plenty of emotional and financial support.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.259
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.370
Are there any death-defying accidents we missed?

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.440
Which ones are your favorites?
