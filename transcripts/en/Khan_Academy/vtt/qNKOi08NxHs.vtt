00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.758
- [Narrator] So we have
nine students who recently

00:00:02.758 --> 00:00:07.757
graduated from a small school
that has a class size of nine,

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:10.843
and they wanna figure out
what is the central tendency

00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:14.297
for salaries one year after graduation?

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:16.847
And they also wanna have a
sense of the spread around

00:00:16.847 --> 00:00:20.246
that central tendency one
year after graduation.

00:00:20.246 --> 00:00:23.885
So they all agree to put in
their salaries into a computer,

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:25.912
and so these are their salaries.

00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:27.342
They're measured in thousands.

00:00:27.342 --> 00:00:30.787
So one makes 35,000, 50,000,
50,000, 50,000, 56,000,

00:00:30.787 --> 00:00:34.598
two make 60,000, one makes
75,000, and one makes 250,000.

00:00:34.598 --> 00:00:37.048
So she's doing very well for herself,

00:00:37.048 --> 00:00:40.583
and the computer it spits
out a bunch of parameters

00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:42.583
based on this data here.

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:47.230
So it spits out two typical
measures of central tendency.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.144
The mean is roughly 76.2.

00:00:50.144 --> 00:00:53.012
The computer would calculate
it by adding up all of these

00:00:53.012 --> 00:00:55.849
numbers, these nine numbers,
and then dividing by nine,

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:59.646
and the median is 56, and median
is quite easy to calculate.

00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:01.990
You just order the numbers and you take

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.623
the middle number here which is 56.

00:01:04.623 --> 00:01:07.631
Now what I want you to
do is pause this video

00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:10.085
and think about for this data set,

00:01:10.085 --> 00:01:14.276
for this population of
salaries, which measure,

00:01:14.276 --> 00:01:19.242
which measure of central
tendency is a better measure?

00:01:19.242 --> 00:01:21.172
All right, so let's think
about this a little bit.

00:01:21.172 --> 00:01:23.837
I'm gonna plot it on a line here.

00:01:23.837 --> 00:01:26.054
I'm gonna plot my data
so we get a better sense

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:28.407
and we just don't see them,
so we just don't see things

00:01:28.407 --> 00:01:31.136
as numbers, but we see
where those numbers sit

00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:32.633
relative to each other.

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:34.818
So let's say this is zero.

00:01:34.818 --> 00:01:38.985
Let's say this is, let's see,
one, two, three, four, five.

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.846
So this would be 250, this
is 50, 100, 150, 200, 200,

00:01:51.564 --> 00:01:52.530
and let's see.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.370
Let's say if this is 50
than this would be roughly

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.804
40 right here, and I just wanna get rough.

00:01:58.804 --> 00:02:03.664
So this would be about 60,
70, 80, 90, close enough.

00:02:03.664 --> 00:02:05.591
I'm, I could draw this
a little bit neater,

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:07.258
but, 60, 70, 80, 90.

00:02:08.953 --> 00:02:12.437
Actually, let me just clean
this up a little bit more too.

00:02:12.437 --> 00:02:14.023
This one right over here would be

00:02:14.023 --> 00:02:16.690
a little bit closer to this one.

00:02:18.416 --> 00:02:22.049
Let me just put it right around here.

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.049
So that's 40, and then
this would be 30, 20, 10.

00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:28.686
Okay, that's pretty good.

00:02:28.686 --> 00:02:30.098
So let's plot this data.

00:02:30.098 --> 00:02:34.265
So, one student makes 35,000,
so that is right over there.

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:38.411
Two make 50,000, or three make 50,000,

00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:40.328
so one, two, and three.

00:02:42.278 --> 00:02:43.860
I'll put it like that.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.027
One makes 56,000 which would
put them right over here.

00:02:49.897 --> 00:02:53.287
One makes 60,000, or
actually, two make 60,000,

00:02:53.287 --> 00:02:54.804
so it's like that.

00:02:54.804 --> 00:02:58.387
One makes 75,000, so
that's 60, 70, 75,000.

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:02.108
So it's gonna be right around there,

00:03:02.108 --> 00:03:04.173
and then one makes 250,000.

00:03:04.173 --> 00:03:07.669
So one's salary is all
the way around there,

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.262
and then when we
calculate the mean as 76.2

00:03:11.262 --> 00:03:13.328
as our measure of central tendency,

00:03:13.328 --> 00:03:15.411
76.2 is right over there.

00:03:16.646 --> 00:03:21.137
So is this a good measure
of central tendency?

00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:23.237
Well to me it doesn't feel that good,

00:03:23.237 --> 00:03:26.137
because our measure of central
tendency is higher than all

00:03:26.137 --> 00:03:29.862
of the data points except for
one, and the reason is is that

00:03:29.862 --> 00:03:33.560
you have this one that the,
that our, our data is skewed

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.310
significantly by this
data point at $250,000.

00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:41.288
It is so far from the
rest of the distribution

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:44.593
from the rest of the data
that it has skewed the mean,

00:03:44.593 --> 00:03:46.894
and this is something
that you see in general.

00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:49.866
If you have data that is skewed,
and especially things like

00:03:49.866 --> 00:03:52.740
salary data where someone might
make, most people are making

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.100
50, 60, $70,000, but someone
might make two million dollars,

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.659
and so that will skew the
average or skew the mean I should

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.979
say, when you add them all
up and divide by the number

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.251
of data points you have.

00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:06.401
In this case, especially when
you have data points that

00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:09.776
would skew the mean,
median is much more robust.

00:04:09.776 --> 00:04:14.162
The median at 56 sits right
over here, which seems to be

00:04:14.162 --> 00:04:17.461
much more indicative for central tendency.

00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:18.513
And think about it.

00:04:18.513 --> 00:04:21.579
Even if you made this instead of 250,000

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.805
if you made this 250,000
thousand, which would be 250

00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:29.137
million dollars, which is
a ginormous amount of money

00:04:29.137 --> 00:04:32.722
to make, it wouldn't, it would
skew the mean incredibly,

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:35.530
but it actually would not
even change the median,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.338
because the median, it doesn't matter

00:04:37.338 --> 00:04:38.546
how high this number gets.

00:04:38.546 --> 00:04:39.934
This could be a trillion dollars.

00:04:39.934 --> 00:04:41.689
This could be a quadrillion dollars.

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:43.943
The median is going to stay the same.

00:04:43.943 --> 00:04:45.828
So the median is much more robust

00:04:45.828 --> 00:04:48.148
if you have a skewed data set.

00:04:48.148 --> 00:04:51.518
Mean makes a little bit more
sense if you have a symmetric

00:04:51.518 --> 00:04:54.559
data set or if you have things
that are, you know, where,

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:56.556
where things are roughly
above and below the mean,

00:04:56.556 --> 00:04:59.614
or things aren't skewed
incredibly in one direction,

00:04:59.614 --> 00:05:01.244
especially by a handful of data

00:05:01.244 --> 00:05:03.559
points like we have right over here.

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:06.596
So in this example, the median is a much

00:05:06.596 --> 00:05:09.812
better measure of central tendency.

00:05:09.812 --> 00:05:11.400
And so what about spread?

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.848
Well you might say, well,
Sal you already told us

00:05:13.848 --> 00:05:15.685
that the mean is not so good

00:05:15.685 --> 00:05:18.496
and the standard deviation
is based on the mean.

00:05:18.496 --> 00:05:22.190
You take each of these data
points, find their distance

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.991
from the mean, square that
number, add up those squared

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.775
distances, divide by the
number of data points if we're

00:05:27.775 --> 00:05:31.127
taking the population standard
deviation, and then you,

00:05:31.127 --> 00:05:34.556
and then you, you take the
square root of the whole thing.

00:05:34.556 --> 00:05:37.829
And so since this is based on
the mean, which isn't a good

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:41.402
measure of central tendency
in this situation, and this,

00:05:41.402 --> 00:05:44.959
this is also going to skew
that standard deviation.

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:47.938
This is going to be, this is a lot larger

00:05:47.938 --> 00:05:50.472
than if you look at the, the actual,

00:05:50.472 --> 00:05:53.448
if you wanted an indication of the spread.

00:05:53.448 --> 00:05:56.648
Yes, you have this one data
point that's way far away

00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:59.617
from either the mean or
the median depending on how

00:05:59.617 --> 00:06:02.500
you wanna think about it, but
most of the data points seem

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.935
much closer, and so for that situation,

00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:07.113
not only are we using the median,

00:06:07.113 --> 00:06:10.778
but the interquartile range
is once again more robust.

00:06:10.778 --> 00:06:13.056
How do we calculate the
interquartile range?

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:15.325
Well, you take the median
and then you take the bottom

00:06:15.325 --> 00:06:18.978
group of numbers and
calculate the median of those.

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:21.947
So that's 50 right over here
and then you take the top

00:06:21.947 --> 00:06:24.880
group of numbers, the
upper group of numbers,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.931
and the median there is
60 and 75, it's 67.5.

00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:30.914
If this looks unfamiliar
we have many videos

00:06:30.914 --> 00:06:32.828
on interquartile range and calculating

00:06:32.828 --> 00:06:34.512
standard deviation and median and mean.

00:06:34.512 --> 00:06:35.890
This is just a little bit of a review,

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.208
and then the difference
between these two is 17.5,

00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:43.185
and notice, this distance
between these two, this 17.5,

00:06:43.185 --> 00:06:44.908
this isn't going to change,

00:06:44.908 --> 00:06:48.203
even if this is 250 billion dollars.

00:06:48.203 --> 00:06:51.972
So once again, it is both of
these measures are more robust

00:06:51.972 --> 00:06:54.639
when you have a skewed data set.

00:06:56.064 --> 00:06:59.410
So the big take away here is
mean and standard deviation,

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.232
they're not bad if you have
a roughly symmetric data set,

00:07:02.232 --> 00:07:05.050
if you don't have any
significant outliers,

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.193
things that really skew the data set,

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:10.278
mean and standard deviation
can be quite solid.

00:07:10.278 --> 00:07:12.585
But if you're looking at
something that could get really

00:07:12.585 --> 00:07:15.828
skewed by a handful of data
points median might be,

00:07:15.828 --> 00:07:19.090
median and interquartile range,
median for central tendency,

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.489
interquartile range for spread
around that central tendency,

00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:26.313
and that's why you'll see when
people talk about salaries

00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:28.285
they'll often talk about
median, because you can have

00:07:28.285 --> 00:07:30.262
some skewed salaries,
especially on the up side.

00:07:30.262 --> 00:07:32.407
When we talk about things
like home prices you'll see

00:07:32.407 --> 00:07:35.474
median often measured
more typically than mean,

00:07:35.474 --> 00:07:38.998
because home prices in a
neighborhood, a lot of,

00:07:38.998 --> 00:07:42.256
or in a city, a lot of the
houses might be in the 200,000,

00:07:42.256 --> 00:07:45.629
$300,000 range, but maybe
there's one ginormous mansion

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:48.864
that is 100 million dollars,
and if you calculated mean

00:07:48.864 --> 00:07:51.850
that would skew and give a
false impression of the average

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.767
or the central tendency
of prices in that city.
