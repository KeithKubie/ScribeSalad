00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.510
Simplify 16x plus 14 minus
the entire expression 3x

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.340
squared plus x minus 9.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.510
So when you subtract
an entire expression,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.329
this is the exact same
thing as having 16x plus 14.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.280
And then you're adding the
opposite of this whole thing.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.680
Or you're adding
negative 1 times 3x

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.485
squared plus x minus 9.

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.110
Or another way to
think about it is you

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.450
can distribute this negative
sign along all of those terms.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.760
That's essentially what
we're about to do here.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.450
We're just adding the
negative of this entire thing.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.061
We're adding the opposite of it.

00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:41.060
So this first part-- I'm
not going to change it.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.710
That's still just 16x plus 14.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.310
But now I'm going to distribute
the negative sign here.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.780
So negative 1 times 3x squared
is negative 3x squared.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.690
Negative 1 times
positive x is negative

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.170
x because that's positive 1x.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.174
Negative 1 times
negative 9-- remember,

00:01:02.174 --> 00:01:04.340
you have to consider this
negative right over there.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.960
That is part of the term.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.470
Negative 1 times
negative 9 is positive 9.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.070
Negative times a
negative is a positive.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.240
So then we have positive 9.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.255
And now we just have
to combine like terms.

00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:17.880
So what's our highest
degree term here?

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.254
I like to write
it in that order.

00:01:19.254 --> 00:01:22.487
We have only one x squared
term, second-degree term.

00:01:22.487 --> 00:01:23.570
We only have one of those.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.610
So let me write it over
here-- negative 3x squared.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.050
And then what do we have in
terms of first-degree terms,

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.970
of just an x, x to
the first power?

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.070
Well, we have a 16x.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.710
And then from that, we're going
to subtract an x, subtract 1x.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.820
So 16x minus 1x is 15x.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.470
If you have 16 of something and
you subtract 1 of them away,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.460
you're going to have
15 of that something.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.370
And then finally, you have 14.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.866
You could view that as 14
times x to the 0 or just 14.

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:55.380
14 plus 9-- they're
both constant terms,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.530
or they're both being
multiplied by x to the 0.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.325
14 plus 9 is 23.

00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:01.950
And we're done.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.071
Negative 3x squared
plus 15x plus 23.
