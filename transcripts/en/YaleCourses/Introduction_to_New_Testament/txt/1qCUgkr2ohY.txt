Speaker 1:          00:02          Paul founded several, probably small house churches in the area of Galicia. Uh, there's some debate about exactly what part of Asia minor he's referring to because there are different parts. They were called Galicia. Uh, and of course the word Galicia you recognize probably just comes from the word for gall. That is the people who occupied France later. The Gauls, uh, were tribes that tended to be in different parts of Europe at different times. So there's part of Asia minor that is modern day Turkey, the central part of it that was called Galicia after the goals. So Paul was there at some point. We don't know exactly when he founded some churches there. These were all gentile churches. There's no record at all that he had any contact in the area with Jews themselves. And there's no record in the letter of glow to the Galatians that, uh, he's addressing Jews at all in the letter.

Speaker 1:          01:00          It's, if you notice from the letter also, it's not directed simply to, um, one house church are even one town. Galicia refers to an area that included different towns. And so it's, this is something like a circular letter that would have been gone around to different parts of that. Other traveling teachers obviously have come along and at some point and quite reasonable enough, they may be themselves be Jewish followers of Jesus or they may be gentiles themselves, but who became law observant when they started following Jesus. And this will be natural. I mean, if you come along and say, well, you're now worshiping the god of Israel, now you're sort of claiming to be followers of Abraham, your claim to be children of Abraham. You're claiming to be followers of a Jewish Messiah. Well, it's okay that your followers, and it's okay that you were baptized, but if you really want to be a full citizen in this group, you need to get circumcised like, uh, other Jews do.

Speaker 1:          01:56          You need to keep kosher. You need to follow the Jewish law, this, the Jewish ethnic laws or are written for Jews. They're still in force. And if you want to be a part of the people of Israel and, and follow the god of Israel, then keep the Jewish law a perfectly natural idea. But it sends Paul way over the edge. So he writes Galatians two, this group, trying to convince them not to accept this, what he calls a new teaching or a different gospel. And this is where Paul is in his most angry and most vituperative of just about all of his letters. And we're going to go through several parts of it because what I'm going to point out right now is how did Paul try to convince them? So look at Galatians with me. We're going to skip around in several parts at two.

Speaker 1:          02:43          Galatians two 15, the first part, first two chapters you've already read, because we read at the very beginning of the semester. This is when Paul tells the story of where he was in Jerusalem, where he was in Damascus. He how he got his own Gospel. He, his independence from the leadership of the Churches in Judea. Uh, Peter, James, John, precisely because it may well have been that the people who came to the relationship after he did, and we're teaching these people, otherwise they might have said, well, you know, Paul, sure he told you some of the Gospel. But Paul's not really one of the original apostles, the original apostles or Peter and James and John, and we represent their point of view. So Paul initially set separates himself from that, uh, at all and says, I didn't get my gospel from Peter, James and John.

Speaker 1:          03:29          They are not the core apostles. I'm just a much in a possible as they are. I've got my gospel straight from Jesus. But then he goes on to say, uh, to talk about the law to 15 we ourselves are Jews by birth and not gentile sinners. Gentile centers was just like a two words that almost automatically went together in some Jewish rhetoric and propaganda. This period that being outside of Israel, being outside the people of, of, of God was made you a center practically in itself, at least according to some points of view. And then g and Paul tends to share that point of view because he uses gentile sinners himself more than once. Yet we know that a person is justified not by works of law, but through faith in Jesus Christ. We have come to believe in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by doing the works of the law because no one will be justified by the works of the law.

Speaker 1:          04:19          But if in our effort to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have been found to be sinners. Is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not. But if I build up again the very things that I once tore down, then I demonstrate that I'm a transgressor for through the law. I died to the law so that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. The life I now live in the flesh. I live by faith in the son of God, for if justification comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing. It's a pretty big statement. If CR, if you're, if the law get you anywhere than Christ didn't need to die at all. Notice what he says in three 12, he gets even worse. Um, with what he says, three 12.

Speaker 1:          05:00          The law does not rest on faith. On the contrary, whoever does the works of the law will live by them. So notice he's separating out faith and, and law. That's not something that almost any Jew would do. The idea that somehow, uh, you don't have faith in God because you keep kosher is ridiculous too. A lot of Jews, right? In fact, you're keeping kosher. You're keeping the law is an expression of your faith in God. And so Paul is saying this is, it might sound almost commonsensical if you've been raised in a Christian Church, but if you put yourself in the mind of a, of a Jew in the first century, hearing this somehow that the law and faith are opposed to one another is just very shocking. Look at three 15 brothers. I give an example from daily life. Once a person's will has been ratified, no one adds to it or a nose.

Speaker 1:          05:52          It, the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say and to offsprings. And what he's doing, he's playing on the Greek word seed is what is translated here, his offspring. And he's saying this was given to Abraham seed. And the Greek word is singular seed. It doesn't say seeds. So that means that, uh, it has to refer to Christ. Christ is the seed of Abraham, not all the people of Israel. My point is this, the law which came 430 years later, does not, and all a covenant previously ratified by God. So as to nullify the promise for if the inheritance comes from the law, it no longer is from promise, but God granted to Abraham through promise. Notice what he's doing here. He differentiate, differentiate the law from promise, which would be very odd coming from a Jew at the time.

Speaker 1:          06:39          So separating off the law firm faith, separating off the law firm promise is counterintuitive in Jewish theology at the time. Uh, and then what he also says is the law came 350 years after God made his first covenant with Abraham. Abraham just, I mean, God justified Abraham by faith, although he was circumcised later with a circumcision, was not what justified him. Uh, it was his faith that justified them, even Abraham. So he takes all the way back to the father of the Jews and says, God made a covenant with Abraham. The law came 350 years later. So the law is a late comer in the whole s and the whole system of how God was dealing with people. Then look at what he says in three 19 right after that. Why then the law, in other words, if you had the covenant with Abraham, why did the law come about anyway?

Speaker 1:          07:25          You didn't need the law to have the covenant according to his theology. So he says, why then the law, it was added because of transgressions, until the offspring would come to whom the promise had been made and it was ordained through angels by a mediator. Now this is really weird. The law came about for transgressions. Now there's a way to, uh, to a couple of days you gotta understand this, did the, and the way most modern Christians read is the law came about to keep people from sinning. You know what you're not supposed to do by reading the Law? So they'll all comes back to keep you from transgressing. But I don't think that's what Paul's doing because price precisely in Romans five 20 when he makes a similar statement, it's very clear there that the law came in to increase transgressions. What he's saying here is somehow the law came in after the comment was already established and it was precisely brought in through a much later and it was added to increase sin in the world.

Speaker 1:          08:26          It's a very odd thing to say. Notice what he also says. It was ordained by angels. I've talked about this before when we talked about the speech of Steven. Paul is saying that God even wasn't the one who gave the law to Moses. It was given by angels. What he says, look guys, his, um, it was ordained through angels by a mediator will, who is the mediator? Moses. Right now a mediator involves more than one party, but God is one. That's odd, but it seems to express what would have been sort of a legal theory in the ancient world. For example, if you have, if I want to sign a contract with all of you, we don't have to have a mediator. You basically just choose one of you or a committee of you to represent you. And I represent myself. If I want to sign a contract just with Jude, then we don't need a mediator.

Speaker 1:          09:19          We just signed a contract together. But if you have two groups of people wanting to come to some kind of agreement to have a contract, a covenant, you need a mediator who can be in the middle and not represent either of their interests, but be neutral. So what he's saying is that there's a mediator here, eh. All the Jews know that, that Moses was the mediator. But if the contract was between God, if the law was between God and the Israelites, you didn't have to have a mediator. And he says, that's precisely why they had to have a mediary. It wasn't between God and Israel. That's it was between the angels and the Israelites. Notice how demoting this is of a certain piety of the law. You believe the law came 350 years after the covenant. It was given by angels to Moses, not even directly from God, and it was given in order to make sin worse, not to make, not to get rid of sin.

Speaker 1:          10:14          Look what he says in three 23 he's digging himself deeper though he's saying more and more negative things about the Jewish law. Three 23 before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. Now the law becomes a prison guard that keeps humanity and he sees me talking about all of humanity, not just Jews. Somehow the law, the Jewish law in put all of humanity in prison and kept it there all those years. Look what he says in three 24 therefore, the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we meet about might be justified by faith. Well, the word disciplinary in there is that word, the Greek word pedagogue. Does anybody have pedagogue in your Greek translation there at three 24 does anybody have a different translation at three 24 then disciplinarian? Yes, sir. In the back, what does three 24 therefore the law was our,

Speaker 1:          11:17          okay. Was put in charge. So if someone in charge it were first to the slave, because these were almost always slaves who took care of young boys when they were going to school. That a child would, up to a certain age would be into the care. And obviously you were talking about upper class people who had slaves and could and would put their children in the care of nurses and slaves. The child had a very young age would be under the care of a nurse, but at a certain age, maybe five or six, the child, the boy especially, they would be put in charge of a slave who basically was assigned to watch over the kid. The pedagogue, contrary to the way this has come English as pedagogue, didn't refer primarily to the teacher of the child. That was a different term. The pedagogue was a slave who just basically took care of the boy, made sure the boy, uh, carried the kids, uh, uh, books to school, had the tablets, the wax tablets they wrote on and that the blocks they wrote on, uh, kept the kids stuff in a little Satchel.

Speaker 1:          12:14          And watch the kid took the kid to school to make sure the kid got there safely and make sure no older boys were bullies or make sure the kid didn't get any trouble and then stayed in school and sat, maybe sat in the classroom. I sat outside the classroom until school was over, then took the kid back home, make sure the kid did his homework. And according to a lot of Greek literature, pedagogues are not only are they slaves, they're ugly. We have lots and lots of artistic representations of pedagogues in ancient terracotta and that sort of thing. And they're usually depicted as ugly, stumped slaves and they're often depicted as mean and cruel and they beat the kids all the time. So by calling the law a pedagogue here, I don't think Paul is saying that the law was our teacher. I think what he's saying is the law is that slave, uh, surviving who kept us basically enslaved. Remember he just said we're prisoners. Look what he says in four three. So with us, when we were minors, we were enslaved to the elemental spirits of the cosmos of the world. This term, elemental spirits goes back to something I talked about previously. I think it was in my lecture when I talked about Steven's speech and x. This is that Greek word strike chaos.

Speaker 1:          13:35          Okay, is a very, very big major Greek word. It can use in all kinds of ways. For one thing, it just referred to ranks of soldiers. If soldiers were lined up in different ranks, those ranks were strike Kia rose. It could refer to all kinds of other rows. It could refer to letters of an alphabet that could be talked about is star k because what you do, you put them, you put all the letters of the alphabet in a row and you, and there are different elements. So Start Kia also can refer to what we would call a chemical elements. The element, the table of elements. Those will be called star, Kia, and Greek. So for example, they took wind, fire, water and air are sometimes there were other for earth. Sometimes you've heard this a theory, right, that the Greeks believed and ancient people believe there were four fundamental elements of all matter.

Speaker 1:          14:23          And those are sometimes they said six, sometimes eight, sometimes others, but quite often they'd, they'd settled on for classical elements and they believe that everything was made up of some combination of earth, fire, water, and air. And so everything's some matter. Those are the thicker stuff, has more earth in it and less air. The lighter stuff has more air in it and less earth, but all matter is made up of these four elements. So these elements constitute the whole cosmos. But what's really interesting is at least a lot of people in the ancient world believe that these also, this term also referred to this sort of angelic or demonic or godlike beings who constitute the universe also. And their words, they didn't believe necessarily that air was simply an ERT material. It also was a god or some kind of demonic being. So, or some people would say that each of these different layers of the universe say the layer that is earth or the layer that is water or the layer that is air or the top layer that is fire or ether, that those are all divine beings themselves.

Speaker 1:          15:25          Or they could talk about them as being not divine beings themselves, but being ruled by divine beings. So they, even Jews for example, would think that there were certain angels who were in charge of different rows of the universe. So for example, if you, and this is what we talked about, gnosticism, if you want it to go to God according to some, uh, uh, magical texts, for example, you had to figure out the tricks to go through the different ranks of demons or angels that lived in the sky between you and God. And one way to do that is to learn secret pass a passwords. So magical text I'll sign often will give you what it looked like, passwords, because we had this password. And when your soul is flying up to God, you can give the password to whatever demon or angel is guarding different gates between you and God.

Speaker 1:          16:09          So these steroid Kayah refers to elements of the universe in a physical sense, but it also refers to these spiritual beings that rule the cosmos or even make up the stuff of the cosmos and a lot of ancient thought, but now notice what Paul is saying here. When we were under the law, we were enslaved to the elemental spirits of the universe being under the laws being enslaved to these and he says, you want to go back to that slavery but wait a minute, what are the Galatians doing? They're not saying we want to go back and serve idols. What Paul is saying is when you serve idols, you are actually serving the strike chaos of the universe. They weren't real gods, they were fake gods. You just don't kind of, angelic beings are demonic beings. Paul, I think believed they were real beings behind idols, but they were demons or something like that and the store k out were those the Galatians are not wanting to go back to idol worship apparently.

Speaker 1:          17:00          What are they wanting to do? They're just thinking, well, we're going to keep the Jewish law, but Paul, not they equates keeping the Jewish law. If you're a gentile with going back to idolatry, that is radical for any Jew in the first century to equate law observance, keeping kosher, being circumcised with actually worshiping idols. That's radical. And yet that's what Paul is doing here in Galatians. Noticing what he does know. I'd say that because in four, eight he says, formerly when you did not know God, you were enslaved to beings that are by nature are not gods, that is your Insulite to demons or some kind of other like being like that. Now I have, or that you've come to know God or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly strike chaos.

Speaker 1:          17:56          So he's, he's equating their attempt to keep kosher or be circumcised with their returning to idolatry. And then look what he says in his little exit. Jesus in for 21 here he has a good 10 verses that are important. So I'm gonna read the whole 10 versus tell me this is Galatians four 21 you who desire to be subject to the law. We'll do not listen to the law. So he's going to give you a little exit. Jesus here for it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman. One the child of the slave was born according to the flesh. The other, the child of the free woman was born through the promise. Now this is an allegory. These women are two covenants. One woman in fact, his Hagar from Mount Sinai bearing children for slavery. Wait a minute, Mount Hagar and Hagar is the slave of Abraham, not his wife. Sarah is the wife of Abraham, not as slave Isaac, who then had Jacob, who had had Joseph and all the brothers from whom the people of Israel came came through Sarah, not Hagar. According to Jewish mythology, who are the descendants of Hagar and Ishmael?

Speaker 2:          19:12          Pardon?

Speaker 1:          19:13          Who? Who are the, uh, not Muslims but Arabs. Yes. Cause not all Muslims, but according to Jewish mythology, Arabs are the ones who descend from Hagar and Ishmael, not the Jews, but Paul Equates Hagar with Mount Sinai, which is the mountain from which God Moses got the law. Why does he see neck Hagar who represents the non Jews with Sinai, which represents the law. You would think it would represent Sarah with Sinai.

Speaker 2:          19:48          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:48          Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia.

Speaker 2:          19:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:52          And corresponds to the present Jerusalem. The Jerusalem. Sarah should correspond to Jerusalem.

Speaker 2:          20:01          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          20:02          for she is in slavery with her children, but the other woman corresponds to the Jerusalem above. Oh, and now he gets another Jerusalem. Now there's some kind of heavenly Jerusalem. That's what represented by Sarah. She is free and she is our mother for it is written. Rejoice you child is one who bear. No children burst into song and shout you who endure. No birth pangs for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than the children are the one who was married. Now you my friends are children of promise like Isaac. Now he's talking to gentiles here he's not talking to Jews. He's saying you gentiles are children of promise. You're connected to Isaac. But just as that time, the child who was born according to the flesh persecuted the child who was born to the spirit. So it is now also, wait a minute, it seems like he's accusing the Jews of persecuting non Jews.

Speaker 1:          20:57          Followers of Jesus. What does the scripture say? Drive out the slave and her child for the child of the slave will not share the inheritance with a child of the free woman. So friends, we are children not as a slave, but other free woman. Drive out the slave woman if he's equated the slave woman, Hagar with Mount Sinai, with Jerusalem in Judea, it seems like he's equating the Hagar with the Jews, at least the law observant Jews. And he says, drive them out. That is very radical now. And then finally he ends up later in chapter five, verse four. Then I'll move on.

Speaker 1:          21:44          You who want to be justified by the law have cut yourselves off from Christ. You have fallen away from grace. Notice he's not saying that you're going to fall away from grace if you sin. That doesn't seem to be the problem. He's saying, if you, even if you gentile followers of Jesus even attempt to keep the Jewish law, you'll be cut off from the grace of God. That's radical and it's no wonder that all this stuff got Paul into trouble. Now, we don't know what happened with Paul's letter to the Galatians. We don't know whether he convinced them that he was right and the other people who are coming, uh, telling them, teaching them to obey the law. We're wrong. We don't have second Galatians unfortunately, or any other letters. It has been pointed out by some scholars that Paul never talks about the collection that he later takes up, which among his different churches, which I'll talk about in a minute, he never talks about that in Galatians, nor does he ever mentioned the area of Galatians again to any of his other churches in other areas, and that's led some people to suggest, well, maybe Paul lost the battle in the churches of Galicia and therefore he just didn't deal with him anymore.

Speaker 1:          23:03          After that. We have references in his other leg, in his letters to churches in a Kia like current. We have referenced to his leg to his churches in Macedonia. We have referenced to churches in Ephesus. We have referenced at different churches that we know Paul founded churches, but we don't ever have any reference elsewhere to Galician so somebody would have said maybe he lost the battle. Maybe he lost the argument in. That's why we don't hear any more about it, but we don't know that for sure. The letter though, if he Paul winter on teaching this kind of stuff, it clearly though got him in trouble with other people who just thought not only was this wrong, but it sounded antinomian. It sounded anti law in general. And that leads us to Romans. So now turn over to Romans. Romans isn't written in a very different situation, but let's first just see what just Paul tell us what does Romans tells us about Paul's reputation with regard to the law. Look in Romans three eight

Speaker 2:          24:00          okay.

Speaker 1:          24:08          Now in chapter three he's talking about a lot of different things about justification by faith, apart from law, but just in verse eight, I'm just going to take a clue at her. But why not say as some people slander us by saying that we say, let us do evil. That good may come. Their condemnation is deserved. Ah, Paul denies the charge, but is it very hard to imagine why some people who may have heard about the kinds of stuff he says about the law, the law was brought into increased transgression and then transgression increased so that God could have more grace and mercy. Doesn't that sound like Paul is saying, let us do evil. So that good may come. Apparently some people thought it did. So Paul brings up the charge and denies it, but it shows that Paul had already developed by this time, some kind of Antinomian reputation.

Speaker 1:          24:56          Notice what he says in Romans six six chapter. What then are we to say, should we continue in sin in order that Grace May abound? It sounds like that would be the logical outcome. Paul, you've just said several times that as sin increased in the world, grace increases more. So let's send, we're not saved by doing good anyway. We're not saved by following the law, so let's just ignore the law and sin and grace will abound. Paul again seems to be echoing something that could have been very logical charge against him. How does he answer it? By no means, how can we, who have been heck, can we who died to sin, go on living in it. But here he goes on to answer the charge and the rest of chapter six by saying, by coming, by being bed peasant to Christ, you have so vacated the whole realm of sin, that it's inconceivable that you could go back to it as long as you're in Christ, you can have nothing to do with the whole world of sin. So he, he gets rid of that charge. But we can see that some people saw that there was a logical connection between some of the things did and said in places like Galicia. So he has to deny he does the same thing in six 15. What then should we sin? Because we are not under law, but under grace. He says, no, no, no, no, no, no by no means. That's not what I mean. But you can see how he got the accusation.

Speaker 1:          26:17          And then, uh, in three 20, some of the other places he talks about the law in Romans,

Speaker 1:          26:25          for no human being will be justified in his sight by deeds prescribed by the law for though the law for through the law comes knowledge of Sin. Ah, so you can hear Paul's gears working. He's trying to nuance some of the things he's saying about the law to too. So doesn't sound quite as radical as he had sounded in Galatians entity may likely have sounded elsewhere. So right here say he admits there for that. Well the law is good for some things through the law came knowledge of Sin. So that's, that's a good thing. Look what he says in three 21 right below that.

Speaker 1:          27:01          But now apart from law, the righteousness, righteousness of God has been disclosed and it is a tested by the law and the prophets. Ah, so both the Torah, the law and the prophets, at least bears witness to the righteousness of God. Because if you'll notice throughout both Galatians and Romans, Paul quotes Jewish scripture more than it is in any of his other letters is precisely when Paul's dealing with problem of what is the name, what is the relationship between non Jews to Jewish law that Paul actually quotes Jewish scripture the most? And that's in Galatians and Romans. So here he's saying, he's saying we can look at the law and the prophets to learn about this doctrine of righteousness that I'm now saying to you, because the law will attest to it. It's a much more positive view, the law. And he also says, we uphold the law, uh, by this, by doing this, uh, look at, um,

Speaker 1:          28:04          yes, it's three 28. Uh, look at three 27. Then what becomes a boasting? It is excluded by what law? By that of works. No, but by the law of faith, for we hold that a person is justified by faith, apart from works prescribed by law or as God that [inaudible] Thee is God the God of the Jews only is he not got her gentiles. Yes. Also gentiles, since God is one, but the last verse of that chapter, do we then overthrow the law by this faith? You would have thought from things that he said in Galatians that the answer to that would be yes. By no means. On the contrary, we uphold the law. And then look, one more place here. Seven, 12, Romans seven, 12.

Speaker 2:          28:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:46          Uh, he says backup one, verse two, verse 11, for sin, seizing an opportunity in the commandment deceived me and through it killed me. So notice what happens here. Sin Is talked about this as this agent of the cosmos. Sin is almost like one of these sort of strike kr, kind of like an intelligent being. This is actually a debate among scholars of Paul. Some people really believe that sin is a high pasta ticed intelligent being of some sort in the cosmos. Other people say, no, no. Paul's talking metaphorically when he talks about sin and these words, and we need to see sin, uh, not as this actual hypothesize being, but simply a metaphor. Metaphorized as of being. So scholars themselves debate about what Paul means when he talks about sin as this agent, but at least he talks about sin as the agent who uses the commandment uses the, um, where was I at? Seven. 2012. Yep. Okay. Where was I? We're just reading.

Speaker 2:          29:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:53          Seven 11. Yes. Sin. Seizing an opportunity. The commandment. So sin uses the commandment to, to see the human beings and kill them. Paul's not talking about himself personally. Here, he's talking about himself as representative. All human beings today says, so the law is holy and the commandment is holy, ingesting good. Doesn't it strike you that that is that little addition of verse 12 doesn't seem to follow so logically from verse 11 how can the lobby holy ingesting good if it's deceiving people?

Speaker 1:          30:30          That part clearly going on as Paul is backing off the more radical things he said about the law and trying to nuance this, and that's the question I'll ask. So let's read the rest of that for we know that the law is spiritual, but I'm of the flesh is verse 14 sold into slavery under sin. I didn't understand my own actions for I do not do what I want. I do the very thing I hate. Now, if I do what I do not want, I agree that the law is good, but in fact it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me for I know that nothing good dwells within me that is in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot do it for, I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do.

Speaker 1:          31:09          Now. If I do what I do not want, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that lives within me. So I find it to be a law that when I want to do what is good, evil lies close at hand for I delight in the law of God in my inmost self. But I see in my members another law at work with the law of my mind, making me captain for the law of sin that dwells in my members. Well, all of that is very confusing and if you want to get a phd, you can do the x Jesus off it for the rest of your life. But the main thing I'm pointing out here is that Paul is being very careful to nuance a straight forwardly negative depiction of Jewish law and say that, well, it's still good. In a sense it still is true.

Speaker 1:          31:50          It's still holy and he's doing this because I think he knows that he's got a reputation as being anti law and being antinomian. So why these differences between Romans and Galatians? Well, we need to understand a little more about the Roman situation first. Paul did not found the church in Rome. It grew up on it's own by other people. According to church tradition, Pete, according to Roman Catholic tradition, Peter the Apostle Peter founded the church in Rome. But that's tradition and we don't have any historical data to really prove it. But, and I personally believe that probably the church in Rome was started by anonymous Jews who happened to hear about Jesus and, and went to Rome and then started a little house groups of Jesus' followers on their own. And then apostles later, just like Paul seems to have gone there later. But the Roman church at the pint time, Paul is writing this letter is by this time no longer a purely Jewish group.

Speaker 1:          32:50          They now seem to be predominantly Jen pile with some Jews in the churches in Rome also. And remember, we're not talking about one church building or even one house church. We're talking about probably several different house churches that met in different people's houses or in their apartments and tenements and these sorts of things. So maybe some of them had more Jews in them than others. But the overall church in Rome is by now apparently gen pile. And when Paul writes Romans, he directs his rhetoric to gentiles. He does say hello to some Jews in the last chapter. He greets them, uh, Jews who are there that he knows. But if you look through the rhetoric of Romans, more and more of US scholars are convinced that the main recipients of Paul's rhetoric is supposed to be gentile believers in Jesus. So what, why does Paul write this letter?

Speaker 1:          33:36          Letter? Several different reasons. Not just one. For one thing, he can't write like he's written most of his other letters as talking to a group he founded. He can't talk about himself as their father in the faith in that way, he can't set his ups up as their apostle in a straightforward way because he's never been there at this point. He didn't found the churches there. So he's writing a letter. This one of the very, very few things we have of him. Uh, the only a letter perhaps where he writes to a church, a letter to a church that he himself didn't found. So that's important. So what do we find out? Why is he writing it? Look at 15, Romans 15, 22.

Speaker 1:          34:20          This is the reason I have so often been hindered from coming to you. So he's wanting to go to Rome, but now with no further place for me in these regions, I desire as I have for many years to come to you when I go to Spain for, I do hope to see you on my journey and to be sent on by you once I have enjoyed your company for a little while. Paul sees himself as the apostle to the gentiles, as Peter was the apostle to the Jews. So why not? I mean, he didn't found the church there, but if he, he believes that he's already done all this missionizing in Asia Minor. And Greece is kind of ironic for Paul to say this because what did he actually done? Christianity wasn't this big movement with thousands of people everywhere. It wasn't even like there was a Christian Church and each city or town, but Paul seems to act like these, he's done everything you can in the east.

Speaker 1:          35:07          Yep. Everything in Greece and you know, Asia Minor. My churches are all doing great. I gotta get Outta here. My work here is done. And so he's taken off to the west. It's kind of exaggerating, I think just exactly what he's, he's accomplished. But in his mind, by planting a few, you know, house churches in major cities, he's sort of done the first job of evangelization that he saw himself called by God and sent out to do. So. Now he's looking to the west and he wants to go to Spain. Uh, and so he's gonna stop in Rome. No sizes. I want you to send me on that. Greek actually means that he's asking them, he's going to ask them for financial contribution. Sending him along is not just, Hey Paul, don't let the door hit your butt on the way out. It's a, it's sitting him along with money.

Speaker 1:          35:53          So what he's doing is saying, I want a little contribution from you, so I want some support from you both symbolic support and financial support. So that's what he's writing to them to talk about is further mission to Spain. He's writing him also because Rome is the center of the Earth for uh, you know, the Romans and for many people. And so he's the apostle to the gentiles or the whole earth. So what more likely place for him to go than to Rome at least sometime on his way to Spain. So that's one thing he's doing. Look also at, um, we'll keep reading there at 15, 22 for I do hope can see a verse 25 at present, however, I'm going to Jerusalem in a ministry to the saints, a liturgy. He's, he's taking some help to what he calls the saints in Jerusalem. The sanctus means the holy ones.

Speaker 1:          36:46          He's probably talking about believing Jews, Jews, and Judy and Jerusalem who believe that Jesus is the Messiah. So he's taking them some kind of a help too for Macedonia and Acadia. Remember the where his churches and Philip Pie and Fessel, Annika and Macedonia. His church in Corinth is in a Kia master and a k. I have been pleased to share their research sources with the poor among the saints in Jerusalem. They were pleased to do this and indeed they owed to them for if the gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they also ought to be of service to them in material things. So he's taking money that he's been collecting in his different churches that are gentile churches. Pat Back as a gift to the poor, uh, followers of Jesus in Jerusalem, the Jews. So when I have completed this and if delivered to them what was being collected, I will set out by way of you to Spain.

Speaker 1:          37:34          And I know that when I come, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ. This collection was much more important to Paul then. A lot of modern Christians seem to think it's just kind of, you know, Oh, well all churches take up money. But remember Paul had agreed when he met in Jerusalem with Peter, James and John and other people that he would go to the gentiles and they didn't have to circumcise it installs. Peter would go to the Jews, but the one thing they said is remember the poor. And so this was interpreted that in the different churches that Paul founded among non Jews, he would continue to take up financial contributions to send back to Jerusalem. This was partly just of course they were poor there, but it's also apparently seen by Paul as very symbolically important. The giving of money from the gentile churches to the Jerusalem churches would be an acknowledgement by them, by the gentiles of the somewhat superiority, at least in time in the Gospel, they got their Gospel from the Jews.

Speaker 1:          38:35          It's an acknowledgement of the importance in this [inaudible] of Jews in the Jesus movement by gentiles and it's also reciprocal. Remember I talked about, we've talked about the patron client structures and we've talked about gifts and people giving things to other people in the ancient world. The whole Patriot constructs, we very much centered around giving and receiving. So if I give you something, you're indebted to me. And if you don't want to be shamed, you have to give something back to me. So giving and receiving is always a very important issue with status and relationships and friendships in the ancient world, whether you're talking about equals our people on different social statuses. So Paul, setting up the relationship between the Jerusalem, the Judy churches, predominantly gentile and his gentile churches that he's founded as a, something like a patron client structure where the Jews gave the gentile something, the Gospel.

Speaker 1:          39:26          Now the gentiles owe it to the Jewish followers to give them something. So he's taking this collection. So Paul has, he's talked about this collection and several of his letters. It's been very important to him. And so he's on his way to Jerusalem to do this. But now notice what happens. We don't. We know about, a little bit about Paul's last trip to Jerusalem as it's depicted in acts. How does acts portrayed? This? Paul goes to Jerusalem. He's got some gentiles with him. He's got some other dudes with him. He's in, he goes to the temple purely to pray to be a good Jew. Other people not believing Jews see them there and they think that he's trying to bring gentiles into the temple. So he's arrested. Uh, he tried and then he has to eventually appeal to Caesar to get to Rome. What does acs tell us about the collection? What happened to the collection in acts?

Speaker 1:          40:17          We don't know. The writer of acts may have known about this collection. It was certainly one of the most important things to Paul and his ministry. The writer of acts tells us nothing. Notice also, Paul seems to be a little nervous if you read between the lines, because what happens if he's collected all this money and he takes it to Jerusalem and the Jewish leaders say, Paul, do you know what kind of rumors had been flying about what you're saying about the law? Do you know what we've heard? We're not going to take your money. We're not going to justify your activities. I think Paul was concerned that the Jerusalem churches wouldn't take his money and that would be catastrophic for his vision of having a United church that included both Jews and gentiles. He writes to the Romans partly because he'd go into his painting, he wants to start, you know, uh, um, prepare the ground for a trip to Rome and the Spain.

Speaker 1:          41:18          But also he goes so careful to explain what he really believes about the law and justification because I think he's afraid of what may happen in Jerusalem. He's in a sense trying to get the Roman Christians on his side before his trip to Jerusalem. And that takes us to what's become a new interpretation of Romans. I'm going to do this quickly and we can talk about it maybe more after the break, but the traditional interpretation of Romans was that this was Paul's theological treatise. It didn't have much of anything to do with the circumstances. Paul just kind of decided he's going to go, go to Rome. So he sits down and he says, what's really my Gospel in 16 chapters? And he writes it up. He sends it to the churches in Rome to present my gospel to them. This is, this is sort of a, a theological treatise and the main point of the treatise is you're not justified by works of law, by any works.

Speaker 1:          42:12          No matter which law you're justified by grace through faith alone. So the big Protestant, the Lutheran, the Calvinist reading of Romans, set Romans as the center book of the Bible and start that. What it's mainly about is individual salvation, your personal salvation. You need to recognize that you won't be saved by your works, by anything you do. Not only, you're not say by Jewish law, you're not say by Roman Catholic rules or not say by any law. You're saved by putting your faith in Jesus, having accepting Jesus as your Lord and personal savior or something like that. And it's individual salvation and it's a doctrine of individuals have Asian by faith. That's the reason Paul wrote Romans and that's what the central messages, very individualistic, very doctrinal, very theological. That reading of Romans has been severely challenged in the last 40 years or so. Now people are starting to say it's not the first few chapters of Romans that constitute the most important part of Romans, which has always been the process interpretation cause that's where Paul talks.

Speaker 1:          43:07          Dot Tryon only about justification by faith. Scholars have said, now look to the end of Romans chapters nine to 11 the latter part of Romans. That's where you'll see what the real point of Romans is. And it's not about individual salvation, it's about the relationship between the nations. When I say gentiles number, that's just a term that Jews used for all the nations except themselves. So I want to say the nations, I mean all non Jewish people's in ancient world, that's the way the gent tells you the term. And in fact gentiles is just sort of a Latinized translation of the Greek word nations. So when you see gentiles in Paul's text, read nations, we referred to the non Jewish nations. What's the relationship of the nations to Israel and the God of Israel? Look at a few places. In chapter nine Paul basically gives this apocalyptic expectation, even quotes Hosea saying, the people who are not my people will be my people.

Speaker 1:          44:03          In other words, again, Paul is quoting Jewish scripture to enforce his belief that at the end of time gentiles would become people of God. And this was common in Jewish apocalyptic idea. The basic scenario was the messiah is going to come at the end, the Messiah will bring in, will overthrow the oppressors of the Jews and the Messiah will bring in all the other nations, all the nations, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans will all come to the temple. In Jerusalem, they'll gifts, they'll all worship the god of Israel. And you find this in Isaiah, you find it in Hosea. So Jewish scripture itself gave Jews appalls Paul's Day. The idea that the apocalyptic end would bring all the nations in the Osi had already come for Paul. So that's why he sees himself as going to get the, the gentiles in his whole mission is part of this end time scenario.

Speaker 1:          44:54          So what does that mean? Look at Romans 1113 I'm speaking to you gentiles. So he turns directly to the Romans in as much. Then as I'm an apostle to the gentiles, I glorify my an industry in order to make my own people jealous and thus save some of them for if their objection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be? But life from the dead. If the part of the doe offered is as first fruit is holy than the whole batch is holy. If the root is hold it in, the branches are also holy. So Paul gives a theology here of the remnant, not some of it. A lot of the Jews have not accepted that Jesus the Messiah. Therefore they seem to be cut off. They're like branches of an olive tree that are cut off and the gentiles who are not natural branches of the dollar tree had been grafted in their place that needs they're part of Israel now, but notice what this means so that you may not claim to be wiser than you are brothers and sisters.

Speaker 1:          45:45          I want you to understand this mystery. A hardening has come upon part of Israel. Some of the Jews don't believe until the full number of the gentiles has come in. That's his job is trying to bring in the full number of the gentiles, and so all Israel will be saved. Wow. All Israel. Notice he doesn't explain how this happens, but in Romans nine through 11 Paul presents this magnificent scenario that he believes was prophesied in Jewish scripture itself, that at the end of this cosmos, the end of this world, the Messiah would come overthrow the oppressors of the Jews, set up Jerusalem as the center of the earth, and then all the gentiles, all the nations would come to the god of Israel. They would be grafted in to the nation of Israel. They would worship the god of Israel. Paul's addition to this myth is simply that you don't need to keep the law in order to do this.

Speaker 1:          46:41          So all the pulse about the law is secondary to his main point, which is you're now part of Israel. Paul is not about starting a new religion. There's no Christianity and Paul, there are no Christians in Paul's letters. You can't find the word. You can't find the concept. There is no Christianity or Christians in Paul's world. He believed that he was the apostle to the gentiles to bring them into Israel, to make the gentiles part of Israel. And then as he says right here, most widely along, he somehow believes, although he doesn't tell us how it's going to happen, that somehow God and God's miraculous mercy is going to figure out a way in the end to even bring all of Israel back in. Also, all Israel, he says, we'll be saved. Paul is not necessarily the first Christian theologian. He's one of the most radical Jewish theologians in the ancient world. Okay, we'll stop now and papers will be handed out. Yup. Come up here to handle the papers.
