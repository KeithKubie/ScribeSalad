00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:11.511 line:0%
Four years ago I was
standing in front of a group
of local fishermen

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.847 line:0%
on a tiny island called Mitiaro
in the Cook Islands.

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:18.717
And I was there to tell them why
they needed to protect sharks.

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.719
Except there was one problem.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:22.756
They hated sharks.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:25.091
Sharks stole fish
from their lines

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.859
that they needed to
feed their families.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.762
<i> So, these are the guys
 that I had to try to talk to</i>

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:32.165
<i> who had very real
 experiences with sharks.</i>

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:35.535
<i> They're in canoes every day
 trying to feed their families</i>

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.538
<i>and sharks are literally ripping
 the tuna off of their lines.</i>

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.973
And, so when the man

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.708
who's sitting behind me
in the turquoise shirt

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.578
he raised his hand, told me
how much he hated sharks.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:48.148
He literally said like,
"I hate them.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.849
They've terrorize me
in my canoe.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.353
I wish they would all
disappear from the planet."

00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:57.022
I'm like,
"Oh, this is not going well."

00:00:57.022 --> 00:01:00.893
And then he said, "But
I've learned something today.

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:04.197
I wasn't sure of the
importance of them to our reef.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:06.432
I have children,
I have grandchildren

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:07.967
and I would like
for them to fish

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.436
and for that reason
I will support you."

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.273
For me, that was the single
most powerful moment

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:17.576
of the entire two years
of the campaign.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:20.146
And soon after that happened...

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.714
( audience laughter )

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.983
<i>We made front page of the paper.</i>

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:27.320
<i> This small group
 of farmers, fishermen</i>

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.355
<i> voyagers...
 They came together</i>

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:31.324
and were successful in
getting regulations

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:33.960
that ban the
import, export, sale, trade,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.196
possession and trans-shipment
of sharks and rays

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:39.999
in the entire exclusive economic
zone of the Cook Islands.
