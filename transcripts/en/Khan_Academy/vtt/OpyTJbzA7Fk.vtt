00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
- [Voiceover] Let's study the molecular structure

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.393
of triglycerides.

00:00:07.483 --> 00:00:11.320
And in everyday language we often call these fats.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.500
We often call these fats.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.700
Which is often kind of a feared word

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.360
but as we'll see it's essential for life.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.360
Fats in a liquid form is sometimes referred to as oils.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.920
And a more technical term for triglycerides--

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.550
Triglyceride is the word that you might hear

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.291
when you go to the doctor's office.

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:32.430
But it can also be referred to as tri--

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.650
And I'm going to do the different parts in different colors.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.520
Triacylglycerol.

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.659
I actually like this second name more

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.489
because it makes sense when you break down

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.159
the molecule, triacylglycerol.

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.760
But triglycerides, this is literally fat.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.950
Or where what most people typically refer to as fat,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.160
they're talking about triglycerides.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.490
If you were to get your cholesterol checked

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.290
or if your parents get their cholesterol checked,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.090
they'll probably get a report on triglycerides

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.029
which is really a measure of the fat

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:06.590
concentration in their blood.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.930
But let's think about what a triglyceride is.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.499
And so here I have the constituent molecules

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:13.977
of a triglyceride.

00:01:13.977 --> 00:01:18.479
This molecule on the left, this is glycerol.

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.750
Let me do it in that same blue

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.129
that I just wrote glycerol in.

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:25.649
This is glycerol.

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.160
We can see we have a three carbon chain right over here.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.830
Each of those carbons is attached

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.529
to a hydroxyl group, an O-H group.

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:33.960
If you just get attached to one of them,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.870
this makes you an alcohol

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.090
so this definitely makes it an alcohol.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.520
This is sometimes called a triol.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.690
It has three hydroxyl groups right over here.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.700
And this is considered to be a sugar alcohol.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.300
A sugar alcohol.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.800
We see why it's an alcohol, it's got its hydroxyl groups.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.892
And it's also sweet.

00:01:50.892 --> 00:01:53.459
If you were to drink a solution of

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.050
glycerol it will actually be sweet.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.480
And you might already be familiar with the word glycerol

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.090
from the famous Bush song Glycerine.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.250
Glycerine is referring to glycerol.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.360
Glycerine.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.830
♫ Glycerine ♫

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.019
So there you go, that is glycerol right over there.

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.560
And you form a triglyceride when a glycerol molecule

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.330
reacts with three fatty acid molecules.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.650
So these characters on the right,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.789
these are each a fatty acid.

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:26.090
These are each a fatty acid.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.750
This is one fatty acid, this is another fatty acid,

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.560
this is another fatty acid.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.460
Now why do we call them "fatty" and in particular,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.630
why do we call them a "fatty acid"?

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.050
Well, you have one part that has these

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.920
big carbon chains here.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.960
And I drew these dot dot dots 'cause it can actually have

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.670
different numbers of carbons.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.180
They can have anywhere between--

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.020
Based on my research you can have into the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.990
high 20's numbers of carbons.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.760
In most biological systems you tend to have an

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.760
even number of carbons.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.050
And in most animal biology

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.232
you tend to have 16 to 20 carbons.

00:02:57.232 --> 00:03:00.220
And if it's an even number, you're talking about 16, 18, 20

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.290
carbons involved in these fatty acids.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.290
All the ones I've drawn have all single bonds.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.400
We have as many hydrogens bonded to it as possible.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.860
But you could also have double bonds there.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.720
And we'll talk about that more when we talk about

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.420
saturated and unsaturated fats.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.630
So you have this carbon chain here.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.030
That part is hydrophobic, it won't dissolve well in water.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.976
And that's why people tend to refer to it as kind of fatty.

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:27.630
And then you have on the left-hand,

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.530
or at least the way I've drawn it on the left-hand side,

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.300
you have a carboxyl group.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.460
So this right over here, this is a carboxyl group.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.600
Carboxyl group.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.760
And this is acidic.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.460
It's very easy for it to donate a hydrogen

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.920
because if it donates a hydrogen

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.660
or a hydrogen proton I should say.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.760
Because if this oxygen takes those electrons

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.230
that negative charge can be spread between

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.430
this oxygen and this oxygen over here.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.070
And so it's very willing to give away a hydrogen

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.900
so that makes it acidic.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.600
So that's where the "acid" comes from.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.220
That's a fatty acid.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.760
And when you have these three molecules

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.090
they don't have to be identical.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.260
This one could have 18 carbons.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.900
This one over here could have 16 carbons.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.630
This one could have 20 carbons,

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.360
it might have a couple of double bonds in it.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.590
So they could all be different.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.350
But let's think about how they actually form together.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.600
Like those robot movies from the 80's like Voltron.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.860
So what you have happening,

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.360
and this is gonna be a little bit of organic chemistry

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.800
and this really just a review of dehydration synthesis.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.530
You have a lone pair

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.260
in each of these oxygens.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.790
These oxygens that are part of the hydroxyl group.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.130
So let me draw that.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.190
So you have a lone pair there

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.750
or actually you have two lone pairs.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.860
You have two lone pairs over there.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.470
You have two lone pairs over there.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.040
And so you can imagine a world where

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.650
if they just bump past each other in just the right way

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.960
this carbon over here is gonna

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.620
have a partially positive charge.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.760
It has three bonds to two oxygens.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.390
Oxygens that are very elctro negative.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.510
And so this guy, if he just bumps into it in the right way,

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.450
these electrons could be used

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.550
to form a bond with this carbon,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.600
the one that has that partially positive charge.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.260
And just as that is happening this bond can be let go.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.878
This oxygen say, "Ok look, you're sharing in another pair?

00:05:18.878 --> 00:05:19.990
"I've had enough of that.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.190
"I'm going to take these electrons for myself

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.760
"or even better I'm going to take them for myself

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.160
"or to eventually capture or maybe I capture first,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.370
"it can happen in all different ways, a hydrogen proton.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.070
"I'm gonna capture a hydrogen proton and then I can become

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.820
"this collection right over here

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.790
"could become a water molecule."

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.360
I'm doing just a very high level overview of the mechanism.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.660
You can go to more depth of this

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.320
when you go into organic chemistry.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.630
But this could happen three times.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.820
So it can happen again over here.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.670
It could happen again over here.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.860
This guy takes this--

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.320
Let me do that in that same white color.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.090
So he takes both of these electrons

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.960
that he so badly wants to take back and maybe uses it

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.200
to grab a hydrogen proton.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.900
It could happen the other way.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.000
Maybe grabs a hydrogen proton

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.560
and then just as he's leaving, this guy comes back.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.970
So there's different ways that all of these could happen

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.560
but this is the general idea.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.000
And then you have it happening a third time down here.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.640
One of these lone pairs

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.630
come and form a bond with this carbon.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.160
This carbon in the carbonyl group,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.130
part of this carboxyl group.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.460
And so once again,

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.690
this guy can take those two electrons away

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.220
and maybe share that pair with a hydrogen proton.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.620
Once again, this is forming a water molecule,

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.180
this is forming a water molecule.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.075
So three water molecules are going to be produced.

00:06:43.075 --> 00:06:44.830
This is why we call it dehydration synthesis.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.750
We're losing three water molecules

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.650
in order to form these bonds.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.790
So what's it going to look like after this has happened?

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.290
Well, let me scroll down here.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.760
And actually let me just zoom.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.530
Actually just let me scroll down here.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.560
So this green bond over here is going to now--

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.220
So this green bond that's this big long curvy thing

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.420
is this green bond.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.050
And this second green bond

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.330
is this green bond.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.120
And this third green bond is that green bond.

00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:23.091
The way I've drawn it right now,

00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:27.321
each of these oxygens haven't let go of its hydrogens.

00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:28.821
And that could actually happen before

00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:30.611
or after or all at the same time.

00:07:30.611 --> 00:07:32.990
Chemistry actually is not a clean thing.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.621
But I could, if I want, I could draw the hydrogens here.

00:07:41.774 --> 00:07:45.011
I could draw the hydrogens.

00:07:45.011 --> 00:07:47.881
I could draw the hydrogens over here

00:07:47.881 --> 00:07:50.761
and then these would have a positive charge.

00:07:50.761 --> 00:07:52.461
These would have a positive charge.

00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:55.701
But then you could imagine another water molecule coming by

00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:59.631
and kind of taking one of these hydrogen protons,

00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:02.787
taking the hydrogen protons away from each of those oxygens.

00:08:02.787 --> 00:08:05.331
And then you would be left with

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.291
this molecule right over here.

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:14.830
And remember we produced three water molecules.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.920
So that's one,

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.860
two

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.401
and three water molecules.

00:08:24.401 --> 00:08:25.821
And now this molecule,

00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:27.240
if you ignore the water molecules out there,

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.381
this is a triglyceride.

00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:31.451
Let me write it again.

00:08:31.451 --> 00:08:33.821
Actually, let me write the slightly more technical term.

00:08:33.821 --> 00:08:37.231
Sometimes referred to as

00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:40.231
triacylglycerol.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.661
Well we know where the glycerol comes from.

00:08:45.661 --> 00:08:48.991
It has this glycerine or this glycerol

00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:50.591
backbone right over here.

00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:52.121
Now what is "acyl" mean?

00:08:52.121 --> 00:08:54.891
Well acyl is a functional group

00:08:54.891 --> 00:08:59.791
where you have a carbon that's part of a carbonyl group.

00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:03.721
It can be bound to a kind of an organic chain

00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:05.651
right over here, I'll just call that R.

00:09:05.651 --> 00:09:08.621
And then it's bound to something else.

00:09:08.621 --> 00:09:12.191
And so we have three acyl groups so "triacyl".

00:09:12.191 --> 00:09:15.961
So this right over here, this right here is an acyl group.

00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:18.491
This right over here is an acyl group.

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:20.011
This right over here is an acyl group.

00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:24.551
Each of them, they're bound to an oxygen right over here.

00:09:24.551 --> 00:09:26.121
And actually that gives us more practice

00:09:26.121 --> 00:09:27.761
with another functional group.

00:09:27.761 --> 00:09:31.461
When you have a situation--

00:09:31.461 --> 00:09:32.991
Let me get another color out.

00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:37.621
When you have a carbonyl group

00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:41.441
and let's say you have just an organic chain right over here

00:09:41.441 --> 00:09:43.071
and then you have an oxygen

00:09:43.071 --> 00:09:45.973
and then you have another organic chain right over there.

00:09:45.973 --> 00:09:48.171
This thing

00:09:49.851 --> 00:09:51.981
is called an ester.

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:56.561
And you actually see three esters right over here.

00:09:56.561 --> 00:09:59.301
So you see this ester.

00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:01.431
This ester right over here.

00:10:01.431 --> 00:10:04.191
You see this ester right over here.

00:10:04.191 --> 00:10:06.621
And then this ester right over here.

00:10:06.621 --> 00:10:09.051
So this wasn't just practice in learning about

00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:12.451
fats or triacylglycerol or triglycerides.

00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:14.291
These are all words for the same thing.

00:10:14.291 --> 00:10:17.031
It's giving us good practice with these functional groups.

00:10:17.031 --> 00:10:18.911
But now you see where triacylglycerol comes from.

00:10:18.911 --> 00:10:20.291
You have glycerol backbone

00:10:20.291 --> 00:10:23.161
and you have these three acyl groups

00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:26.791
that allow it to attach to the fatty acids.

00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:30.611
So that's what fat is when people are referring to it.

00:10:30.611 --> 00:10:31.611
And this is just pictures of it.

00:10:31.611 --> 00:10:34.731
This is coconut oil right over here.

00:10:34.731 --> 00:10:37.621
It's right here, it's below its melting point

00:10:37.621 --> 00:10:39.376
so it's in its solid form.

00:10:39.376 --> 00:10:41.051
And this right over here, I'm not sure which type

00:10:41.051 --> 00:10:43.511
of oil this is but it's past its melting point

00:10:43.511 --> 00:10:44.651
and so it's in its liquid form.

00:10:44.651 --> 00:10:48.231
So people would typically refer to this as an oil.

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:51.521
But this is made up of a bunch of triglycerides.

00:10:51.521 --> 00:10:54.078
This is a big mixture of triglycerides here.

00:10:54.078 --> 00:10:56.051
And if you were to see their molecules,

00:10:56.051 --> 00:10:57.691
they would all have generally this shape

00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:00.361
but the fatty acids would have different numbers of carbons

00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:02.891
and might have different numbers of double bonds.
