00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,110
Good lights and take notes while I take
totes up the marijuana smoke though you

5
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:44,040
weren't a choke gun. Smoke done float.

00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,550
Hail Mary full of grace.
Smack the bitch in the face.

Take a Gucci bag and a north face store

Funding with the money. Oh, you got

10
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,700

to call him Mister Macho.

11
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,120
[inaudible] Macho.

12
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,220
I got so much to be done with the stop
list to break off the wake up shaky

13
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,900
smalls and mixed up with led Zeppelin.
Who did this? Let me shop. See,

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,753
don't remember

15
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,300
every hit in your and
sucking on the [inaudible].

16
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:30,410
Fucking bad ass doesn't even
say he did it. That's weird.

17
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,050
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the podcast.

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,460
Our guest today is the one and only Mr

19
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:40,120
Al Madrigal,
longtime friend Allan.

20
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,440
I first worked together in San Francisco
at the old old cars, tiny carves,

21
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,320
a hundred seater, didn't even
see it. 150 probably 200 tops.

22
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:51,620
Tom Sawyer is squeezing
chairs. Really? You legally,

23
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,640
I don't think you'd call kinds
of fire codes. Look violations,

24
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,160
let's say let's say 200 let's say one
50 so we don't get anybody in trouble.

25
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:01,760
But it was a fucking awesome little
club and then now it's like totally

26
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:04,990
different now it's like this big
gigantic we did new year's. Yeah,

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,480
first New Year's. You
remember that? A lot of gigs

28
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,570
going way back to like what? 2000 maybe
2000 and think something like that. Yeah.

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,900
11 years. Cause I haven't been doing,
I met, I met you when I had just been,

30
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,270
you know,
started to do standup comedy a year in,

31
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,930
we worked together at that old cobb's.
You were funny.

32
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:26,570
Back Down even a little fuck.

33
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,820
And it's funny cause I just
think I just figured it out.

34
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,190
I just feel like my latest
stuff has been clearly a videos.

35
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,610
How many years? 12 years. 12 years.
That's what they say. They say 10 years,

36
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,300
10 takes 10 years for you to become a
real comic. You know, like I buy that,

37
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,860
I buy that totally,
you know,

38
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,910
or maybe put it takes it seven years
to get your law degree and then another

39
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:55,040
seven years for you to
become a good lawyer. So it's
like that's the same thing.

40
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:59,030
We stand up practicing as a professional
comedian for x amount of years.

41
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,650
Then you know, becoming really
good at it, finding your own space,

42
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,630
finding who the fuck you are without
influence of other comedians and actually

43
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:10,660
having your real
personality be you on stage.

44
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,440
I should takes a long ass time really
does. Especially if you're distracted.

45
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,700
If you have other things going
on and it's easy for all.

46
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:20,570
So you lose your way as a stand
up. And a lot of guys, you know,

47
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,130
just stop trying. And my big
pitfalls have always been TV shows.

48
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,550
Like uh, there've been
great, you know, news radio,

49
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:29,470
especially like when I was
on Newsradio we learnt,

50
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,230
we worked some serious long hours.
So you're working in,

51
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,520
you're taking away from your stand up,

52
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:36,400
you're not able to hit the clubs as
much as you'd like. I haven't been on,

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,740
I've done six pilots and heaven too,
that made it on the air.

54
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:43,640
And so I, you know exactly what
you're talking about. This,

55
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,720
you're working every single day and
then I have you, we have families. Yeah.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,190
And you got to spend time with them and
then stand up gets pushed to three when

57
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,660
stand up is usually number one.

58
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,810
Very hard to justify getting on
stage all the time. And for me,

59
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:59,890
I just straight got lazy because not only
did I, I did stand up on the weekends,

60
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:00,724
I would do like,

61
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,590
oh dare you go the funniest
I've ringtone to. Oh,

62
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:08,740
by the way, we're sponsored by the
flesh, by the way. That's a good reason.

63
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,740
That's why was calling Karma fleshlight
calling again. Tell us yo bitch,

64
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,150
we pioneer. Yeah. Yeah. We are
actually sponsored by the flashlight.

68
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,320
Yeah. Gray touch that.
It's technology, man.

69
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,010
Put your finger on amazing plastic. Using

71
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,250

of your way and say, okay,

72
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:46,750
I'm going to fuck this tube now within
this and the coconut juice. I feel like,

73
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,460
uh, I learned to grade. Yeah.

74
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,450
C Two o sent us a bunch of
cases of coconut juice, but
I ran out of them. Sorry.

75
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:57,150
C Two o this is Amy and Brian's.
I had to pay for this shit,

76
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,250
which is really good too.
They're all good. Yeah. Great.

77
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,030
But CQL gave me some free
shit. So props. Um, but the um,

78
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,260

80
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:13,930
Like I said, keep the
push that, where is it?

81
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:16,100
Put that lid on it and
I got to keep it fresh.

82
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,720
Don't want to get a dust it with
Ken and Shit, man. I got cats.

83
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,130
Yeah. So yeah, the in your
allergic to cats. So you might be,

84
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,830
so that's the thing is I,
it hasn't affected me yet,

85
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:31,450
but there's a very good chance
that I could completely lose it.

86
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,030
And you have to be rushed to the hospital.
There's no big deal.

87
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,200
The volcano's going to bypass all
that and put it in order for you.

88
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,660
Is it a breathing thing or is he
get swollen or anything? Eyes.

89
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,860
Throat closes the hole. Oh, Shit.

90
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,910
Mouth to mouth resuscitation might
be necessary. In other words,

91
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:51,160
he's a [inaudible].
That's the thing.

92
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:54,460
That's what a large part of my
act is become about allergies.

93
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,960
Me like talking to a Cholo,
but I have allergies. Yeah.

94
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,980
Like, no, I do, um,

95
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,580
like a couple of different stories
that I have is a Cholo soccer dad.

96
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,530
Then I'm talking about and a,
and stuff like that.

97
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:09,320
It's all about me having allergies
in front of black people.

98
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,690
Yeah. Hey, sorry.

99
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,610
Here's a fascinating thing that I
read about the h one n one virus,

100
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,880
that flu virus. They're saying now
that the people that survived it,

101
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,230
the people that got it and survived it,

102
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,070
they have like super immune systems
now and now they don't get any flows.

103
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,900
They don't get any of the flows.
It's like in the,

104
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,370
they think that they may be able to
come up with a universal vaccine for is

105
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,190
based on the h one n one wow. Based
on the people that survived. Yeah.

106
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,120
Pretty fascinating shit man.
I use a motherfucker of a flu.

107
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,540
The thing about this flows is they're
getting better. They're getting stronger,

108
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,960
they evolve just like everything else
evolves and when these assholes take their

109
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:48,850
fucking medicine,
they don't take it all.

110
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,190
Especially this is especially
true about antibiotics.

111
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,340
People who get sick and they
take antibiotics and they only,

112
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,650
they only take it for like
until they feel better,

113
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,390
like say if you're supposed
to take it for 10 days,

114
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,750
the bacteria that survive is like super
powerful antibiotic resistant bacteria,

115
00:07:04,421 --> 00:07:07,630
so that becomes like this strain.
It's almost impossible to kill.

116
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,670
That's where this mercy shit comes from.

117
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,780
Now the people are dying from
these crazy staph infections.

118
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:15,490
It's because assholes don't
take their fucking pills.

119
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,420
They take like a percentage of them and
then they quit and I developed this new

120
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:22,150
fucking super virus because
of that and he's cons.

121
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,770
So you're going to finish all your
medication finishing medication bitches.

122
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,101
You don't,

123
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:29,920
you're not smarter than the scientists
who shit till a little we're to asking

124
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,030
people to do is use the fleshlight.
Yes. You feed off in that shit.

125
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,140
Here's your medication, take the
all of it, take all that shit.

126
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,020
I'm really bad at that. I admit it.
I get down to the wire too and yeah,

127
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:43,490
she didn't do that just
as guilty as anybody else.

128
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:46,050
And part of the manatee for
humanity take that shit.

129
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,040
They should give to ekster just so I
don't take this to treat you like a child.

130
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,330
I'd be Chad at birth control, but
yeah, they said, oh, you'd be pregnant.

131
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,210
How would be totally knocked out for
sure. Portions all day. And Yeah,

132
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,800
you know, they say that a big supply of
pharmaceutical drugs are in the water.

133
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,860
The water supply. There's
not a big supply, but a big
percentage like you know,

134
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:06,810
this measurable amounts of everything.

135
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:10,400
Everything from antidepressants
to birth control pills. Yeah.

136
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,560
Cause people flush their shit
flush their stuffed on the toilet.

137
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,840
I mean that's where your
water supplies coming from.

138
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:18,790
A lot of it's coming from re
constituted poop water. Yeah.

139
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,470
You know in some places, right? Isn't
that where they get their water supply?

140
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,480
They fucking fix up the poop.
Water

141
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,760
doesn't go anywhere. It's never going
to die. It's the same water. Right.

142
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,910
How much can you fool to filter out
where you're leaving in the birth control

143
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:36,750
pills, but giving me no poop. You're
sure there's no poop in this academy.

144
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:39,260
Some poop in there. You Fuck?
I'd like some poop free water.

145
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,900
The same water is coming our way
that birth control pills get into.

146
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,170
Unless I'm ignorant about
how birth control pills get
into water and they're not

147
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:46,680
being

148
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,700
well she is the amount of worth of pills.
You're like a,

149
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,250
anything going into the water
system, is that really, I mean,

150
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,980
large enough to effect it. I mean
I don't, it's a good question,

151
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,440
but I would like 0% of
birth control pills,

152
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:01,860
a money diet 0.0 [inaudible]
no pregnant water anymore.

153
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:06,630
At least what, what? Yeah.
Um, I think, you know,

154
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:08,340
we've gotta be real careful
about that shit man.

155
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,940
You know the idea that water is 96% of
our bodies and that's the one thing that

156
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:16,170
we love to throw things into. It's a
fucking stupid, you know, we need water.

157
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,350
Obviously humans need water over always
dumping shit in the water cause it's so

158
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,300
easy. We're such constantly owl. Owl does.
I do a lot of things vigilante dumping,

159
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,100
dumping oil and shit.
I see.

160
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,800
I'm guilty because when I see a
dumpster near my house and my God,

161
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:34,080
I got to put a fucking that
chair in there and I thought,

162
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,460
well there's nothing wrong with that.

163
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,660
That's I think Robin emotional countries
in these companies are actually locking

164
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,020
a Oh, you know, like
1-800-JUNK-YOU get, is that? Yeah.

165
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,150
That's where the come and
they come and get your shit.

166
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,600
They're shipping it to fucking China
where they're paying for cheap landfill.

167
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,200
Some cute,
huge like secret in the night.

168
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:57,201
Fucking barges full of our shit shows
up in China and landfill all over the

169
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:01,800
place.
And so I mean no flushing pills down the,

170
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,390
I mean that's at least of our trouble.

171
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,480
It's all these foreign countries that
don't have any luck in laws that are just

172
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:10,560
allowing you to dump and Barry and Huck
is toxic waste that we're shipping over

173
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:14,580
there. Do China's crazy. They
develop some new ECO city.

174
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,210
It's fucking fantastical. Have you seen
this thing? No, it's on my Twitter. Brian,

175
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:20,300
have you seen it? It was,
I posted it. Someone,

176
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,970
someone tweeted it and I retweeted it.
It's pretty fucking amazing man.

177
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:26,400
This is new city that they have.
That's like some,

178
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,090
it looks like like some
gigantic future space.

179
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,870
Solar powered like um,
like greenhouse of a city.

180
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:37,310
It's like they have glass domes
over the down buildings. It's China,

181
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,420
Pauly shore running around inside

182
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,690
the Simpsons.

183
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,540
What is the title of the
article so someone can Google
if they want to Google it.

184
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:49,020
What does it say?
Tagine Eco City in China.

185
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,630
You just type in Eco City in
China. China. I'll find it.

186
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,210
It's an amazing world.
We live in that and just do the j I.

187
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,900
N how fucking cool is that?

188
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,320
You can just type that into a box and it
just gives you the instant information

189
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:04,950
information instant. Yeah. We
don't even realize how crazy it is.

190
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,340
Why is there college anymore? Yeah.
Right. Just a way to torture you. Yeah.

191
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,270
Who has to go somewhere and
foster commercial on right
now where they're doing

192
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:12,451
that.

193
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:15,090
You just see families sitting around a
phone and he'd look over and they see

194
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,700
just to be actors who they don't
know who exactly it is and it says,

195
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:21,660
his says his name is tell the toe and
these people are just googling and getting

196
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:24,030
instant information on the
spot when they need it.

197
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,210
And that's totally what we're doing.
And my phone is fantastic. So amazing.

198
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,120
That's when people have their
phones on in comedy shows. I say,

199
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:34,110
I realize that's a fine, fascinating
device. I mean I have one,

200
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,760
I fucking losing it all the
time and I love it. Yeah,

201
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,480
now's not the time to have it, so
just put it in. That's my first one.

202
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,860
You do wig out on people that film you?
Um, I make, I make them stop a lot.

203
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:45,420
Some people are just so blatant with it.

204
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:46,820
They're like sitting right
in the front row and they're,

205
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,580
they're pointing a camera
and filming, like just flip
video camera, just straight.

206
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,160
And uh, I usually point
out, but sometimes people

207
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,000
don't care, you know, just enjoy
the fucking moment. Enjoy the show.

208
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,010
Doesn't have to go on to youtube.

209
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:04,180
I do laugh factory and you're standing
on the stage and there's two monitors on

210
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,690
the side. You've done that closure.
And I sometimes look in the audience.

211
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,820
People are watching me on
a fucking monitor. Yeah.

212
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,910
Yeah. That's weird. If people do
that, the UFC all the time too,

213
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:19,450
and they watch the fight to the Monitor.
It's in front of you. Yeah. Wow.

214
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:20,500
How can I do that?

215
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:24,000
Sometimes ringside at catch myself
doing that dude replayed side.

216
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,520
The guys are fighting five feet in front
of me and I'm looking at this little 13

217
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:30,140
inch monitor in front of me. Well,
sometimes you get a better perspective.

218
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,490
That camera still funny that I'm
doing it. Yeah, you're right there.

219
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:35,920
It's right there and I'm watching a TV.
Yeah.

220
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,120
I like it on the UFC just because
it's like the different camera angles.

221
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:43,320
Especially when you get on the ground,
you can't see anything on the floor. Yeah,

222
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,590
totally. Yeah, that's, that's where
it's real confusing too. If you don't,

223
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,720
if you're in the stands and
you don't have commentary,

224
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,760
like a lot of times you don't see what
guys are going for. You don't see what,

225
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,610
how a guy slept. Trying to set something
up. You know, you just [inaudible].

226
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,780
My very first one was the uh,

227
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,010
Las Vegas Palms will resoling Fox a fight,

228
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,540
a spike night fights
spike fight, fight. Spike

229
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,730
couldn't get it out. It
was great. Did we get it?

230
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,590
This is the finals of the ultimate fighter
and then they have a Tivo was around

231
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,400
a, he also got, he got a ticket
from you and he's had to close her.

232
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:19,390
He was just texting us,

233
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:24,190
constantly saying who's sitting next
to and so on until really? Yeah.

234
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:28,870
A little girl tweets rampage who was
behind them and you tell him in front of

235
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:32,020
her in pain. Couldn't believe, you know,

236
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:35,410
so he was all abuzz location and very fun
and games like a little kid in a candy

237
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:39,250
store. He said he was just loving life
that was dressed up. He wore a blazer,

238
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,850
the blazer, rainbow socks
down. He's a good dude. Good.

239
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,930
Very Fun and funny guy.
Very smart guy.

240
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:51,340
And he's been around for a long time and
a hilarious, frustrating when you know,

241
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,320
you see go like that.
It's not getting anywhere and you're like,

242
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:55,590
how come you know what's going on?
What's happening?

243
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,830
Why isn't it more very famous,
you know, strange world.

244
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:02,460
We live in this comedy world.
So when I met you,

245
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,440
you'd only been doing it like
what? Two years? Even less
than that. Less than that.

246
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,160
Wow. Dude, I met you in
the day's Sun and um,

247
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,530
you recommended me for the
comedy store. Yeah, I'm sorry.

248
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,510
He was you and Freddy
Soto. And I was like, oh,

249
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:18,940
this is the best I'm going to go in.

250
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,510
And then we were doing a
Fridays and Saturday nights
there until everything blew

251
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:25,660
up over there. And then, uh, I, you
know, I've worked with you quite a bit.

252
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,740
It's thought of comedy
store jokes, man. Yeah.

253
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,920
And you used to have the DEA,
you put in the recorder.

254
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,010
What I always appreciated the Jill
bought a digital recorder, not a digital,

255
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:38,770
a CD burner for the club.

256
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,240
And so I'd go in there with a CD just
constantly on a Friday night and just show

257
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:47,590
up and hand my CD. I have old three
different things that I bought.

258
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:50,050
I started out with a dat player,
a dat recorder.

259
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,980
I had digital audio tape installed there.
But the

260
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,460
problem with that is that no one had a
dat player. Yeah. So then I said okay,

261
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,830
we'll get many discs cause
that seems like a good format,

262
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,520
but the problem was many disc died
out. Sure. So then I switched it to CD.

263
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,110
So it's awesome.
So I put three different systems in there,

264
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,581
the CD,

265
00:15:05,581 --> 00:15:09,480
and then you handle all of like those
live moments that you never really get on

266
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:10,314
a comedy album.

267
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:14,020
Yeah. All recorded it at the comedy
store. Yeah, that was perfect. Yeah. Well,

268
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:15,280
you know,
just like it did.

269
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,400
We needed to have it there and
there was a budget issue. Yeah.

270
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,830
There's the comedy store appreciated.
You've,

271
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,330
after you did all these nice
[inaudible] did the real comedy store,

272
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:27,220
did you know that was more,

273
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:32,040
my loyalty was in the first place to put
in the kitchen over there. Good guys.

274
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,680
You get food poisoning 20 years too
late. What the fuck? You know, how many,

275
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,240
how much money they lost from not having,
but you know what dude,

276
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:42,820
it was the comedy store. This
was supposed to be it. The,

277
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:46,960
the real issue there was that they stopped
nurturing good comedy and they had a

278
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:51,040
lot of those issues that al and I were
talking about right before the show that

279
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:54,820
he's dealing with there right
now. If it's, they don't
have the right intentions.

280
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,210
They don't have,
there aren't looking out for comedy there.

281
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,080
They're not even looking
out for the club anymore.

282
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,910
They're just looking
out for short dollars.

283
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,980
They're looking out for what's gonna
work and what's going to get the money

284
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:03,814
right now.

285
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,290
Yeah, it sounds, it's tough
because I really, I mean on
those Friday and Saturdays,

286
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,124
I remember those.

287
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,370
I honestly won't some of the best nights
you were there for all of them. Yeah.

288
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,930
Some of the best nights, uh, that I've
ever had as a comic, that place packed.

289
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:20,770
And it's like that old cops you were
talking about when you get that 150 to 200

290
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,280
seater really packed. It's great. Yeah.

291
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,260
That was a fun Gig man.
Because when I was doing fear factor,

292
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,990
I couldn't really travel.

293
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,730
And so I just set up shop at the comedy
store and I set it up so that I paid for

294
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:34,770
everything. I paid for
the sound system. I did,

295
00:16:34,771 --> 00:16:36,210
I advertised everything in my space.

296
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:39,750
I never asked for a dime pack the place
every weekend and work totally for free.

297
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,560
Yeah. And um, when, when that
was happening in man, that was,

298
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,190
that was like the most fun time ever
for comedy for us, for me, you know,

299
00:16:47,191 --> 00:16:51,000
so we had some good times in that past,
meet him. I mean, crazy weekends there.

300
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:55,580
At least 10 times. I bought the
entire audiences shots. That's crazy.

301
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,860
At least about times. Remember
that the whole audience had shots.

302
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,290
Whenever I would kick somebody
out, I would go, look,

303
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,720
I know that we just went through
this douchey moment together,

304
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:06,030
but we can change this.
We can get out of this feeling.

305
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:06,960
I know this feels terrible.

306
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:10,230
We had some drunk assholes yelling things
and they got kicked out and everybody

307
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:13,450
feels weird. Like, what the fuck man,
you know, and there's a few people going,

308
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,950
they paid to, you know, to stop.
Those are douchebags right? Let's,

309
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,710
we're not douchebags we're
going to change all this shit.

310
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,370
So I would like to buy you guys a
drink, everybody and, and you know,

311
00:17:23,371 --> 00:17:25,920
kind of bring the mood back and
everybody would cheer and we'd all wait.

312
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,360
I would say that's the one
thing that we gotta wait,

313
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,400
we gotta wait and everybody
waited. Man. Every time.

314
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:33,030
We never had an issue with people drinking
their shots early. The waitresses,

315
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:36,450
they hustled, they came back and forth.
They had to do like fucking 10 15 trips,

316
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,160
you know, with big trays, full of shots.

317
00:17:38,161 --> 00:17:40,340
But we give shots to everybody
that wanted them. Yeah.

318
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,400
Probably a few alcoholics fell off the
wagon. Probably a few guys who were like,

319
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:48,090
wow, fuck it man, he's giving me
a shot. I don't want to be a dick.

320
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:50,160
And next thing blacked out with his pants

321
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,310
down. You know, very a lot
of people's, it's shots for
everybody. But that was the,

322
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,620
that was a shit load of people.

323
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,270
Thousands of dollars every time it was
the shots for everybody and there was 10

324
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:04,470
people there are dying. That's what shots
for everybody in a big fucking room.

325
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,300
But it was, you know, it worked though.

326
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,430
It totally restored the
vibe because first of all,

327
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:10,800
everybody knew that I was paying for it.
So you know,

328
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:13,890
it was going to cost real
money and you know, and it was,

329
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:18,380
it was just all for the vibe to
fix it cause we can, you know,

330
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:20,310
all that was the, the whole
attitude about it. And that's,

331
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:23,740
that should be the attitude of comedy.
You know, it's supposed to be the,

332
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,370
it's about getting into it
and find, finding, you know,

333
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,160
finding what's fucking fun about and
taking everybody with too. What's fun,

334
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,750
you know, and when you,
you have an opportunity to
correct the vibe of the room,

335
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,810
you know, if you can do it like that,
that's really what it's all about right

336
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,030
now. Now, you said you had used to
do a podcast like five years ago,

337
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,750
five years ago when the podcast first
came out and those were really big back in

338
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:47,120
the day and they kind of died
and it, was there a, yeah,

339
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:51,620
there was like a poser because, um,
you know, it was four years ago.

340
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:52,360
I don't even know what she,

341
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,160
you feel your own podcast called?

342
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,510
I did 17 episodes of the lot of
you think it's a lot of them.

343
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:02,420
I did a TV show in 1994. Only did six
episodes. I can tell you a lot about it.

344
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,350
It was,
um,

345
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:08,430
it was a, we had sort of many names
for the thing, but it was the, um,

346
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,850
uh, I, we did it with Peter Myriad at
a comedy writer. And so it was just,

347
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,160
and he's half Mexican and I'm
half Mexican and it was too

348
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:19,630
combining full [inaudible] calls
it two. Yeah, one maximum together.

349
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:23,160
We are one Mexican done me a good
name for it. Can one Mexican feather.

350
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,910
We one Mexican and we still don't speak
Spanish. You don't speak any of them? No,

351
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,670
not really.
It's horrible because must get mad at you.

352
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,030
Yeah, it's, it's uh, yeah,
like I said, just like the
allergies to put music. It's,

353
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,780
I'm on a weird spot with the
big guy with the Laker Jersey,

354
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,240
don't we guys

355
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,800
fromm also was at the,
in La, the segment you,

356
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:46,110
when I was working with Joe and San
Francisco, when we first started,

357
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:47,910
I didn't even know I was Latino comic.

358
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:52,440
I was just a comic and then you moved
down to la and immediately I got put in

359
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,850
this Hbo Aspen Comedy thing
where it was me, Jeff Garcia,

360
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,760
Freddy Soto.
Willy Birth Center.

361
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,530
Oh, that's fine. You guys together?

362
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,130
Yeah.
And they gave me a tin of red hots.

363
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,940
They brought me a 10 of red hots and
they said, this is for you, says Hbo,

364
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:11,930
Latino on it, and this guy, Mateo
comes up and goes, my name is Mateo.

365
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:15,320
Can I interview you in Spanish? You know,
and shit like that. I was like, yeah,

366
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:20,160
you can fucking try to work out.
I don't know why. I don't know.

367
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,370
I'm not a Latino comic.
I'm just the one comic.

368
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:24,410
And I went to my friend Becky Pedago,
I was like,

369
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,920
they give you a hat and they
gave me fucking red hots.

370
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,910
[inaudible]

371
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,150
okay, let them know with these
guys. And I looked at her,

372
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:36,470
I swear to God with these guys
said, I said, I looked at her, I go,

373
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,910
I'm a Mexican comedian,

374
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,230
this word

375
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,140
of God. And I was like, I just learned
it. Oh No, we want to, can I Aaron?

376
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,100
So I did the sets in and that's

377
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,560
weird for me because you know,

378
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,480
just like you sort of get put in that
group and they all sort of make funny.

379
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,000
I did a new years.
They make fun of you would like to,

380
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:56,230
real Mexican comics were there.

381
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:00,070
I remember walking up to you don't have
those comedy break dance circles form

382
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,140
where it's just a Commie, uh, like a group
of comic standing in a circle. Right,

383
00:21:04,141 --> 00:21:08,830
right, right. And I do see two TV, the
Latino Comedy Festival on, you know,

384
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:13,450
TV chauffeurs, CTV as Shitty, you
know, want to be English speaking.

385
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:17,530
Latinos station I think still exists
and it's really tiny at the time.

386
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:20,680
So they're doing stand up. And
I sent him a there with, um,

387
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,700
this Guy Rick Cutera's and all these
Mexicans comics and they're talking about

388
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,640
how him and Gabriel lived together
and they don't go on the road.

389
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,670
They go out and they're on the road so
much that no one's ever at their house.

390
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,960
And I looked at him and I go, wow,
it must have a lot of dead plants

391
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,590
and there, and the guy looks at me, he
goes, we don't have any power plants, bro.

392
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,470
What are you talking about? We don't
have any fine or what the fuck? No class.

393
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,110
That's how I feel like
around all these guys.

394
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:55,111
I got made fun of every night over new
years by a comic that I was supposed to

395
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:59,790
co headline with. I'll never do another
Latino show again. You've got to be, yeah,

396
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,450
it's a co headline.

397
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,200
Who is this fucking Willy Willy
birth sending me funny funnies. Yeah,

398
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,480
well he didn't think he
was making fun of me,

399
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:10,390
but we had a conversation about
it and I felt like he was just,

400
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,870
he kept bringing up my name, like Sam
and he actually said this at one point.

401
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:17,770
He goes, I don't want my kids to grow
up. Like, Oh, you know, like all scared.

402
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,230
Whoa. Like that. And she was, was
talking, you know about me, you know,

403
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:26,350
and doing the whole,
my name is Al Madrigal and I'm a lot know

404
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,810
like, okay, I fucking get it. I talk about
myself and I'm stepped, self-deprecating.

405
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:38,020
So we were doing the New Year's count
down and um, he was off on his time.

406
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,230
He started trying to do the
countdown five minutes early.

407
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,130
Everybody has fucking cell phones. They
call them one, you know, they're like, no,

408
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,140
it's not it.
And so he has to wait.

409
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,040
And then he yells to the back of the
room to the manager at the Sac Punch.

410
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,100
He goes, you're trying to
humiliate me, bro up here on stage.

411
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,950
And I grabbed the back, Mike flipped
it around really quick and I go,

412
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,180
what's a matter,
Willie?

413
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,250
Don't like being humiliated on stage
is ever fucking get through you like a,

414
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:07,480
and he's like, this is bad ass.
He's like a East La Street fighter,

415
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,670
uh, killed people. And then, uh,

416
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,560
he goes, we had a problem
or only but, and I go, look,

417
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:21,670
Willie. And I made him understand,
I go, I get just as angry as you do,

418
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,270
but I don't have the fighting
ability. Do you understand me? I go,

419
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,780
I'm just as fired up as is.
You've killed guys, you know,

420
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:34,420
and fucking Nile aided people. And, uh,
I don't have the ability to do that,

421
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,880
but I still feel fucking angry as shit.

422
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:41,020
So you got angry at him saying that
you are scared to talk shit about,

423
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,590
you're still like to what
Andy comic brings up to get
next comic before them and

424
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,310
starts really fucking referring

425
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,980
to somebody, you know? And, uh, yeah,

426
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,240
it was using me as an
example of what will happen.

427
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,740
What if you were really good friends with
them and they were joking around with

428
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:55,760
them like,
you know,

429
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:58,850
like I have friends and they'd go on after
each other and joke around about each

430
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:03,390
other and it's just like Joey
will go on after Ari and,

431
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:06,470
and you know, and talk about
art being a Jew, you know,

432
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,500
but how it wasn't real guys know
each other. Real good, real good.

433
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:14,000
I always make fun of Joey. Yeah.
You know, but it's like, oh no,

434
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:16,900
I'm just saying it then it's all about
the relationship. I totally get that.

435
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,020
Your relationship, it's more like he's
actually mocking you. He's say yeah,

436
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,840
I think you really,

437
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,800
I don't want my kids to grow up like you
will scared Montreal in 2002 and I've

438
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:27,770
told them this story and we've
talked about it and I walked out to,

439
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:30,560
when I use the only other non white,
you know,

440
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:34,130
like he's the only Latino guy there and
I don't know anybody and I wait until I

441
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:38,210
go, hey Willie a hey, hi.
Nice to meet Ya. Al Madrigal.

442
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,750
And he looked at me and goes, you don't
even see your own last name, right, bro?

443
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,780
Like,
wow.

444
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,830
It like motherly Gal to really,

445
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,170
could you imagine if you really did
that dual enrolled your tongue and

446
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:54,120
everything, you'd be committed to
every other word. Exactly. It's like,

447
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:59,180
do it for that. Yeah. Just roll the name
and not really, when I was in college,

448
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:02,150
you went to Tijuana.
What? What? Oh, excuse me.

449
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,240
Yeah.
So you've got to commit.

450
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,700
When I do the Wayans and I
have to pronounce Dude's names,

451
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,030
I have to decide whether or not,

452
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:15,470
I don't want to commit to that Super
Spanish way of saying things, you know?

453
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,550
And there's a lot of Mexicans in the
UFC, right? I mean, sure, yeah. Yeah.

454
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,370
I think it's the correct way to
say it, but it's like, you know,

455
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:27,320
like Montreal is how we say it, but
they say Montreal, they say Montreal.

456
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,970
So really you should say Montreal.
Like who the fuck are you to say Montreal?

457
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,320
And he out their cities to get pissed
when people say Frisco and shit like that.

458
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:39,830
And nobody knows. San Franciscan
likes stuck in for it. You
really like touchy. Oh,

459
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:43,370
San Fran. That's a, that's it used to get
pissed at them calling it Sam phone. No,

460
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:46,240
no, no. I'm just saying it's a
native to be for a Faggot Ville.

461
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,220
It's what is the most derogatory names?
No,

462
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,720
I'm just saying when you're calling
it the wrong thing and you're a local,

463
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:58,460
you know, I mean, we're not, no one's
expected to browns saying faggot anymore.

464
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:02,470
I just haven't used it wasn't
even, I just is an example. Oh,

465
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,160
try not to think that someone else.
Yeah, I totally stopped saying faggot.

466
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,400
Did you hear that? Toronto is
censoring the Mark Knopfler Song,

467
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:14,630
the dire straits song. Um,
what does that song, um,

468
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:19,400
the rock star Song, what does
that fucking song? God dammit,

469
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,420
it's dire straits. You don't know. Dire
Straits, of course. Money for nothing.

470
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,650
Nothing to chicks for
free because it's got,

471
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:27,710
that song has the word Faggot in
it three times. Oh, that's you.

472
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,510
Little Faggot zone. Jet
Airplane. That little side. Good.

473
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,240
He's a middle unit. I forgot about
that. That she was on the radio.

474
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,100
Yeah. Yeah. City of Toronto. They have
decided, well, no, it was in Toronto.

475
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,070
It was in the newspaper in Toronto.
And you know, they've decided,

476
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,620
I guess in Canada to start censoring
that song, at least in Canada. I mean,

477
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:50,940
I don't know if they do in America. I'm
sure they played on classic rock. Yeah,

478
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,120
it's tricky. It's tricky man.
Because I mean, that is a gay sex,

479
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,990
that's a gay slur and it's on
a major song that's on the TV.

480
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,230
[inaudible] I remember that was willing
to the first music videos. Yeah,

481
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,070
it was on TV. Yeah. Yeah. There
was like three d animation,
Bang it on the, uh, yes,

482
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:08,340
they did. Yeah, they told us the
popular version. Yeah, absolutely.

483
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:10,040
On the television version.
On the radio version,

484
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,080
we could look up the MTV video right now.

485
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,430
Let's look up into the idea and
what's not listened to it though,

486
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:16,850
because it's really not that.
No, no, no, no. You know,

487
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,780
they had some killer songs with,
that wasn't one of them.

488
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,560
That was just so fucking old videos
where they had like neon flashing in the

489
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:27,240
background and smile and it's like
poorly. Yeah. Dope roller girl.

490
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,730
You ever heard that song roller
girl from dire straights? No,

491
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,970
but it pulled it out from
boogie nights like that shit.

492
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:38,070
Apparently that bitch is courageous.
She just did the hangover. Yeah.

493
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,850
Yeah. Oh, that's right. She was a hooker.
Yes, but again, that's a good role. Yeah,

494
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,300
I heard she's off the charts crazy.
I love people like that.

495
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,720
It's just like knowing they're out there
dire straits or alerts. It's kind of fun

496
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:56,070
into the habit. It's got skate away. Dire
Straits. Skate away. That could be it.

497
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,970
Yeah.
Scared away.

498
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,480
All right,
let's see.

499
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,780
Skate away.
She's that girl.

500
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,693
Yeah,
this is it.

501
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,120
This is a song from my child in that
this is a song in front of this.

502
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:16,750
I mean,

503
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,590
I might've been like fucking 13 or 12
or some shit when this song was out.

504
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,470
They're brilliant musicians,
man.

505
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,620
It's like it's a different kind of
rock and roll was really big too.

506
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,780
It's not like this is some. No,
there were huge. They were huge.

507
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,600
When I was in highschool, dire
straits, we've gigantic that was gone

508
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:46,750
down the wrong way. Cool
video too. Is that a Walkman?

509
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:51,720
She has hung around that big giant man.
Please walk,

510
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,383
man.

511
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,380
Same little clues in the campsite.

512
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:05,590
[inaudible] that take [inaudible].

513
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,910
Yeah, I really feel in this song
or you guys. Yes. I love it.

514
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,700
How dare you record on these. The
skate away from me. She's ugly.

515
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,260
She's living in 1979 dudes and
they didn't make it back then.

516
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,130
They used to dress themselves up with
flowers. Clown makeup looks like,

517
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,900
you know,
she used to have to wait around.

518
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,510
This is a window to another world,
Bro. This is a different era.

519
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:51,520
That's how crazy this fucking world is
evolving and how quickly I got that big

520
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:53,020
stupid Walkman she's got on,

521
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,060
you know are giant stupid headsets.
Although stupid headsets,

522
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,070
big ones like we're wearing right
now. They've made a comeback. Yeah.

523
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,160
Because of those beats.
Dr Dre will,

524
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,580
everybody wants to pretend
they're fucking DJ. Yeah.

525
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:09,010
You know gotta get a real good
sample of this music gum soon.

526
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:11,410
I need full coverage of my ears.
I'm saying

527
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,770
like Ernie,
I got to hear the whole song.

528
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:16,670
I'm going to hit a dirty shit in the
background. I'm sure I've got the Bose.

529
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,270
Bose noise canceling. Yeah.
Airplanes. Those are dope.
Yeah. Yeah. The, the beats ones.

530
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:23,370
I have those lists.
They cancel the noise to spice.

531
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,850
I like a rap battles have moved onto
headphones now cause it's like you got the

532
00:30:26,851 --> 00:30:31,030
Dr Dre ones now and I think 50 cent has
Luda Luda just came out with his old

533
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:34,740
shit. Why not everybody shared their
own. Have I want my own headphones.

534
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,110
There'll be cool. Yeah. I
think it's an easy company.

535
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,910
Start Alien logo on the headphones.

536
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,670
You can smoke them when you're
done listening. Yeah, right.

537
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:45,870
We could store a stash like there's an
extra battery area to the show would have

538
00:30:45,871 --> 00:30:48,900
a set of those Joe Rogan headphones.
That would be weird.

539
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,550
That would be step one of the Colt. Step
one. Step two, purple Nike's. Step three,

540
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:58,710
alien logo tattooed somewhere on
your body. Step four, step five.

541
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,410
If you embraced Twitter owl,
I've heard you on that thing.

542
00:31:01,411 --> 00:31:02,590
Are you addicted to it or you,

543
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:06,430
you know what? Um, I read
a lot more than I post

544
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,920
someone's alert.
I'm not that much of a [inaudible].

545
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,340
So tell me this problem that you were
having at the comedy store that we're

546
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,183
talking about?

547
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,120
Well, you know, it's, um,

548
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,340
I guess when you stay in one place for
too long already it's with your job or

549
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:23,810
with anything else,
you just start to realize that the people,

550
00:31:23,811 --> 00:31:26,790
if you start associating with the
same people over and over again,

551
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:30,030
sometimes you need to get a little
negative. Yeah. In terms of,

552
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,910
there's always been a real
negative vibe there. And uh,

553
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,780
but the state of time is amazing
and we just were talking about,

554
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,630
yeah, that's what talking about
like you had some great times.

555
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:40,980
They're done working out.
Yeah.

556
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,780
Bear is harder than
working on anywhere else.

557
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:50,060
I think Blaine compassion, very funny
comedian said, um, if this was a comedy,

558
00:31:50,061 --> 00:31:51,350
clubs were a video game,

559
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:56,030
then the comedy store will be one on one
of the hardest level Las level, Boston,

560
00:31:56,031 --> 00:31:59,750
Yale, then then you'd go
like laugh factory Improv.

561
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,390
And then when you get down easy would
be like the UCB and all those things.

562
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,390
Cause they're very,

563
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:09,200
very supportive and like smart
and everyone's paying attention.

564
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,730
And I'm at the comedy store.
I have Russian guy's yelling out at you

565
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,150
constantly. And so, you know what
though, the sad part about the stores,

566
00:32:18,151 --> 00:32:19,620
when it reveals its true side,

567
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,850
when someone goes up who's not good and
kills someone goes up with some really

568
00:32:23,851 --> 00:32:26,800
dumb hacky shit when they
destroy and then you go,

569
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:31,630
oh you guys aren't cool. You just in
the dark. That's what I was talking.

570
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,810
Just dummies in the dark. It
sort of makes you, makes you

571
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:38,280
feel bad about yourself when you go up
and you think you had a good set and then

572
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:40,220
just the worst in the world

573
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,690
goes up fucking two,
three after you and

574
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,130
just murders, you know, that's a symptom.

575
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:49,060
That's a symptom of what you were talking
about with like to UCB will the UCP is

576
00:32:49,061 --> 00:32:52,280
very well organized. It's, they've
got a very clear ethic. Yeah.

577
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,580
They're trying to put out good art.

578
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:56,920
They're trying to put out good comments
to support it. You know, it's like,

579
00:32:56,921 --> 00:33:00,040
it's very obvious what they're up to.
And so because of that,

580
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,360
that's the kind of crowd they attract.

581
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:04,780
The comedy store is just people
are just walking by and you know,

582
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:08,710
and they've heard the name
and they stumble in and they
don't know any better or

583
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,970
they know who advertising or it could
be, hey, how magical put it on Twitter.

584
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:14,890
He's going to be the comedy store tonight.
Let's go down and check it out.

585
00:33:14,891 --> 00:33:17,230
But it's like he gets such a hodgepodge.
It is.

586
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,580
It is like a vortex of crazy
people for whatever reason.

587
00:33:21,581 --> 00:33:26,530
Crazy people are drawn to that spot.
Like I don't want to believe in energy.

588
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:30,220
I don't want to believe anything of that
fucking crystal sucking astrological

589
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:33,550
bullshit. I don't want to believe in
that. I want to take things on face value,

590
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,530
but if ever there was a fucking,

591
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,030
there was some evidence for a place
having like crazy energy and having like a

592
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:43,120
weird attraction to it.
That fucking comic store was that man.

593
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,690
I'm the same way. I feel like, uh,
I don't believe in any of that crap,

594
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:50,170
but if there was ever a
place for that to exist,

595
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:52,110
you would have to be
something you're just saying.

596
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,550
Yeah. Maybe its affects are over
exaggerated. Like it's not the only,

597
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,280
you can't only have shitty
times at a place like that.

598
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:00,680
But you know when you find out the
history of that place and you know,

599
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:04,340
but it was Bugsy Siegel's nightclub
back in that cereal. Vishen days. Yeah.

600
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,430
Dr. Rose. Yeah, they,
yeah, it who said that?

601
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:10,820
Eliza Sleshinger so they were
doing abortions in the basement.

602
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,450
But we always get into the subject.

603
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,590
But how fucking crazy that places
and how creepy it is. But they,

604
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,670
they killed people there for sure. And
maybe there's like a little shred of that.

605
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:20,370
It's still in the room.

606
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:25,140
It's no funny bone. You know, as
you know, corporate leg comedy club,

607
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:30,170
it's a little bit different than those
animated microphone microphone standing

608
00:34:30,871 --> 00:34:31,350
in the back.

609
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,860
Yeah. Showing you who's coming up
next week. And that's the other thing.

610
00:34:34,861 --> 00:34:36,690
When you get used to being in other clubs,

611
00:34:36,691 --> 00:34:40,290
you get used to like working for the
Improv and you see how fucking organized

612
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:40,920
they are.

613
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,680
They know when they have posters of guys
that are going to be there next week

614
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:47,190
and you know, with supporting acts. And
the show times and they have a, you know,

615
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:48,630
online where you can buy tickets.

616
00:34:48,631 --> 00:34:51,900
It's all on the poster and they're just
like way in advance. You go to the store,

617
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,130
there's a piece of paper that fucking
Tommy's got spilled coffee on, you know,

618
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,590
and it has everybody's name written on it,
you know?

619
00:34:58,591 --> 00:35:01,260
And if you call in and you ask,
well who's up tonight? The light.

620
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,770
Um, um, who's, uh,
where's the fucking list?

621
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,690
Um, it's like nobody, nobody knows what's
going on so you can caulk snail too.

622
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,420
But at one point in time, yeah, he wants
to know if you're sucking cocks too.

623
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,980
Cause what he asked Brian Cox
and I get off stage and he goes,

624
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,660
you still can cook snow to

625
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:25,510
Joe Rogen fucking went off on me like a
good set and I get off to and Tommy and

626
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:30,460
he just goes crazy on me just saying I
was gay and now he's using the comedy

627
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:35,461
store and I was a spy and sucking
dicks and just fucking nuts.

628
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,993
Yeah.

629
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,340
Well what's funny is that
been greeted like that ever.

630
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:47,280
I know it's bad and what sucked is like,
cool.

631
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,790
What's funny is I got off stage and
I was just feeling so happy and good,

632
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:54,450
and then when he did that to me and I was
like, oh, why are you doing this to me?

633
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,400
But I guess you'll do dude. He
bows killed you. Yeah. After,

634
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,130
after talking to a lot of comics,

635
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:02,700
I guess that's just what he does and
he's trying to scare you into thing.

636
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,690
So he's doing it using
intimidation tactics. Yeah. Yeah.

637
00:36:05,691 --> 00:36:08,840
It's so you just swung on him. It's like,
dude does that. You just swung on him.

638
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:12,200
You put your Dick in his face. I just
pull your dick out. You hold them down,

639
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,000
you pull your dick out and
just rub it all over his face.

640
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:18,890
Don't you ever fucking do that to me
again? I thought like that constantly.

641
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:22,670
That's what it makes me sure of danger. I
just got to go in, develop a good mount.

642
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,100
I just got to go and do
my job and get the phone.

643
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:30,350
I'm tired of fucking like rubbing
your Dick on his face. No. Yeah. Well,

644
00:36:30,351 --> 00:36:33,290
there's a lot of negative energy
in that place. You know the,

645
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,480
what you were talking about before
that you don't want to talk about.

646
00:36:35,481 --> 00:36:40,481
Obviously there's a new comedy thief and
at the comedy store and a guy that got

647
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:44,870
kicked out of the hall cafe and he's
another one of these guys that's blatantly

648
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:48,390
on purpose looking to steal
people's material and use it. Yeah.

649
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,680
But I have to be very clear and uh,

650
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,830
I don't even want to get
involved. I know. I hear Ya.

651
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,520
Can I have you got to
bring the guy's name up?

652
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,890
We don't have to bring us down.
That's not the issue.

653
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:01,380
What I was talking about was how the
club, um, justified it and now they,

654
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,330
they actually told you when you brought
the guy's name up that he's not bad

655
00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:09,070
looking on the eyes. Yeah. That's
actually a Tommy quilt, right? Yeah.

656
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,360
Whoopsies sorry.

657
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,470
Yeah, this is what he said to me. Some of
your comic now and I said, yeah, I try.

658
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,740
And he goes, are you working for Joe
Rogan still? Yeah, I still work for him.

659
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,840
You saw cock now too.
And then I

660
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,280
put together if you can repeat that and
working for jewelry. And Brian said, yeah.

661
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,510
I said, yeah, it's like two Cox,
three, four Cox and then five times.

662
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,760
And then he goes,
you come with me at this criticisms.

663
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:37,360
You go onstage and you worked for the
phony fuck. And it's just like, what?

664
00:37:37,361 --> 00:37:41,860
Where's this coming from? Just really
took the wrong size in the sole thing.

665
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,500
It's about them making the wrong
choices. Uh, you know, just threw out.

666
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,280
If they gave me a lot of
statements, negative energy, man,

667
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:53,250
that's why they have to do it.
They're sucked into their own suck.

668
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,000
But then I got my ankle
weights and I want to go.

669
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,160
I can where you don't have to though.
It's not necessary. I, you know, I,

670
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,520
my aunt got a lot better.
As soon as I stopped being there,

671
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,040
I got less angry and I think some of my,

672
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:08,700
like comedy was being formed
by the energy in that place.

673
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,120
There's a lot of great things about
that place, but it's also, it's dark.

674
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,640
I love hanging out there. I love it just
because of the people. But you know,

675
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:19,000
other than that, if they all hung out at
fucking waffle house, I'd be there. Brian,

676
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:19,390
he married. Yeah. Tell

677
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,250
Him we were filming and then hooker came
back and just wanted to start talking

678
00:38:22,251 --> 00:38:25,470
to us about the business and how she
meets guys and how she sets it up. Yeah,

679
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,550
it was pretty crazy, man. Out
of nowhere, this girl just,

680
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:33,110
she came up to us and she seemed,
you know, like fairly normal. Right.

681
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,640
She didn't seem totally crazy
you. She was just, you know,

682
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,490
having a good time like everybody else
and then she starts talking about being a

683
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:41,200
hooker. Yeah, it's crazy.

684
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:44,950
I run into hookers a lot more often
than I thought it would ever run into

685
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:46,480
hookers.
Just like talk.

686
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:49,180
They just come up and start talking to
you and they act normal and they don't

687
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:50,530
say that they're a hooker.
You Think,

688
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,050
oh this girl is talking to me
and they suddenly see slips in a,

689
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,570
and then he little hooker. The world.
The world that you travel in though,

690
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:00,070
you travel in a very interesting world.

691
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,610
I mean if you looked at your life from
any other part of the world, you know,

692
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:05,710
you take some guy from Idaho
and say, Hey, I'm going to,

693
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:08,080
I'm going to hang out with this guy.
What are you going to do today? Well,

694
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:10,330
I'm going to hang out with this girl.
She's a penthouse pet of the year.

695
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:13,390
We're going to go to this porn awards
party and then we're going to go to the

696
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,690
improv where there's a naughty show and
a bunch of porn stars are going to go up,

697
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,250
and then I'm gonna hang out with some
standup comedian friends of mine and we're

698
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:24,251
going to smoke a lot of pot and
let him fuck is this is your life.

699
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,660
I want to go crazy, man. Do you
mind if I tag along? I said, sit,

700
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:32,750
have gone to college, I guess. Yeah.
Then you'd be out of word. Sure. To do.

701
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,800
Look into your life and
music. How did I end up? Yeah,

702
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,230
but that's why there's so many
hookers in your life as well.

703
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:40,800
I'm trying to tell Ya,
you're traveling in strange circles.

704
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:45,220
Definitely hooker material, not there's
anything. We're all being a hooker man.

705
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,970
Buddy of mine was talking to me about
this time massage place that he goes to

706
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,990
and uh, they give you a real time massage
and then they jerk you off. And he,

707
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:56,830
he talked about it like, like it
was the greatest meal, you know,

708
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:58,400
like I would talk to you about like a,

709
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:02,140
a certain steak house that knows exactly
how to fucking cook a good piece of

710
00:40:02,141 --> 00:40:05,230
meat when you cut into that medium,
Maria and the outside,

711
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:10,231
it's just crispy but the inside is juicy
and delicious and warm and the fucking

712
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,660
blood from the meat just
fires up your synapses.

713
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:18,060
That's how this guy talked about getting
jerked up by this Thai lady while I was

714
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,110
talking about it. Like it's the
most amazing thing. He goes,

715
00:40:20,111 --> 00:40:22,930
somebody told me to go to this place.
I didn't think, you know, like that.

716
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,570
It was that kind of place cause
it looked like a real place.

717
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,300
And he goes and I go
in there and I'm going,

718
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,900
well obviously I'm not going to pull my
pants down because this is a legit place.

719
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:34,660
I'm getting a real massage.
Like they giving them a real massage.

720
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:39,100
They're stretching them out there,
rubbing them down, elbows in muscles,

721
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:41,570
loosening all the things. He's like, I'm
getting a little bit chipped massage.

722
00:40:41,571 --> 00:40:44,590
There's no way. The same broad
jerk me off. And then at the end,

723
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:47,970
after like 40 minutes of that, she's
like, so does that feel good to you?

724
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,660
He's like, get the fuck Outta here. This
is a fantasy. She starts rubbing his leg.

725
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:55,420
Yeah. You know, do you want
anything more? Do anything more.

726
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:58,930
And the next thing you know, she like
glances over his Dick and he arches his,

727
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:02,410
his back like towards her hand and she
glances over his dick and then she just

728
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:05,450
gets that the green light. She gets
a hold of it, pulls out the lotion,

729
00:41:05,451 --> 00:41:10,390
starts rubbing his balls, jerks him
off, Bam. Done. Wow. It's like 40 bucks.

730
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,430
Wow. Sorry. Shit chick turned
to me. I was just, uh, you know,

731
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,020
she's going to ask you if you want to,
you know,

732
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:20,220
extra parts because there's a lot of
them to Abby charge more, you know, like,

733
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:24,740
so she knows me, she goes means and he
goes, do you want me to make banana cry?

734
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:28,330
Whoa, whoa. Hey, what are
you fucking say to me?

735
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:32,970
I know banana feels bad about himself
just being in here. Banana cried.

736
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:37,400
She offered, yeah. Opposite Banana
cry. And you said No. Well, you know,

737
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,040
uh, since haven't, uh, yeah,

738
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:45,020
my daughters would have spoiled me for
a lot of fucking porn to right a little

739
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:49,310
bit. Yeah. Me a lot. Strip clubs, porn,
all that. It's not the same anymore.

740
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,540
Now it's not. I mean, it used to be,
I used it all the time. I'd be there.

741
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:55,080
You have babies, you look at them. And I,

742
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,760
I used to look at him as this is a really
hot check. Like, wow, look at that body.

743
00:41:58,761 --> 00:42:02,570
Look at that ass now I go,
why is she dancing? Probably
Cause her dad didn't love.

744
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,480
Yeah. Yeah. And I'm gonna live my day and
I thought I'm going to be a better dad.

745
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,760
Yeah,
I'm trying also.

746
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,830
Yeah, you really think about, and
also the germ factor and shit too.

747
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:14,240
Like these chicks are rubbing up on
fucking all these dudes. I can't,

748
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:18,440
when I go to a con, if they tried to put
you in a comedy Kondo, I would start.

749
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,530
I won't allow it because I started
thinking about fucking Mark Curry.

750
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,980
Probably one out on the couch.
Curry.

751
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,300
Why Marcher hanging with Mr [inaudible]
and you look at the lineup and you go,

752
00:42:28,301 --> 00:42:31,840
oh my God, that guy was fucking here. Mark
Crowe would be the least of my worries.

753
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,640
She's a cool dude. Yeah,
no I love my career,

754
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,890
but I'm just using him as an example
of somebody just randomly in,

755
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,220
oh go with Barry diamond.
Hurry diamond. Just

756
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,510
applying tanning cream. He didn't
go out. So use your brother.

757
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:51,620
What's his dark fucking Mahogany
looking deck? Cause you can never,

758
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,940
never has lotion. So you guys do
use tanning loads. Those Shit, man.

759
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,920
Black Orange is like a giant carrot.

760
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,210
Lupa Lupa orange reds.
Really dirty carrot.

761
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:11,260
Yeah. There's always that one dude that
could have stayed more comedy porno.

762
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,000
I think.
I know there is some of it,

763
00:43:13,001 --> 00:43:15,820
but I don't know how many people want
to want you to know. Surprise comics,

764
00:43:15,821 --> 00:43:17,290
mixed comedy in Porno together.

765
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,800
This face Thomas Ward who
does a fantastic bill,

766
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:24,070
cause bill Cosby was a in
a couple of porins right.

767
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:27,950
Not to be type where he
didn't bang anybody, but you
know he does his background.

768
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,040
Thomas Ward is another one.
Man,

769
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:34,030
I got that guy introduced that got in
my manager in many, many years ago.

770
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:37,660
Cause I was like this kid
has got something and he's
like real raw and he's got

771
00:43:37,661 --> 00:43:40,960
a good way of looking at things and
he's fucking just a natural on stage.

772
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:45,730
But for whatever reason
just doesn't happen. Didn't,
didn't click with him. Yeah.

773
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,570
You know, kind of ways. So God
damn tricky. Yeah. You know,

774
00:43:49,571 --> 00:43:53,110
it's like you pick the wrong wave.
You're, you're not in the right mindset.

775
00:43:53,111 --> 00:43:55,900
You know, you're not, he can never
really get your life in order.

776
00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:58,120
Whatever the fuck it is that
keeps you from getting it right.

777
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,340
There's a lot of guys that we know,
you know Holtzman,

778
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:03,440
his name comes up all the
time. Yeah. But it's like he

779
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:07,000
just allowing yourself not
to get distracted and just
staying on point, you know,

780
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:08,980
holds funds kind of job that he works.

781
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:12,580
I think he was a mechanic
for aircraft at some point.

782
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,810
And so he's got all these
other life distractions and
you gotta be fucking on it.

783
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,100
If you want to go get something,

784
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:21,610
you've gotta be on it 100% and I
think these guys are half ass in it.

785
00:44:21,611 --> 00:44:24,820
They got themselves to a position,
a comfort. See that's the happen.

786
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:27,890
What happens with any sort of fucking
dream is you get yourself to a point and

787
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:31,440
you're like, oh, you should sacrificing
by like compromising and go, oh,

788
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:35,730
I don't really need fucking that. I'm
happy with this. And you get just,

789
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:37,530
Richard reached a point where you settled,
you know,

790
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,650
you don't give a shit anymore. So
you're just like, I'm cool with this.

791
00:44:40,651 --> 00:44:43,890
This is a great life right here.
I can just fucking stop trying.

792
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:45,210
And I got this and then

793
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:49,500
what I did, man. Yeah. When I was on
news radio did, I didn't write anything.

794
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,570
And here's one reason,
one of the things that turned it around,

795
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:56,520
I did sets and when I would do these sets
I would basically do the same fucking

796
00:44:56,521 --> 00:44:59,490
material that I had had for
years and years and years before.

797
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,700
I would just go up on the weekends cause
it was easy because it was something to

798
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:04,350
do. You know, I hadn't,

799
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,980
I had this TV show so I was doing the TV
show all the time and the weekends I'd

800
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,200
only been in la at year.
I didn't really know that many people.

801
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:12,630
So my social life was
going to the comedy clubs.

802
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,770
So I would go up and I want you to do
the same act pretty much just over and

803
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:19,790
over and over again. Nobody knew who I
was. I didn't have any responsibility.

804
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:20,640
I don't have any fans.

805
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:25,200
I know responsibility to give them
new shit and I lost my feeling for it.

806
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,320
Like it wasn't really any more to me.
I wasn't,

807
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:30,780
I wasn't in the comedy mode for real.
It's like,

808
00:45:30,781 --> 00:45:35,310
cause I was just reiterating the same
shit. And a few writers from the TV show,

809
00:45:35,311 --> 00:45:38,820
from news radio came to see me at the
comedy store and I had a really late night

810
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:39,440
set.

811
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,690
It was really late night in the main room
when you have those late nights at the

812
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:46,620
main room, the energy just gets sucked
out of the room where there's nothing,

813
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:51,390
and I went on like next to last and
I ate a dick. I just was, I was,

814
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:52,570
I felt like wow.

815
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:56,940
Saying it that what I was saying was
stupid and it just felt empty to me.

816
00:45:56,941 --> 00:46:00,690
I could feel reciting the words. Yeah,
I could feel them feeling bad for me.

817
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,690
I could feel them judging me
and not liking what they see.

818
00:46:03,691 --> 00:46:07,050
I just did not have it. I just wasn't
in the groove. And then I realized,

819
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,730
I'm like slacking, like I'm not really
writing. I'm not really performing.

820
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:13,630
I'm putting any effort into
it for over a year for, oh,

821
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,470
maybe it might've been two years
for over a year at least I,

822
00:46:16,471 --> 00:46:19,860
I just would go up and do the same
fucking tired shit over and over again.

823
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,250
But that bad set made
me completely refocused.

824
00:46:23,251 --> 00:46:27,930
And then like within a year
I did my first CD cause I,

825
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,240
I just started going crazy.
Then I would go to the stand up.

826
00:46:30,241 --> 00:46:32,580
I would do it every night.
I was doing it every to every night.

827
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,520
I was doing it at the laugh factory and
the Improv and I was just trying to get

828
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:37,710
in as many sets as I couldn't
write as much new shit as I could.

829
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,110
I just realized that like you
can't just keep doing this anymore

830
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:44,340
point that goes off and then
you're just trying to, I try to um,

831
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,080
work new stuff in constant.

832
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,060
Yeah, I'm always adding just little
chunks here and there and he,

833
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,260
not even a whole new bit,

834
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:54,600
but just adding to the old shit that I
have and always growing and evolving.

835
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:57,520
So that's why I have a hard time
putting out bits too quickly. Like,

836
00:46:57,521 --> 00:46:59,860
if you do something and then you know,
you put it out,

837
00:46:59,861 --> 00:47:02,590
you put out like a DVD and in the next
year you want to do another one like

838
00:47:02,591 --> 00:47:07,330
Louis C K is doing, which is, you know,
really super ambitious. But in my,

839
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,750
like what's in my career,
like the things that I've done,

840
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:11,950
they've always gotten way,
way,

841
00:47:11,951 --> 00:47:15,940
way better as I kept doing them like
over a long period of time and sort of

842
00:47:15,941 --> 00:47:19,420
completely tweaked them and got
them to the place where, you know,

843
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:23,260
I have just a the right punch lines
in the right places, the right set up,

844
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,440
the right, you know, think about the
right material to do before you do it,

845
00:47:26,441 --> 00:47:26,820
you know?

846
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,370
Yeah. I got an album then I just
put out and a, I felt exactly

847
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:33,430
the same way when I locked
it. You're like, Oh shit,

848
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,380
you know that and a couple jokes.

849
00:47:35,381 --> 00:47:38,560
I'm trying just not to do any of that
stuff anymore so it won't feel bad about

850
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:42,400
it. I'm just put it away. But
um, yeah, once I do it, yeah,

851
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,970
I think that's how you have to do it.
I've,

852
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:47,230
I've filled Berness Bellbird
does that. What does he do? He,

853
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:51,520
once he does it on TV or on an album,
it goes bye bye and just starts fresh.

854
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:55,000
Well that's the Louis CK way too. That's
what Louise doing, you know. And I think,

855
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:58,930
um, I think you have to do that. You
know, if you really want to keep moving,

856
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:02,320
there's no way you can just do the same
thing for it to a few bits of people

857
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:04,380
call them out.
Like when I do a Q and a sometimes in,

858
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:08,890
especially for about a couple of car.
Yeah. And I'm pretty on it, but um,

859
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,870
you know, it's, um, that's the,

860
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,350
the hardest part about comedies just
to keep that momentum going and keep

861
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:18,760
finding out new and interesting things
to talk about. Yeah, I know. Now it's,

862
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,430
it's tough, um, to, you know,
just let it go on it, man. No Way.

863
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:28,390
It's so hard to stay like, grow
attached to some bits to you. Yeah, man,

864
00:48:28,391 --> 00:48:31,960
there's some good ones. Fucking
love my bit about tigers. Fucking,

865
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:35,440
I used to love doing it.
I still love everything about it.

866
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:38,680
That's my favorite bit of all time,
but like all of them,

867
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,140
there's got to be, sorry, make
the tough decision. Put it behind.

868
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:46,820
You were talking about how bill bird,
just um,

869
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:51,910
every single time he did something
on TV or on an album goes gone.

870
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,930
Just because it starts fresh.
Complete him. That's, that's the,

871
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:57,010
that's the George Carlin way.
You know,

872
00:48:57,011 --> 00:49:02,010
George Carlin's style of doing comedy
and Louis C K adopted it and bill burrs

873
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,980
pretty much doing it too. You know,
it's the way to do it. Just keep him,

874
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,090
keep pounding out.
Shit.

875
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,340
Just very hard to do when you're
doing other things as well. Yeah.

876
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:12,050
That's what we were talking about
earlier is you get stuck on a TV show and

877
00:49:12,051 --> 00:49:14,790
you're working a lot and then cranking.

878
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,370
I mean it's hard to get to
sleep and shit too. Yeah.

879
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,880
Would you recommend comedy to people?
Like if you,

880
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:24,510
like if your child wants it to
be a comic, would you say, Hey,

881
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:27,240
I would recommend comedy or
would you scare people away?

882
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,150
Was already asked what he
wants to be when he grows up.

883
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:34,450
I knew you looked at a group
of your legacy. I just want
to tell jokes. He goes,

884
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:39,420
uh, why wouldn't you recommend one
of the great jobs all the time?

885
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:42,840
I mean, I get to write, I've written
for a couple of other people, you know,

886
00:49:42,841 --> 00:49:45,750
and just, I have a great time. Just,
you know, doing what I'm doing.

887
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,900
You seem to think that you wouldn't
Brian then what you're saying?

888
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:52,810
Well, I, I, I don't know if
I would or wouldn't. Um, I,

889
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,230
I do see just being in it how,

890
00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:00,260
how competitive it is and how it really
is hard to get to a certain point of

891
00:50:00,721 --> 00:50:05,150
where you can survive, uh,
like, like higher up then,

892
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:08,940
then didn't like the normal comic.
Like there's so many really good comics,

893
00:50:08,941 --> 00:50:12,540
but they seem like they all
get to a certain level and
then they kind of balance

894
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:15,180
off, you know, where, yeah,
they're making money and stuff,

895
00:50:15,181 --> 00:50:17,910
but a lot of them are still kind
of struggling here and there.

896
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,420
But it seems like it's really hard to
get to the next level where you're just

897
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:23,130
like, you know, you use the base

898
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,680
analogy or any pro football or
anything like that, any sporting thing.

899
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:28,130
It's like know certain amount

900
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,310
of people get certain distance in the,
you know,

901
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:34,730
there's levels of professional and
people just climb up that level of

902
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:35,350
professional.

903
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:38,380
There's a lot of different things to
think about cause it's not just being a

904
00:50:38,381 --> 00:50:41,500
comedian and being funny.
It's also the marketing of yourself,

905
00:50:41,501 --> 00:50:44,620
which is very alien from the
creative aspect of stand up comedy.

906
00:50:44,621 --> 00:50:47,900
So it's real tricky. Like what gets you
to the next level is a lot of times,

907
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:50,740
so has nothing to do with your proficiency
as a comedian. Right. You know,

908
00:50:50,741 --> 00:50:53,440
there's a lot of comedians that we know
of that, you know, they're really good,

909
00:50:53,441 --> 00:50:56,110
they're really solid, but for whatever
reason they never enter into the,

910
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,120
oh you're talking about Brian Holtzman is,
yeah.

911
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,200
Your example Zeitgeisty never accepts them
for whatever reason. Nothing. You know,

912
00:51:02,201 --> 00:51:04,750
they, they never figured out
how to get promoted correctly.

913
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,090
And also they sabotaged your own

914
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:09,650
career. I mean, did you hear? I remember,
I don't even know I have the story right.

915
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:13,600
But Holtzman jumping into Martin Lawrence
came into the audience and he Holtzman

916
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,020
had people there to see him.

917
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:19,280
It was a big deal and he was finally
going to get a shot and then Martin

918
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,880
Lawrence is bouncer came in and said
something and yeah, I guess, uh, Holtzman,

919
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,710
he just looks and says fuck it and
just jumps in and they, I guess, uh,

920
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:30,630
the bouncer just knocks and
ride out and fucking walk.

921
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,690
Claton seven right in front
of all of these people.

922
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,710
Yeah. Again, I think what was was
Martin Lawrence was heckling. Yeah.

923
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:41,660
And Brian Holtzman was on stage and
Martin Lawrence was heckling and Martin

924
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,450
Lawrence went offstage and was saint
lanes. John, but this is Martin Lawrence.

925
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:45,021
Can you believe this?

926
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:48,200
I'm getting heckled by mind lawns and
the bouncer gets up and punches him.

927
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,940
He's so serious. Yeah. Can't
too close to that. Yeah.

928
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,620
He has a stuff like that happens.

929
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:56,270
All right. It sucks. I was calm.

930
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,730
Lettow would have taken off if he had
been around agents and managers and stuff

931
00:51:59,731 --> 00:52:00,990
too.
That's the other thing about the store.

932
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,360
No one's going there to hang
out because they have to pay.

933
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,380
If you go to the Improv and everybody
gets in free, you know, managers, agents,

934
00:52:07,381 --> 00:52:07,981
they're all hanging out.

935
00:52:07,981 --> 00:52:11,070
There used to be an issue to try
to get people to come in, you know,

936
00:52:11,071 --> 00:52:13,550
like put them on the list to
come see people, you know,

937
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,040
it'd be hard and people couldn't just
couldn't show up. Hey, I'm Mike from IBM.

938
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:19,710
Can we come in and see the show? They were
like, yeah, sure. 20 bucks each pitch.

939
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,180
When you're saying about the marketing,

940
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,650
I think it's also, it's um, that
book, uh, that Malcolm Gladwell book,

941
00:52:24,651 --> 00:52:28,400
the outliers years. He then
either where it's very good, uh,

942
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:32,690
but it talks about people not being
able to express themselves. Like, um,

943
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,680
there was a story of a genius just
kid just, I mean went to Iowa state,

944
00:52:36,681 --> 00:52:38,540
but there's,
mom didn't turn in his paperwork.

945
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:43,550
They were just sort of dumb about speaking
to people and his kid was there and

946
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:44,750
didn't go talk to anybody.

947
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,450
Clearly they wanted him at the school
and what are going to keep them at the

948
00:52:47,451 --> 00:52:48,284
school.

949
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:53,290
But all he had to do was know to go and
talk to somebody or like people are just

950
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,230
socially unable

951
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,750
and how he didn't talk to anybody and yeah

952
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:02,030
he does. You know he's a manager
somewhere or does this kid has the guy,

953
00:53:02,031 --> 00:53:05,080
has the man is the highest
Iq the almost imagined,

954
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:08,800
well there was some guy that get tested
like for the highest Iq ever in America

955
00:53:08,801 --> 00:53:09,700
and he was a bouncer.

956
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,820
There was a bouncer in long island or
something like that and it was a really

957
00:53:12,821 --> 00:53:15,760
weird back cause he was like really kind
of full of himself a bit and like we

958
00:53:15,761 --> 00:53:16,810
would talk about things,

959
00:53:16,811 --> 00:53:19,410
he would talk about things like really
pompous and you just going to go,

960
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,300
hey back the fuck up. You're a
bouncer dude. Like what did you,

961
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,830
if you are so smart and it's
fucking smug everything,

962
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,670
what are you out there swimming in the
human condition every day as a bouncer,

963
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:31,860
getting to know the dark side of humanity.
Are you,

964
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:36,270
what do you fucking Charles Bukowski poet
type character or are you the smartest

965
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:39,140
man in the world? Cause something, there's
a disconnect there fella. You know,

966
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:43,200
you're, you're living life like a dummy.
Not, not that bouncers are dummies.

967
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,570
I know a lot of guys that are bouncers.
I came and they guys,

968
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:47,640
good job that a lot of power had bouncers.

969
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,250
You get power and you do don't do shit.

970
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:50,851
Yeah,
but I mean,

971
00:53:50,851 --> 00:53:54,000
why would you do that if you're a
fucking super genius and you're like 40,

972
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:54,720
all right.
You know,

973
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,710
it's not like he's some 20 year old
kid paying for his college education.

974
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:02,430
Some money on the weekends. No, he's
fucking 40 year old genius character.

975
00:54:02,431 --> 00:54:06,760
Working as a bouncer is services
should be used elsewhere. Totally.

976
00:54:06,761 --> 00:54:11,160
Like if he's that so I can smart, let's
give him more socially. There's the needs.

977
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:15,570
Social intelligence needs to be factored
into the whole idea of intelligence.

978
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,051
You know,

979
00:54:16,051 --> 00:54:20,690
your Iq design include your ability to
fucking maneuver around human beings.

980
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:25,130
And then a similar kid with a
big upgrade. Uh, you know, uh,

981
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:29,180
really wealthy upbringing that
had the same Iq went, you know,

982
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,670
that many times further, you know,
his life and became this great. Yeah,

983
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:37,130
I had a friend when I was living in New
York who was a pool hustler. Uh, and uh,

984
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:41,990
he was a a brilliant guy. Um,
not just socially. He's like,

985
00:54:41,991 --> 00:54:43,820
you had a brilliant
mathematical mind as well.

986
00:54:43,821 --> 00:54:47,390
But he was the first guy that I'd ever
met socially that would like look for

987
00:54:47,391 --> 00:54:52,040
traits in someone, look for things
that people are doing, look for ego,

988
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:54,530
things like he could do
impressions of people,

989
00:54:54,531 --> 00:54:56,930
like really good impressions of him.
They wouldn't sound like the person,

990
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,290
but it would be exactly the type of shit
at that person would say because he's

991
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:04,250
always analyzing people's personalities
and looking for weaknesses. You know,

992
00:55:04,251 --> 00:55:07,430
I did not know until I met this guy that
people were out there that did that,

993
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:11,360
that like would look for a weakness and
how in your game look for weakness and

994
00:55:11,361 --> 00:55:13,970
how you talk,
look for weakness and how you behave.

995
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:17,330
And then they find that little spot
and that's where they start picking.

996
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,480
They start picking on whatever got
you to say that in the first place.

997
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:22,410
Whatever got you to stand up for yourself,
whatever.

998
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:26,000
Got you to make an excuse about something
that happened and it was kind of sick

999
00:55:26,001 --> 00:55:28,430
that day. Normally that would never
go down like that. Oh really? Yeah.

1000
00:55:28,431 --> 00:55:32,330
Normally you're the best, right? The best
ever. Like he would just find the spot,

1001
00:55:32,331 --> 00:55:36,200
find whatever it was and just start
picking his opportunity. Yeah,

1002
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:38,300
they're out there man.
Fuck gathering out there man.

1003
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,330
But that's a lot of what comedy is too.
It's finding that little,

1004
00:55:41,331 --> 00:55:42,850
that little spot,
the fun,

1005
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:45,080
seeing that little thing that
other people might not have saw

1006
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:47,001
now in San.

1007
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:52,001
Then also getting that out and reflecting
that in a creative way that has not

1008
00:55:52,241 --> 00:55:55,150
really been done before too. And you
don't want to fucking go regurgitate.

1009
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:57,520
So another old and tired shit.
I know.

1010
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:01,360
So it's also like there's a couple of
rules in place where not only have you had

1011
00:56:01,361 --> 00:56:02,860
that thought and found that opportunity,

1012
00:56:02,861 --> 00:56:06,340
but now you've got to put this through
this filtering process to determine

1013
00:56:06,341 --> 00:56:08,490
whether or not it's okay to
fucking make it up on stage.

1014
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,360
Yeah. And then there's the saying
that the right way and you know,

1015
00:56:12,361 --> 00:56:16,130
figuring out the best shot of me of
words. Yeah. There's like a lyric cool

1016
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:20,520
aspect to it at that point to now you're
in putting shit together. Like, um,

1017
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:24,070
you know, I try to do that a lot in
one of act when I'm talking about,

1018
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:29,070
and I actually tell that whole banana
cry story on stage as a bit and leading

1019
00:56:31,781 --> 00:56:33,050
into it and I said,
this is the way,

1020
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:34,510
I don't believe that you
didn't get jerked off.

1021
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,100
I just want you to know I love you.
But yeah, keep saying what you said.

1022
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:43,180
You don't have to say anything.
Keep going. Oh, sorry.
Go ahead. So, um, the uh,

1023
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,050
banana cry lady,
I goes,

1024
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,280
this is not the first time I found myself
in an English as a second language,

1025
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:51,190
sexy talk situation. You know,
and so I say shit like that,

1026
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:55,760
so I has to come out like it
can be lyrical at the same time.

1027
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,030
You can use alliteration and
fuck around with it from there.

1028
00:56:58,031 --> 00:57:00,610
So then you got to put it through all
these steps and then it finally makes it

1029
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:05,480
out. And that's why they're tough
to give up her baby and ARD.

1030
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,330
Yeah.
They're like your babies man.

1031
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,900
So when she'd get good at them
and get them all tightened,

1032
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:12,730
you know exactly how to hit them and they
have all these fucking punchlines one

1033
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:15,020
after the other bang,
Bang, Bang, Bang. You know,

1034
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:18,800
that was the Boston style of
comedy to Boston. Um, the,

1035
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,850
the best guys for whatever reason,
didn't really write new material.

1036
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:26,860
They just had a gang of
stuff driving, stating, yeah.

1037
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,230
Like if you understood that like
that you just go out and just,

1038
00:57:29,231 --> 00:57:32,980
they're just crushing. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. There's guys like that.

1039
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,110
It's harder to do now though,
because of the Internet.

1040
00:57:35,111 --> 00:57:37,800
It's just not the same thing.
You know when people and be,

1041
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,590
these guys didn't have
cds out so it could,

1042
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:42,840
people couldn't go and replay there bits.
You had to go see it again. You know,

1043
00:57:42,841 --> 00:57:45,190
you couldn't play it over and over
again. So it's like, you know,

1044
00:57:45,191 --> 00:57:49,660
you know the exact timing
from the punchline comes and
it's not like that people

1045
00:57:49,661 --> 00:57:52,430
are still going out though. I
mean, yeah, comedy is still the,

1046
00:57:52,431 --> 00:57:54,430
the most fun thing for me to go see.
You know,

1047
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,710
if I know that Stan helps
kind of perform or you know,

1048
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,920
Lucy case in town or you know,
Nick Depaulo or something,

1049
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,890
someone that I really think is really
funny. I love fucking have a great time.

1050
00:58:02,891 --> 00:58:04,900
It's still the most fun thing to see.
Who are you saying?

1051
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:08,710
Last night was at the Hollywood Improv,
Stan hope was there.

1052
00:58:08,711 --> 00:58:13,330
David Tell Ron White, uh,
Nick Swardson, Doug Benson.

1053
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:18,830
It was just like never ending and it's
also just a fun hang to [inaudible].

1054
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:21,760
That's the difference between
that place in the store.

1055
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:25,590
Like I never realized that
there's managers that were
actually happy to see you

1056
00:58:25,591 --> 00:58:28,840
there. Well and thankful. Can we get
you a water? Do you want to drink?

1057
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:30,790
Did you like something? Are
you hungry? Do you want to eat?

1058
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:34,450
They got a menu in their hand. They have
good food there. Great Burgers and shit.

1059
00:58:34,451 --> 00:58:37,460
Everyone's friendly. The wait, staff's
friendly. The bar tenders friendly.

1060
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:38,463
There's a bar.

1061
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,290
Everybody sits down and has a good
time at the bar and then there's a back

1062
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:46,090
showroom.
Barter Summers are also the Eddies Deva.

1063
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,620
Yeah, they're great. Great. Had
been to the south sessionals
down the street sales.

1064
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,640
No, I want to go there. Oh, that's a
shit stop by sometimes. Salad Listener.

1065
00:58:54,641 --> 00:58:57,090
And do you know if we're in contact?
I don't know. We'll get you in there.

1066
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,710
Don't worry. We'll get you in
there. We did it a Sunday night.

1067
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:03,190
It was fucking awesome, man. Just talked
about it on Twitter. Sunday place.

1068
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:07,210
It's a real small place. So let's see.
It's like 70 at the all right now.

1069
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,860
But they're also have two more showrooms.

1070
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:11,230
They've got a whole back
area that's gigantic.

1071
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,130
They're going to blow out and build this
like huge 300 seat room back there at

1072
00:59:15,131 --> 00:59:17,860
300 seats. Right. Well there's two
rooms. I think they're going to split it.

1073
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:19,570
I think he should just
build one huge room.

1074
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:23,450
I don't know why I keep this small room
in the front and then make a big one,

1075
00:59:23,451 --> 00:59:25,840
but I guess he's doing like
an Improv room of like uh,

1076
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:30,260
80 and then a bigger room 150 or
something like that. Improv like,

1077
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:33,990
like Improv, like that's shit like
gimme a topic, that kind of Shit.

1078
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,730
What kind of like the like you know like
the side room at the improv where he

1079
00:59:37,731 --> 00:59:41,720
does his show. You know what I mean? Like
like a workout Improv. I don't know. Hmm.

1080
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,940
Yeah. Well hey maybe not.
Maybe, maybe you could do it.

1081
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:46,650
Look the comedy store was three
rooms. Yeah. Forever. You know,

1082
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:48,770
if this guy can actually pull
off three rooms and that spot,

1083
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:51,440
he's got the perfect
attitude. He's like, you know,

1084
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:55,520
sounds like one of those guys that you
hope would come along and open up a

1085
00:59:55,521 --> 00:59:59,600
comedy club. A guy who really loves
comedy. He's a really fun guy and he's,

1086
00:59:59,601 --> 01:00:01,760
he's willing to take some chances
as business sense as well.

1087
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:03,230
That is exactly what he's doing.

1088
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:07,640
And he bought this place and right now
it's got a front area where there's a bar

1089
01:00:07,641 --> 01:00:10,340
and a bunch of seeds and that's what
we performed Sunday where there's a

1090
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:14,690
backyard. This is like old school bakery
and it's been a bakery like forever.

1091
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:18,260
And uh,
apparently he's gonna take over that.

1092
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:21,170
And what was it before
the Big Deanna Cafe?

1093
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:26,530
It's a cafe with a big yellow awning.
It's on Melrose, says Vienna cafe.

1094
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:31,280
Doesn't say sounds comical. He's like
tried to like, you know, like Vianna cafe.

1095
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:33,550
Oh, it doesn't exist anymore,
but come on, we're going to show

1096
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,500
phase it in slowly.
He was telling me,

1097
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:41,330
he was telling me a funny Stan hope a
bit earth story last night when he had a

1098
01:00:41,331 --> 01:00:45,560
club in New York. Uh, he, everyone
was trying to get into his club,

1099
01:00:45,561 --> 01:00:48,080
like all these really good
comics and he wanted Stan hope,

1100
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:50,680
so he called Doug up or something
like that. It was like, hey, you know,

1101
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,810
really like you to come to my club in
Doug's like, I don't do clubs. Sorry.

1102
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:56,720
And then it sounds like, well, just, you
know, ask around first before you say no,

1103
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,790
because I think you're,
you would like my place,

1104
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:01,940
said Doug calls back and
goes out. Everyone's saying
great things, I'll go there.

1105
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:06,320
And so he'd be kind of came friends with
Stan hope and then he had like a party

1106
01:01:06,321 --> 01:01:10,970
to watch, like a boxing
match at his house, like his
apartment. And he, he's like,

1107
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:13,160
Doug, you know, if you want to come over
and watch the boxing game come over.

1108
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:17,660
So Doug invited the whole entire club to
come to sell his house and he just said

1109
01:01:17,661 --> 01:01:21,370
they're like 40 people were climbing
over his fence and just fucking drinking

1110
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:22,340
all his beers.

1111
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:26,570
And can you imagine inviting a whole club
to somebody else's [inaudible] Douchey.

1112
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:27,550
Yeah.

1113
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:30,730
Well, Stan hope drunk. Yes, of
course. Is that a real question?

1114
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:35,020
That isn't a real question. And Islam,
that's funny. Yeah. And after that,

1115
01:01:35,021 --> 01:01:38,020
he's still in a comedy, right?
Who? To Glutton for punishment.

1116
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:43,030
I know this, um, I'm sure, but a principal
empty Ted Williams, the golden voice.

1117
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:47,700
A homeless man, right? Yeah.
And um, this guy is like junkie.

1118
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:52,610
Yeah. And now they're giving them all
this money going. I fucking got it. Some,

1119
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,240
he was on Dr Phil and I guess he's about
to check himself into rehab or he did

1120
01:01:56,241 --> 01:01:59,180
checked himself into rehab
because of the doctor Phil show.

1121
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,200
But Dr Phil brought up the
whole point of where like, um,

1122
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:07,730
that he used to steal cars and like,
he's like, yeah, the great voice.

1123
01:02:07,731 --> 01:02:10,650
It's not like the innocent
cry baby guy that you first,

1124
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:20,430
it's going to be famous. Do you think he's
getting pussy yet? Internet. Pussy. Um,

1125
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:24,240
I hope not. He sort of looks like
Matt. You remember when already locked?

1126
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:29,241
Donald's had that moon man commercial
or it was like a moon face jack that

1127
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:33,240
night. What was that? I
remember it was um, Mac tonight.

1128
01:02:33,241 --> 01:02:38,100
Mac Mac tonight. Wow. Met. Pull
that up. I got to look at that now.

1129
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:43,220
Mac tonight was when Mcdonald's had
some moon headed man wearing a suit.

1130
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:48,050
Well, I don't remember that exactly like
that. I know almost Guy Tim Williams.

1131
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:52,390
So he goes on Dr Phil and he tells them
that he stole cars and all kinds of

1132
01:02:52,391 --> 01:02:54,460
other shit while he was doing drugs.
Is that what he said?

1133
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,753
Yeah.
Yeah.

1134
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,260
Well what he first said that he like
doctor Phil brought up the fact that he,

1135
01:03:00,261 --> 01:03:04,100
uh, uh, hold on, I'll tell you exactly
what it was. I'm just worried. Is it?

1136
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:08,890
Uh, he is the PM for people that don't
know there was a guy, and this is,

1137
01:03:08,891 --> 01:03:09,880
if you haven't heard this story,

1138
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:13,330
there was a guy that was standing on the
side of a road and he had a sign that

1139
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:17,050
said, you know, we'll use my
golden voice for, you know,

1140
01:03:17,051 --> 01:03:19,920
God gave me a voice and give me
some, give me a dollar, you know,

1141
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,050
whatever the fuck it is.
Right. So this guy, um,

1142
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:25,900
does this impression of like a morning
DJ on a television show or on a radio

1143
01:03:25,901 --> 01:03:29,680
show and it's amazing.
It's like a really good radio voice,

1144
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:34,330
like that perfect fake radio voice and
it's, feels, it seems weird coming out of,

1145
01:03:34,331 --> 01:03:36,760
uh, out of a homeless guy
and he's got like, you know,

1146
01:03:36,761 --> 01:03:38,710
a bunch of shit plan that
he can say like that.

1147
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:43,000
And so this became an internet
thing. It got huge. And then from it,

1148
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:46,760
this guy gets a bunch of different
job offers. So now he's on Dr Felons.

1149
01:03:46,761 --> 01:03:47,290
So what happen?

1150
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:47,831
Uh,
well,

1151
01:03:47,831 --> 01:03:50,840
Dr Phil sits down with them and discuss
it as in like all the challenges that

1152
01:03:50,841 --> 01:03:52,380
he's had in his life.
And he did not,

1153
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:55,280
he first denied the incident
in which Dr Phil, um,

1154
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,250
was accused of violent behavior,
public urination, stealing customers,

1155
01:03:59,251 --> 01:04:04,190
cars at a tire store in Ohio and all
this other crap. And then later, uh,

1156
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:08,700
in the interview, the guy finally admits
that he did all those things. And then,

1157
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:12,840
um, the next first few lines, but first
he lies, he's still lying. He's still,

1158
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:14,130
he's still doing the lying thing.

1159
01:04:14,131 --> 01:04:18,120
And then he admitted it later after Dr
Phil probably owned them or some. Wow.

1160
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:22,410
And then supposedly he will appear again.
I'm Dr Phil,

1161
01:04:22,411 --> 01:04:27,180
accompanied by his ex wife
and he has five kids. Wow.

1162
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:28,203
Oh,

1163
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:32,340
the kids got money with this kid is not
what you hope the kids got money and I

1164
01:04:32,341 --> 01:04:36,100
guess supposedly that the, the, the wife
and kids, um, are worried that he's,

1165
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:40,380
he's going to relapse and then later
in the interview or whatever, they,

1166
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,170
they say that he's going to
go into rehab on Thursday.

1167
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,450
So we already realized this today.
Yeah.

1168
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:50,220
Well you've probably got some cash and
you know, straight to the bar. Yeah.

1169
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,900
Almost guy in the shower and
straight to the bar. Joe,

1170
01:04:54,901 --> 01:04:57,180
do you remember this commercial? You
probably don't remember this commercial,

1171
01:04:57,181 --> 01:05:00,870
but this is who, uh, Al says that he
looks like this old, uh, the Shin.

1172
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,240
Yeah, I see it, but I don't
remember. I don't remember it.

1173
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:08,470
It's a big campaign
for robots,

1174
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:16,070
like 24, 2007 to, and that can be 2007.

1175
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,130
There's no way those

1176
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:22,930
four years ago, bitches. Oh wait, here's
a 1989 I'm talking about this. Yeah,

was, that was it. New revamped version.

1178
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,180
I don't see what the fuck do
you guys are talking about.

1179
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:32,770
That's a guy with a moon head guys
bring fucking net. That's ridiculous.

1180
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:36,010

Moon face. Even more than
Jay Leno used. You know,

1182
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:44,660
I bet that Moon Phase I met that Anton
Anton Dodson Dude. He's the dude who uh,

things can, can become viral like this.

1189
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:15,520
He bought his mom a house
from the proceeds. He, I
guess they split the money 50,

1190
01:06:15,521 --> 01:06:19,810
50, and Antwan got a lot of money.

It's all over the place. Yeah. All right.

1221

Ill make your Binion and cry

01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:18,720
celebrity that was made off of
the Internet, it's ea Keela.

1225
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:22,050
It's pretty, yeah Tila Tequila is a
perfect one. She's straight, you know,

1226
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,650

button. Right. You've got mail. She,

1227
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:28,420
it might've been the first. No, no,
no. There has to, I mean that's,

1228
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:30,520
you're talking about like seven years ago,

1229
01:08:30,521 --> 01:08:34,240
I'm talking about like the Internet came
out a long ass time snowmen like Tila

1230
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:37,530
Tequila that made their way into
the public and became [inaudible].

1231
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:40,930
Yeah, before, I mean video and
then social networks. Yeah.

1232
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,450
I'm just talking about the Internet had,

1233
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:48,610
was always a spot for celebrity to go.

1234
01:08:48,611 --> 01:08:49,750
Like I used to look up,

1235
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:53,170
I think some of the celebrities have
brothers and shit like that and there's

1236
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:54,460
like Ricky leads revolt,

1237
01:08:54,461 --> 01:08:58,060
a John Travolta's brother and so
he has a website and I was like,

1238
01:08:58,090 --> 01:09:01,030
there was a lot of funny
shit on it back then.

1239
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:04,120
But nothing like there is
now at the content audio,

1240
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:07,000
there's a sound you can go
to soundcloud and youtube.

1241
01:09:07,001 --> 01:09:10,390
I mean people are putting out,
nobody had the devices either.

1242
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,980
Nobody had flip video cameras.

1243
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:16,680
And so it was a whole new age of
when you introduce the small camera,

1244
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:20,360
that's when, and easy to upload
with a UC, a USB connector.

1245
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:24,700
My fit just right in
immediately HD phones. And uh,

1246
01:09:24,701 --> 01:09:28,870
so you didn't have to have that technology
available to just a regular guy.

1247
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:33,870
So now that it's easier to launch a blog
and video and look out when she goes

1248
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:38,680
viral, I mean a lot of people are
talking about the voice. Yeah.

1249
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:40,320
Yeah.
And Antwan Dodson,

1250
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,700
I mean it's a lot of fucking
money to buy your mom a house.

1251
01:09:42,701 --> 01:09:46,720
I don't care if it's in Alabama
where it was really big of that song.

1252
01:09:46,721 --> 01:09:49,790
Those guys who created that,
um, that auto two song,

1253
01:09:49,791 --> 01:09:53,290
which guys are very talented musician.
Sure. And then just auto tune, I mean,

1254
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:58,120
tune is fucking hilarious every time.
Yeah. You're a Carl Sagan is auto tune.

1255
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:02,530
No, what I have you
heard that, um, the, uh,

1256
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,240
I think it's the woo song.

1257
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:08,350
It's a local dues in San Francisco and um,

1258
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,610
they, I guess there are people
who are putting these mufflers on.

1259
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,580
Oh yeah. Woo. Yeah.

1260
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:19,660
Yeah. They go down and it's local news
on a tune for that. So that's hilarious.

1261
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:24,210
It's all anything auto tuning the news
is funny. Yeah. You can't deny it. I

1262
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:26,430
think garageband is pretty amazing too,
the,

1263
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:30,780
that the program where you can pretty
much make your own song pretty easily.

1264
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:34,170
Don't they have programs like that for
your phone now? Oh yeah, absolutely.

1265
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,230
Absolutely. Like there was, I don't
know if we ever talked about that.

1266
01:10:37,231 --> 01:10:40,320
There was this, back in the day
of my space, somebody linked, uh,

1267
01:10:40,321 --> 01:10:41,860
one of my songs on there,

1268
01:10:41,861 --> 01:10:45,750
a myspace page and like
stole it from my web host.

1269
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,880
And so like when you went
to their myspace page,

1270
01:10:47,881 --> 01:10:51,220
it automatically played a song
from your show for myself. So I,

1271
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:53,610
what I did is I took that file,

1272
01:10:53,611 --> 01:10:57,720
it took it down and then I'm made up a
quick song and garage band about like, ah,

1273
01:10:57,721 --> 01:11:00,360
Stacy from, you know,
Hollywood, California.

1274
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:03,750
I want you to suck my Dick and made a
whole song just set about how I wanted to

1275
01:11:03,751 --> 01:11:08,250
fuck this girl and stuff like that.
And I replace that song, that file,

1276
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,390
what the original file.

1277
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:12,300
So that when people went through her
mind space page just started playing that

1278
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:13,920
song. Yeah. [inaudible]

1279
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,950
that I just love. I don't know how
that, why you thought about that,

1280
01:11:16,951 --> 01:11:18,220
but it's pretty funny video.

1281
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:21,630
That's funny when you can do that with
hot linking and speaking of my space,

1282
01:11:21,631 --> 01:11:25,140
I think the yesterday one
officially really just downsize.

1283
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:29,790
They shut off at Germany and why space
Germany is dead. Somebody tweeted me,

1284
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,120
my space cut all their
employees like three months ago.

1285
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,900
I like half of their employees. They cut
Jordan and they just did it again. Jordy.

1286
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:40,620
Yeah, Jordy was roots and now is your
lucky day and age with comedy central,

1287
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:45,620
but they, yeah, use working
memory. I'm going to come.
My sweet comedy was thriving.

1288
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,630
I'm sure you did. One of those secret
shows. Did I do well? The secret shows.

1289
01:11:48,631 --> 01:11:51,870
I'm thinking about deleting
my mind space live on the air.

1290
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:55,640
What do you think do it if they're
going to cut show and rune.

1291
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:59,730
You know it's funny how we did it with
a, I think, I forget who we did it with,

1292
01:11:59,731 --> 01:12:01,680
like Jason Tebow or something like that.

1293
01:12:01,681 --> 01:12:05,420
Somebody deleted their my space the other
day. Live on air on an old, on podcasts.

1294
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:05,790
Christ.

1295
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:09,810
I can't even come up with one original
idea but watch how many steps it is.

1296
01:12:09,811 --> 01:12:14,190
It's pretty hilarious. I it was Ari.
Ari did it and it was like three steps.

1297
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:17,640
Like they make it really hard.
Like are you sure you yeah.

1298
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:22,170
Are you guys still have people on it?
Try and talk to you? Very, very, very,

1299
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:25,950
very few. Almost all of it
is completely dead as well.

1300
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:30,450
Do you want to go on and
mind also will duel duel one.

1301
01:12:30,451 --> 01:12:35,070
I paid some money to have my tricked
out too at one point. Saks? Yeah.

1302
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,330
Did you have glitter tags?

1303
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:41,220
I don't know what it seems like you
would probably use a fake name on juice.

1304
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,083
I can even say it.

1305
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:47,430
So if you want to delete your myspace
now too and we could have a double my

1306
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:51,600
space and I'm going to keep mine. They
hide this mother fucker. It's not easy.

1307
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:56,070
I don't even know where to go. Um, here,
I'll tell you guys where to go. Hold on.

1308
01:12:56,310 --> 01:13:00,750
Um,
more delete my space.

1309
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:03,900
Can't even tell you. I don't even know if
I know my past. It's time to let it go.

1310
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,531
You know what I mean?

1311
01:13:04,531 --> 01:13:07,920
It's like that girl that you dated 10
years ago and there's phone number still

1312
01:13:07,921 --> 01:13:12,300
in your book. Throw that
shit out, son. Move on.

1313
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:16,320
Um, it's in your book. Listen to me.
Your book, who has a phone book anymore?

1314
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:19,950
Phone books are worth nothing.
Fuck you in your phone book.

1315
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:24,400
I want to write it on paper.
Like some caveman. The good
for standing on. You know,

1316
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:28,680
why don't you just give me some burnt
sticks and I'll use it to carve the

1317
01:13:28,681 --> 01:13:33,350
fucking numbers on a rock. How to delete.
I think you do it and now I can't even,

1318
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,330
can't even figure it out. There
we go. There you go. All right.

1319
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:41,030
If you decided to delete my
space, what you do is more, um,

1320
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:45,820
you go to my account and then,
uh, where's my account? Uh,

1321
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:51,000
it's under more my stuff, my
stuff, account settings right here.

1322
01:13:51,001 --> 01:13:54,660
Account settings. And then you looks
different. I have to give them that. Yeah,

1323
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:58,690
it looks different.
Logo this case.

1324
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:02,040
Should we give him a chance now
that they redesigned everything

1325
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:07,800
we committed to this bro. We've committed
to this man. We're going to kill it.

1326
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:11,560
Everything in here it looks
like white label details.

1327
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:14,010
Remember the,
Oh,

1328
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:18,070
I constantly had those horrible
fucking ads where like people account.

1329
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:21,700
Here we go. You know, try it. I don't
want to catch a smiley face or something.

1330
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:25,330
Yeah. Brian is not just
cancel account. Right. It's
deleted. I want to delete that.

1331
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:28,800
Oh you want to cancel account?
Where's that fine. Canceling. Yeah.

1332
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:30,790
We're sorry you want to leave,

1333
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:35,020
please let us know why to say cause you
can really help us improve my space.

1334
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:40,090
There's not an,
it's over bitch option has board spam,

1335
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:43,360
privacy and email. I'm going to go with
spam was the one thing that annoyed me.

1336
01:14:43,361 --> 01:14:47,680
Where is it Joe? Where's the
cancel? Cancel account under
settings. Under settings.

1337
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:50,250
Under account settings
and privacy settings.

1338
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:55,450
Account settings and
cancellation comments. Thanks
for the love and the last,

1339
01:14:55,451 --> 01:14:58,780
but it's over bitches not down there.
Yeah,

1340
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:04,630
but they do hide it. They hide
it a below the fold. Yeah.

1341
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:09,490
And then you just got to keep on
scrolling down again for bitches. Um,

1342
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:13,270
and you know, it's even pissed.
The cancel account hose, it's over.

1343
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,860
My request has been sent.

1344
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:19,560
You will receive an email shortly with
instructions for confirming that you,

1345
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:24,790
so
why won't you just let me walk away?

1346
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,050
That's what they're doing.
A divorce.

1347
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:29,680
You have to go to your email and click
on a link and it's like a divorce to do

1348
01:15:29,681 --> 01:15:30,640
it now because they don't want to,

1349
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:35,200
they want to pretend they have more
people on my space. Spam continuing. Okay.

1350
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:36,063
Finish him.

1351
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:41,440
You know what sucks is that Facebook just
today has forced their new profile on

1352
01:15:41,441 --> 01:15:43,120
all the Facebook book accounts.

1353
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:47,930
Neupro Fox as really hard because it
high. All right, when you go to Facebook,

1354
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:50,260
at least how I do I, the first
thing I like to do is like, hmm,

1355
01:15:50,261 --> 01:15:52,810
this is person single is this,
you know, look at their photos.

1356
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:56,380
Now they've hidden like the single part
and then it's just like this really

1357
01:15:56,381 --> 01:16:00,130
shitty, like it'll look, it reminds
me of what my space, they've,

1358
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:03,100
they've moved it all around and now
it's just, Oh, you can change out with,

1359
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:05,590
there's actually companies that do that.
Um,

1360
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:09,370
somebody just hit me up from our
company to customize my mind space of my

1361
01:16:09,371 --> 01:16:14,130
Facebook page. Yeah. To make
it look all tricked out. Yeah.
Well now that they, they,

1362
01:16:14,131 --> 01:16:15,970
they used to let you go back.

1363
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:19,690
We talked about having to have a marketing
degree to be a good standup comic.

1364
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:24,400
Right. I try, I got two kids. I work
on them. You know, like I really,

1365
01:16:24,401 --> 01:16:28,560
I told you it's about my situation
website though. Website and cases,

1366
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:31,660
what you're doing. I'm in
touch. If somebody emails me,

1367
01:16:31,661 --> 01:16:33,460
I'll definitely get back to Twitter.
By the way,

1368
01:16:33,461 --> 01:16:38,461
is Al Madrigal a l m a D R I
n g sauteing stuff happening,

1369
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:43,600
but you should say it, Missouri. God,

1370
01:16:44,110 --> 01:16:48,040
especially if you go on before Willie
Barsana, you don't even see your own name,

1371
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:52,450
right, bro? How many followers do you
have closing on 3000. Not too many.

1372
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,870
We're going to blow that out of
the water today. Yes. Monitor here.

1373
01:16:55,871 --> 01:16:59,750
I can't jump you up to 5,000 you fucker.
How has been cancelled?

1374
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,240
You got that kind of reached it.
I could just chop 2,835 you know what?

1375
01:17:04,241 --> 01:17:08,230
If I get people to sign on,
I will. I'm a funny guy.

1376
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:10,100
I'll start putting shit out there.
I'm at war

1377
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,970
with my neighbors right now. Are you
really? Yeah. What's going on? Well,

1378
01:17:12,971 --> 01:17:13,400
let's just sort,

1379
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,010
I'm surrounded by old people and
I'm surrounded by these three guys,

1380
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:20,660
isn't it a bit, this is real treat
three guys named Phil. I go old Phil.

1381
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:25,930
Really old Phil and in Filipino Phil
as how I like a Filipino fills my ally.

1382
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,270
Which one makes your banana credit?

1383
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:31,120
No one there with the other
guys are goofing though.

1384
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:33,930
Complainant banana cry.
It's going to be the new thing.

1385
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:38,940
Do you want me to to make your banana cry?
See you talk about this on stage. Yeah,

1386
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:44,280
I got to see the bit. So
anyway, I'm sorry. So I'm
surrounded by old people and um,

1387
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:48,180
it's Eagle rockets and
upcoming neighborhood still
and there's a lot of cool

1388
01:17:48,181 --> 01:17:50,930
people that live near me,
but at the same time,

1389
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:53,460
it's just rounded by all
people that are in my business.

1390
01:17:53,461 --> 01:17:57,300
I went on my roof to clean out my gutters
and it's like the all assembled below

1391
01:17:57,301 --> 01:18:01,680
me where like I was conducting some, you
know, double arp meeting and that I can,

1392
01:18:01,681 --> 01:18:02,970
they're all in my business.

1393
01:18:02,971 --> 01:18:07,350
And like I had at one
point I had three cars.

1394
01:18:07,351 --> 01:18:09,420
I still have three cars right now.
And then I have,

1395
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:13,380
I got GM was nice enough to
get me a Buick onc, a enclave,

1396
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:16,760
the holiday and let me use that.
Um,

1397
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:20,400
it's just where like perked through the
Pr Department and this thing is awesome

1398
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:24,570
and I, uh, it's really just talking
an incredible vehicle anyway,

1399
01:18:24,571 --> 01:18:25,590
so that shows up.

1400
01:18:25,591 --> 01:18:28,470
So I have four cars and the old people
are stopping my constantly and go,

1401
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:33,710
do you feel a check conomical to have
three vehicles and I can't help but fuck

1402
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,780
with them and hate them when they ask you.
Oh,

1403
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,790
I have people in my shit constantly about
my hedges. My mean, and there's a guy,

1404
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:46,500
old guy walks his dog by my house every
fucking day and is so in my business

1405
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:49,200
like is stop.
If I even show my head,

1406
01:18:49,201 --> 01:18:52,200
he'll stop and start asking
a million fucking questions.

1407
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,980
And so you live up here in this community
where it's nice and there's not,

1408
01:18:56,070 --> 01:19:00,620
I mean your neighbors aren't on you.
I have neighbors just on my end.

1409
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:04,370
That sucks dude. I'm so not into that.
Yeah, no, it's not even like this.

1410
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:08,060
I lived in the woods for three
months while I live in Colorado.

1411
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:11,460
Was that it was the perfect place
for me. I was driving up, I was like,

1412
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:16,550
this is how you do it. Did I
have old people on my shit?
And then also, you know,

1413
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:20,310
it's sort of a little gangly
ish sometimes. So like somebody,

1414
01:19:20,311 --> 01:19:23,480
he'll write a mini truck will
go, you know, down the street.

1415
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:27,410
You that guy like driving by with the uh,
really fast

1416
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,930
for no, we won't worry about that
with your kids, the gang you part.

1417
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:33,660
Well it's no gang adjacent.

1418
01:19:33,661 --> 01:19:37,290
It's not really not right in this shit.

1419
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:40,580
It's close enough where it's going to
become an issue in their life. Yeah.

1420
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:44,670
You can definitely stumbled down
to the wrong area and just get any,

1421
01:19:44,671 --> 01:19:46,260
well anywhere you can get
caught in the wrong time.

1422
01:19:46,261 --> 01:19:49,490
But here it's a highly
unlikely, you know, like again,

1423
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:54,530
I mean I have a more realistic chance
of running into some bad people in my

1424
01:19:54,601 --> 01:19:57,000
neighborhood. Yeah. And a, yeah,

1425
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:59,640
I worry about my wife being alone when
I gave you stand up and shit like that

1426
01:19:59,641 --> 01:20:03,240
all the time. Yeah. I know that
feeling. And even with household shit,

1427
01:20:03,241 --> 01:20:04,230
if anything breaks.
And you know,

1428
01:20:04,231 --> 01:20:06,160
we've had stuff where I've
been on the road doing standup,

1429
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:09,120
I travel all just like not
as much, but I, you know,

1430
01:20:09,121 --> 01:20:14,070
I go out a fair amount and uh, yeah, my
wife's one with two kids and luckily,

1431
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:18,390
you know, we got Filipino frank there.
So tell me what's your issues with your,

1432
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:20,790
your world?
Let's try to come and trim my shit.

1433
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:24,900
Like is you know how you have a hedges?
Yeah, my dog goes route and barking.

1434
01:20:24,901 --> 01:20:29,220
The other day my neighbor was secretly
trying to trim my fucking Madge lousy

1435
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:33,630
trimming. You're just old and drunk
and crazy. Like just talk to him.

1436
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:38,610
Um, no I might, they put, brought over a
letter c I, that's what I'm talking about.

1437
01:20:38,611 --> 01:20:43,500
I feel crazy about this. I'm like, you
want a war? I'll bring you war. God,

1438
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:46,740
I didn't say that, but that's
how I feel. I say I like,

1439
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,280
they'll get all pissed bent out of shape
if I am not talking to a neighbor for

1440
01:20:50,281 --> 01:20:55,020
two years because over parking we had
construction people over our house and the

1441
01:20:55,021 --> 01:20:59,010
Latino guys parked there and he came
running back to the old guy and fucking

1442
01:20:59,011 --> 01:21:02,220
start yelling into Latino guys to
move their car. It's a public street.

1443
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:03,870
Anybody can fucking apart there.

1444
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:06,750
I'm at war where I want him
to talk to the fucking guys.

1445
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:11,010
I like Bourbon war really is
particularly in their turf.

1446
01:21:11,011 --> 01:21:13,680
And then the real issue is people are
not supposed to be on top of each other.

1447
01:21:13,681 --> 01:21:16,890
Like they really spread out apartments,

1448
01:21:16,891 --> 01:21:19,620
man apartments or where it's
really bright on top of each other.

1449
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,580
I talked to the apartment

1450
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,910
north Hollywood where I had a pool table.
Okay.

1451
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:25,900
And I lived on the second floor and there
was this crazy gay couple that lives

1452
01:21:25,901 --> 01:21:29,470
on the first floor and he
was like the landlord to are
the, uh, what is it called?

1453
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:32,780
The Superintendent.
So landlord now,

1454
01:21:32,781 --> 01:21:35,390
he was always controlling
things and it wasn't him.

1455
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:37,670
He didn't know in the building,
but he ran it. So, um,

1456
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:40,490
I had a pool table installed in my
living room. I had a big living room.

1457
01:21:40,491 --> 01:21:43,370
And the reason why I got this big living
room was because I could get a pool

1458
01:21:43,371 --> 01:21:45,200
table. I want her a pool table
in the living room, right.

1459
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:48,050
So I had installed and he comes
knocking on the door, what is,

1460
01:21:48,051 --> 01:21:48,861
what's going on in there?

1461
01:21:48,861 --> 01:21:52,940
There's a lot of movement and there's a
lot of movement up here. And I go, Oh,

1462
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:55,970
I've got a pool table because you're,
you jumping around,

1463
01:21:55,971 --> 01:21:58,160
are you working out or
something? I go, no, no, no, no.

1464
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:02,720
I just walked around the pool table. Yeah,
he's talking making shots. And he goes,

1465
01:22:02,721 --> 01:22:03,171
okay,

1466
01:22:03,171 --> 01:22:07,580
I'm going to have to ask you to not do
that when I'm home because it's just like

1467
01:22:07,581 --> 01:22:11,150
I'm in the living room and all I hear
is creak, creak, creak, creak, creak.

1468
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:12,591
And I'm like,

1469
01:22:12,591 --> 01:22:16,160
so you're saying that because of the
structural instability of this shit had

1470
01:22:16,161 --> 01:22:17,390
fucking apartment building.

1471
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:20,990
You don't want me walking in my
living room because it's annoying.

1472
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:25,350
Yeah. I started changing
my wireless password cause
they're right on top of you.

1473
01:22:25,351 --> 01:22:29,490
Right, right. So everybody in my, so I
changed my wireless. Now my network name,

1474
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,470
I can change it to anything I want.
Right.

1475
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:36,530
So I put like weeds your lawn that I
changed my network and then I looked on it

1476
01:22:36,571 --> 01:22:40,670
like, hey, we link cs. You're
bugging we, you line. Hey, hey.

1477
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:45,680
Oh yeah, quit trimming my
bucking hedges. Wow. I like that.

1478
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:50,100
That's fun. Or they trust steal
off your fucking wireless.
Yeah, man, that's creepy.

1479
01:22:50,101 --> 01:22:51,090
When you have neighborhoods,
man,

1480
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:54,090
there's always that one kid that lived
down the Brock that's going to steal your

1481
01:22:54,091 --> 01:22:56,240
fucking shit when you're not
looking at, yeah, there was,

1482
01:22:56,370 --> 01:23:01,230
someone has some troubled
16 year old troubled youth
walking around. Always, man,

1483
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:05,330
my friend of mine got his fucking bike
stolen. Some fucking kid down the street.

1484
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:05,980
Kids are

1485
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,910
walking up the block just walking up.
Just, you know, just looking around,

1486
01:23:09,911 --> 01:23:13,160
not doing. I'll say, where's that guy
fucking go? You know, he's walking.

1487
01:23:13,161 --> 01:23:17,170
I've arrived. Nobody. First of all in La,
very few people without a dog walking.

1488
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:22,110
And I don't have, you know, chicks have
Lulu Lemon on or something like that.

1489
01:23:22,111 --> 01:23:23,530
And you know,
they're dressed in outfits.

1490
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:27,370
I mean when you see just alone fucking
thug, it's like seeing an aunt,

1491
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:32,860
just a wave from the rest of them to
live in a nice spot to live in a quiet

1492
01:23:32,861 --> 01:23:34,450
spot,
try to find a quiet nice spot.

1493
01:23:34,451 --> 01:23:36,480
And that's why somebody before
go to the suburbs, you know,

1494
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:40,510
like you go to downtown Cleveland, it's
shutting down. There's nothing there.

1495
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:43,020
The fly, every single store is
released and shit like that.

1496
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:47,050
I couldn't find a department store
and my wife sometimes tells me pack no

1497
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:49,330
underwear. So I got to buy
underwear and downtown Cleveland,

1498
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:50,530
not a department store.

1499
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,070
Now it's like Walgreens or Brooks
brothers and that's the only carry little

1500
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:56,680
things that they had.
Cleveland's weird. Yeah.

1501
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:59,920
Does everybody moved down to a
quieter place called what it is? Yeah,

1502
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:02,050
the jobs disappeared,
right?

1503
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:05,150
Isn't that what happened with quell plants
got shut down or something like that

1504
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:06,790
in Detroit.
You know,

1505
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:11,820
people went south and went to
Columbus and Cincinnati cause just,

1506
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:16,150
I mean Cleveland used to be the,
you know, the biggest city in Ohio.

1507
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:18,900
He used to be like the flat.
So it used to be the place to be the cool,

1508
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:23,760
the cool part of Ohio. Now it's scary
improv down there. That's a real dump.

1509
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:28,570
The, yeah, did it once. Well they have,
it's, they just gave out so many passes.

1510
01:24:28,571 --> 01:24:31,510
They completely ruined the room. That's
what a lot of comedy clubs don't do.

1511
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:33,900
Is that just the quality,
they're just giving out pass.

1512
01:24:33,901 --> 01:24:36,280
And so they give out free passes to,
the tickets are free.

1513
01:24:36,281 --> 01:24:38,650
So they're selling booze and
they tickets have no value.

1514
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:41,110
A lot of places believed that
are in the liquor business,

1515
01:24:41,111 --> 01:24:42,130
not the comedy business.

1516
01:24:42,131 --> 01:24:46,440
And they just want people
inside to drinking so they
can see their appointments.

1517
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:48,580
You gotta just keep the fucking
wolves away. Sure. You know,

1518
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:51,160
it's like for a lot of these places,
like in the middle of nowhere,

1519
01:24:51,161 --> 01:24:52,180
it's real hard.

1520
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:55,850
And a lot of the comics that are getting
shipped down there are terrible. Yeah.

1521
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:58,240
How many times have you like been
in a club and you look at the line,

1522
01:24:58,241 --> 01:24:58,541
I'd be like,

1523
01:24:58,541 --> 01:25:00,850
whether they got going on here and you
read their calendar and you're like,

1524
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:02,950
oh shit, she, Jesus. Fuck.

1525
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:06,280
And you just imagine these poor people
having to come and sit and watch this.

1526
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:08,470
Some kid told me a quote there,
which I was working with.

1527
01:25:08,471 --> 01:25:12,760
He said he was at a show and his comic
was so bad. Some old black lady yells out,

1528
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:15,850
you're ruining my free passes.

1529
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:22,000
Oh my God, that was the best I can.
One thing that sums everything else.

1530
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:27,010
They're ruining my free pass.
God's hilarious.

1531
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:30,670
This for free. And I hate
it. This is horrible.

1532
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:34,900
That's so funny. And that's why a lot of,
you know, like when people get, you know,

1533
01:25:34,901 --> 01:25:37,990
when you're, uh, like comedy
promoter, you do free beer.

1534
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:42,850
Like there's always gotta be something
else that will justify, I can move.

1535
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:45,900
Yeah. It's a tough fucking
businessman and he's sort of a bar,

1536
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:49,480
restaurant business on a pool hall,
anything like that. Night and night,

1537
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:53,230
nighttime business, those fucking things
are hard man. And when times are tough,

1538
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:56,690
like they are now, the economy gets
shitty and then it becomes, you know,

1539
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:58,420
they really don't want to go out.

1540
01:25:58,421 --> 01:26:01,200
They don't want to take a chance to just
go see comedy. You know, if you know,

1541
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:03,980
they know someone is going to be there,
you know the bill burrs

1542
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,440
in town. Okay, let's go see him.
You know I know who he is. Yes,

1543
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:08,950
Stan help has that joke that he's done.
I was like,

1544
01:26:08,951 --> 01:26:12,010
how many people are here to see me?
How many people are here to see comedy?

1545
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:16,720
And half of them reply and is like,
don't do that with anything else.

1546
01:26:16,721 --> 01:26:21,510
You don't go. Just roll into,
you know, many things. And

1547
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,590
it's also, you know, I've said
this before but I'll say it again.

1548
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:27,530
The real problem is that
generic label comedy,

1549
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:30,770
it's like you don't go to see live music
and not knowing if you're going to get

1550
01:26:30,771 --> 01:26:34,160
Barry Manilow or guns and roses
or you know, a rap band, you know.

1551
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:37,670
But with comedy you could get that and
you could get that all on the same night.

1552
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:39,140
You can get like five different comments.

1553
01:26:39,141 --> 01:26:41,570
Can go out at the Improv and
they all at five different,

1554
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:45,790
totally different acts and sure. Yeah.
John Reap and any Griffin maybe. Yeah,

1555
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:50,480
exactly. Polar opposites.
Babo Shack, you know,

1556
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:55,430
just these drastic Babo shack can't
call into the store anymore. Really?

1557
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:59,450
Yeah. This, they told him he's too old
series going towards younger people.

1558
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:03,110
What's his name is still can go there
every day and he's got his thing.

1559
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,800
Wow. Yeah. Yeah.

1560
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:12,840
That's your fucking job to Shaq is a
very funny comedy writer and a very funny

1561
01:27:12,971 --> 01:27:15,760
comedian. I mean, you should look
him up. He's talking incredible.

1562
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:20,020
And also when you heard and listened to
a guy like that is a perfect talk about

1563
01:27:20,021 --> 01:27:24,040
alliteration and the story and find, I
mean just kind of, he's a great character.

1564
01:27:24,041 --> 01:27:27,460
Notch. Yeah. He's, he would
be a great talk show host.
He was, I think for awhile,

1565
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:31,270
that's when he moved to Florida and he
was working on one of those good morning

1566
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:36,340
shows is to, you're on him. He moved away
from la I'd say three years ago. Really?

1567
01:27:36,370 --> 01:27:39,190
And once you go be a,
you can type in Bombo shank on youtube.

1568
01:27:39,191 --> 01:27:41,390
And see him as a morning correspondence.
Wow.

1569
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:45,700
And so that fell apart in that new big
Gig and they just moved back to Los

1570
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:49,390
Angeles. Yeah. So Bob, oh, shack in
the morning or whatever. Kids. Yeah.

1571
01:27:49,391 --> 01:27:52,600
He has two kids, uh, at about
the same age as mine, you know,

1572
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:53,800
and at eight and four range.

1573
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,930
I can't believe they're
telling him not to get spots.

1574
01:27:56,230 --> 01:28:00,130
Did he play David Letterman and that
old movie? No. No, no. But he always,

1575
01:28:00,131 --> 01:28:03,790
he has this look about him like where
he really looks like a young Dave

1576
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:08,320
Letterman, you know, emotion by
Oprah to be one of the top comedian.

1577
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:10,150
Speaking of Volpara now
we were talking about it.

1578
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:12,220
That's how we first met was over some old,

1579
01:28:12,221 --> 01:28:16,150
Oprah's a watching what we did stand up
together and we went up to my house and

1580
01:28:16,151 --> 01:28:19,630
just sat there baked 11 years
ago watching old Oprah flooded.

1581
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:20,011
Yeah.

1582
01:28:20,011 --> 01:28:25,011
We were doing a bong hits in Al magicals
couch watching Oprah from like the 80s

1583
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:29,010
when she had big hair. She's Richard.
Did she have plastic surgery?

1584
01:28:29,011 --> 01:28:30,510
What's happening right now?

1585
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:34,190
Like we were just sitting there and
I think there were people around us,

1586
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:36,780
but then you were just
sitting watching the Oprah,

1587
01:28:36,781 --> 01:28:40,780
like there was a little bit of a gathering
and people were talking to drink your,

1588
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:44,210
your wife before she was your wife and
some other buttons. One other person,

1589
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:48,210
a couple of people. And she would just
completely focused on this old Oprah.

1590
01:28:48,211 --> 01:28:50,210
And so we're barbecue and you know,
when something,

1591
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,800
your barbecue is something like all
of a sudden like, wow, why have,

1592
01:28:52,801 --> 01:28:56,160
I never seen it like this before.
It was so strange.

1593
01:28:56,161 --> 01:28:58,970
It was like we were watching
like an alien film too.

1594
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:02,250
Anyway. Oh, Shaq was on and

1595
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:05,430
touted as one of the next grade
communions and nobody knows comedy.

1596
01:29:05,431 --> 01:29:06,860
Like that bitch.
Yeah.

1597
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:12,690
Of whole new networks about watch
how comedy central own. Yeah. Yeah.

1598
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,350
It's like the white version of def jam.
What?

1599
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:18,423
Um,

1600
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:23,100
so nothing on [inaudible] would have to
pull him over it so it doesn't matter.

1601
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:25,840
It's all right. It's just another one
of those stories, you know, story.

1602
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:30,300
It's been the interesting thing about
being a a comedian and living in La is

1603
01:29:30,301 --> 01:29:31,650
watching the whole,
you know,

1604
01:29:31,651 --> 01:29:34,920
the whole story of humanity unfold for
many different people in many different

1605
01:29:34,921 --> 01:29:36,610
players. And they all
just, you know, they,

1606
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:39,060
they take their part in the game
and they all go through it and you,

1607
01:29:39,061 --> 01:29:42,720
you get to watch him and a lot of them
you get to learn from to learn from their

1608
01:29:42,721 --> 01:29:46,200
fuck ups and learn, even though you sort
of pick the path that you want to go,

1609
01:29:46,201 --> 01:29:49,320
it's like choose your own adventures.
Like am I going to be like that dude?

1610
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:52,200
Am I going to end up like that?
And then you get to go,

1611
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:55,500
am I going to go into the cave?
Am I going to choose to go to space?

1612
01:29:55,501 --> 01:29:58,440
Like you have to make choices
along the way and if you fuck up,

1613
01:29:58,710 --> 01:30:02,070
then you might go off in some other
positive direction. But not necessarily,

1614
01:30:02,071 --> 01:30:04,710
I mean, there's a lot of choices
to be made. I've been on,

1615
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:06,030
like I was talking about,

1616
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:10,410
I'm talking six pilots or something like
that at this point since I've taught,

1617
01:30:10,411 --> 01:30:13,230
you know, we've met and not one
of them has really taken off.

1618
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:15,990
It's been weird and one of them could
have taken off immediately. Yeah.

1619
01:30:15,991 --> 01:30:19,350
You ended end up like you can
like get super duper lucky. Um,

1620
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:23,700
and not to see you're lucky on [inaudible]
news radio. Just no Garrett, no doubt.

1621
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:26,700
I was lucky. I, the first two
things I ever auditioned for,

1622
01:30:26,701 --> 01:30:30,660
I got the first two shows. I never, I
didn't go on like a bunch of auditions,

1623
01:30:30,661 --> 01:30:33,840
like a lot of actors. I auditioned for
one thing when I was living in New York.

1624
01:30:33,841 --> 01:30:37,800
I got it came out to California that got
cancelled. I auditioned for news radio.

1625
01:30:37,801 --> 01:30:42,240
I got that. Bam. No acting experience
at all. It's total luck. There's no,

1626
01:30:42,241 --> 01:30:44,130
no getting away from them.
It was just,

1627
01:30:44,131 --> 01:30:47,460
I was in the right place at the right
time when they were looking for stand ups

1628
01:30:47,461 --> 01:30:50,730
on sitcoms. That's all it is.
So it's a lot of luck, you know,

1629
01:30:50,731 --> 01:30:51,900
I could have had the same thing as you.

1630
01:30:51,901 --> 01:30:54,330
It could have been six different pilots
and nothing happened or could have been

1631
01:30:54,331 --> 01:30:59,210
one and actually had that part before
you talk to news radio. Yeah. Yeah.

1632
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:00,960
He, he had it, but I
didn't take it from him.

1633
01:31:00,961 --> 01:31:03,750
I took it from the guy who took it
from him. Aha. That's even better.

1634
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:06,630
They decided somewhere along the line
that they were going to go some in some

1635
01:31:06,631 --> 01:31:08,400
different direction and you know,

1636
01:31:08,401 --> 01:31:11,190
meanwhile it turned out to be the greatest
thing ever for Ray Romano Fuck News

1637
01:31:11,191 --> 01:31:15,810
radio. I mean, Ray Romano,
me $800 million. If somebody
saw him the other night.

1638
01:31:15,811 --> 01:31:19,530
Did you, do you know him? I know
real well and uh, he was, uh,

1639
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:22,920
seemed like you incredibly
humble and he's a very cool guy.

1640
01:31:22,921 --> 01:31:26,400
He's as down to Earth as possible. He
hasn't changed at all. He's the same guy.

1641
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:30,150
And uh, he was talking about something
that I can totally relate to it too.

1642
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:34,360
When I was, we were at the taping of Paul
prevents his Green Room. He did it a,

1643
01:31:34,410 --> 01:31:36,540
the night before I did it.
And by the way, kitties,

1644
01:31:36,541 --> 01:31:39,630
I had a conversation with Mark Marin.
We're both gonna do each other's podcasts.

1645
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:43,770
Yeah, that'd be [inaudible] no real beef
there. Yeah. This is a big Twitter issue,

1646
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:46,500
but uh, so anyway, um, he, yeah,

1647
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:49,440
people keep asking me to do it and
what it looks with. The other thing,

1648
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:53,460
I don't want any beefs any, but
I hear you. It's distracting.
It's a waste of time.

1649
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:54,810
That's all it is,
is a waste of time.

1650
01:31:54,811 --> 01:31:57,540
And you really think about a pride and
shit like that. It's like, shut up.

1651
01:31:57,810 --> 01:32:00,150
We would have who go to work,
you know,

1652
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,670
it's like the wars wanting to do
my shit. Yeah, I hear Ya. Yeah,

1653
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:06,380
exactly the same way. Anyway, I'm, Ray
Romano was talking about how, you know,

1654
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:10,490
you know, uh, even after all
these years I do these shows,

1655
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:15,490
it sounds like Kermit the frog eight he
said even after he does all these years

1656
01:32:15,491 --> 01:32:19,600
and he goes, does, is he
shows at the Mirage in Vegas
or wherever he goes and uh,

1657
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:23,470
you know, massive fucking crowd. He said
he still feels like a fraud. Imposter.

1658
01:32:23,530 --> 01:32:25,070
Yeah.
He feels like when he gets,

1659
01:32:25,071 --> 01:32:28,240
he's stepping out there that all these
people are, sure. I think he goes,

1660
01:32:28,241 --> 01:32:31,420
I think at any moment we're going to just
turn around and just point a finger at

1661
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:34,660
me and go, you're a deck and we
don't really like you. You know?

1662
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:38,410
And that is what it feels like. It's
a, it's a weird thing like as you know,

1663
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:40,960
do comedy all these years and you know,

1664
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:43,870
and people are there to see
you and they're all psyched
up and they're cheering

1665
01:32:43,871 --> 01:32:46,090
when they're bringing the name. And as
you're walking to the stage you're like,

1666
01:32:46,091 --> 01:32:48,130
what the fuck am I even here in ceiling?

1667
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:51,110
Tom Papa told me great stories about that.
Like a,

1668
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:54,400
he'd work to sell out comedy clubs and
he started selling out some comedy clubs

1669
01:32:54,401 --> 01:32:58,750
in any move to the smaller theaters.
And then as a guy in a smaller theater,

1670
01:32:58,751 --> 01:33:02,200
he didn't take a moment to go, this
is it. I'm in a smaller theater.

1671
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:05,740
He started thinking about getting in
bigger theaters like bad was his really

1672
01:33:05,741 --> 01:33:08,140
like we're, are we feeling this one? Okay,

1673
01:33:08,141 --> 01:33:10,750
we're filling this theater and then
we're going to move to a bigger theater.

1674
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:15,040
You know, he wasn't satisfied
with the little theater. Yeah.

1675
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:17,620
Where I'm thinking, oh my God,
if I can get to a theater,

1676
01:33:17,621 --> 01:33:22,410
I don't give a shit what size it is. Yeah.
That's like the jump off point. Yeah.

1677
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:26,140
For comics. So you always want
aspire to users. Yeah, exactly.

1678
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,950
Theaters are a lot of
work though, man. Sure.

1679
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:30,940
It's a lot of work to try to sell them
unless you've got this giant following.

1680
01:33:30,941 --> 01:33:33,760
You know, I was on the road with
Mitch Hedberg and he tells us,

1681
01:33:33,790 --> 01:33:38,440
just told a story about him and Lynn
trying to think they could do a theater on

1682
01:33:38,441 --> 01:33:42,910
their own and they didn't need a promoter
and it was sold down at this comedy

1683
01:33:42,911 --> 01:33:45,400
club forever and they were just going
to try and do and he said it was an

1684
01:33:45,401 --> 01:33:49,210
absolute disaster.
We only like half full.

1685
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:52,140
They lost money or barely
broke even while the,

1686
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:55,300
pretend we didn't have the Internet
in full effect, but no, not at all.

1687
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,250
Mitch Hedberg website was bunk.

1688
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:01,380
It was like look like somebody put it
together at a Netscape navigator that

1689
01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:03,830
build a website page.
Shaylee did that,

1690
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:07,020
you know Shane Lane that goes around
with Stan Ho? Yeah, Gray Shaylee.

1691
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:11,870
Did that website terrible website. It
really is. It's the older style changes,

1692
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:14,030
all the updates going
on there. Right. And so

1693
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:17,310
he didn't have like a regular blog
or he didn't have a message board or,

1694
01:34:17,311 --> 01:34:18,840
so it's hard for him to get the word out.

1695
01:34:18,841 --> 01:34:21,780
You've got to have a lot of shit going
on. Yeah. A lot of different connections.

1696
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:25,340
Now there's also so many
different applications that
you can use that allow it,

1697
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,550
you know, the communication, it'd be
just, you know, it's a lot easier.

1698
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:30,290
Well before you're doing,
you know,

1699
01:34:30,291 --> 01:34:34,580
just emails if you're doing that or
some sort of weird email newsletter with

1700
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:37,610
asterix, you know, as a
separation points. You know,

1701
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:41,150
there's a lot more out there
now. It's easy. I mean,

1702
01:34:41,151 --> 01:34:44,340
you gotta be a fucking marketing major
to do all this shit. I got Twitter,

1703
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,220
I'm going to keep a track
of all this other stuff.

1704
01:34:46,221 --> 01:34:49,160
And then you're trying to about tricking
out on Facebook pages and we just

1705
01:34:49,161 --> 01:34:52,300
deleted on myspace pages. It's like
staying on top of his shit. Well,

1706
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:54,380
it's gotta become a part of
your life and it really does.

1707
01:34:54,381 --> 01:34:58,910
And I love the fucking news stream.
I did that with them. I in um,

1708
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:02,210
Dallas with house barks,
he dropped by sparks was here.

1709
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:05,420
We had them on the podcast.
We had a really surreal thing.

1710
01:35:05,421 --> 01:35:09,530
We were in a strip club at triple the
lodge, you know, that plays the lodge.

1711
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:14,240
Where's it at in Dallas. Addison is
and um, there was a monkey there,

1712
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:18,590
so me and Hal and a monkey
and fucking distributors.

1713
01:35:18,591 --> 01:35:23,020
It was really fucking weird. We went
to dinner with the guys radio show,

1714
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:27,500
a big Dick Hunter, you know.
Okay. Hunter. Yeah. Good guy.

1715
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:30,740
And so we were there and
his wife works at the lodge,

1716
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:34,220
which is a great strip club. It's,
we're talking about B, you know,

1717
01:35:34,221 --> 01:35:37,460
strip clubs being CDF. Do you have
kids? And she didn't like that.

1718
01:35:37,461 --> 01:35:39,680
This is a really fucking nice one.
It's top notch.

1719
01:35:39,681 --> 01:35:42,920
I mean that's the thing
is they higher quality.

1720
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:46,080
I seem to enjoy everything
luxury at this point. Yeah.

1721
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:51,200
I want everything to be top notch.
I've seen the best hotel room,

1722
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:54,710
you know and shit like that and everything
is going to be held up in comparison

1723
01:35:54,711 --> 01:35:58,310
to that at this point. Once you fly for
his class, it's difficult to bugging.

1724
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:00,990
Go on a southwest flight,
crammed in in a mirror.

1725
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:04,940
When you realize how things can be
nice shit, everything can be nice.

1726
01:36:04,941 --> 01:36:06,620
And the same thing as with
true with strip clubs,

1727
01:36:06,650 --> 01:36:10,880
you know like there's bad ones where
we in, it's disgusting. Like you said,

1728
01:36:10,881 --> 01:36:14,840
becoming a Germaphobe, you know, and I'm
thinking about all these other dudes.

1729
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:18,950
I was in Tempe and I was,
it was early on in my comedy career.

1730
01:36:18,951 --> 01:36:22,730
I went to a strip club during the day
that you do check writing guide during the

1731
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:27,440
day. And by the way, you know, have
3,148 followers. That's amazing.

1732
01:36:27,441 --> 01:36:31,550
That gave you like 400 followers
easily. Bam, boom. Like that.

1733
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:34,890
His response equipment like and respect,
I'm sorry.

1734
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:36,460
So you went to a strip club during,

1735
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:38,870
during the day and I was never
a good sign of a good time.

1736
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:42,720
I remember going to a Bachelor Party
and Mr Club was one of the best places,

1737
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:46,670
like fantasy sequence, two girls
at one time it was half off beers,

1738
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:51,730
half off lap dances who are five lap
dances for one or some crazy thing where

1739
01:36:52,461 --> 01:36:57,380
I've loved that. No, it was a dream
sequence for a strip club. Perfect. Uh,

1740
01:36:57,381 --> 01:37:01,950
Asu chicks well before being
married and I go in, yeah.

1741
01:37:02,570 --> 01:37:06,980
And I go in there and um,
the during the day when I was by myself,

1742
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:10,970
old guy just in the corner
in a wheelchair and his girl,

1743
01:37:10,971 --> 01:37:12,950
he's regular in this girl is really hot,

1744
01:37:12,951 --> 01:37:17,180
goes up to him and starts rubbing on him
and I was looking at her before and she

1745
01:37:17,181 --> 01:37:20,780
starts like, he's, Hey John, how are you
today? Did you get the grilled cheese?

1746
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:25,580
And like having small talk and she
spends like 30 minutes with them and then

1747
01:37:25,581 --> 01:37:29,890
comes directly up to me afterwards
and goes, do you want dance? They go,

1748
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:34,730
I looked at her, I go, no, absolutely not.
What the fuck he see what you just did?

1749
01:37:34,731 --> 01:37:38,150
He just rubbed up against death and
I'm going to fucking get a lap dance.

1750
01:37:38,151 --> 01:37:38,984
It's disgusting.

1751
01:37:38,990 --> 01:37:43,370
So I'm saying this place to the lodge and
Dallas is actually really bug and nice

1752
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:47,410
and beautiful. Not like that now. Like
the place would be old routine visit.

1753
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,490
Tricky thing man with old dudes,
man.

1754
01:37:49,550 --> 01:37:52,940
Old dudes like they get taken at
strip clubs all the time. You know,

1755
01:37:52,941 --> 01:37:56,130
they become like a, a part of the
landscape. When Eddie Bravo used

1756
01:37:56,130 --> 01:38:00,900
to be a DJ at a strip club, I used to
go and visit, of course he was. And uh,

1757
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:04,430
for years, for like 10 years
and so awesome. And uh,

1758
01:38:04,431 --> 01:38:07,290
I would go and visit him
at work and uh, he had, uh,

1759
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:09,540
like you get to know the
ecosystem of the place.

1760
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:13,860
It gets to know how it works and you
get to see like he was dating this girl,

1761
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:14,580
right?

1762
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:18,830
And the girl was over by the DJ booth
and I'm talking to her and I'm my castle,

1763
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:21,230
what's going on? Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. You know, we're just talking,

1764
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,770
she's talking totally normal like this.

1765
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:25,980
And all of a sudden this guy walks in
and the guy had like a poster poster

1766
01:38:25,981 --> 01:38:29,490
workers jacket on. So he's not a guy that
makes a ton of money, right. As you know,

1767
01:38:29,491 --> 01:38:33,180
it works for the post office. So he
comes in, he's got a baseball hat on,

1768
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:35,580
it looks like he's
probably about 50 and she,

1769
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:39,840
she all of a sudden turns it on and I
saw it and it was like, it was shocking.

1770
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:43,560
It was like when you see your cat
kill a mouse for the first time,

1771
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:45,810
you ever see a cat kill a
mouse and you love that cat.

1772
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:49,530
But all of a sudden bang that candidate
fucking this mouse up. And it's like,

1773
01:38:49,531 --> 01:38:53,040
Whoa, you evil bitch. Like, I never
knew this about you. Well, you know,

1774
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:55,980
I'm talking to her. She seems totally
normal and this guy comes in, she's like,

1775
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:58,400
hey baby.

1776
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:02,340
And she comes running over to this guy
and you can see ways poor fuck is just

1777
01:39:02,341 --> 01:39:06,720
smitten. He is just so sad. And
she's like, oh my God, you're here.

1778
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:10,830
And she puts her one hand on his lower
back and one hand on his chest and he's

1779
01:39:10,831 --> 01:39:11,900
got his arms around her,

1780
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:15,210
both of them class behind him and she's
like rubbing up against them. I'm like,

1781
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:18,000
Whoa, I'm watching. I'm watching a victim.

1782
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:21,170
Like she's going to inject him with
venom and suck all the money out of it.

1783
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:26,040
But this guy had bought her a truck,
he bought her a Yukon Denali.

1784
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:28,410
She had was having problems with her car,

1785
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:33,590
so he bought her a fucking car and an
expensive one was super luxury doubt.

1786
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:36,730
Denali's still like just like
Cadillacs and escalades. No,

1787
01:39:36,731 --> 01:39:39,660
just as nice but just trunk
space. You have to, dude, it was,

1788
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:42,510
it was the craziest thing ever. It
was watching and it was like, whoa.

1789
01:39:42,511 --> 01:39:45,070
Like this is like, but this
isn't nature man. This is,

1790
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:48,210
this is just as just as natural
as any other thing, you know,

1791
01:39:48,211 --> 01:39:49,070
just as natural as a,

1792
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:52,390
a bug that gets caught in a spider's
Web and get zapped with venomous.

1793
01:39:52,490 --> 01:39:56,240
Well, and also marriage, you know, the, a
lot of these guys married way too early.

1794
01:39:56,241 --> 01:39:56,511
I mean,

1795
01:39:56,511 --> 01:40:00,200
just think back then they were getting
married to 2025 so they're trapped in

1796
01:40:00,201 --> 01:40:02,580
these relationships that grow
into different people. Right.

1797
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:04,100
No wonder there's so much divorced,

1798
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:07,900
so then you're trapped with this woman
who just becomes fucking nasty and then

1799
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:09,240
they get those mom haircuts.

1800
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:13,220
They all look like they have that little
lesbian mom hair cut about and like

1801
01:40:13,221 --> 01:40:16,370
denim jeans and all kinds of things
about what your mom's going to give up

1802
01:40:16,371 --> 01:40:20,510
altogether on their bodies and then he
can go to a strip club and be with a 10

1803
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:25,840
and all the cost is maybe $22,000 after
you get that car wholesale and here he's

1804
01:40:26,751 --> 01:40:28,970
got this 10 that's just all
over him on a regular. Yeah.

1805
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:31,860
Basically that was his,
apparently his modus operandi,

1806
01:40:31,861 --> 01:40:35,670
this guy's thing was to come there after
work and just hang out and hang out for

1807
01:40:35,671 --> 01:40:38,340
hours and hours and hours and just
give this check all of his money,

1808
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:42,030
like literally gave this chick all of his
money everyday was like a new thousand

1809
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:44,860
thousand here, a thousand there are
a thousand here and I can never do.

1810
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:45,370
That's another

1811
01:40:45,370 --> 01:40:47,630
part was true clubs is I'm too worried.
Like I started thinking,

1812
01:40:47,631 --> 01:40:51,700
I'm like if I took this money
and went to Aashe I could get it.

1813
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:54,280
Okay. Yeah. Orchard

1814
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:58,800
supply hardware. How supplies. Yeah, I do.

1815
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:03,010
I'm still work on my place. Stripper
money. Money's got into my home. Yeah.

1816
01:41:03,130 --> 01:41:07,510
That's mad money. That's like, um, um, you
know, that's, I'm a ball. Seriously. Yeah.

1817
01:41:07,511 --> 01:41:10,370
Taken it and thrown your way. This
throw away all this blood. Yeah.

1818
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:11,680
I think about that all the time.

1819
01:41:11,681 --> 01:41:15,010
Even if it's going out
drinking or something like
that. I'm like, Shit, I just,

1820
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:17,270
you know, went out to eat
and I spent, you know,

1821
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:22,320
$60 I could have went and
bought a fucking groceries up.

1822
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:26,320
I hate this. You can go with the best
steak ever at a supermarket for 20 bucks.

1823
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:32,950
20 bucks. Yeah. Well if you got a big
fat thick one, aren't they like 20 bucks?

1824
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:35,530
Yeah.
To like 20 bucks.

1825
01:41:35,531 --> 01:41:38,470
Well that's like also it's like riding
the wave of these comedy careers.

1826
01:41:38,471 --> 01:41:42,370
Cause sometime point you can get like
look at like a guy like Elon gold,

1827
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:44,830
you know, the comic. He's
always been on shows.

1828
01:41:44,831 --> 01:41:47,810
He wasn't an show stacked with
Pamela Anderson. He was on, you know,

1829
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:50,880
he's been on sitcoms. She's got four
kids. Wow. Does it really? Yeah,

1830
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:54,280
he's got impressionists or you look back
Ilan gold, Seinfeld and shit like that.

1831
01:41:54,281 --> 01:41:57,080
He does a lot of good and very easy.
Very good impressions. Very pleasant.

1832
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:00,100
Good impressions of comics.
Yeah, he's very funny. Anyway,

1833
01:42:00,101 --> 01:42:04,120
so he like as on the shows
and the shows go away,

1834
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:07,750
he has just sort of ride it out and
save as much money as you possible can.

1835
01:42:07,751 --> 01:42:11,050
I'm in the same boat. It's like I got
a deal then I have nothing in that.

1836
01:42:11,051 --> 01:42:14,050
You know you have the key is to keep the
standup going so that you always have

1837
01:42:14,051 --> 01:42:14,884
something.
Yeah.

1838
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:17,290
You know that if you're standing up as
strong and you headline all over the

1839
01:42:17,291 --> 01:42:18,940
country and you get a big
following and you know,

1840
01:42:18,941 --> 01:42:20,560
especially develop an internet presence,

1841
01:42:20,561 --> 01:42:23,470
then you don't have to ever worry about
things because he always got money

1842
01:42:23,471 --> 01:42:26,590
coming in and you can always
sort of hustle on and I'm
not making a ton of money

1843
01:42:26,591 --> 01:42:29,710
doing stand up, but you
can, I can make living.

1844
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:33,070
I can definitely make what somebody,
that guy in the post office,

1845
01:42:33,071 --> 01:42:36,340
but you could but listen to, you could
be making a ton of money doing stand up.

1846
01:42:36,341 --> 01:42:38,110
You have the stent,
the comedy chops.

1847
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,500
It's just a matter of getting your
comedy out there to more people.

1848
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:42,670
That's the thing. I'm going to have
a great product. No, no, no, no.

1849
01:42:42,671 --> 01:42:44,620
That's the thing that people
come out to see me live. It's,

1850
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:47,530
it's nothing but good
shows a build borough.

1851
01:42:47,531 --> 01:42:50,740
I talked to him a lot and he told me
it's killing an obscurity. He goes,

1852
01:42:50,741 --> 01:42:54,310
2001 to 2006 was my killing
you obscurity, faith. He goes,

1853
01:42:54,311 --> 01:42:58,330
it was just crushing it every where you
go, nobody knows who the fuck you are,

1854
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:02,020
and then it just starts to snowball and
snowball and you get on this thing and

1855
01:43:02,021 --> 01:43:06,070
that thing happens and it's just getting
the people in the notoriety to have

1856
01:43:06,071 --> 01:43:08,610
people be familiar with your
shit. And then, you know,

1857
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:12,040
we'll just all start to fucking happen.
The key is to keep doing comedy.

1858
01:43:12,041 --> 01:43:13,480
When I was on a news radio,

1859
01:43:13,481 --> 01:43:16,840
like I was always constantly get
encouraged by people to not do it anymore.

1860
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:21,250
They were like, [inaudible], you're
on, you're on. You're an actor now.

1861
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:25,660
Paul Riser, who's just could have
been, you know, Seinfeld kept going,

1862
01:43:25,661 --> 01:43:28,570
all of these guys, Ray Romano was
still does stand up. G Kevin James,

1863
01:43:28,571 --> 01:43:30,820
I think is still going out there.
Doesn't do it at all anymore.

1864
01:43:30,850 --> 01:43:32,920
Riser just stopped all together.
It's like,

1865
01:43:32,921 --> 01:43:37,870
thank God I know what working with Helen
Hunt for 10 years rushes every comedy

1866
01:43:37,871 --> 01:43:42,760
instinct you have every day. You probably
like, what the fuck am I talking money?

1867
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:46,000
I mean, Michael Keaton was a stand
up. There's all these actors.

1868
01:43:46,001 --> 01:43:48,430
Didn't Michael Keaton Woosah?
I don't.

1869
01:43:48,431 --> 01:43:51,610
I haven't seen any of Michael Keaton
standup on Batman was a stand up.

1870
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:56,510
What happened with Michael Keaton? Stop.
No, he's working for a long time though.

1871
01:43:56,511 --> 01:44:01,040
He stopped. He stopped. Yeah, he, uh,
he dropped you off and they dropped.

1872
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:03,920
She came like this, uh, kind
of like character actor guy.

1873
01:44:04,130 --> 01:44:07,070
He went from being like this main
movie star too, like a break.

1874
01:44:07,071 --> 01:44:08,540
And then now he's a character actor,

1875
01:44:08,690 --> 01:44:11,420
which is really kind of a fascinating
transition. Well, he was in the movie,

1876
01:44:11,421 --> 01:44:14,660
the good guys with, um,
the other guys would, uh,

1877
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:19,110
will Farrel Farrel and see that
he's really funny. And then yeah,

1878
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:24,050
he's bringing up a TLC references. That's
it. It's just weird that, you know,

1879
01:44:24,051 --> 01:44:27,490
he was, he was a giant movie star at
one point in time. I remember the,

1880
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:31,850
the colon moving Batman three
men and a baby. Was he in that,

1881
01:44:31,890 --> 01:44:36,500
wasn't it Tom Gutenberg was in that, uh,
Steve Gutenberg. Steve Gutenberg, sorry.

1882
01:44:36,501 --> 01:44:39,790
And Dad's a Steve [inaudible]
story. Steve Gutenberg, you know,

1883
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:43,550
he's lost his mind and he, yeah.
And he used to be another one.

1884
01:44:43,551 --> 01:44:45,710
It used to be a big movie star.
And now that God can't get arrested,

1885
01:44:45,711 --> 01:44:48,590
he doesn't do anything. Well, the
day Phil Hartman was murdered,

1886
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:53,210
Steve Gutenberg shows up at Phil
Hartman's house and he didn't know Phil.

1887
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:56,180
I mean if he knew him, he knew him
like casually, like he didn't know him,

1888
01:44:56,181 --> 01:44:57,710
like I knew them or like you know,

1889
01:44:57,770 --> 01:44:59,930
someone who worked with them on
Saturday live might have known him.

1890
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:01,220
He barely knew the guy.

1891
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:05,900
So he shows up with a fucking suit and
tie standing in front of Phil Hartman's

1892
01:45:05,901 --> 01:45:06,920
house,
um,

1893
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:11,950
and acting as like a liaison between
the entertainment industry and the press

1894
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:15,020
and trying to ask the press to,
uh,

1895
01:45:15,021 --> 01:45:18,910
to use respect and to use
good judgment and say, yeah,

1896
01:45:19,050 --> 01:45:22,420
his family loan is trying time.
And the way he did it was easily move.

1897
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:25,970
He was so creepy, dude. It was
so like this poor fucking guy.

1898
01:45:25,971 --> 01:45:29,750
Like something happened. Like he'd be,
he blew a fuse or something, something,

1899
01:45:29,751 --> 01:45:30,380
something he had.

1900
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:34,160
He must have had some sort of a breakdown
because the idea of him even doing

1901
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:38,000
this and to the neighbor or
anything. No one near him. Wow.

1902
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:41,330
There was a few famous neighbors too.
He lived down the street from Sam Adams.

1903
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:46,400
I'm not Sam Adams at the fuck Samuel
Jackson Jackson. Yeah, Sam Adams.

1904
01:45:46,401 --> 01:45:47,360
The fuck's wrong with me.
I mean,

1905
01:45:47,361 --> 01:45:50,090
you had a bunch of famous neighbors
and you know, it wasn't, you know,

1906
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:52,310
someone saying, Hey, you know,
let's, this is my neighbor.

1907
01:45:52,311 --> 01:45:55,310
Please leave them alone is a guy
who just shows up and he says, the,

1908
01:45:55,311 --> 01:45:56,510
the cameras are going to be here.

1909
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:58,970
I'm just going to get on camera
and I'm gonna speak for the end.

1910
01:45:58,971 --> 01:46:00,830
He thought he was like, yeah,
it's some sort of a message.

1911
01:46:00,831 --> 01:46:02,750
But the real message that everybody
was getting out of it was like,

1912
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:06,690
why the Fuck is Steve Gutenberg there
with a suit and tie on it to save your

1913
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:07,110
seat?

1914
01:46:07,110 --> 01:46:10,200
Brian Holtzman at the Freddy Soto
Memorial. Did you ever hear about that?

1915
01:46:10,201 --> 01:46:14,340
Know where he goes? Uh,
just yells out and um,

1916
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:17,550
have you motherfuckers here?
Don't even know Freddy.

1917
01:46:17,610 --> 01:46:20,880
Just trying to fucking see if
there's a manager or an agent.

1918
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:25,390
Fuck, fuck it all you mother fuckers.

1919
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:27,370
It's true though.
He's right.

1920
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:28,631
Freddy's friends.

1921
01:46:28,631 --> 01:46:32,830
You never wonder for each friends
admitted to never being a virgin.

1922
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:35,650
Right during the memorial. He
goes, I knew Freddie would, oh,

1923
01:46:35,651 --> 01:46:38,320
get the biggest kick out of this, and
so I'm going to do it. And he goes,

1924
01:46:38,321 --> 01:46:41,230
I need to tell everybody right
now. He goes, I'm a virgin.

1925
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:46,060
Holtzman goes up after him and goes,
first line it goes, I'll fuck that virgin.

1926
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:52,610
Please go, fuck it's memorial. The please.

1927
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:54,253
Oh course.

1928
01:46:55,310 --> 01:46:58,500
Yes. I mean, that's so funny.
Holds me. It is. Anyway, so he, um,

1929
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:01,650
but then proceeds to say, look
at your mother fuckers. Like, oh,

1930
01:47:01,651 --> 01:47:05,220
looking around like
somebody here and then, um,

1931
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:10,460
Joey Diaz has the best thing that the
Maryland Martinez memorial went off on

1932
01:47:10,830 --> 01:47:15,450
this guy, Jeff Valdez. Uh, I
think he's just, look, everybody.

1933
01:47:15,451 --> 01:47:18,870
Jeff Valdez is there. Fuck
you. Jeff Valdez. You know,

1934
01:47:18,871 --> 01:47:20,460
just walking you cock sucker.

1935
01:47:20,730 --> 01:47:25,710
Maryland fucking hated you and we all
fucking hate you. Why at the memorial?

1936
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:29,490
Whoa. Maryland would love to fuck. And
then I'm doing this for you now, Joey.

1937
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:33,210
It was one of the, um, wow.
I have my hands on my face.

1938
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:37,670
Thank you Joey. Sankey douchebag.

1939
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:42,990
He's like one of these guys. Who would
you step on your own fucking mother.

1940
01:47:43,410 --> 01:47:45,350
[inaudible] yeah.
Wow.

1941
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:48,660
Who's pretty cause he knew
Maryland would love it.

1942
01:47:48,661 --> 01:47:50,460
That just like that guy
told us where he goes,

1943
01:47:50,461 --> 01:47:53,850
Maryland would want me to do
this and she would and she would,

1944
01:47:54,030 --> 01:47:56,490
I went on the road with her.
I was like, this is weird.

1945
01:47:56,491 --> 01:47:58,830
I mean I've been on the
road with Maryland Martinez,

1946
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:03,890
Mitch Hedberg. So other
guy, um, passed away. Uh,

1947
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:07,130
Dan Crawford and I was very good friends.
Was in San Francisco, which is horrible.

1948
01:48:07,131 --> 01:48:11,840
We do a benefit if you ever just San
Francisco Punch line to Dan Crawford

1949
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,760
Memorial Fund. You know, we
give a comic of free liquor,

1950
01:48:13,761 --> 01:48:17,360
light a tab for the whole year,
but they really, the scholarship,

1951
01:48:17,361 --> 01:48:19,610
because this guy was just a great guy,
great partier.

1952
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:24,310
And he was one of my good friends and
he just fucking died. We went to, sorry.

1953
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:28,490
Yeah, Brian just moved away.
He went to the hospital,

1954
01:48:28,491 --> 01:48:32,090
he was a comic living in
his dad's basement and he
went to the hospital with a

1955
01:48:32,091 --> 01:48:36,470
headache. Public Hospital. You didn't have
insurance. He's a comic, 24 years old.

1956
01:48:36,650 --> 01:48:38,510
And they said, no, we can't help you out.

1957
01:48:38,511 --> 01:48:41,930
And they said away and then he went
back and said, it's really bad.

1958
01:48:42,050 --> 01:48:44,030
You got to help me.
And they give them Vicodin.

1959
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:49,760
He went back to the garage and they found
them convulsing on the floor cause he

1960
01:48:49,761 --> 01:48:51,890
had bacteria had gotten in his brain.

1961
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:55,130
And if had they seen him the
first time when he walked in,

1962
01:48:55,131 --> 01:48:56,660
he would totally be alive.
Wow.

1963
01:48:57,500 --> 01:49:00,590
And it was just a comic can usually
kind of kid without health insurance.

1964
01:49:00,591 --> 01:49:04,070
So I mean if anybody's up in the bay
area when I'm doing the Dan Crawford

1965
01:49:04,071 --> 01:49:08,300
scholarship thing in March and we raised
money to give to like find out about

1966
01:49:08,301 --> 01:49:11,590
the date Twitter, um, yeah, I'll,
I'll definitely put it on Twitter.

1967
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:15,680
So Twitter. Wow Man. You know,
that shit happens all the time.

1968
01:49:15,681 --> 01:49:18,570
So I've been around all these
guys. I mean in Greek, Geraldo,

1969
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:22,490
did you know about Jerry
Redd? Wilson didn't, do you
know Jerry Wilson? You know,

1970
01:49:22,491 --> 01:49:26,000
I heard that happening, but I didn't know
the guy. Wilson is another great guy.

1971
01:49:26,001 --> 01:49:27,560
I knew him from the scene in New York.

1972
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:31,340
Really funny guy because
really a lot of ethnic humor,

1973
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:34,520
Irish kid and they call Jerry Redd.
Wilson gets a pilot,

1974
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:39,920
his pilots in the middle of shooting, I
think it went, what it did got canceled.

1975
01:49:39,950 --> 01:49:44,570
Anyway, the kids, he's always
working, he's in the mix
and um, he's got a headache.

1976
01:49:44,571 --> 01:49:48,040
He's got some fucking problem.
It goes to the hospital and he's waiting

1977
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:48,701
in line.

1978
01:49:48,701 --> 01:49:51,550
I guess he's waiting in the waiting
room for like an hour and a half and he

1979
01:49:51,551 --> 01:49:52,870
can't take any more.
Fuck this.

1980
01:49:52,871 --> 01:49:57,210
I'm getting out of here and he has
to go to Hawaii to film. Um, the, uh,

1981
01:49:57,250 --> 01:50:01,720
fantasy island, the new version of fantasy
island. And by the time he gets there,

1982
01:50:01,721 --> 01:50:04,240
he's so fucked up that he dies.

1983
01:50:04,510 --> 01:50:08,740
He had meningitis and he had like
green shit leaking out of his ears.

1984
01:50:08,741 --> 01:50:13,360
He had like some serious fucking infection
in his brain and he just let it go.

1985
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:16,620
You need to find a place for, you
can go get checked out. Well, yeah,

1986
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:20,020
money does the problem. Yet he just
went, he just ignored the shit he was,

1987
01:50:20,021 --> 01:50:22,460
you know, he was one of those
inpatient guys, fuck this,
I ain't got time for this.

1988
01:50:22,461 --> 01:50:23,660
Let's get out of here. You know, he had,

1989
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:26,620
his career was taking off at a
million things going on. You would,

1990
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:27,251
he was one of those guys.

1991
01:50:27,251 --> 01:50:29,590
You would talk to him and he was just
so obsessed with it. He was like, well,

1992
01:50:29,591 --> 01:50:31,690
we've got a deal right now at universal
element that doesn't get picked up and

1993
01:50:31,691 --> 01:50:35,320
got them all. Yeah. You know, he was
like hustling and Fassler. Yeah, yeah.

1994
01:50:35,321 --> 01:50:36,640
He was making it happen.
So for him,

1995
01:50:36,641 --> 01:50:38,950
that hour and a half sitting in that
waiting room was just killing him.

1996
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:42,040
So he leaves and he fucking
dies. You know, Shit.

1997
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:44,120
And you're not supposed to
fly with a sinus infection.

1998
01:50:44,121 --> 01:50:46,910
They tell you that all the time. You're
not supposed to fly with that shit flew.

1999
01:50:46,911 --> 01:50:51,260
I flew once when I had pneumonia. Oh my
God. Cause I got to get to a stupid gig.

2000
01:50:51,290 --> 01:50:54,290
Yeah. And I just want you to, I'll fly
when I go to the Pacific northwest,

2001
01:50:54,291 --> 01:50:57,630
it feels like my head's gonna
fuck, next one. Wow. So, um, you,

2002
01:50:57,631 --> 01:51:01,070
you do that shit all the time. And
do you, I mean, you've got to find,

2003
01:51:01,370 --> 01:51:04,040
I sometimes get a little overboard
hypochondriac a little bit.

2004
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:08,830
Well, you know, I got sick for the
first time this year in fucking years.

2005
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:10,870
I haven't gotten sick and I slacked off.

2006
01:51:10,871 --> 01:51:14,020
And here's one of the reasons
why I take a lot of probiotics.

2007
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:16,510
I drink like Kombucha.
That's Kombucha tea.

2008
01:51:16,511 --> 01:51:18,700
It's fucking super good
for your health is healthy.

2009
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:19,810
The coconut juice is great too.

2010
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:24,010
But what happened with Kombucha is they
got in trouble with whole foods because

2011
01:51:24,011 --> 01:51:28,780
they're, their shit was more than one half
of 1% alcohol, so it has to be labeled.

2012
01:51:29,110 --> 01:51:32,120
So they watered the fuck down their water,

2013
01:51:32,121 --> 01:51:36,040
their formula like seriously wandered
down where it tastes like shit.

2014
01:51:36,041 --> 01:51:39,700
It does not taste near it's gts.
Kombucha. It used to taste awesome.

2015
01:51:39,701 --> 01:51:43,030
It was like very carbonated, very
strong. And I really enjoyed the flavor,

2016
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:44,320
but then it became like this,

2017
01:51:44,321 --> 01:51:47,830
like literally it feels like it's half
water and half what it used to be.

2018
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:52,270
And I just, I think it's not, it's
not nearly as active, like the,

2019
01:51:52,271 --> 01:51:55,030
the probiotics in, and I don't
think they're nearly as strong.

2020
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:56,980
So I got sick like for
the first time ever.

2021
01:51:57,010 --> 01:51:59,830
He really think that's why you got
sick. Yeah. You know why? Absolutely.

2022
01:51:59,831 --> 01:52:00,521
This is why I think it,

2023
01:52:00,521 --> 01:52:03,730
because I've never been sick before
and I've been drinking that shit almost

2024
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:08,530
every day. So it, it changes
within a month of it changing.

2025
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:12,040
I go and I get sick for the first time.
I, um, I really think that makes sense.

2026
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:15,810
So I went to a vitamin SHOPPE and I walked
in there and I was deathly ill and I

2027
01:52:15,811 --> 01:52:16,051
said,

2028
01:52:16,051 --> 01:52:20,580
what are you selling all the time that
works for immunity and I stuffed line off

2029
01:52:20,581 --> 01:52:21,370
the shelf,
what is it?

2030
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:26,250
And he took me to a thing called Saba
call black elderberry shit that you drank

2031
01:52:26,251 --> 01:52:27,090
and there's pills for it.

2032
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:30,570
I would take Dan on a regular basis
whenever I get sick cleaned right off.

2033
01:52:30,810 --> 01:52:31,770
I mean,
it really does work.

2034
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:35,520
There are definitely probiotics and what
they do is they attack all the negative

2035
01:52:35,521 --> 01:52:38,790
shit in your body. All the
unhealthy bacteria, you know,

2036
01:52:38,791 --> 01:52:42,210
it's like you're keeping healthy troops
on hand. Acidophilus is a big one.

2037
01:52:42,211 --> 01:52:44,220
I hadn't taken acidophilus in forever.

2038
01:52:44,221 --> 01:52:46,040
I will see that reason is
because I was drinking this

2039
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,580
Kombucha all the time. I was like, I
don't need to supplement with acidophilus.

2040
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:52,370
I'm getting plenty of probiotics from
this. So then once this stuff went bad,

2041
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:56,750
I started taking acidophilus again now
to Gas Davos every day. That's the milk.

2042
01:52:57,140 --> 01:53:00,560
Yeah, it's an, it's a milk culture.
Yogurt. You could buy it and pills.

2043
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:05,690
It'll live for me. You have to keep it
a frigerator, you know? But it's uh,

2044
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:07,490
you know, especially
as you get older, man,

2045
01:53:07,491 --> 01:53:09,190
he started reading real
cognizant of your health.

2046
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:11,700
Yeah, I started thinking about
it. I go to the gym and I was,

2047
01:53:11,701 --> 01:53:12,970
I've been trying to go every single day.

2048
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:16,410
I get my resolution is holding up so
far and I even if I could just go for a

2049
01:53:16,411 --> 01:53:16,771
little bit,

2050
01:53:16,771 --> 01:53:20,250
I get my heart going and I stretch and
I can just trying to keep everything in

2051
01:53:20,251 --> 01:53:21,510
shape cause I'm on,
you know

2052
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:25,300
you don't talk into the microphone
dude. Your votes varies. Oh is it? Okay.

2053
01:53:25,330 --> 01:53:27,850
I forget. Sorry, I'm looking at you at
the same time. No, that's all right.

2054
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:28,511
Let's turn.

2055
01:53:28,511 --> 01:53:31,570
So we don't have to do that because it's
like your voice is like real low and

2056
01:53:31,571 --> 01:53:32,470
then all of a sudden it's real high.

2057
01:53:32,471 --> 01:53:36,790
So that people on the ecliptical machine
right now with their headphones in and

2058
01:53:36,791 --> 01:53:39,730
like this fucking owl magical.
Tell them where the Mike is. Right?

2059
01:53:39,731 --> 01:53:43,730
That's not a dissident. See where the
sign is, where the words are. Yeah.

2060
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:46,810
That's the part we should talk to you.
Perfect. That was on the top of it.

2061
01:53:47,230 --> 01:53:49,420
You were ready dude.
You were right there

2062
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:54,910
anyway. So you go to the gym. Yeah.
Take taking your better care of myself.

2063
01:53:54,911 --> 01:53:55,660
I feel like I could,

2064
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:58,720
when I saw that UFC fight for the first
ready felt like I can fucking get in

2065
01:53:58,721 --> 01:54:01,510
there, lock somebody up. I certainly
feel like I have the mindset for it.

2066
01:54:01,511 --> 01:54:05,140
Like I really feel like I can kick some
killer. I used to fire people, you know,

2067
01:54:05,141 --> 01:54:06,880
that was my job when you
first met me and said,

2068
01:54:06,881 --> 01:54:10,590
I like up in the air with George
Clooney. Yeah. I used to be, I'm avid.

2069
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:13,950
I terminated over a thousand people.
Yeah.

2070
01:54:14,260 --> 01:54:17,800
I'm just saying that was my job and my
parents' family businesses that I used to

2071
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:21,010
be the fucking hatchet man.
Karma shit going on.

2072
01:54:21,011 --> 01:54:24,670
Well now they deserved it for the most
part. And so, but sometimes you headed to,

2073
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:27,280
you'd send an unfortunate time.
It's like it's not,

2074
01:54:27,281 --> 01:54:30,040
it's like a privilege to be
working in having somebody pay you.

2075
01:54:30,041 --> 01:54:32,380
If you had a fucking employee and
you didn't have the money anymore,

2076
01:54:33,070 --> 01:54:34,000
there's nothing else we can do.

2077
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:34,710
It's,

2078
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:37,800
there's a bunch of different
ways of looking at this
economy being all fucked up.

2079
01:54:37,801 --> 01:54:40,860
And I see some people who
are very pragmatic look at
it like, hey, you know what,

2080
01:54:40,861 --> 01:54:43,080
these jobs,
these jobs that these people are losing,

2081
01:54:43,110 --> 01:54:45,780
these jobs weren't important in the first
place. These motherfuckers, you know,

2082
01:54:45,781 --> 01:54:48,870
we lost all our jobs overseas and what
we need to do is strengthen our economy

2083
01:54:48,871 --> 01:54:50,970
and this is just a
symptom of a bigger evil.

2084
01:54:51,210 --> 01:54:54,030
I see that but an individual
one on one basis, man,

2085
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:56,400
whenever I think about these people
that are going broke and people that are

2086
01:54:56,401 --> 01:54:58,260
losing their houses and people
that don't know what to do,

2087
01:54:58,470 --> 01:55:01,920
especially if I think that they're
dumb and that their, you know, their,

2088
01:55:01,921 --> 01:55:05,490
their occupation options are limited and
then they have children and shit too.

2089
01:55:05,491 --> 01:55:06,660
It's like fuck man,

2090
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:10,290
these poor Fox were led to believe that
this whole thing that this ship was

2091
01:55:10,291 --> 01:55:12,150
going to sail and it's going to be fine.

2092
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:14,230
Well also it's what you were
talking about with stand up.

2093
01:55:14,231 --> 01:55:17,680
If you just decide to check
out and work and you just like,

2094
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:21,620
you reach a $30,000 job and you say
this is, it is all I need. Right.

2095
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:22,750
My father in law did that shed.

2096
01:55:22,751 --> 01:55:26,200
He's the type of guy who would go and
sit in a big recliner and get like a

2097
01:55:26,201 --> 01:55:29,830
thirsty to ouncer just fucking sit
there and watch TV, no aspirations.

2098
01:55:29,831 --> 01:55:33,460
Did you do anything? And he plays
golf, but people are looking like that.

2099
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:35,920
There's a lot of people like that.
A lot of people like that.

2100
01:55:35,921 --> 01:55:38,410
You just become complacent. You're
like, this is good right here.

2101
01:55:38,490 --> 01:55:41,370
I don't know if it's bad.
I think there's a machine going on man.

2102
01:55:41,371 --> 01:55:44,160
I think we're all little
pieces of this giant machine,

2103
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:44,731
you know?

2104
01:55:44,731 --> 01:55:48,500
And I think you can look at it like what
you're doing is very important and then

2105
01:55:48,501 --> 01:55:51,770
what you're doing has meaning to it.
But really it has meaning to you.

2106
01:55:51,771 --> 01:55:53,610
And I was meaning to the people
who like it. But what is,

2107
01:55:53,611 --> 01:55:58,290
what is its place in the overall grand
scheme? I don't know man. I don't know.

2108
01:55:58,291 --> 01:56:00,790
I mean these people sit in there
with drinks. They might be honest on,

2109
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:02,960
often they might be on to something.

2110
01:56:02,980 --> 01:56:06,960
The guy who was the bouncer
just devour and no job.

2111
01:56:07,530 --> 01:56:10,170
That guy was not on the something.
I don't, I don't believe that.

2112
01:56:10,890 --> 01:56:12,630
I think that kind of needs
to get a real fucking job.

2113
01:56:13,410 --> 01:56:15,090
Certainly 40 year old sewers.
Genius.

2114
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:18,350
We need all the super genius is telling
people not to puke on his shoes.

2115
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:21,550
Good projects. Yeah, no hats. Yeah.

2116
01:56:23,370 --> 01:56:25,410
Super Genius. Yeah. No hats. No hats.

2117
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:28,710
My favorite is like they tell you how to
wear your hat. Like no hats backwards.

2118
01:56:28,711 --> 01:56:31,200
Like I like wearing hats backwards.
That's how I wear actually,

2119
01:56:31,201 --> 01:56:33,600
because when I play pool,
I can see the balls better.

2120
01:56:33,601 --> 01:56:35,310
I don't want a big fucking floppy bill,

2121
01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:37,250
but I went into a pool hall
wants and the guy's like,

2122
01:56:37,251 --> 01:56:41,250
you gotta turn your cap around like what?
You've got to turn my hat around.

2123
01:56:41,251 --> 01:56:45,930
Like really? That's your rule. That
sloppy and had around in front ways.

2124
01:56:45,990 --> 01:56:49,170
All that's fucking someone's
[inaudible] remember one. Yeah.

2125
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:52,260
Especially when you wear it
up high a little bit. Oh,

2126
01:56:52,261 --> 01:56:54,660
the other thing was no wallet chains
could have wall chains either.

2127
01:56:54,661 --> 01:56:59,370
I had to put my wallet chain in my
pocket, choke out God, Gotham comedy club.

2128
01:56:59,371 --> 01:57:01,460
I remember that. Did they
have no wall chains? No, no.

2129
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:05,220
A new hats allowed at Gotham comedy club.
I'm like, yeah, it's like a comedy club.

2130
01:57:05,221 --> 01:57:08,070
And they were still getting it on me while
you were filming there. And I'm like,

2131
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:12,210
no, I'm with Joe. And they still were
like, man, can you take it off? Wow,

2132
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:16,950
come on. That's so silly. What
looks worse? A hat or a hat head?

2133
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:20,910
Definitely hat head. Well, who's
getting offended by hats? I mean,

2134
01:57:20,911 --> 01:57:23,820
it's one thing if you wait some crazy
fucking Phyllis Diller thing with the

2135
01:57:23,821 --> 01:57:28,380
feathers. No one can see
behind you. Fucking Charlie
Chaplin was the last person.

2136
01:57:28,381 --> 01:57:29,730
And be offended by a hat,
you know,

2137
01:57:29,731 --> 01:57:32,930
or somebody back in the day where
they take off hats every time you eat.

2138
01:57:32,931 --> 01:57:35,570
Here it is, it's sort of a
three stooges. Like you know,

2139
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:37,440
they invade the rich people's party.

2140
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:40,520
And another one of my favorites is when
you go somewhere and they say you're

2141
01:57:40,521 --> 01:57:43,650
sure it has to have a collar. Like,
oh, we talked about that before,

2142
01:57:43,820 --> 01:57:47,880
the podcast about what it's like
in a, uh, a lot of parks in la.

2143
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:51,750
It says a big science has no soccer,
no parties,

2144
01:57:52,170 --> 01:57:56,520
and like no soccer, no parties.
Why not just say no Mexicans?

2145
01:57:57,950 --> 01:58:02,880
We use Mexicans elsewhere. No soccer.
Why would not you not want soccer?

2146
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:06,990
I guess people are trying to have
picnics, right? Playing soccer.

2147
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:10,680
If you're white, I think you can
sort of do whatever you want.

2148
01:58:10,681 --> 01:58:14,280
If a Latino soccer game breaks out, which
they've been known to in Los Angeles,

2149
01:58:14,310 --> 01:58:18,460
they stop it. They stop it. Arius,
man, it's a fucking park. Is it the,

2150
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:21,900
are they thinking that they dominate the
park and they make it unsafe for whites?

2151
01:58:21,990 --> 01:58:24,090
I have no idea. They just, you're there.

2152
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:28,320
I know the old white guys at the top
of that. I can. He's making that.

2153
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:30,060
Is that what that is? It's gotta be, yeah.

2154
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:33,570
Trying to bring it back the
way it was in the 50s sure.

2155
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:37,980
No Latino Park disturbance. I've
watched a, a bad men where they just,

2156
01:58:37,981 --> 01:58:42,981
they're in a park and they take their
big blanket and they just dump the thing

2157
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:47,290
and shake out the blanket and all the
garbage just goes everywhere and then they

2158
01:58:47,291 --> 01:58:51,850
just walk away. That's how they should
do shit. Just litter and fucking the,

2159
01:58:51,851 --> 01:58:53,750
you know,
in our public parks were just complete.

2160
01:58:53,751 --> 01:58:55,510
What you were talking about
earlier with the water supply.

2161
01:58:56,080 --> 01:59:00,290
That's how people used the rocket.
Just if I can throw a coke out the window,

2162
01:59:00,310 --> 01:59:03,640
the window, it's, people still do
that all the time with cigarettes.

2163
01:59:03,641 --> 01:59:06,270
Do you do that Brian? Please
say you don't know. No, I, I uh,

2164
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:09,970
knocked the cherry off into a, uh, uh,

2165
01:59:10,150 --> 01:59:13,880
usually have like a can in my
car and then I just, I've seen,

2166
01:59:13,910 --> 01:59:17,830
I've seen people throw burger king
bags out the window. I honked like,

2167
01:59:17,831 --> 01:59:22,150
what do I mean I did, I don't know why a
honk, I just walked in Hawk, right? Like,

2168
01:59:22,151 --> 01:59:26,870
Hey, that's fucked up. And a big hand came
out and just went, yeah, of course. Yeah.

2169
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:28,180
There's a lot of cons out there.

2170
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:30,750
We were forced them on
teenagers and I see a lot.

2171
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:34,570
I see he's fucking Prius's
those Toyota Prius's.

2172
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:37,900
And then I see the person driving the
Prius, flick a cigarette out the window.

2173
01:59:37,990 --> 01:59:41,700
I see that shit all Athens high,
save the earth tight.

2174
01:59:41,770 --> 01:59:45,520
I mark it down. I see it so
many times. I mark it down.

2175
01:59:45,530 --> 01:59:47,130
I've seen it seven times,

2176
01:59:47,890 --> 01:59:51,220
seven times over the past three years
that I've been looking for it. Yeah,

2177
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:53,170
it's definitely something that,

2178
01:59:53,220 --> 01:59:58,220
that people do in other states all the
time in California and they don't do it

2179
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:02,140
during the drive. Less littering
quite a bit in the Midwest. Yeah.

2180
02:00:02,141 --> 02:00:04,960
You didn't even think about it in Ohio,
that sort of what everyone does.

2181
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:07,550
Like I didn't get it until when
I first moved out here. And you,

2182
02:00:07,610 --> 02:00:11,230
you got mad at me cause I
flick my cigarette on the
ground and he got mad at me.

2183
02:00:11,231 --> 02:00:13,510
I'm like, what? It's just a
cigarette. And then you were like,

2184
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:14,860
pick that up Brian and blah blah.

2185
02:00:14,861 --> 02:00:17,230
I'm like never heard anyone
telling me to pick up a cigarette.

2186
02:00:17,231 --> 02:00:20,260
But there's a lot of people,
I mean there's the cigarettes are going,

2187
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:23,620
there's a lot of people burning street
burning trash in their backyard as well.

2188
02:00:23,710 --> 02:00:25,750
Like that shit's happening.
Yeah, that's happening.

2189
02:00:25,751 --> 02:00:30,100
I mean I'm sure people are listening
where that's commonly done or you have all

2190
02:00:30,101 --> 02:00:33,900
this douchey behavior. How do you
stop it? What the fuck do you do to,

2191
02:00:33,940 --> 02:00:37,120
to change people? What do you do to turn
people around? How do you, what do you,

2192
02:00:37,121 --> 02:00:40,270
what do you do? You just kinda just
concentrate on yourself. I mean,

2193
02:00:40,271 --> 02:00:44,020
you volunteer or something and try to
help. I mean, you could go the extra step.

2194
02:00:44,021 --> 02:00:46,240
I mean, if you can't control
your own shit, first of all,

2195
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:47,980
like my wife has recycling.

2196
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:51,910
Like everything I get yelled at for not
putting something in a fucking resize to.

2197
02:00:51,950 --> 02:00:56,200
Yeah. Okay. But meanwhile some Chinese
guy down the block is burning a tire,

2198
02:00:56,530 --> 02:00:58,820
you know, it's fucking,
what the fuck? I mean,

2199
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:02,200
how am I supposed to really care
that much? She gets separated out.

2200
02:01:02,201 --> 02:01:04,840
The homeless people are coming by two
of my neighborhood and rooting through

2201
02:01:04,841 --> 02:01:08,950
everything. They're like sorting it.
It'll get sorted out eventually. Shit.

2202
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:12,100
So like, anyway, but how
are you supposed to care?

2203
02:01:12,101 --> 02:01:14,260
You can only worry about yourself.
And it's the same thing.

2204
02:01:14,261 --> 02:01:16,850
We stand up and like that's what we've
been talking about the entire time.

2205
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:18,190
And she was right.
But as a whole,

2206
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:22,270
if you looked at the human race or it
looked at just the human race in America,

2207
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:25,150
you know though, the ones
that we understand, the
culture that we understand,

2208
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:28,120
how the fuck do you fix it?
How do you fix this culture?

2209
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:33,210
Is everyone getting organized to going
one common goal of living in harmony and

2210
02:01:33,221 --> 02:01:35,130
login in a safe and clean environment?

2211
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:38,170
I mean there'll be no crime and
she'll throw in burger king bags.

2212
02:01:38,171 --> 02:01:40,840
I was window and giving you the finger.
How do you connect to that?

2213
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:45,170
I don't think there's any way can take
connect to that guy because that guy

2214
02:01:45,171 --> 02:01:48,740
would maybe was brought up in a house
where it was a homeless kid and didn't

2215
02:01:48,741 --> 02:01:49,390
have any games.

2216
02:01:49,390 --> 02:01:53,300
You had this horrible fucking life
that you know and to just a Douche bag,

2217
02:01:53,301 --> 02:01:56,930
just a fat Douche bag in his dad's a
fat dude. I've got all kinds of things.

2218
02:01:56,931 --> 02:01:58,980
Like when I see people on pay phones,
I'm like,

2219
02:01:59,030 --> 02:02:03,230
there was no reason why you
shouldn't have of og and cell phone.

2220
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:05,090
No,
I'm just talking about like,

2221
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:09,950
I mean they're giving them away and
like if you're broke and you're on a pay

2222
02:02:09,951 --> 02:02:12,080
phone,
it's used for something illegal.

2223
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:16,850
Tap every single fucking one of those
and just arrest those fucking seriously.

2224
02:02:17,210 --> 02:02:19,060
Funny. That could easily
just be broke people dude.

2225
02:02:19,070 --> 02:02:23,020
Or if someone loses their phone,
40 ounce, like an elitist,

2226
02:02:23,450 --> 02:02:26,360
a 40 ounce, 40 nothing
good has ever come. Great.

2227
02:02:26,361 --> 02:02:28,460
If you want to watch
superfly and review it,

2228
02:02:28,461 --> 02:02:31,550
that the best thing to drink right
now is that once with a buddy of mine,

2229
02:02:31,551 --> 02:02:35,370
we watched the country club. Country
Club is another one. What is it?

2230
02:02:35,630 --> 02:02:39,380
It's another malt liquor. They'd say,
Oh yeah, we had old English and um,

2231
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:43,730
there was another one,
fuck, I forget what it was,

2232
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,000
but there's a bunch of those that are
only there really marketed something.

2233
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:51,170
King Cobra, I think it was marketed for
the black community, like straight up,

2234
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:55,100
you know, taste to go down easy.
Like even the way it's written,

2235
02:02:55,101 --> 02:02:59,720
like the ads are written just like
just straight to the African American

2236
02:02:59,721 --> 02:03:01,400
community.
And when you start drinking that stuff,

2237
02:03:01,670 --> 02:03:05,720
those are so strong and they're so
strong and you don't give a fuck.

2238
02:03:05,930 --> 02:03:09,440
You drink that shit. You don't give
a fuck. He started drinking Boone's,

2239
02:03:09,441 --> 02:03:11,410
is that what it's called?
Like strawberry farm billion.

2240
02:03:11,530 --> 02:03:15,730
There was night train engineers. Is that
Boone strawberry farm or sweet wines?

2241
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:19,250
Sweet wine. That was like
marketed to taste really good.

2242
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:23,780
Grape one like grape juice. Grape juice
for purple drank and really is. Yeah,

2243
02:03:23,781 --> 02:03:28,520
they could, yeah. How do you
fix that? Well, there's also
Cisco and all that Shit.

2244
02:03:28,521 --> 02:03:33,230
Let me just really high all alcohol
content. We know that Loko four Loko.

2245
02:03:33,230 --> 02:03:36,220
Do you hear about that one? I had it
pulled it off the market. Oh yeah.

2246
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:39,110
Somebody had it on new years of that
will wasn't sure that I was telling you

2247
02:03:39,111 --> 02:03:43,280
about. I took a shot of it all
night was help a heart palpitation.

2248
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:47,090
Whoa. I really felt like it was
a four Loko really fucked me up.

2249
02:03:47,210 --> 02:03:48,640
I've heard people died off.
Yeah.

2250
02:03:48,690 --> 02:03:53,690
A couple of people are saying it's a
band and somebody had a big ass can Audi.

2251
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:58,580
You got to try it for local coach band.
Oh go. I'll just take a sip of it.

2252
02:03:59,150 --> 02:04:02,630
We took one sip and a jacket. Dude.
I feel like it fucked my whole night.

2253
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:06,290
I had the most surreal new
year's Sacramento punchline a,

2254
02:04:06,440 --> 02:04:11,370
it's in a strip mall next to us.
Sleep trained and I intend to uh, um,

2255
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:15,590
how about Arden Mall? It's in a
strip mall. It is Barbara College.

2256
02:04:15,591 --> 02:04:20,000
You've been to that place, have a
phone, a cell phone store. A yeah,

2257
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:23,210
in a strip mall at the upstairs,
next big mattress store.

2258
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:27,590
All kinds of weird shops. Red lobster
next to a Tony Roma's next to an outback.

2259
02:04:27,591 --> 02:04:28,960
Like nothing.
Right.

2260
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:34,040
And I mean there on new years and people
had paid $50 a ticket to go to this new

2261
02:04:34,041 --> 02:04:38,040
year's show and it was a good shot. I mean
I really, I didn't get up and half ass

2262
02:04:38,790 --> 02:04:42,360
50 odd ticket,
but it was weird.

2263
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:46,710
Then spending your New Year's
in login strip mall dancing.

2264
02:04:46,711 --> 02:04:50,940
Some guy who are dom Perignon strip mall
and he's trying to show off in front of

2265
02:04:50,941 --> 02:04:54,300
his girlfriend and a fight broke out
because somebody spilled it. Wow.

2266
02:04:54,970 --> 02:04:57,540
There's a whole weird,
and I was filming the whole thing.

2267
02:04:57,700 --> 02:05:00,320
I was filling this one lady lip.
I really was on my flip.

2268
02:05:00,340 --> 02:05:04,680
I'm going to add the video, I'll make sure
I put that on Twitter as well. But um,

2269
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:08,930
people came up to me, he's
like, are you filming our mom?
I go, no, I'm not familiar.

2270
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:12,300
I sorta was filming their mom, not
really, you couldn't make out who it was.

2271
02:05:12,301 --> 02:05:16,980
And my flip camera and then the kid
who's the son of the mom who was dancing,

2272
02:05:16,981 --> 02:05:19,470
it was dancing really fucking
funny with his young Latino Kid.

2273
02:05:19,471 --> 02:05:23,400
And she was old and this Latino kid was
just dry humping or on the dance floor.

2274
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:28,230
So I'm like, this is my new years as you
know, what a horrible fucking new years.

2275
02:05:28,260 --> 02:05:30,750
And uh,
they came up and the guy says,

2276
02:05:30,751 --> 02:05:34,410
I've been looking for an excuse to
kick your ass the whole night. Oh,

2277
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:35,290
I know what the

2278
02:05:35,290 --> 02:05:38,980
why. Where'd that come from? I
haven't fucking done anything like

2279
02:05:39,260 --> 02:05:41,090
it was a horrible fucking new years.

2280
02:05:42,150 --> 02:05:46,570
Sounds better than mine though. What do
see where outside of the house stayed in?

2281
02:05:46,730 --> 02:05:50,800
I uh, Brian had a fight with his
girl on the ears, man. Girl left.

2282
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:55,000
Scroll left him on new years, man.
That same girl you're talking about.

2283
02:05:55,001 --> 02:05:59,440
Not only does girl leave him on New
Year's trashy vixen, it's a long story.

2284
02:05:59,441 --> 02:06:01,930
I'm sorry. That's not
cool. You don't have to,

2285
02:06:01,931 --> 02:06:04,930
we'll have to play that prince line again.
Trust me.

2286
02:06:04,931 --> 02:06:08,080
It's for the best at this time or
last time. Uh, she broke up with them.

2287
02:06:08,081 --> 02:06:10,540
We had to play the prince on.
I got a broken heart again.

2288
02:06:13,970 --> 02:06:16,060
You really feel bad about it?
No, I don't feel bad at all.

2289
02:06:17,170 --> 02:06:20,100
This is what I described it as the same
way I described people who are do should

2290
02:06:20,101 --> 02:06:22,720
you on the internet that it's
like a little bit of snake venom.

2291
02:06:22,990 --> 02:06:25,570
It a little bit of snake venom
gets you immune to snake venom.

2292
02:06:25,690 --> 02:06:28,660
So that's named after a bite you three
or four times after. Why? Like, Hey,

2293
02:06:28,690 --> 02:06:31,400
get the fuck outta here. You know,
poisoning me anymore. She was, yeah,

2294
02:06:31,570 --> 02:06:34,930
she was one of those relationships where
like we would break up and then you

2295
02:06:34,931 --> 02:06:35,051
know,

2296
02:06:35,051 --> 02:06:38,500
something happened and then I would take
her back just because I know how broken

2297
02:06:38,501 --> 02:06:39,070
she is.

2298
02:06:39,070 --> 02:06:43,640
And then this third time was
just like so quick and fast like,

2299
02:06:43,670 --> 02:06:46,680
like we started dating again and next
thing I know she's almost moved in.

2300
02:06:46,710 --> 02:06:51,340
She's talking about getting married and
like this is like in two weeks and she

2301
02:06:51,341 --> 02:06:54,460
just got out of a relationship with this
guy like cheated on her or something

2302
02:06:54,461 --> 02:06:59,230
like that. And it was the most
intense zero to 60 in two weeks.

2303
02:06:59,410 --> 02:07:02,460
And then one day I was just out of
nowhere, she just started going crazy,

2304
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:05,560
picking fights with me out of nowhere.
I'm like, what the fuck is going on?

2305
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:09,670
Next thing I know next day she's
tweeting her ex boyfriend like pictures

2306
02:07:09,671 --> 02:07:14,080
together and like are
you fuck is going on?

2307
02:07:14,190 --> 02:07:17,500
Oh and I keep on finding all this shit.
She left at my house.

2308
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:20,920
And one of the thing is is like she had
a memory card in my camera that she must

2309
02:07:20,921 --> 02:07:22,750
have used my camera.
And the funniest thing is,

2310
02:07:22,751 --> 02:07:27,580
is like pictures of her and this guy
and then the next day pictures of me in

2311
02:07:27,581 --> 02:07:28,414
her,

2312
02:07:28,860 --> 02:07:33,860
it's like do I he exact same poses like
arms around each other and it like two

2313
02:07:35,471 --> 02:07:35,980
days it

2314
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,880
was actually a photo shopped
in over that other guy. Yeah.

2315
02:07:39,450 --> 02:07:42,660
Well you know what it is and this is,
this is how I describe it to you.

2316
02:07:42,810 --> 02:07:47,220
There's some people that are addicted to
that charge of an initial relationship.

2317
02:07:47,221 --> 02:07:48,940
When someone is just in love with you.

2318
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:51,390
You know when you meet
someone man and you, you know,

2319
02:07:51,391 --> 02:07:55,230
you fucking really click and you're
hanging out in your fucking like four or

2320
02:07:55,231 --> 02:07:59,070
five times a day and you just kissing all
the time and you can't wait to see him.

2321
02:07:59,220 --> 02:08:03,210
That's like an intense fucking,
you know, intense romantic thing.

2322
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:06,920
And then I got married. Yeah, that
works that way sometimes. Yeah.

2323
02:08:07,050 --> 02:08:10,770
And then when you are in a situation
where, let's be quite honest about this,

2324
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:14,760
the girl, perhaps it might be a bit above
you on the food chain, right? Not a lot,

2325
02:08:14,761 --> 02:08:16,390
but a bit, right? Well then yeah,

2326
02:08:16,410 --> 02:08:19,500
then you're stepping on eggshells because
you're afraid of offending her because

2327
02:08:19,501 --> 02:08:22,230
you're in the situation. You're like,
Jesus, I don't want to fuck this up.

2328
02:08:22,231 --> 02:08:24,900
Like this is the greatest thing of
all time here. This is so perfect.

2329
02:08:24,990 --> 02:08:25,980
She's got the perfect body.

2330
02:08:25,981 --> 02:08:28,280
They're not going to find one of these
and telling all my friends, dude,

2331
02:08:28,281 --> 02:08:30,240
look at this picture. Can you believe
I'm fucking this? This is the same.

2332
02:08:30,690 --> 02:08:31,710
And so then you know,

2333
02:08:31,980 --> 02:08:36,980
they get addicted to that really intense
part of the relationship where you just

2334
02:08:36,991 --> 02:08:39,420
enamored by them and then as time goes on,

2335
02:08:39,630 --> 02:08:42,630
you get comfortable with each other and
then she becomes your girlfriend and

2336
02:08:42,631 --> 02:08:43,710
when she becomes your girlfriend,

2337
02:08:43,830 --> 02:08:46,110
then you just kind of like lack
of days ago around each other.

2338
02:08:46,111 --> 02:08:49,050
You don't care if your hair is fucked up,
you don't care if your breath smells,

2339
02:08:49,051 --> 02:08:52,930
hey, you know you pay with the door open.
You know, you have a flat box each other.

2340
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:55,070
She doesn't give a fuck either.
And so you know it,

2341
02:08:55,071 --> 02:08:58,680
it becomes some weird thing where you
just get real comfortable with each other

2342
02:08:58,681 --> 02:09:00,300
and you don't fuck as much.

2343
02:09:00,420 --> 02:09:04,170
And then some other guy comes along and
that other guy shows the same potential

2344
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:07,410
for being the guy that's so in
love with you. And this is it.

2345
02:09:07,411 --> 02:09:09,750
It's supposed to be about us.
We've had some problems in the past.

2346
02:09:09,870 --> 02:09:12,420
We're going to fucking stick
together forever for till death.

2347
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:14,550
We're going to have babies.
Yes.

2348
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:18,540
And then the range is on again and
it's just as mad fucking crazy.

2349
02:09:18,541 --> 02:09:22,290
Dash from one person to the next
who can provide the next charge,

2350
02:09:22,291 --> 02:09:25,920
the next beginning of the
relationship. Thunderous, you know,

2351
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:28,620
orgasmic type of a interaction.

2352
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:32,360
And it sucks because I've gotten to the
age where I totally know that, you know,

2353
02:09:32,361 --> 02:09:36,170
and, and so I am like, this person
gets hurt. And I'm like, you know,

2354
02:09:36,530 --> 02:09:37,400
I want you to know,

2355
02:09:37,430 --> 02:09:40,580
I can tell you what happened to
our relationship and you know,

2356
02:09:40,581 --> 02:09:45,320
we can really work this together and
I'll do the stupid take girl back from I

2357
02:09:45,321 --> 02:09:47,660
need to, I need, I don't
know, I just need to stop.

2358
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:51,650
You know what man is stop
dating girls started dating guys

2359
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:57,710
and they're like all this shit that's at
my house. And I'm like, Oh wow, a sock,

2360
02:09:57,740 --> 02:10:00,620
a bra. And I'm like, I need to date guys.
Cause then they can leave things like,

2361
02:10:00,650 --> 02:10:04,550
oh Gillette sensor blades razor are,
you know, like a video game. Oh,

2362
02:10:04,551 --> 02:10:07,040
he left me a video game.
I hate the shit that,

2363
02:10:07,370 --> 02:10:12,140
that girls leave over relationships
36. Oh, that's good. How old are you?

2364
02:10:12,470 --> 02:10:15,020
39. Oh, you see, I thought
you were way younger than me.

2365
02:10:15,770 --> 02:10:18,850
Yeah. Um, I think, uh,
you know, look, it's,

2366
02:10:18,851 --> 02:10:22,770
it's hard to find someone that you fucking
drive with all the time and sometimes

2367
02:10:22,771 --> 02:10:25,620
people can keep it together for long
stretches where they really are.

2368
02:10:25,621 --> 02:10:28,110
The perfect girlfriend for
like two weeks is crazy.

2369
02:10:28,111 --> 02:10:31,350
Bitch really is the perfect girlfriend.
She's a lot of fun. She wants to cook.

2370
02:10:31,380 --> 02:10:34,310
She's hilarious. She cracks jokes,
going to look forward to seeing her.

2371
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:37,220
And then after that two weeks
they'll fucking crazy comes out.

2372
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:38,330
And after the two weeks,

2373
02:10:38,331 --> 02:10:41,090
it's what am I going to do for a living
and what am I going to do for this and

2374
02:10:41,091 --> 02:10:45,050
what happens when I get old and what am
I going to do when I'm 50 and foc and

2375
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:47,780
show these licks are not going to last
forever. I've got to kind of a strategy.

2376
02:10:47,781 --> 02:10:51,480
I got to figure out what I want to
date a blind deaf girl. Not only that,

2377
02:10:51,490 --> 02:10:54,920
you've got a date dude, ready for
this. You've got a date. Civilians,

2378
02:10:54,921 --> 02:10:58,580
civil [inaudible] aliens. Absolutely.
My wife says, you're a great teacher.

2379
02:10:58,700 --> 02:11:03,140
Bengo perfect civilians. Listen,
you are, you're a creative Weirdo.

2380
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:05,940
Okay. And if you're dating
another creative Weirdo,

2381
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:07,670
she's going to be just
as fucked up as you are,

2382
02:11:07,671 --> 02:11:10,580
but in a way you can understand
because she's going to be a woman.

2383
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:13,430
That's what the hardest part
about living in California though,

2384
02:11:13,431 --> 02:11:17,150
is because 90% of the populations out
here to be in the same entertainment

2385
02:11:17,151 --> 02:11:21,460
industry. There's a lot of regular
nice sound. I know a a or something.

2386
02:11:21,470 --> 02:11:25,910
My wife's teacher friends that are very
single and available, they're painted.

2387
02:11:26,090 --> 02:11:28,520
They're tainted. They're out here.
Listen. They know how magical.

2388
02:11:28,521 --> 02:11:32,010
He's probably in Texas anytime
soon. Joe. We gotta move.

2389
02:11:32,030 --> 02:11:35,260
You gotta move to Colorado with
me. I'm moving back. Back. Yeah.

2390
02:11:35,540 --> 02:11:38,050
I want my kids to be
raised in Colorado tax.

2391
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:41,000
I don't want my kids to be raised in
California. I think this place is just,

2392
02:11:41,170 --> 02:11:44,950
it hums at to higher frequencies
to share. Yeah. That's,

2393
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:47,780
I don't want to go further out.
I want to live on a ranch, dude.

2394
02:11:47,781 --> 02:11:49,850
I like living in the woods.
That's where I live.

2395
02:11:49,851 --> 02:11:53,450
I want to live by a lake in the woods. I
like to be around nature. I want to wait.

2396
02:11:53,540 --> 02:11:57,010
I want to see deer that if shit goes bad
I can shoot those bitches and eat them

2397
02:11:57,011 --> 02:12:00,480
that exist. Why don't you go out
to palm springs or desert man?

2398
02:12:01,220 --> 02:12:03,600
You know what's out there? Meth and
gay people. What about arrowhead?

2399
02:12:03,830 --> 02:12:07,160
What about arrowhead? No, that's good.
That's a move. That's a possibility.

2400
02:12:07,170 --> 02:12:11,030
A lot of you love to arrowhead places
and you can get here quick to two hours.

2401
02:12:11,090 --> 02:12:11,510
Yeah,

2402
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:15,800
I might look at like getting maybe like
a vacation now someday in their hand.

2403
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:19,300
That would be the shit. And
you just, I want to just like
living in the woods, man.

2404
02:12:19,790 --> 02:12:21,410
I loved,
I loved living in Boulder.

2405
02:12:21,411 --> 02:12:26,411
I loved the idea that I would see like
fucking deer every day driving home that

2406
02:12:26,601 --> 02:12:27,950
there was eagles flying overhead.

2407
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:31,250
The tiers that you see everyday is going
to jump in front of your car and you're

2408
02:12:31,251 --> 02:12:33,170
going to fuck deers and yeah,
but you know,

2409
02:12:33,230 --> 02:12:34,970
just get a big ass bumper and you're good.

2410
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:38,900
What about you didn't want to drive
my car? Yeah, that's the problem.

2411
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:41,900
The missus Rogan's not so fucking
good at driving and snow. Yeah. Well,

2412
02:12:41,901 --> 02:12:44,090
why even early somewhere where
there's snow. That's why he said go.

2413
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:47,420
He go on the road and you should a
stranger out there on this cabin.

2414
02:12:48,370 --> 02:12:49,370
That was part of the issue.

2415
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:52,730
And then our dog got eaten by a mountain
lion that the real thing that sent us

2416
02:12:52,731 --> 02:12:56,720
home though was that we were 8,500 feet
above sea level and uh, she got pregnant.

2417
02:12:56,930 --> 02:12:58,910
And when you're that high above sea level,
if your bodies,

2418
02:12:58,940 --> 02:13:01,040
even if you are living
there your whole life,

2419
02:13:01,041 --> 02:13:04,280
the kids still going to have
to go on oxygen number kids,
just scary number kids.

2420
02:13:04,281 --> 02:13:08,650
He's stopping off at two and my loads are
still fucking devastatingly good. Hmm,

2421
02:13:08,930 --> 02:13:11,750
I'm ready. She got another one
in that testing is hard man.

2422
02:13:11,790 --> 02:13:14,720
Just taking care of two little babies
at the same time. You know, one,

2423
02:13:14,721 --> 02:13:17,930
two and a half and one nine months old
or seven months old. It's tricky. Cute.

2424
02:13:19,330 --> 02:13:20,710
It's the greatest thing in the world.
People don't.

2425
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:25,960
I always tell people that
kids and mushrooms are very
similar and then if you've

2426
02:13:26,271 --> 02:13:27,230
never experienced it,

2427
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:29,390
if you never had your own kid and if
you've never really done mushrooms,

2428
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:33,090
shut the fuck up. You really don't know.
I used to talk about kids, you know,

2429
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:35,280
I didn't understand what it
was until you have a kid.

2430
02:13:35,430 --> 02:13:38,250
And the other thing that you understand
is that there stopped doing that.

2431
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:39,970
Whatever you doing.
Anything cool that,

2432
02:13:40,100 --> 02:13:44,520
that the other thing that you realize
when you have a kid is that you change and

2433
02:13:44,521 --> 02:13:48,900
you hit some weird new next level of
evolution where there's so much more at

2434
02:13:48,901 --> 02:13:52,440
stake now and there's some you, you,
you become a more serious person.

2435
02:13:52,441 --> 02:13:55,530
It's really weird. I feel like a real
man to, I feel like man. Exactly.

2436
02:13:55,910 --> 02:14:00,090
I'm still very silly and I
obviously make a living. Sure,
sure, sure, sure. You know,

2437
02:14:00,091 --> 02:14:01,500
and I still smoke a lot of weed,

2438
02:14:01,501 --> 02:14:04,740
which is also a weird thing with a lot
of people that's like, they think some,

2439
02:14:04,741 --> 02:14:06,960
for some reason another,
you're not supposed to smoke weed.

2440
02:14:07,260 --> 02:14:09,150
You know that like smoking
weed when you're a father,

2441
02:14:09,151 --> 02:14:12,240
like said some sort of a weird
example or that it's a bad thing, but,

2442
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:15,510
but you know, I'll go, well, how come I
can go to a restaurant and order a beer?

2443
02:14:15,511 --> 02:14:18,930
And nobody even blinks, you know? That's
fine. Nobody says a word about that.

2444
02:14:18,931 --> 02:14:22,720
I go and get some wine, you know, with
dinner and nobody me, nobody looks at me.

2445
02:14:22,721 --> 02:14:25,260
You know, they asked me if I
want it, you know, if I said no,

2446
02:14:25,261 --> 02:14:28,350
but you guys got a place where I could
hit this joint, they'd be like, Whoa,

2447
02:14:28,351 --> 02:14:31,680
what the fuck you children are here,
by the way, if you bake though,

2448
02:14:31,681 --> 02:14:35,460
if you get too drunk, I mean, not
even just get wasted. Of course,

2449
02:14:35,461 --> 02:14:38,940
some guys just fucking crushing
it and enabled to operate.

2450
02:14:38,941 --> 02:14:42,720
Like if I had too high.
Yeah, I can't function.

2451
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:47,580
And also I'm really bad with booze to
two drinks. I'm fucking tipsy. I'm drunk.

2452
02:14:47,870 --> 02:14:51,810
Yeah. Well that's good to
know. You're a lightweight.
You're a, you're a cheap date.

2453
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:54,270
No, no, I am. Yeah.
No, I definitely don't.

2454
02:14:54,330 --> 02:14:57,120
I don't think you should be
drunk or high around your kids.

2455
02:14:57,121 --> 02:14:57,954
That's not what I'm saying,

2456
02:14:58,140 --> 02:15:02,090
but I'm saying like I'm not going to
change like who I am. You know the guy.

2457
02:15:02,190 --> 02:15:05,280
I don't have to like become this fucking
straight edge person just because all

2458
02:15:05,281 --> 02:15:06,150
of a sudden I have children.

2459
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:08,850
If I thought there was something
wrong with smoking pot,

2460
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:12,150
I would have stopped doing it because
I think it's bad for you if like it was

2461
02:15:12,151 --> 02:15:15,210
detrimental to my health or to
my mental wellbeing or something.

2462
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:18,270
If I thought it was something like
an issue that I needed to deal with,

2463
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:21,270
I would deal with it as an issue,
but I don't think there's an issue.

2464
02:15:21,270 --> 02:15:24,810
I think it's beneficial.
I think it helps my personality.

2465
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:28,740
It helps me enjoy life.
It helps me write like crazy.

2466
02:15:28,741 --> 02:15:33,360
It is like steroids for writing. When
I get high and I write, I am just,

2467
02:15:33,361 --> 02:15:37,560
I just strap in and ride
this wave that I connect to.

2468
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:39,930
I get high and I go into
the isolation tank and I,

2469
02:15:40,050 --> 02:15:43,200
I rethink my whole life and it becomes,

2470
02:15:43,201 --> 02:15:47,790
I come up with new strategies and new
ways of behaving and I and I have a new

2471
02:15:47,791 --> 02:15:51,630
appreciation for everything in a new
respect and love for my friends and my

2472
02:15:51,631 --> 02:15:52,141
family.
I want to,

2473
02:15:52,141 --> 02:15:55,050
I'll end up calling people that I haven't
talked to in months just getting out

2474
02:15:55,051 --> 02:15:57,180
of the tank and go like, dude,
I just want to tell you man.

2475
02:15:57,181 --> 02:15:59,820
I mean we don't hang out, but I'd love
you man. We're Sharon's in, you know,

2476
02:15:59,870 --> 02:16:02,910
I get these crazy conversations like I
just got to make sure I say all these

2477
02:16:02,911 --> 02:16:07,230
things that I need to say like it, it re
reinvigorates me, but also being a dad,

2478
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:09,900
I hope that, I mean that was
two. Yeah, that definitely does.

2479
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:11,670
The combination of the two things.

2480
02:16:11,700 --> 02:16:16,650
People don't realize that that's there
is that you do feel like taking a step

2481
02:16:16,651 --> 02:16:20,070
back and not taking things so seriously.
Even though I still get fired up,

2482
02:16:20,071 --> 02:16:22,890
I keep everything in perspective
very well too. I mean,

2483
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:26,250
I'm not making too many fucking
stupid decisions over here. Yeah.

2484
02:16:26,251 --> 02:16:30,190
You get more in tuned with love,
you know, and that fucking very

2485
02:16:30,200 --> 02:16:33,190
gay gay.
But it is what it is man.

2486
02:16:33,191 --> 02:16:35,320
It's like you get more in tune
with love and that's honestly,

2487
02:16:35,321 --> 02:16:40,180
that's what weed is all about. To weed
is about getting you in tune with love,

2488
02:16:40,181 --> 02:16:42,910
getting you into with happiness.
We eat is a happy drug.

2489
02:16:42,911 --> 02:16:44,770
It's about friendships and,

2490
02:16:44,771 --> 02:16:48,430
and hugs and having a good time and
laughing and giggling together. You know,

2491
02:16:48,431 --> 02:16:51,640
it's not, it's on a bad
drug. It says and theologian.

2492
02:16:51,850 --> 02:16:53,230
And that's what people have to understand.

2493
02:16:53,231 --> 02:16:57,190
Everything is lumped together in this
one big stupid group called drugs and

2494
02:16:57,191 --> 02:17:01,380
included our caffeine and alcohol and
then dangerous shit like heroin and

2495
02:17:01,390 --> 02:17:04,210
fucking, you know, and, and
meth and all those are drugs.

2496
02:17:04,211 --> 02:17:06,350
But there's also drugs
that literally trained,

2497
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:09,430
changed the way your fucking
mind works and in a good way.

2498
02:17:09,730 --> 02:17:12,880
And they're here to make you like
more humble, make you feel better.

2499
02:17:13,090 --> 02:17:14,770
And the reason why people have bad trips,

2500
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:17,440
cause there's a lot of shit about
your life. It's Douchey, man.

2501
02:17:17,710 --> 02:17:20,080
You need to clean that shit up.
You know why you paranoid,

2502
02:17:20,081 --> 02:17:22,450
why you're freaking out. Well you
should be freaking out. That's why

2503
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:24,460
we do a lot of drugs in college too.

2504
02:17:24,461 --> 02:17:27,400
When you're younger and you don't
have as much responsibility,

2505
02:17:27,401 --> 02:17:31,870
but I mean more and more responsibility
you have. And then when you do drugs,

2506
02:17:31,871 --> 02:17:35,170
he started thinking about all that shit.
That's why people tend to freak out.

2507
02:17:35,171 --> 02:17:35,500
Sure.

2508
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:38,650
But if you're just more carefree person
in the first place and the college is a

2509
02:17:38,651 --> 02:17:42,340
perfect example because you really don't
have too many responsibilities and go

2510
02:17:42,341 --> 02:17:46,120
home by yourself and the first time and
not have anybody scrutinize you once you

2511
02:17:46,121 --> 02:17:49,270
get there. And so it's an opportunity. No,

2512
02:17:49,290 --> 02:17:53,050
no real bills to fucking pay. I mean,
if somebody is taking care of the,

2513
02:17:53,420 --> 02:17:57,210
so less responsibility and you can
just fucking let go completely and,

2514
02:17:57,230 --> 02:18:00,520
but more and more shit that you've got
going on like a daughter and we talked

2515
02:18:00,521 --> 02:18:03,310
about the porn, they went to
die. Like you just start to put,

2516
02:18:03,770 --> 02:18:05,110
you have more shit built up.

2517
02:18:05,510 --> 02:18:06,920
The thing about porn is,
you know,

2518
02:18:06,921 --> 02:18:09,230
I don't want to say why anybody
gets into porn cause I don't know.

2519
02:18:09,231 --> 02:18:11,840
I'm not a girl when I grow old,
it's getting fucked on camera.

2520
02:18:11,841 --> 02:18:13,010
I don't understand that.
You may be,

2521
02:18:13,011 --> 02:18:16,340
you really are a healthy person and
it's just fun for you. That's possible.

2522
02:18:16,460 --> 02:18:21,230
Dr Drew says, no. Um, but
like, then again, I said I'm
not, I'm not, I'm not a woman.

2523
02:18:21,260 --> 02:18:23,150
I'm not a doctor.
I don't really understand it.

2524
02:18:23,420 --> 02:18:26,810
But I think the ones that
I've come in contact with,

2525
02:18:27,050 --> 02:18:31,160
almost all of them had some fucked
up childhood, almost all of them.

2526
02:18:31,250 --> 02:18:34,280
I think it's pretty much mandatory. Yeah.
There's no other way to do it. Right,

2527
02:18:34,340 --> 02:18:35,090
right.

2528
02:18:35,090 --> 02:18:37,580
It's like the reason why you got into
it in the first place is not a healthy

2529
02:18:37,581 --> 02:18:39,650
reason.
So it's just this massive evidence.

2530
02:18:39,651 --> 02:18:41,690
And even if you're the coolest
person to hang out with ever,

2531
02:18:41,900 --> 02:18:45,330
like a lot of them are, you know, a lot
of them really fun to hang out with your,

2532
02:18:45,340 --> 02:18:49,370
there's still you're this way
because somebody was shitty to you.

2533
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:51,260
That's what they were talking
about. Think about that. Yeah.

2534
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:54,260
They were talking about that on that
green room show with Paul preventative

2535
02:18:54,270 --> 02:18:58,040
before the one you were on and they were
talking about how everybody's, you know,

2536
02:18:58,060 --> 02:19:02,280
Al Comics Dads, you know,
or some shit like that. Like
yeah, there is some comics,

2537
02:19:02,281 --> 02:19:02,440
some

2538
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:05,440
dads Shit, dad shit. Yeah. Well you don't,

2539
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:09,280
you don't ever become a comic or
anything like that, a singer or any, any,

2540
02:19:09,281 --> 02:19:10,360
anything where you're,
you're,

2541
02:19:10,361 --> 02:19:13,150
you're asking for this
exorbitant amount of attention.

2542
02:19:13,151 --> 02:19:16,240
Like this really unbalanced
amount of attention to say,

2543
02:19:16,270 --> 02:19:20,230
I want to be a comedian is to say I want
to be the one with a light shining on

2544
02:19:20,231 --> 02:19:25,150
me while everyone else is in the dark
with my voice amplified and I want to be

2545
02:19:25,151 --> 02:19:28,200
above them and understanding
above their head.

2546
02:19:28,420 --> 02:19:31,220
Think of it like that at all. Yeah.
That's what it is. That's what it is.

2547
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:34,340
That's what we did is you want
to be above the crowd. You know,

2548
02:19:34,490 --> 02:19:38,810
nobody wants to do a show where everyone
is in the balcony staring down on you

2549
02:19:38,811 --> 02:19:40,370
and your,
your one level below them.

2550
02:19:40,371 --> 02:19:43,010
You would feel disconnected if you
didn't have that floor filled in,

2551
02:19:43,370 --> 02:19:46,180
you would feel disconnected.
It's the whole thing is a,

2552
02:19:46,190 --> 02:19:50,030
is a really ridiculous request.
And so to want to do that for a living,

2553
02:19:50,150 --> 02:19:51,790
you have to have some giant deficits.

2554
02:19:51,791 --> 02:19:55,520
You're trying to make up for some
fucking crazy hole in your childhood.

2555
02:19:56,560 --> 02:20:00,620
Yeah. But none of us really think, I
don't think I have it that bad. You know,

2556
02:20:00,621 --> 02:20:02,090
it's a, I mean, it was pretty,

2557
02:20:02,370 --> 02:20:04,050
you don't have to have it that bad now.

2558
02:20:04,170 --> 02:20:06,270
And I think one of the reasons
why is because your self healed.

2559
02:20:06,271 --> 02:20:08,850
When you have a family of your own and
you have your own children and all of a

2560
02:20:08,851 --> 02:20:11,610
sudden that shit goes away and you
don't need your daddy anymore. Man.

2561
02:20:11,611 --> 02:20:13,830
I don't need my dad get hit in
the head by a fucking media,

2562
02:20:13,860 --> 02:20:17,010
not my Stepdad who raised me, my
real dad. I don't even know. Um,

2563
02:20:17,070 --> 02:20:20,210
I wouldn't give a fuck. Like I don't
need a dad, you know, I'm a mom,

2564
02:20:20,220 --> 02:20:23,880
a dad and myself. Thanks. Thanks.
Take care. I got it. Oh, sorry. Sorry.

2565
02:20:23,881 --> 02:20:27,330
You got hit in the head by a media, you
know what I mean? But when I was seven,

2566
02:20:27,390 --> 02:20:29,900
it was devastating when I
was seven like that guy,

2567
02:20:29,910 --> 02:20:32,460
like the fact that my dad wasn't in my
life anymore, it was just like, whoa.

2568
02:20:32,460 --> 02:20:37,200
It was just crushing and
so that whatever's sets you
off when you're seven or

2569
02:20:37,201 --> 02:20:39,930
whatever it is, what age it is
that you have this, this dad issue.

2570
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:44,140
That's what gives you this incredible
energy and desire to pursue this,

2571
02:20:44,260 --> 02:20:45,660
this standup comedy thing.

2572
02:20:46,110 --> 02:20:50,850
The key is somewhere along the line you
have to shift your motivation and your

2573
02:20:50,851 --> 02:20:54,420
motivation has to go from,
I want all this attention to,

2574
02:20:54,450 --> 02:20:57,060
I want to produce all this
art and make people happy.

2575
02:20:57,270 --> 02:20:59,280
I want to produce all this
shit that people love.

2576
02:20:59,281 --> 02:21:02,280
I want people to come see how magical
and concert and I'm gonna give them a

2577
02:21:02,281 --> 02:21:05,430
fucking rocking show where they get all
excited and can't wait to see me again.

2578
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:09,670
I think about what my,
one of my kids,

2579
02:21:09,671 --> 02:21:10,690
I can't help but think about this.

2580
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:14,470
I think about my kids looking at my
standup when they're 18 years old and

2581
02:21:14,471 --> 02:21:17,680
looking back and seeing what
I did. But you still smoking
cigarettes? No, I'm done.

2582
02:21:17,740 --> 02:21:22,030
You're done? Yeah, the
completely, I quit almost,

2583
02:21:22,330 --> 02:21:25,490
I feel like a year ago. Right
around now. Let me tell you,

2584
02:21:25,570 --> 02:21:27,600
how many times a day do you
think about it? I don't know.

2585
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:31,050
This mother Fucker,
he quits and his cat hurts her foot.

2586
02:21:31,740 --> 02:21:36,180
The cat hurt her foot. So he was at
her? Yeah. Yeah. Cat hurt her foot.

2587
02:21:36,300 --> 02:21:39,300
She jumped off the fridgerator and hurt
her foot. So he got so stressed out.

2588
02:21:39,301 --> 02:21:40,530
He started smoking cigarettes again.

2589
02:21:40,670 --> 02:21:43,010
Yeah. I mean, it's always
something for me. I mean,

2590
02:21:43,011 --> 02:21:46,250
it means if it's a relationship problem
or if it's for my cat and get hurt

2591
02:21:46,290 --> 02:21:49,310
problem. It's all, it's all
excuses. I mean, cigarettes, I even,

2592
02:21:49,430 --> 02:21:52,220
I know you say that you're over and stuff
like that, but most people, when they,

2593
02:21:52,221 --> 02:21:56,030
even if it's been a year, I still
thought about it at least once a week.

2594
02:21:56,570 --> 02:22:00,770
The reason I saw, I actually saw a
commercial that had made me quit. Wow.

2595
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:03,650
One of those nonsmoking
commercials and it was great. One,

2596
02:22:03,651 --> 02:22:07,640
it said you was there for you then you
know you did it after you smoked in the

2597
02:22:07,641 --> 02:22:10,550
morning, you smoked at night,
you smoked after lunch,

2598
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:13,220
you smoked when your daughter was born,
you smoke to here,

2599
02:22:13,221 --> 02:22:15,170
you smoke there cause you did it,

2600
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:19,970
you tried and you're done like that and
just put it to you. You gave it a shot.

2601
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:23,690
Like I smoked, I really did
smoke and I'm just done with it.

2602
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:26,670
I think if I have kids, that's, that's,
that's gonna be a real big pushy thing.

2603
02:22:26,671 --> 02:22:28,350
But when you're hanging
out at a comedy club,

2604
02:22:28,351 --> 02:22:30,240
drinking and every
single person's smoking,

2605
02:22:30,241 --> 02:22:34,590
it is almost impossible to fucking quit
smoking unless you have something like a

2606
02:22:34,591 --> 02:22:36,910
kid at home that you're like, okay,
I'm doing anything. But this is,

2607
02:22:36,911 --> 02:22:39,230
especially when you get a couple of
drinks and you're like far, yeah,

2608
02:22:39,250 --> 02:22:41,560
but everybody else is smoking
and you're sitting around.

2609
02:22:41,590 --> 02:22:44,910
It's also an easy way to step away from
a situation. Like if I'm at a party,

2610
02:22:44,911 --> 02:22:46,690
one of the best things about
smoking for me, he say,

2611
02:22:46,691 --> 02:22:49,470
you were in a party and
I got to walk outside.

2612
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:52,130
Just sort of collect my thoughts
and be by myself for fucking,

2613
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:54,120
and it may be he's out
there and there's cool,

2614
02:22:54,121 --> 02:22:56,720
not cool smoker guy tag or what's up,
what's,

2615
02:22:56,721 --> 02:22:59,050
how do you see the chicken
there or whatever it is.

2616
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:02,520
And so you have a tiny meeting
away from the Vulcan event.

2617
02:23:02,610 --> 02:23:06,390
I used to see that back in Boston when
they had to do it and it was fucking zero

2618
02:23:06,391 --> 02:23:08,700
degrees or degrees.
And these poor junkies,

2619
02:23:08,701 --> 02:23:12,030
we're standing outside these fucking
queer laws, smoke in the circuit.

2620
02:23:12,031 --> 02:23:16,610
We've fucking game smoke inside anymore.
What's next? You just go into each,

2621
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:20,940
the ability to step away from shit. I
really did miss. That's what all meetings.

2622
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:23,730
Little tiny meaning. Tiny
meetings. So that's funny.

2623
02:23:24,030 --> 02:23:25,440
So you're in a little tiny club.

2624
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:28,200
That's kind of interesting when you're
looking at a club where you meet with the

2625
02:23:28,201 --> 02:23:29,300
regular people at the work of time.

2626
02:23:29,310 --> 02:23:33,480
So you see Teebo who I'm sure you've had
cigarettes with cigarettes with Jason

2627
02:23:33,480 --> 02:23:34,830
Tebow. Oh yeah, all
the time. All the time.

2628
02:23:34,831 --> 02:23:36,720
One of my favorite cigarette smoker guys.
Exactly.

2629
02:23:36,721 --> 02:23:40,780
So he has his regular cigarette guys that
he sees and he knows vcs court McCowen

2630
02:23:40,781 --> 02:23:41,910
he can get a cigarette off him.

2631
02:23:41,910 --> 02:23:46,200
He knows if he sees this guy ran as
easy used to smile. Can you just quit?

2632
02:23:46,201 --> 02:23:49,740
So if you see Steve Reynolds easy, you
can smoke. You know he's got cigarettes.

2633
02:23:49,770 --> 02:23:51,780
Isn't that a part of it too?
That you support each other?

2634
02:23:51,781 --> 02:23:53,700
Like you give each other,
you want to bomb a cigarette,

2635
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:55,050
you always give the guy a cigarette.

2636
02:23:55,051 --> 02:23:57,360
Cause you know that if you see him
and you don't have a cigarette,

2637
02:23:57,390 --> 02:24:00,750
he's got a scissor and integrating lot
of bartering and I you see you maybe

2638
02:24:00,751 --> 02:24:03,990
we'll do that at bars too, that don't even
know people. You've got a spare. Yeah.

2639
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:06,420
I ask you for a fucking free cigarette.

2640
02:24:06,630 --> 02:24:09,210
Like that's like saying can I have
a dollar? You know what I was,

2641
02:24:09,211 --> 02:24:13,790
I was at take two guy. I cause I knew
he'd need one for later on for later.

2642
02:24:14,360 --> 02:24:17,010
Yeah, there you go. I didn't do that.
A lot of that to Daryl last night.

2643
02:24:17,320 --> 02:24:20,820
Do you know what you like a guy a lot.
You see, you see a Tebow I to here,

2644
02:24:20,821 --> 02:24:25,260
you know what, diva have another fucking
bust out three, you know, and go yeah, no,

2645
02:24:25,261 --> 02:24:27,270
just put one behind the year. Did you, uh,

2646
02:24:27,300 --> 02:24:30,480
did you ever go the natural cigarettes
route where you try to get them like

2647
02:24:30,550 --> 02:24:35,340
Derek Parliament light hardpack and I
smoked a marvel lightheart back and that

2648
02:24:35,341 --> 02:24:38,880
was it. And what happened? Brian? Those
natural, that's not the way to go. Uh,

2649
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:42,540
supposedly are better for you because
they have only tobacco in it and no

2650
02:24:42,541 --> 02:24:45,930
pesticides and none of the whatever,
102 chemicals,

2651
02:24:45,931 --> 02:24:49,290
but I still drag of a twig.
Yeah.

2652
02:24:49,291 --> 02:24:52,770
It's so hard and rough that I actually
felt like more shit the next day.

2653
02:24:52,771 --> 02:24:55,800
Waking up on that shit takes 15 minutes
to swung on a regular cigarettes.

2654
02:24:55,801 --> 02:25:00,120
You about seven minutes, not even seven
and a half of it is just explosive.

2655
02:25:00,121 --> 02:25:02,270
Chemicals are sucking in. Yeah. You know,

2656
02:25:02,280 --> 02:25:07,280
there's 599 FDA approved
chemical additives that are
in cigarettes and Joe was

2657
02:25:08,191 --> 02:25:12,000
always on me. Not to smoke or you have
children. I know, I know you were on it.

2658
02:25:12,001 --> 02:25:14,460
And then also when I did,
before I had children,

2659
02:25:15,060 --> 02:25:18,270
you hear that sound lazy before you
had children of okay, I'm not doing,

2660
02:25:18,330 --> 02:25:19,710
that's the volcano.

2661
02:25:20,490 --> 02:25:24,430
It's come alive for go to request

2662
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:29,530
request is to fuck you up. We're talking
about smoking and there's a, you know,

2663
02:25:29,531 --> 02:25:31,540
a lot of people say, well
marijuana, you know, you're smoking,

2664
02:25:31,610 --> 02:25:33,340
that Shit's bad for you.
That's not good.

2665
02:25:33,610 --> 02:25:36,010
Well there's a thing called the
vaporizer ladies and gentlemen.

2666
02:25:36,040 --> 02:25:40,330
And what it is is it looks like a
Ufo and it's keeping pop. Oh yeah.

2667
02:25:40,331 --> 02:25:41,690
It looks like it's making Jiffy pop.

2668
02:25:41,691 --> 02:25:46,450
But what's really doing is taking my
ground up plant material and vaporizing it

2669
02:25:46,451 --> 02:25:48,100
so that there's no smoke.

2670
02:25:48,280 --> 02:25:52,030
But instead it's a mist
and it's a t h c missed.

2671
02:25:52,330 --> 02:25:55,480
And what it does is it fills this
bag up with, is THC missed? Oh,

2672
02:25:55,481 --> 02:25:59,160
it's filling up now. It's looking
good. How long have you had that? Uh,

2673
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:03,950
I've had it for a while, man. I think
I got it a few years ago. And, um,

2674
02:26:04,030 --> 02:26:07,090
cause your bag leaks a little bit.
We know where you're going to do.

2675
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:10,250
That's a good gift idea.
If you want to get you a new bag.

2676
02:26:10,330 --> 02:26:14,740
[inaudible] I need a new bag.
Does it turn off by itself? No,

2677
02:26:14,741 --> 02:26:17,770
you just wait. Is it going to pop
and look at it now? Not Ready.

2678
02:26:18,100 --> 02:26:21,040
It's not ready yet. So it
can good though. Scary. Yeah.

2679
02:26:21,180 --> 02:26:24,640
This is don't be a bit like walking
around with balloons and not hitting the

2680
02:26:24,641 --> 02:26:29,540
ceiling. It's just vapor bro. It's
THC vapor and the thing is it,

2681
02:26:29,541 --> 02:26:33,060
it looks like nothing. Like when you
breathing in and breathing out yelling,

2682
02:26:33,110 --> 02:26:35,980
sometimes you don't even think he got
anything you want with the clear bag with

2683
02:26:35,981 --> 02:26:40,540
all bags are pretty much clear as you can
see. Two misdemeanor. Exactly. Well they,

2684
02:26:40,570 --> 02:26:42,490
this is just the same bag
that I've had for years.

2685
02:26:42,491 --> 02:26:45,280
I'm probably supposed to be replacing
them. That's why ladies, I mean, yeah,

2686
02:26:45,310 --> 02:26:48,710
it is a good gift idea. If you're
thinking about gifting. Yeah.

2687
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:51,940
This volcanoes are fucking expensive.

2688
02:26:53,020 --> 02:26:57,040
Yeah. I think they're like $600 or
something like that. Is it real? Yeah.

2689
02:26:57,490 --> 02:27:00,280
I was thinking about getting one and
then I was like, so then this is the,

2690
02:27:00,430 --> 02:27:04,420
this is what you get out of it.
This a strange thing.

2691
02:27:04,630 --> 02:27:06,300
And inside the strange thing is,
I don't know,

2692
02:27:13,630 --> 02:27:14,700
going crazy

2693
02:27:15,990 --> 02:27:19,980
that she sticks around for awhile. You can
use that later. Yeah, that's it. Bam Son.

2694
02:27:20,490 --> 02:27:23,730
Pure THC. You don't have to
worry about smoke in for,

2695
02:27:23,740 --> 02:27:25,230
to worry about shit being bad for you.

2696
02:27:25,410 --> 02:27:28,560
How magical do you still go on your
children? Are you still going on the road?

2697
02:27:29,010 --> 02:27:33,360
Yeah. Yeah. Cause you can go, you go
with Ari. Ari comes all the time. Joey,

2698
02:27:33,390 --> 02:27:34,380
when you can count on him,

2699
02:27:35,810 --> 02:27:40,810
you'd never know what Joe Diaz cause
he might pull the Joe ideas and just no

2700
02:27:40,890 --> 02:27:44,670
show. What's that? I'm just no show. Um,

2701
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:48,750
I actually started taking two people
on the road with me for the very reason

2702
02:27:48,930 --> 02:27:51,000
that I never knew of Joey
Diaz is gonna show up.

2703
02:27:51,540 --> 02:27:55,050
So Joey Diaz is the reason was that,
did you hear that?

2704
02:27:55,530 --> 02:28:00,510
Did you hear a feedback? No.
Do you hear us? Yeah. Hmm.

2705
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:03,210
Interesting. You wrestling, maybe you
just kicks on when you sat down. Maybe.

2706
02:28:03,390 --> 02:28:04,960
Anyway. Um, I used to work,

2707
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:10,100
take Joey d is on the road all the time
until we worked in rascals over rascals

2708
02:28:10,970 --> 02:28:12,780
in New Jersey.
And Joey just didn't show up.

2709
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:15,540
It just never flew to New Jersey
and he didn't answer his phone.

2710
02:28:15,541 --> 02:28:17,730
He had a pager back then. It was
impossible to get in touch with them.

2711
02:28:18,300 --> 02:28:20,610
And then finally we got in touch
with them the next day and he's like,

2712
02:28:20,611 --> 02:28:22,040
I'm coming tonight. Don't
worry about it. I'll be

2713
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:24,650
there. Don't worry about them that
don't worry, I'm, I missed my flight.

2714
02:28:24,651 --> 02:28:26,660
I fucked up.
I get stuck in Vegas,

2715
02:28:27,020 --> 02:28:30,890
so it's maybe an hour before the show and,
uh,

2716
02:28:31,070 --> 02:28:34,310
we finally get a hold of Joey Diaz
and he's still back in la or Vegas.

2717
02:28:34,311 --> 02:28:36,370
I forget where he was like,
I ain't gonna lie to you until I was done.

2718
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:41,120
I never got on the plane and just,
he just, he just, whatever reason,

2719
02:28:41,121 --> 02:28:44,180
I just decided to go off and do his
own Joey Diaz world. That's great.

2720
02:28:44,210 --> 02:28:47,570
And he's done that so many times.
He did that in Phoenix. He just,

2721
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:51,620
he just fucking vanishes. Telling you one
story of him at the Maryland Martinez.

2722
02:28:51,780 --> 02:28:53,780
Maybe there's somebody who
talked about that, but I mean,

2723
02:28:53,781 --> 02:28:56,660
it was just really one of the
best things I've ever witnessed.

2724
02:28:57,470 --> 02:29:00,680
And just telling somebody off at a
memorial, those fucking memorials.

2725
02:29:00,770 --> 02:29:04,700
They bumped me out, man. Yeah, I went
to Mitch. Yeah, Mitch was, I mean,

2726
02:29:04,940 --> 02:29:07,030
I don't go to anybody's,
I don't like funerals either.

2727
02:29:07,050 --> 02:29:09,430
I don't like the idea behind if I want
to celebrate somebody who wanted to

2728
02:29:09,431 --> 02:29:12,490
celebrate it on my own and think
about their life and you know, my, my,

2729
02:29:12,730 --> 02:29:14,690
my personal relationship with
them. And if, I mean, if I,

2730
02:29:14,691 --> 02:29:17,000
I mean it's cool with you if you want
to meet up with everybody and talk about

2731
02:29:17,001 --> 02:29:20,510
how great the guy was and celebrate
them. I get it. I totally understand it.

2732
02:29:21,110 --> 02:29:24,800
But to me it's just like, man, it's such
a personal thing. And when someone dies,

2733
02:29:24,801 --> 02:29:28,300
I don't, wouldn't have public
official died in Tucson. I mean, uh,

2734
02:29:28,370 --> 02:29:31,610
he saw all the people and Obama
spoke. Yeah. That was a lot of people.

2735
02:29:31,611 --> 02:29:32,780
How many people were at that event?

2736
02:29:32,790 --> 02:29:36,680
You know a shit load of people in a
university of Arizona probably in the

2737
02:29:36,681 --> 02:29:41,570
basketball stadium, easily about 8,000
people. It's weird. Right? And um,

2738
02:29:41,630 --> 02:29:44,870
well you know when that case though,
it's like those people need healing.

2739
02:29:44,990 --> 02:29:47,690
You know, those people are
obviously totally, yeah.
What's something that happened?

2740
02:29:47,691 --> 02:29:50,600
Like that little girl got shot like that,
that thing is so devastating.

2741
02:29:50,840 --> 02:29:53,060
And apparently the cops had
been called to this guy's house.

2742
02:29:53,061 --> 02:29:55,800
The guy who did that shooting in Arizona
where they pulled him over luckily

2743
02:29:55,820 --> 02:30:00,230
there. Jesus could they really, they pull
away. They got arrested for uh, yeah,

2744
02:30:00,231 --> 02:30:04,210
he had a some sort of violation.
He got pulled over. Oh my God.

2745
02:30:04,211 --> 02:30:08,510
And they didn't check that he's got guns,
guns in the bag. Jesus fucking Christ.

2746
02:30:08,511 --> 02:30:09,870
Anyone goes to load up.
Hey,

2747
02:30:09,871 --> 02:30:11,870
you went to Walmart and burnish
it a little bullets too.

2748
02:30:11,930 --> 02:30:16,010
I think you've gotta
be some check company.

2749
02:30:17,390 --> 02:30:20,590
Let's take a picture and sending, I'm sure
all of that's being done. I don't even,

2750
02:30:20,610 --> 02:30:24,680
I feel I feel bad for the cop that
pulled them over. Who has to think that,

2751
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:27,490
you know, have you done a little
bit more of an investigation?

2752
02:30:27,510 --> 02:30:30,360
I just looked into this. He probably had
some inkling, but he's probably, you know,

2753
02:30:30,361 --> 02:30:33,920
whatever. Leave the guy alone and
other people talking about that at HP.

2754
02:30:33,921 --> 02:30:36,530
We'll talking about the fact that
he was stopped and I never heard it.

2755
02:30:36,650 --> 02:30:39,350
I didn't hear until you just
brought it up. That's crazy though.

2756
02:30:39,500 --> 02:30:40,910
The photos of that kid,

2757
02:30:40,990 --> 02:30:45,920
the mugshot photos just as
bananas as anybody could look.

2758
02:30:46,380 --> 02:30:50,660
I can't look into grazier.
Yeah, that's definitely,
again, with the pay phone shit,

2759
02:30:50,690 --> 02:30:54,590
it's like I would, yeah,
inspect them. Yeah.

2760
02:30:54,740 --> 02:30:57,170
Well then the other thought is that,
you know,

2761
02:30:57,171 --> 02:30:59,780
if you look at the whole machine of life,

2762
02:30:59,810 --> 02:31:02,870
if you look at all these different
things in life, the good and the bad,

2763
02:31:03,170 --> 02:31:06,940
there's a lot of people that believe,
and this is, you know, this is sort of a,

2764
02:31:06,941 --> 02:31:09,590
a staple in eastern religion said almost.

2765
02:31:09,591 --> 02:31:14,210
You sort of have to have negative in your
life to recognize the positive and the

2766
02:31:14,211 --> 02:31:14,960
Yin and Yang.

2767
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:18,080
The reason why it exists is because that's
the only way anything ever gets done.

2768
02:31:18,590 --> 02:31:20,340
And like even events like nine 11

2769
02:31:20,610 --> 02:31:21,990
like they're terrible events,

2770
02:31:21,991 --> 02:31:26,940
but in some ways they bring people
together like New York after nine 11 after

2771
02:31:26,941 --> 02:31:31,200
that was like the friendliest fucking
place in the world. For the longest time,

2772
02:31:31,260 --> 02:31:35,910
senators holding hands on town. It
was just different, man. People were,

2773
02:31:36,300 --> 02:31:39,840
everyone was devastated. People were
shell shocked. They were horrified,

2774
02:31:40,110 --> 02:31:44,150
but there was this weird feeling,
an air of a,

2775
02:31:44,170 --> 02:31:47,190
a group of people that are
all cool mother fucker.

2776
02:31:47,220 --> 02:31:52,020
I'm weak now.
I feel better about mine text earlier,

2777
02:31:52,190 --> 02:31:55,410
somebody just to call me once. I swear
to God, I unplugged that fucking thing.

2778
02:31:56,040 --> 02:31:56,590
Anyway,

2779
02:31:56,590 --> 02:32:01,460
there was a sense of community there
that didn't exist the ways the right back

2780
02:32:01,470 --> 02:32:05,820
back reductionist, but for the longest
time, man, everyone was so fucking cool.

2781
02:32:05,821 --> 02:32:08,970
They're so positive. We went
there. We filmed a fear factor.

2782
02:32:08,971 --> 02:32:11,490
I think it was right after September
11 there wasn't far afterward.

2783
02:32:11,630 --> 02:32:14,370
It's like maybe a year or two
after and everybody was in.

2784
02:32:14,371 --> 02:32:17,310
It was back once when firemen
were fucking heroes and farming,

2785
02:32:17,311 --> 02:32:19,680
which just getting pussy
thrown at them everywhere.

2786
02:32:19,980 --> 02:32:24,660
Women wanting to go fuck firemen. They
wanted to go fuck heroes. You know, it's,

2787
02:32:24,661 --> 02:32:27,180
it's weird how that changed
but for that long time,

2788
02:32:27,181 --> 02:32:28,920
so it's like almost like a negative thing.

2789
02:32:28,921 --> 02:32:33,180
Like can oftentimes inspire like this
positive reaction the opposite way.

2790
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:36,300
And there's a lot of people that think
that all these things are in place and

2791
02:32:36,301 --> 02:32:39,930
all these fucked up people are in place
and fucked up situations to get us to

2792
02:32:39,931 --> 02:32:43,380
appreciate the situations that aren't,
you know, to get us to really, you know,

2793
02:32:43,381 --> 02:32:48,381
to really try to be better in and help
us evolve so that we can get past these

2794
02:32:48,541 --> 02:32:50,010
unfortunate but

2795
02:32:50,680 --> 02:32:54,280
unavoidable situations where, where are
these incentives? We need homeless people,

2796
02:32:54,610 --> 02:32:58,780
homeless people. I mean,
you know, you'd have to,

2797
02:32:58,781 --> 02:33:00,460
do you need sort of
somebody on the bottom?

2798
02:33:01,010 --> 02:33:03,180
This will not, we'll see. I don't
know if that's true. I don't,

2799
02:33:03,190 --> 02:33:06,390
I don't necessarily agree with that.
But it's also like, you know, to,

2800
02:33:06,520 --> 02:33:10,130
to watch something really terrible like
that sort of like motivates you to not

2801
02:33:10,190 --> 02:33:13,130
let that happen to you.
People can accept a lot of shit.

2802
02:33:13,430 --> 02:33:16,220
A lot of things can happen to you and
you just sort of accept your situation,

2803
02:33:16,221 --> 02:33:18,990
then it gets worse. You started
except that. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

2804
02:33:19,030 --> 02:33:21,410
Hoarders a perfect example.
Yeah. And you know,

2805
02:33:21,411 --> 02:33:24,710
because of that you just sort of just
all of a sudden you find yourself,

2806
02:33:24,950 --> 02:33:25,580
you know,

2807
02:33:25,580 --> 02:33:29,600
so many levels of accepting this bullshit
in a place where you never would have

2808
02:33:29,601 --> 02:33:31,850
just accepted it straight
up right off the bat.

2809
02:33:32,120 --> 02:33:35,050
You just kind of let it happen like that.
Next thing I know you're homeless. Yeah.

2810
02:33:35,120 --> 02:33:35,960
Pills and pills.

2811
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:38,780
Credit gets out of control and all of
this and you're evicted and you just

2812
02:33:38,781 --> 02:33:41,080
fucking doing handle your shit.
Yeah.

2813
02:33:41,090 --> 02:33:43,700
You do look at that to get motivated
because this is the bottom.

2814
02:33:43,701 --> 02:33:46,520
Then I know I've seen the bottom and I
don't want to be near the fucking bottle,

2815
02:33:46,570 --> 02:33:50,680
so that's what it is.
I do not want that. I,

2816
02:33:50,700 --> 02:33:53,390
when I watch a hoarder's, me and my wife
actually watched one the other night,

2817
02:33:53,391 --> 02:33:57,710
and this show is difficult to watch
because it was you. You're right.

2818
02:33:57,711 --> 02:33:58,800
That they do gradually,

2819
02:33:58,801 --> 02:34:03,801
except that they have to shit on top of
fucking caprice on boxes or something in

2820
02:34:03,981 --> 02:34:04,930
their way and shit,

2821
02:34:04,931 --> 02:34:09,020
and it just stacks up around him and
they're just shifting and then we just

2822
02:34:09,021 --> 02:34:11,960
started living in one room.
They say that all the time.

2823
02:34:12,250 --> 02:34:14,780
Also, I think that we
moved to this room's, yeah,

2824
02:34:14,870 --> 02:34:18,250
we all recognize that our own brains
are just vulnerable as these people's

2825
02:34:18,251 --> 02:34:19,084
brains.

2826
02:34:19,090 --> 02:34:22,550
Oh sure. We just did. A lot
of people choose to fight a
little bit of Ra, you know?

2827
02:34:22,580 --> 02:34:26,180
I can just keep the shit clean and
it takes work. Everything takes work.

2828
02:34:26,181 --> 02:34:28,240
There's life's maintenance
needs to be fucking done.

2829
02:34:28,241 --> 02:34:29,950
You can't let shit get out of control.

2830
02:34:29,980 --> 02:34:32,620
But we've all,
we've all gone into this weird spiral.

2831
02:34:32,621 --> 02:34:33,940
I think anybody that I've ever met,

2832
02:34:33,970 --> 02:34:37,030
especially anybody that's ever
been in a tumultuous relationship,

2833
02:34:37,300 --> 02:34:40,270
you go into this weird spiral where
you don't feel like you have that much

2834
02:34:40,271 --> 02:34:42,690
control over your thoughts and actions.
You know when,

2835
02:34:42,691 --> 02:34:46,200
when guys get in like a devastating
relationship, you get your heartbroken.

2836
02:34:46,210 --> 02:34:48,700
You can't sleep. You can't think.
And especially when that happens,

2837
02:34:48,701 --> 02:34:51,550
young in your life, he, you don't,
you don't really have it mastered yet.

2838
02:34:51,551 --> 02:34:53,680
You don't know really
understand who the fuck you are.

2839
02:34:53,900 --> 02:34:58,150
You know that shit can send you on
some kind of crazy spiral, you know?

2840
02:34:58,420 --> 02:35:01,690
And if you go through all that and you've
got some sort of a history of mental

2841
02:35:01,691 --> 02:35:05,470
illness in your family and you know,
next thing you know done,

2842
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:08,550
you're cracked.
Yeah.

2843
02:35:09,090 --> 02:35:11,380
I mean you don't want ever except
that it could happen to you,

2844
02:35:11,381 --> 02:35:13,930
but you look at someone
who's really devastated by,

2845
02:35:14,080 --> 02:35:17,560
by any sort of a fucking obsession
like that. Gambling obsessions. Yes.

2846
02:35:17,740 --> 02:35:21,140
No gambling people, dude. My
in laws live in dirty Vegas.

2847
02:35:21,141 --> 02:35:25,680
So you out near the airport pays out and
where there's all of those poker places

2848
02:35:25,690 --> 02:35:30,440
and the pawn shop poker place just
shut down fast food, fast food,

2849
02:35:30,441 --> 02:35:31,700
pawn shop, poker, poker,

2850
02:35:31,701 --> 02:35:35,750
poker and you go into one of those places
like a terribles casino and shit like

2851
02:35:35,751 --> 02:35:36,091
that.

2852
02:35:36,091 --> 02:35:40,280
And there's those car washes and you
go into like a PJ's poker place and you

2853
02:35:40,281 --> 02:35:44,210
just see these just guys.
You think like an Indian casino is bad.

2854
02:35:44,240 --> 02:35:48,170
There's regular casino, really nice. Then
there's a lower level downtown casinos.

2855
02:35:48,380 --> 02:35:49,940
Then there's like an Indian casino,

2856
02:35:49,941 --> 02:35:51,770
the shout in the middle of
fucking nowhere and like,

2857
02:35:51,771 --> 02:35:53,860
why would you go there and
they say it's like, oh,

2858
02:35:53,861 --> 02:35:57,350
it's a Morongo casino is we're real
nightlife is and you go in and it's just

2859
02:35:57,351 --> 02:36:02,270
like, like you know, weird grouping of
people in Morocco. They cool right here.

2860
02:36:02,271 --> 02:36:06,810
There's a lot of money in
Morocco. Come to Morocco. They,

2861
02:36:07,240 --> 02:36:10,620
there's so many hot chicks and I love
going to Marengo, man. Thank you. I can,

2862
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:12,410
they have these commercials that come on.

2863
02:36:12,710 --> 02:36:16,580
It's like the nightclubs and shit like
that and it ends up being old Chinese

2864
02:36:16,581 --> 02:36:18,650
ladies in like mystical wolf tee shirts.

2865
02:36:18,651 --> 02:36:23,270
Fucking walking around with those walkers
with the tennis balls on the bottom of

2866
02:36:23,271 --> 02:36:26,300
the feet. It's disgusting.
It's depressing shit.

2867
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:30,140
Is that gambling addiction as a
strange one man. Anybody whose spouse,

2868
02:36:30,150 --> 02:36:32,180
there's homeless people in my
neighborhood and bought a car.

2869
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:34,610
What I watched and be homeless.

2870
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:37,850
I knew they were going around
collecting cans and is one day,

2871
02:36:37,880 --> 02:36:40,130
you know how you got your eye on
the same homeless people at a time?

2872
02:36:40,131 --> 02:36:43,370
You've seen him around for a
regular basis? These two I can.

2873
02:36:43,371 --> 02:36:47,420
It's like a couple just from
people looking weird white
lady in this tall black

2874
02:36:47,421 --> 02:36:51,590
guy or is a top hat sometimes they
started driving around in a green minivan.

2875
02:36:51,650 --> 02:36:53,030
Fucked up green minivan,

2876
02:36:53,060 --> 02:36:56,750
but they got there and like saved up
enough cans like Marlboro miles to buy

2877
02:36:56,751 --> 02:36:58,100
their sleeping in his van though.

2878
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:02,930
I'm sure they're cheating
in my neighborhood because
they have a place where you

2879
02:37:03,320 --> 02:37:07,550
can turn recyclables into money and
then every night I see them just fucking

2880
02:37:07,551 --> 02:37:08,390
going through all my,

2881
02:37:08,450 --> 02:37:12,050
everyone's recycle bins and just taking
out all the shit from the recycle bins

2882
02:37:12,051 --> 02:37:15,520
and then selling it down the street.
Yeah. Cheating, cheating. No,

2883
02:37:15,530 --> 02:37:18,950
that's like the marvel doesn't does a
Starwood points for homeless people.

2884
02:37:18,951 --> 02:37:22,340
I think that makes sense because one
way or one way you're not gonna make any

2885
02:37:22,341 --> 02:37:24,560
money. If you just put your
recyclables on the street,

2886
02:37:24,590 --> 02:37:27,260
you're not going to make any money.
And for them it's like free money.

2887
02:37:27,470 --> 02:37:29,960
I don't think it's cheating at
all out of my fucking trash.

2888
02:37:29,961 --> 02:37:31,580
I don't want you in my tracks.
He was telling me they were,

2889
02:37:31,581 --> 02:37:33,860
as long as they do a good job,
that downtown,

2890
02:37:33,861 --> 02:37:36,800
they don't make them like your identity
and you're going to downtown la like

2891
02:37:36,920 --> 02:37:39,020
shopping mall or something like that.
And they saw,

2892
02:37:39,790 --> 02:37:42,910
or an office complex and he saw water
fountains where people throw money in the

2893
02:37:42,911 --> 02:37:45,350
fountain and they were just
standing there going, oh my God,

2894
02:37:45,351 --> 02:37:49,390
what a beautiful fountain.
And then this Latino family came in,

2895
02:37:49,400 --> 02:37:51,710
just rolled up all those leaves and
went in and they found and just started

2896
02:37:51,711 --> 02:37:55,910
taking all the money out and
GCA because it's free money.

2897
02:37:55,911 --> 02:37:59,730
We're throwing money in water. Yeah.
What do you say to that? How do you stop?

2898
02:37:59,980 --> 02:38:03,920
I have zero money and there's
money just right there.

2899
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:08,050
It's like a foot of water and it's like,
it's weird.

2900
02:38:08,260 --> 02:38:12,320
Like is it illegal to take the money?
Yeah. Yeah. Is it? I think so. It's all,

2901
02:38:12,500 --> 02:38:13,520
it shouldn't be.
No.

2902
02:38:13,521 --> 02:38:16,850
I think a lot of these fountains usually
have a charity booked around behind it.

2903
02:38:16,851 --> 02:38:18,710
Like the mall gives it to
a charity or something.

2904
02:38:18,711 --> 02:38:20,450
So really once it's that your con,

2905
02:38:20,480 --> 02:38:23,510
it's considered giving to
a charity then it stealing,

2906
02:38:23,511 --> 02:38:26,230
but it didn't know charity sign take
their money. You need the money.

2907
02:38:26,250 --> 02:38:29,630
They started doing it to a charity just
because people were doing it. Right? Yeah.

2908
02:38:29,750 --> 02:38:31,320
It's like the Mexican soccer said,

2909
02:38:31,340 --> 02:38:34,550
it's ridiculous that that's how fucking
rich this country as people can throw

2910
02:38:34,551 --> 02:38:37,280
money in a fountain.
The found enough money for food.

2911
02:38:37,460 --> 02:38:39,230
Like there's enough money
in that fountain for you.

2912
02:38:39,231 --> 02:38:41,060
Definitely to get something to eat.
You know,

2913
02:38:41,061 --> 02:38:42,450
it's always quarters
and nickels and dimes,

2914
02:38:42,451 --> 02:38:45,950
a comic that a cone and rider
that actually does that as a bit,

2915
02:38:45,951 --> 02:38:47,600
I'm sorry I'm forgetting his name,
but he goes,

2916
02:38:47,601 --> 02:38:51,110
imagine coming from another country
like where they have no water,

2917
02:38:51,111 --> 02:38:52,430
where you have to go to a,
well,

2918
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:56,210
I don't really just out in the middle
of nowhere and there's a one water hole

2919
02:38:56,211 --> 02:38:57,650
and there's a fucking tiger there.

2920
02:38:58,160 --> 02:39:02,760
And then you come to this country and
you've gone to like a place like, um,

2921
02:39:02,790 --> 02:39:06,080
to city center with citywalk
citywalk universal city walk, right?

2922
02:39:06,350 --> 02:39:09,500
And there's fucking water shooting up
out of the ground and kids are fucking

2923
02:39:09,501 --> 02:39:10,131
frolicking.

2924
02:39:10,131 --> 02:39:14,870
And then we're taking our extra money
and throwing it in the voc and fountain,

2925
02:39:14,930 --> 02:39:19,280
just like, here's our money in our
water. It's crazy, right? Released crazy.

2926
02:39:20,140 --> 02:39:23,690
It really is. Well, we don't realize how
rich this country is until you watch,

2927
02:39:23,691 --> 02:39:25,550
like, and even talk to some
of the people that are in,

2928
02:39:25,551 --> 02:39:29,390
in certain European countries where
there's no resources and nothing to do.

2929
02:39:29,391 --> 02:39:32,570
Like there's a, there's a real issue
in Italy right now with young people,

2930
02:39:32,600 --> 02:39:35,690
like where there's no fucking jobs,
there's really nothing they can do there.

2931
02:39:35,750 --> 02:39:38,720
You know, people are graduating
and there's like, there's nothing,

2932
02:39:38,780 --> 02:39:42,230
there's nothing out there. Mom's already
manning the cafe or whatever it is,

2933
02:39:42,231 --> 02:39:45,270
you know, there's no, yeah, you
have to go on and find an actual,

2934
02:39:45,271 --> 02:39:48,230
have to leave the country. You have
to get on a fucking boat or something,

2935
02:39:48,260 --> 02:39:51,740
you know, you've got to go find your
shit somewhere else. You're stuck. Yeah.

2936
02:39:51,770 --> 02:39:55,520
And I think a lot of the smarter people
said there's free land over in that

2937
02:39:55,521 --> 02:39:59,780
other place. And a people were nuts,
man, let's go. The idea behind that,

2938
02:40:00,110 --> 02:40:01,070
we've talked about it before,

2939
02:40:01,071 --> 02:40:05,030
but how crazy you have to be to be
living in Europe and say, you know what,

2940
02:40:05,060 --> 02:40:06,470
fuck this.
We're going to get you know,

2941
02:40:06,471 --> 02:40:10,100
boat and we're going to go across the
ocean. It's going to take a long time.

2942
02:40:10,250 --> 02:40:11,290
A lot of us are going to die.

2943
02:40:11,690 --> 02:40:14,370
A lot of us are gonna die and we're
going to get some new diseases

2944
02:40:14,370 --> 02:40:18,660
when we get there. But good dying
is better than no, that shit.

2945
02:40:18,690 --> 02:40:21,270
They weighed that out. They
must have, there must have been,

2946
02:40:21,810 --> 02:40:23,340
or they're just running from the law.

2947
02:40:23,341 --> 02:40:26,640
We're a nation built by criminals
running from European law.

2948
02:40:26,670 --> 02:40:29,850
I wonder how many people were supposed
to be one thing when they were in Europe.

2949
02:40:29,851 --> 02:40:33,180
They came over here at Bob Smith. That's
my name. You know, just new identity,

2950
02:40:33,181 --> 02:40:35,580
new identity, new.
Everything's clean. Slate.

2951
02:40:35,581 --> 02:40:39,210
That's how to wipe out a complete
record of yourself, right? Don Draper,

2952
02:40:39,211 --> 02:40:43,320
the whole thing. Yeah. A lot
of them. Right? You can't
do that shit anymore folks.

2953
02:40:43,710 --> 02:40:47,200
That's going out of the way
soon. Soon you're going to
be, you're going to be you.

2954
02:40:47,300 --> 02:40:49,860
[inaudible] where are you at this week?
And now you gotta be chill.

2955
02:40:49,980 --> 02:40:54,980
I am actually doing the John Oliver
TV comedy Central Show in New York on

2956
02:40:55,351 --> 02:40:59,830
Saturday night. Cool. And then, um,

2957
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:04,290
I'm going to be an Austin, Texas or the
Cap City comedy club. My favorite club.

2958
02:41:04,410 --> 02:41:07,530
And it would be at the Ontario Improv.
I've got those three coming out.

2959
02:41:07,590 --> 02:41:11,070
So it goes, can I come with you to
Austin, John Oliver, some bitches,

2960
02:41:11,970 --> 02:41:16,590
chicks in Austin. How confident
are you still? Some bitches.

2961
02:41:16,620 --> 02:41:17,370
Brian's like,

2962
02:41:17,370 --> 02:41:21,690
oh I have to do is go to Austin and I'll
just start a fucking heroin and shit.

2963
02:41:21,750 --> 02:41:22,471
I love them.

2964
02:41:22,471 --> 02:41:26,820
So I got to do is just go there like
rescuing them one in fast and are from to

2965
02:41:26,980 --> 02:41:29,130
Austin as the shit. Why
would it be rescuing? Yeah,

2966
02:41:29,131 --> 02:41:32,220
you're not dragging them because they
don't want to get world and they don't

2967
02:41:32,221 --> 02:41:33,240
want to get beat up anymore.

2968
02:41:33,241 --> 02:41:35,090
They're going to get in Twitter
fights with your ex-girlfriends,

2969
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:41,490
Twitter war. How many people would
have in public like spats on Twitter?

2970
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:44,700
It's so are they have relationships
are broken up on Twitter.

2971
02:41:44,701 --> 02:41:47,190
That's literally arguing with cheese.
That's another thing I miss.

2972
02:41:47,220 --> 02:41:50,220
I miss texting in my relationship
so I don't even know what it's like.

2973
02:41:50,221 --> 02:41:53,490
Where are you at when we,
you and I have no idea what that's about.

2974
02:41:53,790 --> 02:41:57,420
There's a few people that I follow just
because I know that they're in a famous

2975
02:41:57,421 --> 02:42:00,870
couple and then they'll get in spats
and when they get in spats like they'll

2976
02:42:00,871 --> 02:42:02,460
like leave like little vague shit.

2977
02:42:02,490 --> 02:42:07,010
There comes a point when you know that
you cannot count on anyone who's the,

2978
02:42:07,020 --> 02:42:11,070
who are the person I can't tell you
about mine. I tell you when we're off,

2979
02:42:11,420 --> 02:42:15,000
we're off air. But you know, I follow
them just because I want to hear them.

2980
02:42:15,150 --> 02:42:18,720
And then once that point has
been reached, it's over. Yeah.

2981
02:42:18,730 --> 02:42:21,270
So there's an echo in here.
I keep on hearing phones ring.

2982
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:23,970
I think I'm just going more friends.
Right Buddy? That's my medicine.

2983
02:42:24,020 --> 02:42:26,250
It's your medicine folks
is fucking shows over.

2984
02:42:26,730 --> 02:42:28,180
It should've been over a while ago now.

2985
02:42:28,350 --> 02:42:32,310
We've got to get new seats when we do
these two and two hours and 45 minutes

2986
02:42:32,311 --> 02:42:34,240
shows, I forgot. How was
that phase? You're happy.

2987
02:42:34,241 --> 02:42:37,540
So you need to work on your core now
because these are the most uncomfortable.

2988
02:42:37,830 --> 02:42:42,390
I feel pretty good. I'm right. He's right.
Rather. Um, I, I, when I got to, yeah,

2989
02:42:42,391 --> 02:42:45,030
there's no back support. I'm going to get
us office chairs. That's the next one.

2990
02:42:45,060 --> 02:42:47,250
Really Nice one.
That way we can move around more to,

2991
02:42:47,251 --> 02:42:51,000
we're not married to this one spot and
we can face each other better. Yeah.

2992
02:42:51,090 --> 02:42:53,430
Listen folks,
this shit is ever evolving.

2993
02:42:54,330 --> 02:42:56,680
I'm working on some sort of a
TV and look at the youth stream.

2994
02:42:56,970 --> 02:42:59,730
Really does look like a professional
environment though with the microphone in

2995
02:42:59,760 --> 02:43:03,630
your face and it looks like, you know we,
I mean it is a very professional setup,

2996
02:43:03,631 --> 02:43:06,840
but I'm saying fucking raise this
shit. Yeah, we'll figure it out.

2997
02:43:06,870 --> 02:43:08,250
When we first started doing it,
man,

2998
02:43:08,251 --> 02:43:11,980
we just had a laptop and we had like
snow in the background and shit and

2999
02:43:12,120 --> 02:43:14,230
does a terrible ones.
If you can download a podcast,

3000
02:43:14,260 --> 02:43:17,910
those first 10 of them can't believe
anybody was still listening. Yeah.

3001
02:43:18,170 --> 02:43:21,730
We just would get baked and just start
rambling and nobody was paying attention,

3002
02:43:21,731 --> 02:43:22,930
so we didn't think it was a big deal.

3003
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:26,170
But now there's like hundreds of thousands
of downloads and wanting to deliver a

3004
02:43:26,171 --> 02:43:29,050
quality. I feel like I
have to. Yeah. You know,

3005
02:43:29,110 --> 02:43:30,820
I have to make the
conversations interesting.

3006
02:43:30,821 --> 02:43:35,320
I have to bring on people like Al
Madrigal. I have fun town. Great.

3007
02:43:35,321 --> 02:43:36,820
Always barely.
You're an awesome dude.

3008
02:43:36,821 --> 02:43:38,350
I'm glad we've been friends
for all these years.

3009
02:43:38,351 --> 02:43:41,430
I'm glad I knew you back in
your salad days right now.

3010
02:43:41,550 --> 02:43:45,670
So I have a goal has not changed. I just
put down, what is it? What's it called?

3011
02:43:45,820 --> 02:43:50,320
It's called Cholos on a moped. Cholos
on a moped. Itunes. Franksville no,

3012
02:43:50,350 --> 02:43:53,160
it's just on my website. Okay.
It's, did they have to download?

3013
02:43:53,340 --> 02:43:56,740
They download it or they know they have
to download it and I just put it in sort

3014
02:43:56,741 --> 02:44:00,220
of a pay whatever you want it bottoms out
of seven 99 cause I think that's like,

3015
02:44:00,340 --> 02:44:04,510
that's nothing, but if people want to
pay 10 bucks or more, it's kind of cool.

3016
02:44:04,570 --> 02:44:08,260
I like that. You know, I've, I've
seen people do that with paypal links.

3017
02:44:08,261 --> 02:44:10,840
They say if you want to donate, you know,
here's where this is something to that.

3018
02:44:11,230 --> 02:44:14,720
I Dunno, I just, I'd rather people have
it than I make a certain dollar amount.

3019
02:44:14,800 --> 02:44:17,050
When before we go, let me, I
want to ask you about this.

3020
02:44:17,290 --> 02:44:20,180
How do you feel about like a online
piracy? What do, what is your,

3021
02:44:20,181 --> 02:44:21,040
what are your thoughts on that?

3022
02:44:21,570 --> 02:44:25,780
On I did actually like ripping a movie
and then distribute anything. Your stuff,

3023
02:44:25,810 --> 02:44:28,360
let's just go specifically
with your stuff. Oh,

3024
02:44:28,390 --> 02:44:32,410
if somebody puts a sign stuff out
online, wire takes my shit. I see.

3025
02:44:32,411 --> 02:44:37,150
I'm at a stage in my career where I
would like people to have the stuff more

3026
02:44:37,151 --> 02:44:39,550
than I like to bake. Well,
I'll write new shit, right?

3027
02:44:39,610 --> 02:44:41,410
I'm going to continue
to prove to producing,

3028
02:44:41,440 --> 02:44:43,720
I mean I'm just starting
to write now with this,

3029
02:44:43,721 --> 02:44:47,140
like a couple of bits that I have of
that the laugh factory put up on Youtube,

3030
02:44:47,470 --> 02:44:50,560
like the shut shit that I
really bucking enjoy doing.

3031
02:44:50,561 --> 02:44:53,380
So I just want to keep producing
shit like that in a high quality.

3032
02:44:53,381 --> 02:44:56,500
But at some point where there's
real big money to be made,

3033
02:44:56,501 --> 02:45:00,010
I'm sure I'll fucking want to sell
this stuff legitimately. Right.

3034
02:45:00,011 --> 02:45:03,190
I know what you're saying, but for the
most part I just want to get it out.

3035
02:45:03,520 --> 02:45:06,250
I'd give it to somebody. If somebody's
kid comes up to me after my shows,

3036
02:45:06,550 --> 02:45:08,500
I always say, pay what
you want. I don't care.

3037
02:45:08,530 --> 02:45:12,100
As long as you don't throw the fucking
dude, you look a hippie. Socialists.

3038
02:45:12,580 --> 02:45:16,810
I mean for the most, I see what you can
afford. The cheapest people give you a,

3039
02:45:16,811 --> 02:45:20,980
I'll take five bucks because
they cost three to make. Wow.

3040
02:45:21,070 --> 02:45:25,840
And so, and then if somebody put for the
most part, people give you $20 what is,

3041
02:45:26,110 --> 02:45:28,810
that's kind of cool.
What is the most someone's ever given you?

3042
02:45:28,970 --> 02:45:33,040
I had people in Tempe at the Tempe Improv
jumping up and down and it was one of

3043
02:45:33,041 --> 02:45:37,870
the last cds, but $40 $60 I think
for was like they were running out.

3044
02:45:38,170 --> 02:45:42,170
Oh, what are you doing Brian? What
does that museums are facing? Yeah,

3045
02:45:42,910 --> 02:45:45,370
sounds like a Chinese
restaurant, Bro. Chem trails,

3046
02:45:45,371 --> 02:45:48,950
but it sounds like the waiting area
for a Chinese restaurant. Yeah. Yeah.

3047
02:45:49,100 --> 02:45:51,400
You can make it louder a little bit.
There you go.

3048
02:45:51,430 --> 02:45:53,820
February 4th Mandalay Bay theater.

3049
02:45:53,821 --> 02:45:58,690
I am there with Ari Shaffir
and Joey Coco Diaz. Hopefully.

3050

uh, w tickets are selling very fast.

3052
02:46:07,751 --> 02:46:09,980
It's going to be a fucking crazy show.
It's a big place.

3053
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:14,120
It's like a, it's like 2000 seats,
something like that. 1800 seats.

3054
02:46:14,480 --> 02:46:18,350
It's a new theater in Mandalay bay and
that'll be the night before, uh, the UFC.

Thank you for being a great standup
comedian and thank you for being the same

3062
02:46:44,391 --> 02:46:49,040
guy that I met. We got high and watched
Oprah exactly the same 11 years ago.

3063
02:46:49,550 --> 02:46:52,220
It's pretty much not too much has
changed. Well, you're, you know, you're,

3064
02:46:52,221 --> 02:46:55,850
you're more of a dad and a man
now and all that good stuff. Sure.

3065
02:46:55,851 --> 02:46:58,550
But at the same doing same
guy. Yeah. I'm the same dude.

3066
02:46:58,580 --> 02:47:00,490
That doesn't always happen
that way. I know. And then,

3067
02:47:00,491 --> 02:47:04,850
and then you were telling me about Ray
Romano. That's exactly the same exact guy.

3068
02:47:04,880 --> 02:47:08,420
He's always been a great,
that's good to hear. Yeah, you
can keep it together. Sure.

3069
02:47:08,450 --> 02:47:09,470
You're going to keep it together.

3070
02:47:09,560 --> 02:47:12,350
I predict there's no used to be
all effected your the same thing.

3071
02:47:12,380 --> 02:47:15,350
It's like yes you could. You have
the right to be some like, you know,

3072
02:47:15,351 --> 02:47:19,310
affected fucking guy with people around
you and it's a mess that's fucks you up

3073
02:47:19,311 --> 02:47:22,190
more than the, the, the
ego boost is a fake one.

3074
02:47:22,310 --> 02:47:25,340
If you're a smart person that you don't
accept it and so you don't get a good

3075
02:47:25,341 --> 02:47:29,300
feeling out of it anyway. Cause you know,
it's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. Bitches.

3076
02:47:29,330 --> 02:47:34,010
We are in an atomic soup that no one
understands and it's been going back and

3077
02:47:34,011 --> 02:47:37,370
forth on and over from the big bang
to the end of creation forever.

3078
02:47:37,620 --> 02:47:40,040
And it's an endless cycle.
And we'll see you next week.

3079
02:47:40,400 --> 02:47:44,540
And fleshlight tall latch a boy.
Yeah. fleshlight.com go there. And um,

3080
02:47:44,660 --> 02:47:45,860
and just buy a bunch of them.

3081
02:47:45,861 --> 02:47:48,470
Just jerk off in the him and shoot
your loads all over the house.

3082
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:51,560
There's special, they're good.
They feel better than beating off.

3083
02:47:51,561 --> 02:47:54,800
You will have long ball draining orgasms.

3084
02:47:55,100 --> 02:47:58,730
I highly recommend,
highly recommend it.

3085
02:47:58,940 --> 02:48:03,740
Also a Miami Improv. Ah,
fuck. I don't even know who's
going down with me. I'm 28,

3086
02:48:03,741 --> 02:48:07,840
29 and 30 and not Miami.
And probably I keep saying that.

3087
02:48:07,850 --> 02:48:11,300
I said that twice West Palm beach and
bigger, nicer. You know why I say it?

3088
02:48:11,301 --> 02:48:14,100
Because it's a half an hour from Miami
and I'll never worked in Miami Improv

3089
02:48:14,180 --> 02:48:17,360
ever again. So I'm just
terrified cause it's right there.

3090
02:48:17,361 --> 02:48:18,640
It's a half an hour away.
Yeah.

3091
02:48:19,100 --> 02:48:23,510
It's the only place where I was on stage
in the middle of a show and people were

3092
02:48:23,511 --> 02:48:27,530
so dumb. Like I had some joke where I
brought up the word Oscar de la Hoya,

3093
02:48:27,560 --> 02:48:28,530
like brought up his name.

3094
02:48:28,850 --> 02:48:32,600
And so all of a sudden this
fucking war broke out in the crowd.

3095
02:48:32,740 --> 02:48:36,770
We do no fucking mad. She'll
get Shane Mosley, fuck Mosley.

3096
02:48:37,340 --> 02:48:40,580
And then they started going back and
forth and yelling out at the top like it's

3097
02:48:40,581 --> 02:48:44,060
a cafeteria,
like who's the most bad ass boxer?

3098
02:48:44,300 --> 02:48:47,000
And they went on for like 30 seconds.
So these guys were yelling back,

3099
02:48:47,001 --> 02:48:49,730
standing up, doing these things
with their hands, yelling at him.

3100
02:48:50,030 --> 02:48:52,910
And I just had finally I said, I'm
never coming here again. That's great.

3101
02:48:52,940 --> 02:48:55,550
I was there in a woman's hair
caught on fire and she vomited.

3102
02:48:55,670 --> 02:48:59,520
Nice when in what order?
That's that first second.

3103
02:49:00,220 --> 02:49:02,090
And that lays is end of the show.

3104
02:49:02,091 --> 02:49:07,091
So a West Palm Beach Improv 28 29 and
30th you know all that Twitter details and

3105
02:49:07,560 --> 02:49:08,010

3106
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:12,360
of Twitter followers as a result.
