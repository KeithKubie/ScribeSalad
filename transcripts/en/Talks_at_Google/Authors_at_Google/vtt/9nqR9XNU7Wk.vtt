RACHEL: So hi, everybody.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.580
Thanks so much for coming.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.290
I am here in Mountain View, and
we've got a full packed room.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.631
Our room is a little tight,
but thanks for being here.

00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:18.380
And on the livestream,
I know there's many

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.830
of you joining us from
around everywhere at Google.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.110
And just thrilled
that you're here.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.310
So thanks so much.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.170
Today we are hosting Dr.
Rick Hanson, who is here.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.659
He is a local in the
Bay Area, and he's

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.510
going to be talking about his
new book, "Resilient," which

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.500
has a lot of really good
data, where he blends

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.280
in his expertise in
neuroscience, mindfulness,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.830
positive psychology, his
clinical psychologist

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.090
background.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.530
And like [? Van ?]
said, speaks to what

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.010
we can create for ourselves
if we are conscious to what

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.820
we want to create.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.170
So I'm just really
excited to learn more.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.800
And I also want to thank you,
Rick, on behalf of Google

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.060
for being here.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.540
And I also have learned
through the [? depos ?] program

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.130
and the work in
emotional intelligence

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.610
that I do that if we change
our mind, we change our lives,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.020
we change our brain.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.120
And that is the mantra
that my mentor Judith

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.710
Wright has taught
me, and that is what

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.970
Rick is here to tell us today.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.330
I'm just thrilled to hear more,
and it's all about savoring,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.005
right, Rick?

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:25.130
We're going to be savoring.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.440
So as you are here
for the hour, this

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.540
is our practical
application of the hour is

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.740
to savor what you learn today.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.990
How are you going to apply it?

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.300
Just know that you're in
the here and now with Rick

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.140
and all of us, and we can change
our lives, change our minds,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.890
change your brain.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.070
It's really, really cool.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.820
With that, I'll hand
it over to you, Rick.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.830
Thanks.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.160
RICK HANSON: Thank
you very much.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.098
That was a really
enthusiastic introduction.

00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:50.980
Thank you.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.959
I appreciate it.

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:53.500
That's great.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.190
It's an honor for me to be here.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.640
I am a complete fan and
actually very grateful

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.670
for Google's place in the world
and to have a full house here

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.190
of really, really smart people
interested in this material

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.810
just really touches me.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.950
What I want to explore with
you fundamentally is the how

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.940
of changing the
brain for the better.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.750
And that general
purpose how can then

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.260
be applied to any
particular thing

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.270
we want to develop,
any particular form

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.200
of skillfulness, any
beneficial state of being,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.350
any useful attitude.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.330
Happiness altogether
is something

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.490
that we can to develop as well.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.270
And to make a point
at the beginning

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.390
that I'll make
again in the middle,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.490
it's really striking
for someone like me,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.830
who's been in the growth
business, the growth game

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.620
for pushing 50 years now almost.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.500
I started young in the
human potential movement,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.100
and along the way, became
a mindfulness teacher,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.309
a clinical psychologist,
a neuropsychologist.

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:56.600
It's really interesting to
me that for those of us that

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.570
are in the business of
growth, and by growth,

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.270
I mean the term quite
broadly to include

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.040
learning of skillfulness,
social skillfulness, healing,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.310
personal development,
that for those of us who

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.710
are in this territory,
we still lack

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.970
a general theory of growth.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.770
We have a general
theory of attachment,

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.710
we have a general theory
of how people, for example,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.860
might develop particular
things, such as self-compassion.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.050
But there's actually
no general theory

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.330
of growth, which in
a funny kind of way

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.280
would be the most
useful thing to have,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.160
because then it could be
applied to any particular thing

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.160
to develop.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.360
And so what I'd like to
do in a fairly brisk way,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.660
moving right along here is
to explore this material

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.610
with you, particularly
with an emphasis

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.170
on pragmatic, immediately
applicable tools.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.014
And I know the slides will
be available to you later.

00:03:49.014 --> 00:03:51.180
There's also a lot of
supportive material about this

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.000
on my website, including
our kind of greatest hits

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.360
collection of scientific
papers in the public domain

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.710
and other resources there, too.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.850
You can learn more
about it there as well.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.870
So here, I'm going to try to
move straight into a fairly

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.900
direct summary of how to engage
volitional, psychological

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.170
mental factors
inside your own mind

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.579
that increases the
registration of experiences

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.579
that you're having,
and thereby increases

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.390
their conversion into
lasting physical changes

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.070
of neural structure
and function,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.160
which is the fundamental
process of any kind of lasting

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.499
change for the better.

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:32.790
So that's what I'm going to
be exploring with you here.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.360
OK?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.440
So here we go.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.130
They said the way to do this
is to zip along, and then

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.799
at about--

00:04:38.799 --> 00:04:40.340
when there are about
15 minutes left,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.390
slow down for questions
and discussion.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.250
I'm also going to do a little
bit of experiential practice,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.600
utterly voluntary along the way.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.640
And as Rachel said in the
beginning, the opportunity

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.040
inside our own minds, in a sense
is to do experiments there,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.880
to treat it as a kind of
laboratory in which we

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.070
see the results from what's
called the first person

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.460
perspective of subjectivity,
while at the same time

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.140
being able to draw plausible
conclusions from a third person

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.430
perspective about actually what
might be happening physically

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.660
inside our own brain.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.730
So that's my intro.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:18.690
Let's get to it.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.400
So I want to talk
with you to begin

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.860
with about the notion
of inner resources,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.280
psychological strengths
of various kinds.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.850
If we are to have any
kind of lasting well-being

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.600
in a changing world, we need
to be resilient, not just

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.270
for surviving the
worst day of our life,

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.580
but thriving every
day of our life.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.550
Or to use a traditional
saying, through resilience,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.220
we're able to walk evenly
over uneven ground.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.960
I think of resilience a
lot like having a deep keel

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.410
in your personal sailboat.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.830
Having capsized a sailboat when
I was learning how to sail,

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.370
I've really come to appreciate
the value of a deep keel.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.740
Resilience is our deep keel.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.390
It enables us to
recover fairly rapidly,

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.440
and in particular, over the
course of a day, or at work,

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.470
or in a relationship,
we can keep

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.170
on going with that
deep keel in the water.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.190
So to have any kind of lasting
happiness, well-being broadly,

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.780
we need to be resilient.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.780
All right, what do we
need to be resilient?

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.120
Where does resilience come from?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.890
Fundamentally, resilience
comes from internal resources,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.520
and the development and
use of internal resources

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.350
is in a larger frame
that's commonly

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.510
used in health care
and psychology that

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.790
says that the
course of a person's

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.740
life over a day, a week,
or the entire lifetime

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.450
is, in effect, an equation
with three variables.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.070
It's the result
of the combination

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.140
of three factors,
the challenges that

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.710
wear upon a person, the
vulnerabilities they penetrate

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.620
through, like
chinks in a person's

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.850
armor, and the
resources the person

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.310
draws upon to deal
with those challenges

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.960
and to shore up vulnerabilities.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.700
It's a nice and very
useful and simple model.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.640
All three are opportunities
to make things better.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.220
I tend to focus on resources,
because it's forward

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.590
looking and tends to
be positive and also

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.960
because challenges and
vulnerabilities can often

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.130
be intractable.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.680
And yet, we're surrounded
by opportunities one way

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.780
or another to grow resources.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.420
OK, so where are
challenges, vulnerabilities,

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.100
and resources located?

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.700
Out in the world, in the
body, and in the mind.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.770
This gives us-- my inner geek--

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.830
a three by three matrix,
if you think about it,

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.070
obviously, nine cells,
challenges, vulnerabilities,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.340
resources, world, body,
mind, bing, bing, bing.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.580
The ninth cell, resources in the
mind, is full of opportunity,

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.610
because we can intervene
there directly,

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.670
and we take the fruits
with us wherever we go.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.800
So that's what I'm
going to focus on here

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.270
in this larger frame.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.780
I'm not against helping things
be better in those other eight

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.880
ways, if you will,
but I'm going to focus

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.000
on resources in the mind.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.360
Resources in the mind
include familiar things

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.200
like mindfulness.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.250
Mindfulness is a fundamental
mental or psychological

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.120
resource.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.570
Other resources include
classic character virtues,

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.370
like modesty or thrift.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.070
I was a Boy Scout in a
very rebellious troop.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.420
We caused a lot of trouble.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.980
I remember four things, I think.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.670
A Boy Scout is thrifty, brave,
clean, and reverent, something

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.330
like that.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.920
I didn't remember
the rest of them.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.090
Those are virtues.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:32.070
Skills are inner resources,
know how, both technical

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.539
know how applied on the job, as
well as inter-personal know how

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.840
and intrapersonal
know how, knowing

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.690
how to manage one's own
reactions and to manage

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.550
the thoughts, the flow of
one's thoughts and feelings.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.800
That's procedural learning.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.420
That's learning how to.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.190
Other inner resources include
positive emotions, love,

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:55.860
moral commitments,
good intentions.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.320
Those are inner resources, too.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.610
So the question then becomes,
how do we develop them?

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.480
The harder a person's life
is, the more important

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.100
it is to develop
inner resources.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.060
It's easy to think about
this sort of material

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.960
as cherries on the frosting
of the cake of life.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.570
Oh yeah, when everything's fine,
I'm going to savor the moment.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.640
Well, the worse things are--

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.450
think about it-- and the more
that a person is on their own.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.390
The calvary is not coming.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.610
Many people experience
life this way these days.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.700
The more important it is as the
foundation of self-reliance,

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.470
a kind of old school scruffy
determination to do what we can

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.720
in any moment to grow
as much as possible

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.430
from here, because
there's nothing

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.010
we can do about the
past, the more important

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.610
it is to have inner resources.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.470
So that's a key
context here that I'm

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.760
speaking about this material
not as some sort of add

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.210
on for people who
are very privileged.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.270
OK.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.790
Researchers generally
have focused

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:04.620
on identifying and using
psychological resources,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.020
such as workplace mindfulness.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:07.770
Really good.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.120
It's good to identify it.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.070
It's good to apply it.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.290
But what about acquiring
it in the first place?

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.090
That's actually
been really lacking

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:19.030
in most of the research
on inner resources,

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.640
including recent
research on things

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.350
like character strengths.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.630
So how do we develop them?

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.470
What's the possibility here?

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:30.540
Well, if you look at research
on the nature nurture question,

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.780
the ballpark is
that at least half,

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.910
if not even up to
about two-thirds

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.010
of the variation in
human attributes,

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:43.720
psychological attributes, is
not due to heritable factors.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.890
In other words, roughly
a third to a half

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:50.760
of the variation on average has
to do with heritable factors,

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.880
kind of woven early into DNA.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.090
The other opportunity,
though, is

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.520
what we can acquire over time.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.370
That is really,
really good news.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.250
It also takes us to a
fundamental responsibility.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:09.240
No one can stop us from growing
resources inside ourselves,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.780
from learning and growing
over the course of the day.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.150
No one can stop us
from trying to do

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.540
that inside the inner
sanctuary of our own mind.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.960
But no one can do it for
us as well, which to me,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.140
gives a kind of credibility
to the results of those forms

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.560
of inner practice.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.930
So if we are to grow inner
resources in the mind, that

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.930
fundamentally means
changing the brain,

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.960
because inside the natural
frame, whatever mysteries may

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.037
lay outside the natural frame,
inside the natural frame, which

00:11:40.037 --> 00:11:42.120
is certainly where I'm
going to be speaking today,

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.910
and where I generally
operate, any kind

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.930
of lasting change of mind
must involve a lasting change

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.780
of body in particular
in the nervous system

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.500
and its headquarters, the brain.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.640
So how do we do it?

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.810
How do we get those green
balls into the brain?

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.690
This takes us to
self-directed neuroplasticity,

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.300
a term coined by Jeffrey
Schwartz at UCLA 15,

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.640
20 years ago.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.970
To put things in context,
neuroscience is a baby science.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.820
So much has been just discovered
in the last year or two,

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.250
let alone and definitely
the last decade or two.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.280
So new things have
been seen all the time,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.420
and it's really an
exciting, to me, territory.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.980
So an overview of
current research.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:31.980
What is very well known is
that mental practices A,

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:37.200
produce mental results, C,
presumably via the black box,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.100
B, of the brain.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.090
That's the first point.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.960
There's much research
that mental efforts

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.080
produce psychological results.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.107
Can.

00:12:46.107 --> 00:12:47.940
There's also a tremendous
amount of research

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.510
that's invasive and
ethically questioned mark

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.920
on non-human animals that
various stimuli, presumably

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.960
with experiential
correlates, lead

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.690
to lasting changes
in their brains.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.090
And through very
invasive research

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.230
of the granularity of
what's been discovered

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.830
is really quite extraordinary.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.420
So there's here, too,
a lot of evidence

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:18.790
that the experience of any
kind of a complex animal

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.985
can lead to lasting physical
changes in the nervous system.

00:13:21.985 --> 00:13:23.860
This is the basis of
what's called experience

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.100
dependent neuroplasticity.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.510
There is some research on
humans that their experiences,

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.320
including meditative practice,
mindfulness practice can

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.780
change their brains over time.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.860
There's a little research
on, to me, the stuff

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.080
that's really, really
useful to know about,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.520
which is how can people relate
to the experiences they're

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.530
having, how can they relate to
the emotions they're having,

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.960
the sensations in
their body, the ideas

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.990
that they're having,
the intentions, the

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.850
wants that they're experiencing.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.550
How can they relate
to those experiences

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:01.920
to maximize the gain from them,
to maximize the lasting impact?

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.150
There's a little bit
of research about that,

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.867
which is scattered
here and there

00:14:05.867 --> 00:14:07.450
and which I've tried
to pull together,

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.150
but I want to be modest
and appropriate about what

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.070
is and is not known
with regard to that.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:17.800
And last, there's one study,
my study actually, disclosure,

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.490
on the systematic training
and the mental factors,

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.070
volitional mental
factors, that plausibly

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.800
can steepen people's
growth curves

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.420
as they grow through life.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.070
This study is in process.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.200
I'm running up the
results with collaborators

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.740
from the University
of California.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.290
It's not yet peer reviewed.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.690
All disclaimers said happily.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.280
We've gotten really
good results.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.200
It would be so
embarrassing if we hadn't.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.050
But anyway, that's the
status of the research.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.030
In this context, then,
I want to talk with you

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.680
about what's plausible.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.070
And then we can start
engaging the laboratory

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:55.640
immediately inside ourselves
to see what real results are.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.650
So in this context of some,
you know, modesty the learning

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.900
process, the change
process fundamentally

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.840
happens in two stages, two
necessary and sufficient

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.650
stages.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:09.040
We begin in almost all
cases with an experience.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.650
There is some
learning that occurs

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.560
through unconscious
processes, but the great bulk

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.270
of human development, healing,
transformation, even awakening

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.970
begins with an experience
of one kind or another.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.700
There are different terms that
are used for the experience.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.770
I like experience, because
it's kind of direct.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.240
It makes it clear.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.590
Neurologically, we could
talk about encoding.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:35.860
We could use the general term
I use for activation in terms

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.180
of a phase, or an old
fashioned word, state,

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.670
some kind of state of
being, state of mind,

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.030
state of attitude, state of
intention, state of sensation,

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.110
some kind of state.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.600
That's the necessary first
step, but it's not sufficient.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.730
There must be the
second stage of learning

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.740
for any kind of lasting value.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.810
And you're probably
starting to see the critique

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:01.670
that I'm mounting here of
most efforts, including my own

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.190
to help people have some kind
of lasting value, some kind

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.080
of lasting benefit
from something.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.584
We must engage the
second stage of learning.

00:16:08.584 --> 00:16:09.500
Call it what you will.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.060
I call it the
installation stage.

00:16:13.828 --> 00:16:17.750
I have a cybernetic kind of
view of things in many ways.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.440
To me, it makes sense,
activation, installation.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.620
In neurological terms, we
would speak of consolidation,

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.500
or kind of in simple language,
the movement from state

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.100
to trade.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.680
This is a fundamental
two stage process.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.290
The second stage is
necessary and it's

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.390
one we routinely forget.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.760
This two stage process
is summarized in kind

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.500
of increasingly
well known saying

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.410
from the work of the Canadian
psychologist Donald Hebb,

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.020
"Neurons that fire
together wire together."

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.210
I've actually had some
grad students turn that

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.770
into a rap video for me.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:49.810
It's pretty cool.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.070
But I don't sing myself.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.390
People pay me not to sing.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.940
But here's this fundamental
process, fire together,

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.840
wire together.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.620
It's actually more
complicated than that.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.040
I won't go through every
little bit on this slide.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.840
You can look at it
later if you like.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.140
It's a summary of the major
mechanisms of experience

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.099
dependent neuroplasticity.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:11.599
The many ways in which
the nervous system

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:16.369
is designed to be transformed,
in effect, by the information

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:21.500
flowing through it, that as
immaterial information does,

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.869
it is represented
by some material

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:26.930
substrate, the flows
of information that

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.620
are the basis for experiences
moving to the nervous system

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:34.670
enlist underlying neural
processes to represent them

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:38.630
and repeated patterns of
underlying neural processing

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.860
leave lasting traces behind,
leave lasting changes behind.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.350
And the fundamental
notion of experience

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.960
dependent neuroplasticity
is not breaking news.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.150
It's been presumed
for a long time

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.060
that any kind of
learning, broadly

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.940
defined, learning to
walk, instead of crawling,

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.570
learning how to be more patient
while raising teenagers--

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.530
I had to work on
that one myself--

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:02.330
any kind of real
learning must involve

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.720
a physical change, presumably
primarily in the brain.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.250
That's not a new idea.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:11.420
The real news in neuroplasticity
is the extraordinary degree

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.820
to which these
changes can proceed

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.690
and the breadth and depth
of the remodeling process

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.190
of the nervous
system, especially

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.900
the cerebral cortex
that can occur,

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:26.580
as we develop and change,
for better or worse in life.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.140
So the essence of the process
I just went through that moves

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.110
from state to trade,
and you can apply it

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.210
to many ordinary experiences,
think about the acquisition

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:37.580
of greater trait mindfulness.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.170
Begins with the
experiences of mindfulness,

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:45.200
which then, in some way,
incidentally or deliberately,

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.660
leave lasting traces
behind in the body,

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.340
especially in the
nervous system.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.810
We become more compassionate,
more resilient, more grateful,

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.290
more skillful with other people,
more skillful with ourselves

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.870
by having experiences
of these things, which

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:03.230
then are internalized,
installed in some way,

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.960
leading to lasting
changes behind.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.090
But here's a key
point, a key critique.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.390
Knowing does not
equal experiencing,

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.790
and experiencing does
not equal learning.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:21.490
Think about the large percentage
of useful experiences we have,

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.160
useful moments, where we're
happy about something,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.350
or we understand something, or
we feel committed to something,

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:33.610
or we kind of move into a really
nice state of being or kind

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.850
of in a zone, and then
whoosh, it's gone.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.700
We can't find our
way back to it again.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.890
For me, as a longtime
clinical psychologist,

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:45.350
longtime therapist, and
teacher and other roles,

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.110
including in
business consulting,

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:51.370
it's humbling to appreciate
how many hard won moments

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:56.080
that people were having, useful
thoughts, good intentions,

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.110
ways of feeling at ease
released in some way,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:02.860
et cetera, et cetera, how
large a fraction of them

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.860
washed through the brain
like water through a sieve

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.300
without leaving any
lasting value behind.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.100
And if anybody, like
myself, is involved

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.160
in helping others change for
the better, as a manager,

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.860
as a parent, as an
educator, as a coach,

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.160
as someone engaged
in the larger world,

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.180
it's really, to me,
right at the bullseye

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.980
of what we should
focus on, which

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.570
is how to increase
the conversion

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.730
rate from states to traits.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.520
How do we help
useful moments really

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.000
land in the heart of
ourselves and other people,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.097
so they take root there and
really, really, really sink in?

00:20:40.097 --> 00:20:42.055
So that's what I want to
focus on with you now,

00:20:42.055 --> 00:20:46.060
the plausible, practical
neuropsychology of actually

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.180
how to do this.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.220
How do we actually steepen
the conversion rate from state

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.510
to trait?

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.450
Without doing that, we
tend to flatten the gains

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.780
from programs.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.630
We also, in particular,
if you think

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.540
of the distribution of results
in various trainings including

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.030
formal mindfulness trainings,
usually about a third

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.420
to half the people in them don't
get much out of them, drop out,

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.820
they don't practice,
or they get gains.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.880
They say well, that was amazing,
but then 10 days later, they're

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.102
as neurotic as ever.

00:21:14.102 --> 00:21:15.810
I can speak from some
personal experience

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.050
there about myself there.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:21.340
So if we don't pay attention
to this installation

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.140
phase of learning,
we're going to lose

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.072
all kinds of opportunities.

00:21:25.072 --> 00:21:26.530
To put it in a
certain way, I think

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.447
about four schematic
lives, you know,

00:21:29.447 --> 00:21:31.030
think of anything
you want to develop,

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.550
mental resource on that side.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:39.380
Happiness, calm,
self-confidence, self-worth,

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.720
no longer being haunted
by childhood experiences,

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.530
greater habit of skillfulness
with other people.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:48.760
What do we want to develop?

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.880
Well, imagine one life
that just goes downhill.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.120
That's the decline.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.930
There this person at
the end of that period,

00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:00.550
a day, a year, a life, is less
happy, less wise, less capable

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.680
than they were than
when they started.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.400
Then we have the second
life schematically, flat,

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.010
no decline, but no gain
in terms of the outcome

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.720
values on the
y-axis that we care

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.630
about, the mental
resources axis.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.420
What about, then, the person
who has a linear growth?

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.540
This person is getting
stronger, getting happier,

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.500
getting more loving, getting
calmer, let's say, over time.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.460
That's great.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.380
And then we have
the person who's

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.500
learning how to learn along
the way, a person whose

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.520
growth curve takes an
exponential course.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.850
And to me, where the takeaway is
is to really stare hard at that

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.980
and go, wow, in things
that I care about

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.980
or things that, frankly, you
know, my friends and family

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.710
or therapist tell me I
really ought to care about,

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.660
what's my trend?

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.920
Is it an upward trend?

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:48.880
What's the delta?

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.380
How steep is that curve?

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:55.240
And can I start moving
into exponential growth.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.750
What can we do to steepen
our growth curves?

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.480
I think of this process
in a kind of old school

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.980
way, as we're growing
strengths inside,

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.610
to me, learning,
very broadly defined,

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.010
especially emotional
learning, not so much book

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:11.960
learning or
intellectual learning,

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.280
but social learning,
intrapersonal learning,

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.830
motivational learning, learning
how to motivate yourself,

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:22.040
learning how to lean into what's
good for yourself and others.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.750
This kind of learning,
broadly defined,

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.570
I think of as the
strength of strengths,

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:30.480
because it's the strength
that grows the rest of them.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:36.400
So this point is really
sharpened, the general point

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.090
about the importance of focusing
on acquisition and development

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:43.730
and what aids acquisition
that's under internal control

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.100
that we can do ourselves.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.840
This point is really
sharpened when

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.810
you face what scientists call
the brain's evolved negativity

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:52.000
bias.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.470
A simple way of
putting it, I put

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.810
it is that we've got a
brain, that's basically

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:59.830
by design, like Velcro,
for bad experiences,

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.660
but like Teflon for good ones.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.850
We all have experiences of--

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:05.184
what?

00:24:05.184 --> 00:24:06.600
Well, we all have
a sense of this.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.308
You know, you go
through a day, 10 things

00:24:08.308 --> 00:24:11.130
happen in a relationship with
someone at work or at home.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:14.130
Nine of them are good, one
of them is bad, you know,

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:15.547
unpleasant, harmful.

00:24:15.547 --> 00:24:17.880
What's the one you brood about
as you're falling asleep,

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.380
right?

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.690
Or I think about
performance reviews.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:24.870
You know, 19, like 10
points of feedback,

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:28.120
you know, nine are really good,
one is room for improvement.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.610
What's the one
you just brood on?

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.460
You just think about,
room for improvement,

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.306
you know, for the rest
of the week, right?

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:35.430
That's the negativity bias.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:39.060
So by design, if
you think about it,

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.400
our ancestors needed to
get carrots and avoid

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.280
sticks, carrots like food,
sticks like predators.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.520
Both are important.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.950
But there's a key difference.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.110
If you fail to get
that carrot today,

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.970
back in the Serengeti
plains, you'll

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.310
have a chance of one
tomorrow probably.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.520
If you fail to avoid that
predator or that aggression

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.380
inside your band or between
bands, potentially no more

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.790
carrots forever.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.980
Sticks are more
consequential, typically,

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.350
in terms of raw
survival, and the passing

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:10.050
on of genes that pass
on genes, the engine

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:12.330
of biological evolution.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.770
Sticks have more
urgency and impact.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.740
So by design, we've
got a brain that

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.170
does five things
automatically, routinely,

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:22.650
and you can watch your mind,
therefore your brain doing it.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.890
Scan for bad news.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:27.050
Overfocus upon it.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:28.970
Overreact to it.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:32.630
Fast track it in the memory,
especially emotional memory,

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.160
implicit memory.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.980
And then along the way, through
the activity of the stress

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.060
hormone cortisol,
gradually become sensitized

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:46.010
to stressful, irritating,
frustrating, annoying

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:49.160
experiences, so we're just
a little more reactive

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.340
to them the day after that,
which then, as you can see,

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.080
creates a vicious cycle.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.630
And in the process of
all this, as our brains

00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:00.560
change in this way
by design, we tend

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.960
to create negative
cycles with others

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.170
that then continue to change
our brain in that way.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.990
That's the fundamental
negativity bias.

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:11.690
It's a kind of universal,
well-intended learning

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.570
disability, as a result of
having a brain optimized

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:17.750
for peak performance in
Stone Age conditions.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:21.080
We learn very rapidly
from experiences

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.310
of disappointment or
frustration or self-doubt

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:26.270
or self-criticism.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.530
We learn really quickly.

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.350
Once burned, twice
shy, never forget.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.070
Those red balls go
right into the brain.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.710
They're fast tracked in.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:37.250
But because of the
focus on the red

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:41.030
balls draws us away from
sustaining attention

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:44.140
to the green balls, which are
not prioritized for storage.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.880
So they need extra help
so that they actually

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.240
can lead to lasting changes of
neural structure and function.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.060
And I'm going to talk
about how to do that now.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.210
All right, so the
negativity bias,

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:58.250
a lot of implications there.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:00.200
Daniel Kahneman,
the psychologist,

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.360
won a Nobel Prize in
economics for his work

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.260
on loss aversion, the ways that
people are typically much more

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.380
motivated by not
losing something

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.700
rather than by gaining the
equivalent amount or reward.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.010
There's been a lot of research
on the negativity bias.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.740
By the way, my slides
have, I think, seven slides

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.690
worth of references and
small print at the back,

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:23.840
including a couple
of great papers

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.140
that are literature reviews
on the negativity bias.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.090
It's really interesting to think
of the consequences of that,

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:30.590
including in her own life.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.630
All right, Velcro, Teflon.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:33.260
OK.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.430
So how do we do it?

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.930
I want to talk
about the how now.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:39.530
How do we get lasting gains
from passing experiences?

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.340
How can we increase the
conversion rate, in effect,

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.070
of beneficial states?

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.280
Now, I use the word
beneficial pragmatically

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.350
as that which is
useful or that which

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:51.690
promotes happiness and welfare
for ourselves and others.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.630
How can we increase
the conversion rate

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.600
from beneficial states
to beneficial traits?

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.970
Here's where I use a
framework that I've

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:03.530
developed called the HEAL
framework that summarizes

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:09.770
the plausible, internal factors
we can mobilize to increase

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:14.330
over a time scale typically
of a dozen or less seconds,

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.660
that we can plausibly
engage these mental factors

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:22.750
to increase the conversion rate
of experiences we're having

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.920
into some kind of lasting
change of neural structure

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.830
and function.

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.520
This framework is
pragmatic and eclectic.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.230
I've just pulled a
lot of stuff together.

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:33.380
You'll recognize things that
skillful teachers are already

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.410
doing, or you're already doing
yourself inside your own mind,

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:37.849
as I talk through this.

00:28:37.849 --> 00:28:39.890
And then we'll do a little
experiential practice,

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.290
explore the implications,
and then I'll shut up,

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.880
and we'll discuss it.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.480
All right?

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.050
OK.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.980
So this is the fundamental
neuropsychology of learning.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.740
We begin with an
experience, have some kind

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.510
of beneficial experience.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:55.670
And then we move into
the installation phase,

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:59.510
which has two subjectively and
objectively distinct aspects.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.730
I call them enriching
and absorbing.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.070
In actual practice, they
sort of mush together,

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.400
but they're actually distinct.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.590
Enriching, subjectively,
is like having

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:13.520
a large, sustained,
powerful, intense experience.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.960
It's enriched.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.870
Absorbing, subjectively,
it's like receiving it

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.360
into yourself,
giving over to it,

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.330
feeling like literally it's
sinking in, like almost

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.830
a warmth spreading inside.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.310
The distinction there.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:31.540
Objectively, enriching
an experience presumably

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:36.730
means a very large sustained,
spread, and intense pattern

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:39.290
of neural activation.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:43.370
Absorbing is about turning
up the sensitivity, the gain,

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.460
as it were in the internal
memory making machinery

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.305
of the brain.

00:29:47.305 --> 00:29:50.090
To use a bit of a
metaphor, enriching

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:53.840
is like getting a really
rich, green liquid

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.940
sitting on top of a
sponge, so now it's

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.180
really dense and vivid and
bright green and concentrated,

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.580
and then absorbing is
like picking a sponge

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.680
or helping a sponge
become especially

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.310
receptive to the
experiences landing in it.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:09.830
In practice, as I said, these
two sort of mush together,

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.920
but I'm being opportunistic
here and looking

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.180
for anything that can help the
registration of an experience.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.870
So enriching, we help
the experience be big.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:20.870
There are five fundamental
factors of enriching.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.470
I have a lot of slides,
and oh in the back,

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:25.790
I have supplementary
slides to get into this.

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:28.160
I'll just name these
five factors right now.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.050
The longer we
experience something,

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.840
the more it tends to get
encoded and consolidated.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.550
So duration, over
the course, let's

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:38.600
say of a breath or two or
longer, second, the intensity.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.400
That's another
factor of enriching.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.320
The more intensely
we feel something,

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.540
the more it's going to
tend to be internalized.

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.030
Third is what I
call multimodality.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:51.030
It's a funny word
for the more aspects

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.070
of the experience we're
aware of, the more

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.520
impact it's going to have.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.330
So I think of experiences
as having essentially five

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:58.170
aspects.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:00.272
The more of these that
we engage the better.

00:31:00.272 --> 00:31:01.980
There's the thought
track, which includes

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.670
imagery, the perception track,
particularly body sensations,

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.360
the emotion track of experience,
like a song has five tracks

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.410
to it, kind of.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.060
So there's the emotion track.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.820
Then there's the desire
track-- very important--

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.990
the intentions, the wants,
the values, the purposes,

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:22.950
the plans, the
longings in the heart.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:24.420
And then there's
the action track,

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.810
the sense of embodied
behavioral action,

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.810
including facial expressions
and subtleties of posture.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:34.140
The more of these that are
engaged, as any kindergarten

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.100
teacher knows, the more impact
experiences are going to have.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.680
So that's the third
factor of enriching.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.410
And the other two are novelty.

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:44.980
The brain is a novelty detector.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.670
With the news, it's always
looking for something new.

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.010
So if we engage our
experiences with what's

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:53.620
called beginner's mind, they're
more likely to have an impact.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:57.150
If we bring a
freshness, a child mind,

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:58.830
a sense of not
knowing to experience,

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.630
it's going to tend
to have more impact.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.490
And then last,
personal relevance.

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:04.990
Why would it matter
to me, for example,

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:08.430
to have an experience today of
feeling respected and included

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:13.160
by others, given my childhood
and my high school experiences

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.170
in which I felt like an odd
duck and I was cast out?

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:19.020
Why would it be
meaningful to me today

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:25.060
to really register that
my tricky conversations

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:29.050
with my partner go
better when I lean in

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:33.520
and sustain attention, rather
than space out and withdraw?

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.460
How can I help that
really land inside me?

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.990
Because it's
personally relevant.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:42.200
OK, five factors of
enriching, then absorbing.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.880
Let it sink in.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.280
Essence of absorbing
is to intend

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.490
to receive the experience,
to sense it's coming in,

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.210
and to focus on its value.

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:54.170
Because as we focus on what's
rewarding about an experience,

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:58.010
what's enjoyable about it
or personally meaningful,

00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:01.460
that increases activity of
dopamine and norepinephrine

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.990
in the brain, these fundamental
neurotransmitter systems.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:09.770
And as their activity increase
in proportion to or in relation

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:13.080
to the sense of reward,
as that happens,

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.890
the experiences we're
having are flagged

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:18.050
as keepers for protection
and long term storage.

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.390
We're more likely
to retain or to be

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.010
changed for the better
by those experiences that

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:24.300
feel rewarding.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.750
I think about so many times
I've been a therapist talking

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.690
with a client like who is
this sort of droning on,

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:31.130
and I'm droning on myself.

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:32.330
We're both bored.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:36.390
Yeah, your mother, your mother,
my mother, my mother, mothers,

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.680
my father, my brother, my this.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.630
Yeah.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:40.520
Yeah, really.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.220
There's no change that's
going to happen usually.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.410
There needs to be more
of a sense of reward.

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:48.200
OK, that's the fundamental
process of change.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.870
To use a metaphor of a fire,
we begin with the fire,

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:54.080
we have fire, usually because
it's already happening.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.850
We're already having
the experience,

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.920
or we might
deliberately create it.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.010
And then we protect the
fire by enriching it.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.100
We add logs to it, so
it burns more brightly.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.700
And then in absorb, we
take the warmth of the fire

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:08.969
into ourselves.

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:10.460
That's the fundamental process.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:14.870
The optional fourth step in the
change process I call linking.

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:17.420
Again, I didn't invent
the elements in these.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.690
I have invented this
framework, and its application,

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.580
and its grounding,
as I get to, in

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.739
evolutionary neuropsychology.

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:28.280
But in linking, as we have
familiar experiences with,

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.909
we're aware of two things at
once, positive and negative.

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:34.670
Mindful awareness,
spacious mindfulness

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:38.420
is a form of linking, if what
we're aware of is painful.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.610
Because we're aware
of what's painful,

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:43.040
let's say, while
at the same time

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.520
being rested in an untroubled
spaciousness of awareness,

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.630
which is itself never tainted
or disturbed or damaged

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:54.239
by what it represents, by
what passes through it.

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:56.900
We've also had other natural
experiences of linking where

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.480
we're mad about something,
and we talk ourselves

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.290
off the ledge, or we're
rattled in some way,

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:06.200
and we reach down for some kind
of memory are very supportive

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.980
relationship or a previous time
when we handled that challenge

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.200
to kind of give
ourselves perspective

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.140
and to soothe ourselves and
to reorient and encourage

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:15.820
ourselves.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.170
That's linking as well.

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.380
In really a quite
formal way, for example,

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.500
a person let's
say could be aware

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.980
of a beneficial experience in
the foreground of awareness

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:32.030
of being really seen and
wanted in a healthy way

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:36.260
and valued by another person,
while at the same time,

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:40.170
off to the side, having old
feelings of being dismissed

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.820
and left out and
overlooked and rejected.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.490
And because neurons that
fire together wire together,

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:49.190
if a person sustains
the positive experience

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.770
and keeps it big,
while the negative

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:54.470
is off to the side of
awareness, then the positive

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:57.290
will tend to associate
with it and soothe and ease

00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:59.200
and eventually even
replace it, sort

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.120
of like using flowers
to crowd out weeds

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.820
and then eventually uproot them.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.740
Linking is optional,
because it's not

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.830
inherently necessary for
the change process to occur

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:13.010
and also because sometimes that
negative material can really

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:14.750
suck you right in.

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:17.360
Don't underestimate the
power, et cetera, et cetera.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.220
It can really grab your away.

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.860
The key to linking is to
keep the positive bigger

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:25.790
so that it soothes and
eases the negative, rather

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:28.580
than the negative
contaminating the positive.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.590
The essence is really simple.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.360
Have it, enjoy it.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.920
The two stage process.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.320
Have the experience
and take it in.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.290
I like the word savoring,
which Rachel used.

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:42.410
But I tend to use
words beyond savoring,

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.680
because many of the experiences
we're trying to internalize,

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.900
much of what we're trying
to grow inside ourselves

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.940
isn't really
relevant to savoring.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.520
For example, we
have a clear idea.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.610
I had a really powerful
idea in my mid-twenties

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.670
that growing up I'd been
a nerd, but not a wimp.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:02.390
That was a very useful
idea for me to register.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:06.050
It wasn't that I would savor
it, but wow, do I really

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.870
want to help that one sink in.

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:11.120
Other examples are
where we're more

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.420
skillful with another person.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.930
We don't really savor the
sense of skillfulness.

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:18.050
We just want to really help it
land, kind of as a one trial

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:19.970
learner, as they
say in behaviorism.

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:23.360
So the next time it happens,
we move into that way

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.950
of being just naturally.

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:26.630
That said, I like
the word savoring,

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:29.360
but it's not applicable
to everything.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.990
But the fundamental process
is one of internalization.

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:35.610
So you want to try
something experiential?

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:36.920
That'll be good.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.790
Try to practice what
I'm preaching here.

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:40.490
So let's just try
it really fast.

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:42.760
We're going to do a
little, mini experiment.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.370
And then I'll move to
a wrap with two kind

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:47.620
of overarching perspectives.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:53.290
So most of the time that we
have the beneficial experience,

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.240
it's already occurring.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.810
We just need to notice it.

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:58.900
Think of all those
moments where we

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.870
have a sense of
accomplishment, getting

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:05.260
one thing done after another,
or a sense of friendliness

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:10.060
or camaraderie with others
or some kind of insight

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.760
into how to be in the future.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.670
We have the experience.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:16.870
We see the flower.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:20.420
We have a moment of ah,
that looks nice out there.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.180
But then we just
move on from it.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.520
We don't harvest
the value of it.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.922
So most of the time, we're
just noticing experiences

00:38:26.922 --> 00:38:27.880
that are already there.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.340
That said, there's
completely a place for self

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.930
activating states of mind.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:35.050
That's central to
coping, to functioning,

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.690
and central to spiritual
practice of well,

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.730
at the other end of the
spectrum, if you will,

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:41.450
if that's of interest to you.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:42.960
So to begin with, we'll just--

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.940
then I'll move it through,
and I'll say less.

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:49.945
Notice that as you exhale,
you are naturally relaxing.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.590
The parasympathetic
nervous system

00:38:54.590 --> 00:39:00.470
handles exhaling, naturally
slowing the heart and relaxing.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:04.090
And then as you foreground
into awareness, this experience

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.430
that's already happening in
the background of relaxing

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:09.280
while exhaling, you don't
need to change your breathing.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.890
Your breathing might naturally
change as your focus here.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:14.320
Then you can sink
in increasingly,

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.630
enriching and absorbing
this sense of relaxation.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:19.520
So be quiet for 30 seconds.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.858
Just do a little
internal experiment.

00:39:55.730 --> 00:40:00.680
You might have a sense
of encouraging relaxation

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.860
to establish itself more in
you as a kind of resting state.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.950
One bit at a time,
one synapse at a time,

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.330
growing trait relaxation.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.220
OK.

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.170
That was the first experiment.

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:22.760
Second one, gratitude, gladness.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.210
Here's where we're going
to create an experience.

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:28.330
If you like, bring to mind
one or more things you feel

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:31.730
glad about or grateful for.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:35.930
And help yourself
move from thoughts

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:39.010
of things you are
grateful for or glad about

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:43.730
to an increasingly embodied,
emotionally saturated

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:46.650
experience of gratitude.

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:50.370
And then as you settle
into a sense of gratitude,

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:52.440
kind of marinate in it.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.370
Let yourself really feel it.

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:58.160
Maybe bring a little
smile to your face.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.790
So I'll be quiet
here, too, as you

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:02.900
take in the good of gratitude.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.350
If your mind wanders,
that's completely natural.

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:45.620
Just bring it back.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.780
In effect, in meditative
language, for half a minute,

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:53.790
you'd be taking gratitude
as your object of attention.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:58.270
And as your mind rests
upon any particular thing,

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:02.380
that tends to be internalized.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.140
OK, finishing up here.

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.180
As with any practice,
we're doing two things.

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.550
We're trying to do
something inside our minds,

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:13.480
and we're observing the
results inside the laboratory.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:19.720
And if it's difficult to
activate an experience at will,

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.360
such as gratitude,
that's a bit of a flag

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:27.190
to look for opportunities
to build up that trait.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:31.720
And also, if there's any
difficulty sustaining attention

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:35.080
to a positive experience or
difficulty really receiving it

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:38.290
into yourself, that's a little
bit of a flag to yourself

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:40.620
for further investigation.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.960
And then the last
one, warm heartedness,

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.530
perhaps compassion,
perhaps kindness,

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:50.530
bringing to mind one or more
beings you care about, have

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:53.980
warm feelings for,
could be friends,

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.700
could be a pet, an
animal companion,

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.520
could be a group of
people you care about.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.670
And then as you do
this, help yourself

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:07.600
move from the idea
of this to feelings

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.821
of warmth, caring, even love.

00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:12.570
Here too, I'll be quiet
for half a minute.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.140
It's a real interesting
process to observe your mind

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:57.250
and see what is it like to
help something establish itself

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.540
more inside yourself.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.240
What's the process
of helping kindness

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:08.210
to establish itself more in
you or compassion for others?

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:10.270
What's that like?

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:14.320
It's a really interesting
and useful inquiry.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.280
OK, so finishing up
the little experiment.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.840
I'm on the homestretch now.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:24.850
I want to sort of step back
a bit and take a wider view

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:28.550
and then open it
up for discussion.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:32.080
So there are, I think,
four distinct kinds

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.810
of benefits for taking
in the good, which

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:38.410
is my informal general
term for the deliberate

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:41.704
internalization of
beneficial experiences,

00:44:41.704 --> 00:44:43.870
which is the technical
definition of what we've been

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:47.680
exploring here, or what could
be called mindful cultivation,

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:51.530
or others, you know, I use the
term positive neuroplasticity.

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:54.370
First, we grow specific
resources inside.

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:58.360
That's good, both in general
and for particular purposes,

00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.990
which I'll speak to in a moment.

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:01.780
Second, there are
implicit benefits

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:04.150
in this practice of
mindful cultivation.

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:06.580
For example, it's a
training in mindfulness,

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:09.310
and also, implicit
in it is a stance

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:11.980
of being for one's self,
treating one's self

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.010
as if one matters, which
is worthy in its own right,

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:18.190
and especially worthy if it's
a corrective to not feeling

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:20.910
like you've mattered enough
to others in the past.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:24.550
Third, it's quite plausible
that in this process

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:27.160
of internalization of
beneficial experiences,

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:31.270
we are sensitizing the brain to
positive beneficial experience,

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:34.300
much as the brain can be
very readily sensitized

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:35.890
to negative experiences.

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:39.100
There is emerging research
that quite possibly,

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.950
it can become increasingly
sensitized to positive ones,

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:44.260
so it becomes more
efficient and effective

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.140
at converting those experiences
into a lasting change

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.730
of neural structure
and function.

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:51.400
And then last, as we grow
the good inside ourselves,

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.830
the world tends to look
a little different.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:55.810
It sometimes can
treat us differently,

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:59.140
which gives us an opportunity to
grow more good inside ourselves

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:02.680
in a positive upward spiral,
or as Lao-Tzu, I think,

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.680
put it many, many
years ago, "If you

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.720
keep a green bough
in your heart,

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.820
a singing bird will come."

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.510
And now for a wider
perspective, I've

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:16.150
spoken here about
the general process

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:18.100
of self-directed
neuroplasticity,

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:21.220
self-directed brain change.

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.530
You can apply that
general process

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:27.550
to growing particular
resources inside yourself.

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:31.370
Resilience is used
to meet needs.

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:35.860
What are the needs that
resilience is relevant for,

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.420
and then how can we
identify and grow

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:42.040
resources and signs
that are matched

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.240
to the needs we might have?

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.210
If we run out of gas, a
spare tire won't help us.

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:47.950
It's not matched to the issue.

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:51.730
If we have a flat tire, now
that resource is matched to it.

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.210
So you might really
ask yourself,

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.660
I think one of the
most useful questions

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:59.050
from a long career in
clinical psychology, what,

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:01.630
if it were more present
in the mind of a person,

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:02.950
would really help?

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:05.170
Would help with this
workplace issue, would

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:07.510
help with some kind
of family problem,

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:10.510
would help just heal the
residues of the past,

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:13.050
or to feel happier all together?

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:16.630
What, if it were more present,
would really, really help?

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:20.110
I use, as a map for this, the
framework of the three needs

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:22.410
that have been identified
in a lot of research

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:26.000
as our fundamental needs
for safety, satisfaction,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.250
and connection.

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:29.990
There are other needs models.

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:32.770
I don't think everything that's
important to people fits neatly

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:33.870
into this framework.

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:36.040
But this is a really
fundamental framework.

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:39.760
And we manage safety by
avoiding, in general,

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.160
avoiding harms,
manage satisfaction

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.670
by approaching rewards, and
connection attaching to others.

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:49.510
You see the general
framework here.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:52.900
These three overarching
motivational and regulatory

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:56.590
systems, avoiding,
approaching, and attaching

00:47:56.590 --> 00:48:00.430
are loosely, but significantly
related to the three stage

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:02.540
evolution of the human brain.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:05.170
This is the so-called
triune brain model.

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:07.450
It's a little fuzzy
around the details,

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:10.070
but the essence is
pretty much there,

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:14.080
that as our ancestors
over 600 million years

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.810
evolved a nervous system,
rule one in the wild

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:18.430
is eat lunch today.

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:19.990
Don't be lunch today.

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:21.860
Live to see the sunrise.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:24.880
That's the reptilian brain
stem, very, very highly

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.440
focused on safety needs.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.910
Then we have the
mammalian sub cortex,

00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:32.320
very, very focused
on satisfaction.

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.440
Mammals can sustain pursuit.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.270
Reptiles generally can't.

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:39.460
Mammals can also hunt at night.

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.670
I'm very fond of our
scruffy mammalian rat-like,

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:46.420
squirrel-like ancestors evolving
about 200 million years ago

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:49.600
when dinosaurs ruled the earth,
but they were crafty and tough

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.660
and they survived
65 million years ago

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:55.570
when something big
smacked into the planet,

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:57.520
and the dinosaurs
became extinct.

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.520
And then on top of
all that, especially

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.410
as the brain has tripled in
volume in just the last couple

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:06.760
three million years, are
profound social capabilities

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.660
of primates and hominids
and humans for relationships

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.350
of various kinds.

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:14.980
So there's a loose relationship
between the management

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:18.090
of these needs and our
structure of our brain.

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:19.980
That's why I kind of
joke that routinely we

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:23.640
need to pet the lizard, feed
the mouse, and of course, hug

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.350
the monkey.

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:26.730
So OK.

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:29.970
There's a little chart here
of resources matched to needs.

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:32.340
You can go back and
take a look at it later.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.740
It just illustrates
the broader point.

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:37.860
Routinely, as a person who
works with other people,

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:39.660
I see that number
one, people come

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.930
in with challenges this high,
but resources this high.

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:46.320
They need to scale up
resources to match the problem.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.000
And second, they're
unclear, often,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.790
about what resources
would actually help.

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:52.920
And so identifying
resources that

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:56.580
would actually help particular
needs is really, really useful.

00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:00.120
And you can get into the detail
of that later if you like.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.030
So finishing up in
roughly the next minute,

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:06.330
I want to point to
a wider implication.

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:09.210
At the individual
level, as people

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.940
develop psychological
resources, they

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:15.300
are more able to sustain
resilient well-being

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.910
in the face of the
challenges of life.

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:20.700
The point of all
this, for me, is not

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:24.870
how to withdraw from the world,
sit on a cushion, go to a cave,

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:27.150
bliss out, and bliss out.

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:30.480
That's fairly easy and
straightforward to do.

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.250
The issue for me really is
how to engage life fully,

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:36.420
how to dream big dreams, how
to swing for the fences, how

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:40.470
to speak truth to power, how
to enjoy the pleasures of life

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:44.460
on the basis of an unshakable
core of well-being, a feeling

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:47.430
already safe enough inside,
already satisfied enough

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:51.190
inside, and already connected
enough inside, in other words,

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:54.510
with a kind of unshakable
core deep down of peace,

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:55.950
contentment, and love.

00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:58.470
That's the real challenge,
and therefore, to me,

00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:59.950
that's the real opportunity.

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:03.510
So this process of developing
resources, as I've described,

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:07.500
is absolutely key to growing
that increasingly unshakable

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.130
core.

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:11.940
But it has wider implications,
because without getting

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:15.360
into any particulars
of politics,

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:19.650
throughout human history, we've
seen how vulnerable humans are

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:25.650
to manipulations due to fear,
greed, and us against them

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:27.090
grievances and conflicts.

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:28.980
We've just seen
profound vulnerabilities

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.780
throughout history,
and I think we've

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:35.760
seen great vulnerabilities in
the modern news cycle today.

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:38.640
As people develop
internal resources,

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:41.610
in addition to changing
the world for the better,

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:45.360
but develop resources inside
themselves increasingly,

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:49.140
they become less vulnerable
to these classic manipulations

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:53.220
of fear, greed,
and us against them

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:56.430
rivalries, which has a
lot of wider implications.

00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:59.490
And I'm hopeful that the
process of internalization

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:01.380
and development
of inner resources

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:04.410
is a key part of helping
the world come to a softer

00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:06.990
landing than the one it's
aiming toward by the end

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:08.340
of the century.

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:11.070
To finish on my last
slide, if you'll

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:15.210
indulge me a quotation from an
ancient text, the Dhammapada.

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:17.520
It's a saying that I think
about many times that

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.900
really summarizes
this process, I think,

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.260
and why it's so helpful
and why it also speaks

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:24.360
to personal responsibility.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.880
"Think not lightly
of good saying,

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.860
'It will not come to me.'

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:32.260
Drop by drop is the
water pot filled.

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.240
Likewise, the wise
is one, gathering

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.870
it little by little
fills oneself with good."

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:41.780
So thank you very much
for this opportunity,

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:46.280
and I'm grateful to you for
what you do each day to help

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.994
this world be better.

00:52:47.994 --> 00:52:48.928
Thank you.

00:52:52.441 --> 00:52:53.190
RACHEL: Thank you.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.690
All right.

00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:55.600
We're going to open
up to questions.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.100
Is there-- we have
a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:57.740
We're going to put that up.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:58.930
But is there a question?

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:01.451
Actually, Ben, do
you want to do that?

00:53:01.451 --> 00:53:06.059
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:06.059 --> 00:53:06.850
AUDIENCE: Hi, Rick.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:09.030
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:11.160
I have to tell you that
I've been following you

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:15.960
for many years and truly,
truly, truly, this practice

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:21.660
has changed my life in many
positive ways, drop by drop.

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.970
My question to you,
and I've thought

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:26.940
about as I've read
your books, and I still

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:29.820
have like this internal
doubt within me

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.970
is, how do we
cultivate the positive

00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:36.960
and take in the good,
while still allowing space

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.980
for the negative, the
shadow side and the emotions

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:43.920
that we maybe we
don't want to feel,

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.810
so that this process
maybe doesn't become

00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:46.980
sort of a cover for that?

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:48.120
RICK HANSON: That's right.

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.824
That's great, and I'm glad for
you that it's been helpful.

00:53:50.824 --> 00:53:51.490
I'm really glad.

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:53.550
Yeah, well, you're getting
on a really, really important

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:54.210
question.

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:59.040
And to be super clear, nothing
that I'm talking about here

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.870
is about looking
on the bright side

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:02.490
or fake it till you make it.

00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:05.790
I want to see the whole reality
of life, the whole mosaic.

00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:07.560
I don't believe in
positive thinking,

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.030
but I want to see
the whole mosaic

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:12.180
with a brain that's designed
to overfocus on that one

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:13.850
flashing red tile.

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:14.550
All right.

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:21.920
So if we fight our negative
feelings, they just grow.

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:25.940
If we are to be able to
tolerate them and remain mindful

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:29.720
of them, we must grow
resources, like perspective,

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:33.110
steadiness of mind,
self-soothing, self-compassion.

00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:35.870
So resources we grow
inside ourselves

00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:41.070
help us accept and be
with and bear our pain,

00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:42.900
including the pain
that lands when we are

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.600
compassionate for other people.

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.090
So resources, growing
resources, in part,

00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:49.730
is a means to an end
of being able to be

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:53.180
authentic and inclusive
about everything we feel.

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:56.150
One of my great journeys as
I landed in adulthood numb

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:59.140
from the neck down was to
wake down, not just wake

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:01.190
up, to include my own interior.

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:04.160
But to do that, I needed
to grow resources,

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.170
because otherwise
opening to my experience

00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:08.780
was like opening a
trap door to hell.

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.010
[? So that part. ?]

00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:14.540
The other thing is that what
happens as we grow resources

00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:18.260
inside, in addition to be
able to bear our difficulties,

00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:20.510
ourselves, we become
much more able to deal

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:22.610
with the negative
things out in the world.

00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:26.610
We become more confident,
more courageous, spunky,

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:29.750
you know, feisty, keep going.

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:32.540
We're not going to be stopped,
because we have built up

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:33.320
strengths inside.

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.560
So to me, they really,
really work together.

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.400
And that's a key
question you're raising.

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.150
Absolutely key,
absolutely central.

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:40.740
Thank you.

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:43.340
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.610
AUDIENCE: How does one go
about teaching kids early

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:49.480
how to combat negativity
bias, taking in the good,

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.197
that you talked about
in your research?

three clearly defined

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:57.140
can incorporate into their

RICK HANSON: I
wish more questions

00:55:58.556 --> 00:56:02.360
came to me in this form,
clear, concise, direct.

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.110
It's really great.

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:05.109
Well, for one, I work
with a lot of kids.

00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:07.400
I have a background there,
and my dissertation actually

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.570
was on 15-month-olds.

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:11.510
So I have a real interest
in early childhood, too.

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:13.940
So I think the
question is really apt.

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:16.200
So three practical suggestions.

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.830
One is up to the
age of around 14,

00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:21.590
when kids no longer will
put up with their parents

00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:25.460
putting them to bed, that
period just before sleep

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:29.750
is a wonderful opportunity for
a couple, three minutes to rest

00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:33.710
attention on something wholesome
and beneficial for the child,

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:36.260
which could be as simple
as just feeling cozy

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:40.160
and cuddly with a caregiver
or happy about the dog that's

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:42.740
in the room, or talking
about some neat thing that

00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:44.150
happened in the day.

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:47.030
And then for those few
minutes, just sort of marinate

00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:48.330
in the experience.

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:50.840
I've known a number of
families in which they started

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.400
doing that with
their kids, and there

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.080
were fairly dramatic benefits.

00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.960
Part of it's
implicit, obviously,

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.400
keep sustaining a parent's
attention, let's say.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.340
But I think in particular,
there is some internalization.

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:02.390
That's one.

00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:06.830
Two, in formal settings, like
school teachers, educators,

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:09.050
or mindfulness
coaches, there are so

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:11.690
many opportunities that
are natural moments

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:14.720
to slow it down and
help it sink in.

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:18.050
When kids come back from
recess or after a period

00:57:18.050 --> 00:57:22.220
or before going home, use
those more formal opportunities

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:25.280
for internalization or
similar opportunities,

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.680
like at meals, in a
family where people just

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.950
take a moment with or without
any religious framework,

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:32.530
and just be grateful
for the food.

00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:33.530
Just think of something.

00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:35.360
Or just go around
the room, what's

00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:36.977
one good thing that
happened today,

00:57:36.977 --> 00:57:38.810
and it can be the same
good thing every day.

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:39.620
That's all right.

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:41.536
But what's one good thing
that happened today.

00:57:41.536 --> 00:57:43.680
People do different things
at formal opportunities.

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:46.490
And then the last is with this
particular child or really

00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:50.300
any child, ask that question,
what resources would really

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:53.210
help if they were more present
in the mind of the child,

00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:56.630
and know what is it we're
trying to develop in this child,

00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:59.870
not based on Mom or
Dad's infinite wisdom.

00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:02.900
I speak from some experience
here, some kind of lecture

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:05.090
coming at the kid,
that they blow off.

00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:07.160
But from the
child's perspective,

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.990
what would the
child be motivated

00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:11.480
to develop more inside
themselves, especially

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.120
social emotional
resources, and then

00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:16.670
if you know what
you're trying to grow,

00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:18.750
which is where the
issue is in most cases,

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:20.690
people don't know what
they're trying to grow.

00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:22.310
Know what you're trying to grow.

00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:24.740
If you know what you're trying
to develop and encourage

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.660
and nourish and
protect in that child,

00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:29.570
then look for opportunities
to have experiences of that,

00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:33.020
which then are internalized.

00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:33.530
OK, good.

00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:34.820
RACHEL: I know we're at time.

00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:36.020
RICK HANSON: Thank you.

00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:36.590
Thank you.

00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:37.470
RACHEL: Some of
you have to leave.

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:39.678
So I just want to give you
another round of applause,

00:58:39.678 --> 00:58:41.180
and we can stay
for more questions.

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:43.930
[APPLAUSE]
