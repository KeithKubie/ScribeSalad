true test of skill and that was actually

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:43.649
true test of skill and that was actually
 

00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:45.259
true test of skill and that was actually
a project I did when I was at the

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:45.269
a project I did when I was at the
 

00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:47.089
a project I did when I was at the
Baltimore Sun and goats of another

Tribune paper in Orlando and remember

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:50.279
Tribune paper in Orlando and remember
 

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.749
Tribune paper in Orlando and remember
the Orlando reporters sent a piece plant

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759
the Orlando reporters sent a piece plant
 

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:56.149
the Orlando reporters sent a piece plant
to to my reporter and the first thing he

00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:56.159
to to my reporter and the first thing he
 

00:07:56.159 --> 00:08:00.409
to to my reporter and the first thing he
says it won't work so that took a lot of

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:00.419
says it won't work so that took a lot of
 

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:02.779
says it won't work so that took a lot of
that that really took a lot of me to

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:02.789
that that really took a lot of me to
 

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:04.730
that that really took a lot of me to
kind of put that together in this case

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740
kind of put that together in this case
 

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.109
kind of put that together in this case
it was a lot easier because the

00:08:06.109 --> 00:08:06.119
it was a lot easier because the
 

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:08.719
it was a lot easier because the
reporters really were a team and they

00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:08.729
reporters really were a team and they
 

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:12.109
reporters really were a team and they
didn't act jealously and for me it was

00:08:12.109 --> 00:08:12.119
didn't act jealously and for me it was
 

00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:14.149
didn't act jealously and for me it was
more like a ringmaster just coordinating

00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:14.159
more like a ringmaster just coordinating
 

00:08:14.159 --> 00:08:16.399
more like a ringmaster just coordinating
what they were doing and focusing what

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:16.409
what they were doing and focusing what
 

00:08:16.409 --> 00:08:18.230
what they were doing and focusing what
they were doing that at a certain point

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240
they were doing that at a certain point
 

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.579
they were doing that at a certain point
people will do a lot of research and

00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:22.589
people will do a lot of research and
 

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:24.379
people will do a lot of research and
some of the reporters I had were such

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:24.389
some of the reporters I had were such
 

00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:27.009
some of the reporters I had were such
maniacs they would still be researching

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:27.019
maniacs they would still be researching
 

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:30.049
maniacs they would still be researching
but you have to say okay I see the shape

00:08:30.049 --> 00:08:30.059
but you have to say okay I see the shape
 

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:32.269
but you have to say okay I see the shape

let's not like Luke grant if you
 

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:41.089
let's not like Luke grant if you
remember that where Billy and Rossi

00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099
remember that where Billy and Rossi
 

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:43.159
remember that where Billy and Rossi
would for four weeks on the story and

would for four weeks on the story and
 

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:44.569
would for four weeks on the story and
then Luke grant would say well it's two

00:08:44.569 --> 00:08:44.579
then Luke grant would say well it's two
 

00:08:44.579 --> 00:08:46.579
then Luke grant would say well it's two
hours the deadline better get writing

00:08:46.579 --> 00:08:46.589
hours the deadline better get writing
 

00:08:46.589 --> 00:08:49.100
hours the deadline better get writing
well no I mean realistically this took

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:49.110
well no I mean realistically this took
 

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.920
well no I mean realistically this took
weeks to write but I had to say at a

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:51.930
weeks to write but I had to say at a
 

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.170
weeks to write but I had to say at a
certain point if this is going to be

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.180
certain point if this is going to be
 

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.730

basically I know as a beat reporter I'd
 

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.630
basically I know as a beat reporter I'd
never been part of investigation like

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640
never been part of investigation like
 

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.340
never been part of investigation like
this before but really it was kind of

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:11.350
this before but really it was kind of
 

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.260
this before but really it was kind of
like daunting like almost like building

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:13.270
like daunting like almost like building
 

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.510
like daunting like almost like building
a pyramid you know and I thought that

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:15.520
a pyramid you know and I thought that
 

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.650
a pyramid you know and I thought that
scared me the idea of building a pyramid

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:16.660
scared me the idea of building a pyramid
 

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.990
scared me the idea of building a pyramid
but building a piece of a pyramid day by

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.000
but building a piece of a pyramid day by
 

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.730
but building a piece of a pyramid day by
day and like going out and finding

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:20.740
day and like going out and finding
 

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.230
day and like going out and finding
something out coming in and telling Mike

so much so it's one of them say that
let's talk about the data that was

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.090
let's talk about the data that was
 

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.870
let's talk about the data that was
produced from this project it's amazing

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:33.880
produced from this project it's amazing
 

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.300

that information
 

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.430
that information
well we obtained the data in part it was

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440
well we obtained the data in part it was
 

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.560
well we obtained the data in part it was
a long struggle to get the data from the

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:46.570
a long struggle to get the data from the
 

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.640

didn't maintain it in a in a usable form
 

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.890
didn't maintain it in a in a usable form
so it took a lot of time to crunch the

00:09:58.890 --> 00:09:58.900
so it took a lot of time to crunch the
 

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.530
so it took a lot of time to crunch the
numbers and then you know we didn't

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:01.540
numbers and then you know we didn't
 

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.480
numbers and then you know we didn't
really believe the numbers once we got

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:03.490
really believe the numbers once we got
 

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.860
