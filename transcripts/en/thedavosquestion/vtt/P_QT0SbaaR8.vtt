00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.630
&gt;&gt; So I'm going to talk about the financial
crisis and banking.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.150
This is really not a recession.
It's a reset.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.990
And it's not so much an economic crisis as
a crisis of virtues and

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.480
values.
And one of the things that we've forgotten

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.550
about is the power of the
idea.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.659
And that's what America was based on, what
made America great.

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.939
It's what made every great nation great in
its time.

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.620
And so we moved from the power of the idea,
and using free enterprise

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.149
and capitalism to spread that idea and to
create value in society and

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.510
as a result of that you become wealthy and
powerful, maybe.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.780
To just be focused on being wealthy and powerful
and so we made the

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.510
by-product, the product.
We made money the product and that's why we

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.859
hit a wall, and that's why
I say it's a crisis of virtues and values.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.239
So I think the innovation that people are
not thinking about today is

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.600
really this global economic crisis as a reset,
an opportunity for us to

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.040
get it right again.
And in the 20th century the issue was democracy

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.260
all around the world.
And so you had movements for democracy, civil

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.420
rights, the hands of the
average person the right to vote, South Africa

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.320
and Nelson Mandela, the
Southern states in America with Dr. King and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.950
my hero and mentor
Ambassador Andrew Young, his aide.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.110
In India, you had of course Gandhi.
We still have the struggle for democracy with

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.420
the Palestinians, et
cetera, et cetera in the Middle East.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.780
But in the 21st century, you got to have in
this global economic crisis

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.450
the backdrop for the global economic crisis,
the reset, the new issue

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.090
is silver rights, not civil rights but silver
right.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.520
In this backdrop, if you don't have a bank
account, and you don't

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.390
understand the language of money, financial
literacy, you are an

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.360
economic slave.
And so we have got to make free enterprise

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.030
and capitalism work for the
poor.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.410
So I think financial literacy called the language
of money, Operation

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.520
Hope, is the new silver rights and civil rights
issue for the 21st

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.270
century.
Operation Hope is doing its part in the US,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.030
we've served 1,100,000
people giving them basic tools to help them

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.280
up and out of poverty.
Converting cash-checking customers into banking

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.940
customers, and turning
renters into homeowners, [INAUDIBLE] into

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.330
small business owners and
entrepreneurs.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.890
The guy who made this suit that I wear today
and shirt I wear today is

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.310
an Operation Hope success story.
He came in with $35,000 idea, wanted a loan,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.870
we gave my knowledge
instead, financial literacy knowledge helped

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.920
him get the loan as well
through banks vouching for his credibility.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.810
He's now doing $800,000 a year in revenues
as a entrepreneur, has six

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.210
full time employees at Strobe Clothing, South
Central LA, and he's

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.350
paying his taxes, and raises his children,
and is a responsible

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.640
citizen.
And has started a nonprofit to teach young

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.130
people how to be responsible
citizens called LEAP, so he's leaping forward,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.880
paying it forward.
And that's doing well and doing good.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.319
So the big answer here, the big idea is a
massive campaign on financial

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.069
literacy around this world banks can use this
to get their brand back,

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.819
to get their reputation back, their credibility
back, to use this to

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.040
empower people.
And if we do this right we'll create a new

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.010
generation, a new culture.
And I guess I'll finally say my friend Quincy

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.020
Jones has issued 20 years
of change in culture.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.430
In the last 20 years, we've made dumb sexy.
We've dumbed down and we celebrate it.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.820
If we do this right, we'll make smart sexy
again and we will never end

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.440
up in this place again.
