00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.200
So today we're going to be
making something which has

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.610
been called the Bernoulli
cups.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.430
Whether that's an appropriate
name or not is something that

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.580
I won't comment on.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.506
All we need for it are these two
polystyrene cups that I'm

00:00:19.506 --> 00:00:21.280
going to arrange end
to end somehow.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.630
And I'm just going to tape
them together around the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.000
middle, like so.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.350
A little bit more, maybe.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.890
Right, that should do the job,
apart from the couple of

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.060
elastic bands.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.200
These are probably not quite
long enough, but we can do

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.970
something about that.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.585
We'll just fold one through
the other and make a loop,

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:46.470
double-length elastic band.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.230
That's all we need.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.400
So let's go and find out what
this does, for which we'll

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.650
need a bit more room, I think.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.410
OK, we're in the gallery of
the lecture theatre, which

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.730
obviously is the best place for
launching flying objects,

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.720
which hopefully is what this
is about to become.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.940
Well, first of all, I have to
just wind the elastic band

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.278
around the middle, and hopefully
wind it on itself so

00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:10.800
it doesn't pop out.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.440
I wonder if I'm doing
it the right way.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.780
I can't really remember what's
the best way of doing it.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.800
And then I'll hold on
to that a bit, hold

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.570
it a bit like that.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.875
And, mm-hmm.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.290
Mmm, yeah, flying would be a
generous interpretation for

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.540
what just happened.

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:36.310
Oh, yeah, that's better.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.490
You sort of saw it loop up a bit
before it ran out of steam

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.820
and then kind of plummet.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.156
Well, luckily, I've got
plenty more, so we can

00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:48.406
have a few more goes.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.880
Ooh, a bit of a misfire.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.230
So what I think we saw there was
- well, first of all, the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.710
cups fell a lot more
slowly than you

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.350
might think they would.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.070
They drifted down
pretty slowly.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.860
But also, I don't know if you
saw at the start, when the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.200
cups were moving quite fast,
they sort of curved up a bit

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.620
before drifting back
down again.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.910
So there's obviously some
effect going on there.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.850
Now, aerodynamics is pretty
fiendish to explain.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.770
And getting two people to
agree on the best way of

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.530
explaining something, it's as
likely to end in a fist-fight

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.370
as not, I think.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.160
So I'm going to tread
quite carefully.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.530
But one of the things that I
think is going on here is

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.290
something called the
Magnus effect.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.290
And this applies to objects that
are spinning as they move

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.835
through the air.

00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:10.070
So it applies to footballs
when - this is what makes

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.110
footballs curve when
the players

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.550
apply spin to the ball.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.300
So with the cups, as they move,
they're sort of spinning

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.070
backwards like this.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.120
And you get sort of air
entrained around the cups,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.250
spinning with them.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.130
And that sort of creates a
higher air pressure area

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.870
underneath the cups, and sort
of lower pressure on top.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.595
And that supports some of the
weight of the cup, even all of

00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:33.710
the weight of the cup
at the start.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.740
And you get this sort of kicking
up like that, and then

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.930
just gradually slowly
drifting down.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.120
And then eventually the spin
runs out of oomph, and it just

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.370
falls on the ground.

00:03:45.955 --> 00:03:48.520
This is pretty easy to make,
so have a go yourself.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.110
See what you think.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.270
And see if you can come up with
a better explanation than

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.520
I have given.
