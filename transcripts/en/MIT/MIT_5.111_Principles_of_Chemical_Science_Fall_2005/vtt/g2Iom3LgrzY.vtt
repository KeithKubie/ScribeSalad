00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.012
All right.
We are first going to start

00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:18.464
talking about bond strengths.
You know that we have been

00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:27.000
drawing these energy interaction
curves as a function of r.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.513
And we have defined,
here, a bond association energy

00:00:32.513 --> 00:00:38.783
E sub d as that energy
difference from the bottom of

00:00:38.783 --> 00:00:42.783
this well to the separated atom
limit.

00:00:42.783 --> 00:00:47.540
And let me consider the
separated atom limit,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.486
now, to be a separated methyl
group and a hydrogen atom,

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:59.000
because I want to talk about
the CH bond.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.665
This is the bond association
energy for CH in methane.

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:10.865
But now, what we are going to
do is change our definition a

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:14.820
little bit.
Instead of talking about a

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.348
dissociated energy,
a bond energy,

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:22.837
we are going to talk about a
bond enthalpy.

00:01:22.837 --> 00:01:30.000
And I am going to represent the
bond enthalpy by delta H.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.862
It turns out that in the
laboratory we can more easily

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:37.981
measure a delta H,
a bond enthalpy,

00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:42.935
rather than a bond energy.
We can do so because most of

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:47.155
the experiments we do are at
constant pressure.

00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:52.110
When we do an experiment in the
lab that is at constant

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.504
pressure.
And the relationship between

00:01:55.504 --> 00:02:00.000
delta H and delta E is the
following.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.133
Delta H is equal to delta E
plus delta PV.

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:09.778
Now, where this relationship
comes from is a subject of a

00:02:09.778 --> 00:02:15.020
great discussion in 5.60,
in Chemical Thermodynamics.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.447
You will see that if you take
5.60.

00:02:18.447 --> 00:02:22.883
At the moment,
we are just going to take this

00:02:22.883 --> 00:02:27.278
as a given.
But I will tell you that,

00:02:27.278 --> 00:02:31.379
although delta H and delta E
differ for gases,

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.756
the difference is on the order
of 1% to 2% for gases between

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:40.767
delta H and delta E.
They are both an energy,

00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:44.321
but we are going to call it an
enthalpy.

00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:48.240
That is actually what we
measure, typically,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.615
in the laboratory.
For solids and for liquids the

00:02:52.615 --> 00:02:57.810
numbers are essentially the
same, but for gases there is a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.395
1% to 2% difference.
So if you are doing an exact

00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:08.442
calculation, you really do need
to know that number exactly,

00:03:08.442 --> 00:03:11.265
you need to get the bond
enthalpy.

00:03:11.265 --> 00:03:14.943
And, in fact,
if you go and you look up bond

00:03:14.943 --> 00:03:18.194
strengths they will,
for the most part,

00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:21.958
all be bond enthalpies and not
bond energies.

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:27.348
There is a more extensive table
of bond enthalpies than there is

00:03:27.348 --> 00:03:32.565
for bond energies.
So we are going to talking

00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:37.598
about delta H for a bond now.
And in thermodynamics,

00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:41.940
as again you will see in more
detail in 5.60,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.000
we always need a standard
state.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.342
We are always going to be,
for the most part,

00:03:49.342 --> 00:03:53.289
measuring things relative to
one another.

00:03:53.289 --> 00:04:00.000
And so we need a common ground,
we need a standard state.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.548
And what your book uses,
and what most people now use

00:04:06.548 --> 00:04:12.214
for a standard state,
is the pressure one bar.

00:04:12.214 --> 00:04:18.637
The standard state really
refers to the pressure and

00:04:18.637 --> 00:04:25.311
actually not the temperature.
One bar is equal to 10^5

00:04:25.311 --> 00:04:29.592
Pascals.
And a Pascal is a kilogram

00:04:29.592 --> 00:04:38.670
meter per second squared.
10^5 kilogram per meter second

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.275
squared.
And the relationship between

00:04:44.275 --> 00:04:51.904
bar and atmosphere is one
atmosphere, 1.01325 bar.

00:04:51.904 --> 00:04:58.131
An atmosphere is 1.01325 bar.
I am sorry?

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:02.887
Okay.
And so to represent this

00:05:02.887 --> 00:05:08.661
standard state here,
we are going to put a nought

00:05:08.661 --> 00:05:12.992
up here.
We are going to put a

00:05:12.992 --> 00:05:18.646
superscript up here.
This is going to be delta H

00:05:18.646 --> 00:05:24.902
nought.
That is going to represent our

00:05:24.902 --> 00:05:30.195
standard state.
This slide is what we will do

00:05:30.195 --> 00:05:32.000
now.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.160
On the first slide here,
what I have is bunch of bond

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.129
enthalpies.
And these are bond enthalpies

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.000
where all of them are for CH
bonds.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.275
The first one is for the CH
bond in methane.

00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:05.321
The second one for the CH bond
in ethane.

00:06:05.321 --> 00:06:08.901
The third for the CH bond in
CHF three.

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:12.710
And what you can see is that
they are all about 400

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.366
kilojoules per mole.
They are not all exactly the

00:06:16.366 --> 00:06:20.707
same, and they shouldn't be.
They are different molecules.

00:06:20.707 --> 00:06:24.744
The bond strength really does
depend on the individual

00:06:24.744 --> 00:06:26.724
molecule.
But they are all,

00:06:26.724 --> 00:06:30.000
roughly speaking,
the same.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.285
And so what is often done is to
take bond enthalpies,

00:06:34.285 --> 00:06:37.582
such as this,
and average those strengths

00:06:37.582 --> 00:06:41.456
over many different molecules
for the same bond,

00:06:41.456 --> 00:06:44.835
so that you have an average
bond enthalpy.

00:06:44.835 --> 00:06:49.532
And that is what you will see
plotted, or that is what you

00:06:49.532 --> 00:06:53.653
will see a graph of.
This is a table from your book

00:06:53.653 --> 00:06:57.032
that gives you the mean bond
enthalpy for,

00:06:57.032 --> 00:07:00.000
for example,
CH bonds.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.823
412 kilojoules.
It gives you the mean bond

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:07.739
enthalpy here for CC bonds.
348 kilojoules.

00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:11.655
Carbon-carbon double bonds.
612 kilojoules.

00:07:11.655 --> 00:07:17.250
And so those are the kinds of
tables that you will often see,

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.540
but remember these are average
bond enthalpies.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:26.948
They are going to give you that
bond enthalpy approximately

00:07:26.948 --> 00:07:31.155
correctly.
But not exactly correctly.

00:07:31.155 --> 00:07:35.466
And that is going to be
important, as we are going to

00:07:35.466 --> 00:07:39.694
see in just a moment.
Now, why in the world are bond

00:07:39.694 --> 00:07:44.419
enthalpies important to us?
Well, they are important to us

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:49.227
because they determine the
enthalpy of a chemical reaction.

00:07:49.227 --> 00:07:53.455
If the bond enthalpies in a
product of the reaction,

00:07:53.455 --> 00:07:57.601
if those bond enthalpies are
stronger than the bond

00:07:57.601 --> 00:08:03.384
enthalpies in the reactants.
Well, then the enthalpy of that

00:08:03.384 --> 00:08:05.846
reaction is going to be
negative.

00:08:05.846 --> 00:08:09.923
You are going to have an
exothermic chemical reaction.

00:08:09.923 --> 00:08:14.230
If the bond enthalpies in the
reactants are stronger than

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.307
those in the products,
well, then we are going to have

00:08:18.307 --> 00:08:22.538
an endothermic reaction.
So the relative bond enthalpies

00:08:22.538 --> 00:08:27.307
are going to determine the sign
of the enthalpy of the chemical

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:32.200
reaction.
So let's look at this reaction

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:38.173
here, a very important reaction.
This is the oxidation of

00:08:38.173 --> 00:08:41.693
glucose, very exothermic
reaction.

00:08:41.693 --> 00:08:47.986
Minus 2816 kilojoules per mole.
This reaction is going on in

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:54.279
every single cell of your body.
It is this reaction that you

00:08:54.279 --> 00:09:01.000
are using right now to maintain
your body temperature.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.271
To move your muscles.
To repair tissue.

00:09:05.271 --> 00:09:09.430
To think.
This oxidation of glucose is

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:13.813
important.
I mean, this is the reaction.

00:09:13.813 --> 00:09:20.445
And this is the reason why we
eat, this is the reason why we

00:09:20.445 --> 00:09:26.852
breathe, this is the reason why
we exhale, and this is the

00:09:26.852 --> 00:09:32.454
reason why we pee.
So what do we have to do to

00:09:32.454 --> 00:09:36.090
calculate the enthalpy for this
reaction?

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.545
Well, what we have got to do
here is take glucose,

00:09:40.545 --> 00:09:45.181
and that is the structure of a
glucose, blood sugar,

00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:49.454
and that of oxygen.
And we have to calculate how

00:09:49.454 --> 00:09:54.727
much energy it is going to
require, how much enthalpy it is

00:09:54.727 --> 00:10:00.090
going to require to break every
single one of these bonds in

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.953
glucose.
What we have to know is how

00:10:04.953 --> 00:10:10.093
much energy is required to break
seven CH bonds.

00:10:10.093 --> 00:10:16.984
We have to know how much energy
or enthalpy is required to break

00:10:16.984 --> 00:10:20.921
five OH bonds.
Here are our OH bonds.

00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:27.046
And how much enthalpy is
required to break five CO bonds.

00:10:27.046 --> 00:10:33.026
Here are CO bonds.
And to break five carbon-carbon

00:10:33.026 --> 00:10:36.151
bonds.
And to break one CO double

00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:38.397
bond.
And then, finally,

00:10:38.397 --> 00:10:43.865
we need the enthalpy to break
six molecular oxygen bonds.

00:10:43.865 --> 00:10:49.138
So we can calculate that.
We can calculate the enthalpy

00:10:49.138 --> 00:10:55.094
to break all of these bonds by
looking up the values from that

00:10:55.094 --> 00:11:01.105
table that I just showed you.
The table of average bond

00:11:01.105 --> 00:11:03.717
enthalpies.
And when we do that,

00:11:03.717 --> 00:11:08.013
we find it is a whopping 12,452
kilojoules per mole.

00:11:08.013 --> 00:11:12.983
That is what we are going to
need to take glucose and oxygen

00:11:12.983 --> 00:11:15.932
to the elements,
the atomic species.

00:11:15.932 --> 00:11:20.649
Well, then, likewise we know
that although we need to put

00:11:20.649 --> 00:11:25.956
that much energy in to break the
bonds, we are going to get some

00:11:25.956 --> 00:11:30.000
energy back when we make the
bonds.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.091
So now we need to know how much
energy enthalpy we are going to

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:41.887
get back when we make 12 CO
double bonds and when we make 12

00:11:41.887 --> 00:11:45.719
OH bonds.
Again, we can use our table of

00:11:45.719 --> 00:11:50.926
average bond enthalpies to
calculate that when we make

00:11:50.926 --> 00:11:56.526
those bonds we get 15,192
kilojoules of energy or enthalpy

00:11:56.526 --> 00:12:01.395
back.
And then the difference between

00:12:01.395 --> 00:12:07.639
this energy and that energy,
well, that is the enthalpy of

00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:10.487
that reaction,
minus 2,740.

00:12:10.487 --> 00:12:15.745
What did we do here?
Well, what we did to get the

00:12:15.745 --> 00:12:22.208
enthalpy for the reaction is we
took the bond enthalpies for

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:29.000
each bond of the reactants and
we summed them all up.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.723
And we took the bond enthalpies
for each bond of the products,

00:12:35.723 --> 00:12:40.793
and we summed them all up.
And then we took the

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:45.311
difference.
That's how we got this number,

00:12:45.311 --> 00:12:48.728
minus 2,740 kilojoules per
mole.

00:12:48.728 --> 00:12:54.239
But now what I want you to
notice here, and this is

00:12:54.239 --> 00:13:01.072
important, is that we calculated
these enthalpies by taking the

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:07.465
enthalpies of the bonds of the
reactants minus those of the

00:13:07.465 --> 00:13:12.374
products.
When we measure enthalpies for

00:13:12.374 --> 00:13:16.805
chemical reactions using bond
enthalpies, it is reactants

00:13:16.805 --> 00:13:20.287
minus products.
The reason I tell you this is

00:13:20.287 --> 00:13:24.719
because in a moment I am going
to show you another way to

00:13:24.719 --> 00:13:27.647
calculate the enthalpy for a
reaction.

00:13:27.647 --> 00:13:32.000
And that way will be products
minus reactants.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.730
You've got to keep this
straight, this is reactants

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:44.519
minus products.
But now, you see that I just

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:51.788
calculated a number for that
reaction enthalpy of minus

00:13:51.788 --> 00:13:56.769
2,740.
And the experimental value here

00:13:56.769 --> 00:14:03.022
was minus 2,816.
Some of you are looking at your

00:14:03.022 --> 00:14:06.337
notes like it is not in your
notes.

00:14:06.337 --> 00:14:09.456
Is that right?
It's in the notes,

00:14:09.456 --> 00:14:12.674
Okay.
Gee, this is what I told you

00:14:12.674 --> 00:14:17.158
was the experiment,
this is what we calculated.

00:14:17.158 --> 00:14:21.643
What happened here?
Well, remember that what we

00:14:21.643 --> 00:14:27.200
used to calculate this number
was average bond enthalpies.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.855
We didn't use the exact bond
enthalpies for every bond that

00:14:32.855 --> 00:14:36.994
we had.
And there is a difference.

00:14:36.994 --> 00:14:41.213
And so how can we calculate
this in a more accurate way?

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:44.894
I mean sometimes,
depending on what you're doing,

00:14:44.894 --> 00:14:48.269
it is okay to have the average
bond enthalpy.

00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:51.184
You are close enough.
It's good enough.

00:14:51.184 --> 00:14:54.022
But sometimes it isn't.
When it isn't,

00:14:54.022 --> 00:14:57.397
what can we do?
Is there a more accurate way?

00:14:57.397 --> 00:15:02.000
Well, you could have the exact
bond enthalpies.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.710
But the bottom line is that if
you had the exact enthalpies for

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:12.684
each bond, for each known
molecule, can you imagine the

00:15:12.684 --> 00:15:16.736
table of numbers that you would
have to have?

00:15:16.736 --> 00:15:20.421
In fact, such a table doesn't
even exist.

00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:25.578
I mean just for glucose alone,
we would need 23 different

00:15:25.578 --> 00:15:30.000
numbers, 23 different bond
enthalpies.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.122
That is a large amount of data
that we would need to do this

00:15:36.122 --> 00:15:39.443
exactly from the bond
enthalpies.

00:15:39.443 --> 00:15:41.000
I am sorry?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.979
Absolutely.
That is your job.

00:15:47.979 --> 00:15:51.444
That is why you are here,
to sit in class and say,

00:15:51.444 --> 00:15:55.050
gee, that's too hard,
let me think of another way to

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.666
do it.
That is what a MIT education is

00:15:57.666 --> 00:16:00.000
all about, OK?
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.639
I am serious.
You're laughing.

00:16:03.639 --> 00:16:10.040
But we do have a less
cumbersome way to handle this.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.558
And that is using heats of
formation.

00:16:14.558 --> 00:16:18.700
A heat of formation,
what is that?

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.595
Here it is.
I am going to define this as

00:16:23.595 --> 00:16:31.000
delta H nought sub f.
That's a heat of formation.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.100
It is an enthalpy.
It is the enthalpy of a

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:41.299
reaction that forms one mole of
a compound from the elements in

00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:45.700
their most stable form in the
standard state,

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.000
which is one bar of pressure
here.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.299
Let me explain that.
Here is a reaction that

00:16:53.299 --> 00:16:56.899
produces one mole.
That is important,

00:16:56.899 --> 00:17:01.515
one mole.
One mole of liquid water.

00:17:01.515 --> 00:17:07.250
The enthalpy for this reaction
is minus 285 kilojoules per

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.670
mole.
That enthalpy here is defined

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:16.606
as the heat of formation for
water, because the enthalpy for

00:17:16.606 --> 00:17:20.329
this reaction forms one mole of
water.

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:25.661
And it is forming one mole of
water from its elements,

00:17:25.661 --> 00:17:32.000
but the elements here are in
their most stable form.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.517
The most stable form of
hydrogen then makes up this

00:17:36.517 --> 00:17:42.208
water here, the most stable form
at one bar pressure and at room

00:17:42.208 --> 00:17:46.093
temperature.
And I forgot to tell you that I

00:17:46.093 --> 00:17:51.333
was going to talk about delta
H's at 298.15 degrees Kelvin.

00:17:51.333 --> 00:17:55.760
All of our delta H's will be
for that temperature.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:01.000
Delta H does depend a little
bit on temperature.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.272
But we are not going to do that
here.

00:18:04.272 --> 00:18:07.090
We are going to do that in
5.60.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:11.909
298.15 is the temperature at
which you are going to be

00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:15.000
dealing with all of your delta
H's.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.727
Anyway, H two,
that is the most stable form of

00:18:19.727 --> 00:18:22.454
hydrogen.
And then oxygen here.

00:18:22.454 --> 00:18:28.000
Well, that makes up one of the
elements in water.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.674
And so, the most stable form of
oxygen at this temperature and

00:18:33.674 --> 00:18:36.930
pressure is indeed molecular
oxygen.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:41.209
And so this equation satisfies
this definition,

00:18:41.209 --> 00:18:46.883
forming one mole of a compound
from the pure elements in their

00:18:46.883 --> 00:18:51.069
most stable form.
Let's look at this reaction.

00:18:51.069 --> 00:18:54.604
Here we are forming one mole of
oxygen.

00:18:54.604 --> 00:19:00.000
And we are forming it from one
mole of oxygen.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.056
The delta H for this reaction
is a whopping zero.

00:19:04.056 --> 00:19:09.126
However, this is the definition
for the enthalpy of formation

00:19:09.126 --> 00:19:12.676
for oxygen.
Because we are forming one mole

00:19:12.676 --> 00:19:17.661
of oxygen from its elements in
their most stable form at the

00:19:17.661 --> 00:19:21.464
standard state,
the most stable form of oxygen

00:19:21.464 --> 00:19:24.422
is oxygen.
So the heat of formation,

00:19:24.422 --> 00:19:30.000
the enthalpy of formation of
molecular oxygen is zero.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.694
Such is the case for the heat
of formation of hydrogen,

00:19:35.694 --> 00:19:38.330
H two,
or nitrogen,

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.967
N two,
or chlorine,

00:19:40.967 --> 00:19:46.450
Cl two gas.
The heat of formation of those

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:52.989
compounds are all equal to zero,
because they are in their most

00:19:52.989 --> 00:19:59.000
stable form at one bar pressure
and 298 Kelvin.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.607
What about this reaction?
Well, this reaction here is

00:20:03.607 --> 00:20:09.278
forming one mole of glucose from
glucose's elements in their most

00:20:09.278 --> 00:20:12.202
stable form.
Here is the hydrogen,

00:20:12.202 --> 00:20:15.569
molecular hydrogen,
here is the oxygen,

00:20:15.569 --> 00:20:19.734
molecular oxygen,
and here is the element carbon

00:20:19.734 --> 00:20:23.721
in its most stable form.
When you see this GR,

00:20:23.721 --> 00:20:30.428
that stands for graphite.
The most stable form of carbon

00:20:30.428 --> 00:20:37.057
is graphite at this standard
pressure and this temperature,

00:20:37.057 --> 00:20:41.857
298 Kelvin.
The enthalpy for this reaction,

00:20:41.857 --> 00:20:46.657
minus 1,260,
that is the heat of formation,

00:20:46.657 --> 00:20:51.228
or the enthalpy of formation
for glucose.

00:20:51.228 --> 00:20:56.599
Now, we looked at the
definition for the heat of

00:20:56.599 --> 00:21:01.823
formation.
How are we going to use the

00:21:01.823 --> 00:21:07.888
heat of formation to calculate
the enthalpy for a reaction?

00:21:07.888 --> 00:21:11.549
That is what we are going to do
now.

00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:15.941
Here are our reactants,
glucose and oxygen.

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:21.692
What we are going to do is use
the heats of formation to

00:21:21.692 --> 00:21:27.862
calculate how much energy we
need to produce the elements of

00:21:27.862 --> 00:21:33.172
glucose and oxygen.
The elements in their most

00:21:33.172 --> 00:21:37.184
stable form meaning graphite,
molecular hydrogen,

00:21:37.184 --> 00:21:39.608
molecular oxygen.
That energy,

00:21:39.608 --> 00:21:43.536
here, is minus the heat of
formation of glucose.

00:21:43.536 --> 00:21:47.631
Now I am taking this reaction
and going backwards.

00:21:47.631 --> 00:21:52.812
I am going from glucose to the
elements, so this is going to be

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:55.988
minus the heat of formation of
glucose.

00:21:55.988 --> 00:22:00.000
It is going to be 1,260
kilojoules.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.038
But then, what I am going to do
is form the products.

00:22:04.038 --> 00:22:08.699
I am going to take the elements
in their most stable form and

00:22:08.699 --> 00:22:11.650
put them together to form the
products.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.990
In this case,
I am going to form here six CO

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:19.106
two molecules.
I need the heat of formation of

00:22:19.106 --> 00:22:21.436
CO two.
Since this is per mole,

00:22:21.436 --> 00:22:24.932
we've got six moles of them,
it's minus 2,361.

00:22:24.932 --> 00:22:29.126
And then I am going to take
these elements and form the

00:22:29.126 --> 00:22:32.000
other product,
water.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.265
And there are six moles of
water.

00:22:35.265 --> 00:22:40.367
So I need the heat of formation
of water times six,

00:22:40.367 --> 00:22:46.081
minus 1,715 or something.
And then the difference between

00:22:46.081 --> 00:22:50.979
the sum of these two energies
and these energies,

00:22:50.979 --> 00:22:55.265
well, that is the enthalpy of
the reaction,

00:22:55.265 --> 00:22:58.326
minus 2,816.
That is a tabular,

00:22:58.326 --> 00:23:02.000
or energy diagram,
form.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.383
We can also write out the
equations.

00:23:05.383 --> 00:23:09.153
Let's do that.
Here is the reaction that

00:23:09.153 --> 00:23:14.759
defines the heat of formation of
glucose, except I wrote it

00:23:14.759 --> 00:23:18.433
backwards.
This is glucose going to its

00:23:18.433 --> 00:23:21.720
elements in their most stable
form.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.166
The enthalpy change for that
reaction is minus,

00:23:26.166 --> 00:23:31.000
now, the heat of formation of
glucose.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.066
Here is the reaction that
defines the heat of formation of

00:23:36.066 --> 00:23:39.888
CO two.
The enthalpy change for that

00:23:39.888 --> 00:23:44.599
reaction is six times the heat
of formation of CO two,

00:23:44.599 --> 00:23:49.666
because we've got a six here.
The heat of formation is for

00:23:49.666 --> 00:23:54.377
one mole, but now we've
multiplied this whole equation

00:23:54.377 --> 00:23:59.000
by six so we need to multiply
that by six.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.414
Then we've got an expression
here for the formation of six

00:24:03.414 --> 00:24:06.357
moles of water,
so the delta H for that

00:24:06.357 --> 00:24:10.384
reaction is six times the heat
of formation of water.

00:24:10.384 --> 00:24:13.095
Now we are going to add them
all up.

00:24:13.095 --> 00:24:16.348
We are going to add up the
reactions first.

00:24:16.348 --> 00:24:20.763
And what you can see is that
there is going to be a lot of

00:24:20.763 --> 00:24:23.706
cancellations if we did this
correctly.

00:24:23.706 --> 00:24:28.043
This six carbon atoms in the
form of graphite is going to

00:24:28.043 --> 00:24:33.000
cancel with this graphite on the
left-hand side.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.990
These six moles of H two
is going to cancel with these

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.982
six moles of H two.
These three moles of O two

00:24:39.982 --> 00:24:43.839
are going to cancel with
these three moles of O two.

00:24:43.839 --> 00:24:47.165
And then the six O two cancels
with this six O two.

00:24:47.165 --> 00:24:50.357
We add them all up,
and we have the reaction that

00:24:50.357 --> 00:24:53.216
we're looking for,
the oxidation of glucose.

00:24:53.216 --> 00:24:56.541
And then, of course,
we are going to have to add up

00:24:56.541 --> 00:25:00.000
the delta H's for all these
reactions.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.069
When we do so,
we get minus 2,816.

00:25:03.069 --> 00:25:07.255
That is the enthalpy change for
this reaction.

00:25:07.255 --> 00:25:11.906
What I just did here,
adding up these reactions and

00:25:11.906 --> 00:25:16.279
the corresponding delta H's for
these reactions,

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:21.488
well, this is an example of
Hess's Law, which I think you

00:25:21.488 --> 00:25:26.761
have seen before.
Which says that if you have two

00:25:26.761 --> 00:25:32.017
or more chemical equations that
are added up to give another

00:25:32.017 --> 00:25:35.848
chemical equation,
that is what we did here,

00:25:35.848 --> 00:25:41.104
you then also have to add up
the corresponding enthalpies to

00:25:41.104 --> 00:25:45.380
get the enthalpy change for the
overall reaction.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:50.547
Now, what did we actually do?
I showed you how to calculate

00:25:50.547 --> 00:25:55.893
the enthalpy for this reaction
both in kind of this graphical

00:25:55.893 --> 00:26:01.060
form and also kind of this
mathematical form where we wrote

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:06.464
out the equations.
But the essence of what we did

00:26:06.464 --> 00:26:09.668
is this.
What we did is we took the heat

00:26:09.668 --> 00:26:14.679
of formation of each one of the
products, multiplied it by the

00:26:14.679 --> 00:26:19.444
appropriate stoichiometric
number, and then summed over all

00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:24.127
of those heats of formation.
And then we took the heats of

00:26:24.127 --> 00:26:28.974
formation for each one of the
reactions and multiplied it by

00:26:28.974 --> 00:26:33.000
its appropriate stoichiometric
number.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.171
Summed over all of that and
subtracted the two to get the

00:26:38.171 --> 00:26:41.773
enthalpy for the reactions.
For glucose,

00:26:41.773 --> 00:26:45.006
we took one product,
CO two,

00:26:45.006 --> 00:26:49.439
multiplied that by six for the
heat of formation,

00:26:49.439 --> 00:26:54.334
added to the six times the heat
of formation of water,

00:26:54.334 --> 00:26:59.968
subtracted from that the heat
of formation of glucose and that

00:26:59.968 --> 00:27:04.264
of oxygen.
And that is our calculated

00:27:04.264 --> 00:27:07.312
value for the reaction.
And, indeed,

00:27:07.312 --> 00:27:12.189
that does agree with the
experimentally measured enthalpy

00:27:12.189 --> 00:27:15.063
for the oxidation of glucose.
Why?

00:27:15.063 --> 00:27:19.939
It agrees exactly because we
used the heats of formation.

00:27:19.939 --> 00:27:24.555
The heats of formation are
specific for the individual

00:27:24.555 --> 00:27:28.822
molecules that are participating
in that reaction.

00:27:28.822 --> 00:27:33.900
It is exact.
And having tables of heats of

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:39.799
formation-- The tables are much
less extensive than what you

00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:45.900
would need for the bond enthalpy
for every bond in every known

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.900
molecule.
And so these tables of heats of

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:53.700
formation are readily available
to you.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:28:00.000
And you can get exactly the
enthalpy for the reaction.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.951
But now, the second very
important point here is look at

00:28:04.951 --> 00:28:09.273
how we calculated the enthalpy
for this reaction.

00:28:09.273 --> 00:28:14.675
We took the heats of formation
of the products and subtracted

00:28:14.675 --> 00:28:18.816
them from the reactants.
In the case of getting

00:28:18.816 --> 00:28:23.318
enthalpies for chemical
reactions from the heats of

00:28:23.318 --> 00:28:28.000
formation, it is products minus
reactants.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.614
For bond enthalpies,
or for getting the enthalpy of

00:28:33.614 --> 00:28:40.463
reaction from bond enthalpies,
it is reactants minus products.

00:28:40.463 --> 00:28:46.526
You can be sure to see this
soon, like on November 2nd.

00:28:46.526 --> 00:28:53.038
It is something you want to
remember, something you want to

00:28:53.038 --> 00:28:55.621
know.
Questions on that?

00:28:55.621 --> 00:29:00.000
All right.
This is important.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.539
And I want to just make one
other brief point here about

00:29:05.539 --> 00:29:11.381
delta H's and many thermodynamic
quantities, but delta H in

00:29:11.381 --> 00:29:15.913
particular here.
And that is that delta H is a

00:29:15.913 --> 00:29:20.546
state function.
That means it is independent of

00:29:20.546 --> 00:29:22.258
path.
For example,

00:29:22.258 --> 00:29:28.000
here I have glucose decomposed
to the elements.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.970
Not in their most stable form,
but glucose decomposed to the

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:36.255
elements.
And then rearranged to form CO

00:29:36.255 --> 00:29:40.383
two and water.
The difference between this

00:29:40.383 --> 00:29:44.932
energy and this energy is the
enthalpy of the reaction.

00:29:44.932 --> 00:29:49.817
And we calculated the enthalpy
of the reaction in this way,

00:29:49.817 --> 00:29:52.850
if we had used exact bond
enthalpies.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:56.978
But we also calculated the
enthalpy using heats of

00:29:56.978 --> 00:30:01.378
formation.
Taking glucose to the elements

00:30:01.378 --> 00:30:05.263
in the most stable form and then
recombining them.

00:30:05.263 --> 00:30:08.672
Again, the energy difference is
minus 2,816.

00:30:08.672 --> 00:30:13.271
What this is an example of is
the function enthalpy being a

00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:16.759
state function.
It is independent of the path

00:30:16.759 --> 00:30:21.199
that we took to calculate it.
You can go up here and then

00:30:21.199 --> 00:30:25.005
come back down here.
You're going to get the same

00:30:25.005 --> 00:30:28.017
number.
As you go up here and come back

00:30:28.017 --> 00:30:33.875
down here.
That is what we mean by a state

00:30:33.875 --> 00:30:38.875
function.
Again, you will talk about that

00:30:38.875 --> 00:30:44.625
in more detail in 5.60.
Now, that takes care of

00:30:44.625 --> 00:30:51.375
enthalpies for the moment.
What I want to talk about is

00:30:51.375 --> 00:30:56.375
another concept,
and I want to talk about

00:30:56.375 --> 00:31:01.129
spontaneity.
Spontaneity or spontaneous

00:31:01.129 --> 00:31:05.717
change is certainly something
that you are familiar with.

00:31:05.717 --> 00:31:09.977
It occurs by itself without any
outside intervention.

00:31:09.977 --> 00:31:12.762
It has directionality.
For example,

00:31:12.762 --> 00:31:17.677
if you put a rock near the top
of the hill and you let it go,

00:31:17.677 --> 00:31:20.299
you know what is going to
happen.

00:31:20.299 --> 00:31:24.559
It is going to roll down.
It is not going to roll up.

00:31:24.559 --> 00:31:29.432
That's a spontaneous process.
If you have a gas,

00:31:29.432 --> 00:31:32.776
say, over here,
at high pressure and then a

00:31:32.776 --> 00:31:37.631
stop cock and a bulb here with a
vacuum, and you open the stop

00:31:37.631 --> 00:31:42.646
cock, you know that that gas is
going to flow from high pressure

00:31:42.646 --> 00:31:46.388
to low pressure.
It is not going to go the other

00:31:46.388 --> 00:31:49.094
way.
That is a spontaneous process.

00:31:49.094 --> 00:31:53.791
You know that if you put a hot
object next to a cold object,

00:31:53.791 --> 00:31:58.248
the heat is going to flow from
the hot object to the cold

00:31:58.248 --> 00:32:02.683
object.
It is not going to go the other

00:32:02.683 --> 00:32:05.280
way.
However, although a change

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.743
might be spontaneous,
it may not be fast.

00:32:08.743 --> 00:32:13.244
If you take a bottle of
ketchup, in the days when the

00:32:13.244 --> 00:32:18.438
bottle of ketchup was a glass
bottle and you couldn't squeeze

00:32:18.438 --> 00:32:23.200
it, and turned it upside down,
well, the ketchup has the

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:29.000
spontaneous tendency to come out
but it may not be fast.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.562
What we want to understand is
what is the key to spontaneity,

00:32:34.562 --> 00:32:37.900
in particular for chemical
reactions?

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.609
For example,
you know that iron rusts and

00:32:41.609 --> 00:32:46.801
you don't have to do anything
about it to make it happen.

00:32:46.801 --> 00:32:50.417
It rusts.
It turns out that iron rusting

00:32:50.417 --> 00:32:57.000
is a very exothermic reaction,
minus 824 kilojoules per mole.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.091
You know that if your stomach
is a little bit acidic,

00:33:02.091 --> 00:33:06.988
that as long as you ingest
something that is basic,

00:33:06.988 --> 00:33:10.513
that you can neutralize that
acidity.

00:33:10.513 --> 00:33:16.290
That is also a very exothermic
reaction, minus 56 kilojoules

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:20.207
per mole.
Another reaction that occurs in

00:33:20.207 --> 00:33:24.712
every cell of your body is this
transformation,

00:33:24.712 --> 00:33:30.000
or the reaction of adenosine
triphosphate.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.362
The hydrolyzation,
the reaction with water to

00:33:34.362 --> 00:33:39.121
adenosine diphosphate,
this also is an exothermic

00:33:39.121 --> 00:33:42.889
reaction.
You don't have to do anything

00:33:42.889 --> 00:33:45.070
to make it go.
It goes.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:48.739
The question is,
is delta H the key to

00:33:48.739 --> 00:33:52.308
spontaneity?
Well, let's look at this

00:33:52.308 --> 00:33:55.679
reaction.
This reaction is ammonium

00:33:55.679 --> 00:33:58.753
nitrate dissolving,
essentially,

00:33:58.753 --> 00:34:05.000
in water, to make ammonium ion
and nitrate ion.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.776
And the question is,
is this reaction spontaneous?

00:34:10.776 --> 00:34:17.613
This is a reaction that is
about 24-25 kilojoules per mole,

00:34:17.613 --> 00:34:22.329
endothermic.
Does an endothermic reaction

00:34:22.329 --> 00:34:28.223
happen spontaneously?
Well, to answer that question

00:34:28.223 --> 00:34:34.000
we are going to have to do an
experiment.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.843
And the experiment we are going
to do is one of these cold

00:34:38.843 --> 00:34:41.816
packs.
And we are going to carry out

00:34:41.816 --> 00:34:45.385
this reaction and see if it is
spontaneous.

00:34:45.385 --> 00:34:50.313
What you are going to do is,
and the TAs can give out a few

00:34:50.313 --> 00:34:54.307
of the cold packs,
take a cold pack and find the

00:34:54.307 --> 00:35:00.000
little packet inside this cold
pack that has water in it.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.472
You are going to squeeze it to
break that packet,

00:35:03.472 --> 00:35:07.161
and then you are going to see
if this reaction goes.

00:35:07.161 --> 00:35:10.561
If it goes, hey,
it is going to get cold because

00:35:10.561 --> 00:35:14.902
this is an endothermic reaction.
It is going to pull heat out

00:35:14.902 --> 00:35:17.000
from the environment.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.625
All right.
And some of you should have

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:33.889
gotten hot packs.
Is an endothermic reaction

00:35:33.889 --> 00:35:36.283
spontaneous?
Yes.

00:35:36.283 --> 00:35:41.818
Is an exothermic reaction
spontaneous?

00:35:41.818 --> 00:35:45.559
Yes.
Is delta H the key to

00:35:45.559 --> 00:35:49.000
spontaneity?
No.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.602
So it is not the key of
spontaneity.

00:36:18.602 --> 00:36:22.000
What is the key of spontaneity?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.960
What is the key to spontaneity?
Delta G.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:37.320
That is the key to spontaneity.
The Gibbs free energy.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:44.039
There it is in all its glory.
Delta G is equal to Delta H

00:36:44.039 --> 00:36:48.960
minus T delta S.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.920
What is delta S here?

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.760
Delta S is the change in
entropy.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:03.239
What is entropy?
Entropy is a measure of the

00:37:03.239 --> 00:37:09.480
disorder in a system.
If you have a positive delta S,

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:15.480
if the change in delta S,
if the sign of delta S is

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:22.079
positive, you are going to have
an increase in disorder,

00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:28.679
the systems for disorder.
If you have a negative delta S

00:37:28.679 --> 00:37:33.239
--
If the change in delta S is

00:37:33.239 --> 00:37:39.960
negative, you are going to have
a decrease in this order.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.679
That is going to affect delta
G.

00:37:43.679 --> 00:37:49.800
It is not just delta H.
But the change in delta S is

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:55.320
going to affect the spontaneity
for a reaction.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:03.000
The combination of delta S and
delta H is this delta G.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.345
And our conditions for
spontaneity are the following.

00:38:07.345 --> 00:38:12.024
If delta G is less than zero,
then you have a spontaneous

00:38:12.024 --> 00:38:14.948
reaction.
If delta G is greater than

00:38:14.948 --> 00:38:18.792
zero, then you have a
non-spontaneous reaction.

00:38:18.792 --> 00:38:23.053
And if delta G is zero,
then you are at equilibrium.

00:38:23.053 --> 00:38:26.396
These are the conditions for
spontaneity.

00:38:26.396 --> 00:38:30.741
These are the conditions under
conditions of constant

00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:36.496
temperature and pressure.
This is also important.

00:38:36.496 --> 00:38:42.356
We won't dwell on this.
And the actual origin for these

00:38:42.356 --> 00:38:48.000
conditions is something,
again, you are going to talk

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.511
about in exquisite detail in
5.60, but let me try to give you

00:38:54.511 --> 00:38:58.201
a feeling here for what delta G
is.

00:38:58.201 --> 00:39:02.000
And that is the following.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.942
The bottom line is this.
The reason why it is delta G

00:39:15.942 --> 00:39:22.571
and not delta H for spontaneity
is because when you have an

00:39:22.571 --> 00:39:26.228
exothermic reaction,
for example,

00:39:26.228 --> 00:39:33.099
that releases this delta H.
It turns out that not all of

00:39:33.099 --> 00:39:36.088
that enthalpy,
that delta H,

00:39:36.088 --> 00:39:41.955
not all of that delta H is
necessarily released to the

00:39:41.955 --> 00:39:48.487
outside world to do useful work.
When you have an exothermic

00:39:48.487 --> 00:39:54.686
reaction, it is not necessary
that all of that delta H is

00:39:54.686 --> 00:40:00.000
released to the outside to
useful work.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.672
Some of that delta H actually
gets stuck in the reaction,

00:40:06.672 --> 00:40:13.463
stuck in what I call the nooks
and crannies of the product

00:40:13.463 --> 00:40:18.229
molecules.
The amount of that energy that

00:40:18.229 --> 00:40:22.280
gets stuck is this T times delta
S.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:28.000
T times delta S has the units
of energy.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.791
What do I mean about some of
the enthalpies getting stuck in

00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:37.619
the nooks and crannies of the
molecules?

00:40:37.619 --> 00:40:42.233
Well, it turns out,
and we are unfortunately not

00:40:42.233 --> 00:40:47.926
going to have time for this
discussion, that molecules have

00:40:47.926 --> 00:40:51.950
a way to store energy in their
vibrations.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:55.386
Molecules vibrate.
These bonds move.

00:40:55.386 --> 00:41:00.000
Molecules jiggle.
Molecules rotate.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.046
That is a way in which
molecules can store energy.

00:41:05.046 --> 00:41:10.916
And it is that energy that is
not available to the outside

00:41:10.916 --> 00:41:16.272
system to do useful work.
And so the amount of energy

00:41:16.272 --> 00:41:22.451
that is actually available to do
useful work is delta S minus

00:41:22.451 --> 00:41:26.983
this T delta S,
the amount that gets stuck in

00:41:26.983 --> 00:41:34.129
the products of the reaction.
And so that's why delta G here

00:41:34.129 --> 00:41:39.762
is called the free energy,
because it is this amount of

00:41:39.762 --> 00:41:43.622
energy that is free to do useful
work.

00:41:43.622 --> 00:41:47.899
Delta H, that is not
necessarily all free.

00:41:47.899 --> 00:41:51.341
Delta G is free to do useful
work.

00:41:51.341 --> 00:41:55.514
For example,
let's look at this reaction.

00:41:55.514 --> 00:42:00.000
This is an oxidation of
methane.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.089
Methane is a major component of
natural gas.

00:42:04.089 --> 00:42:09.700
When you go home for dinner and
you turn on your natural gas

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:13.884
stove, this is the reaction that
is going on.

00:42:13.884 --> 00:42:18.734
You are burning methane.
A very exothermic reaction,

00:42:18.734 --> 00:42:24.536
minus 890 kilojoules per mole.
This is the energy that you are

00:42:24.536 --> 00:42:29.956
going to use to heat up the
water to boil the water so you

00:42:29.956 --> 00:42:35.810
can cook your pasta.
However, not all of this energy

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:39.980
is going to be available to heat
up that water.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:44.604
The amount that is going to be
available is delta G.

00:42:44.604 --> 00:42:47.777
First of all,
we have to know how to

00:42:47.777 --> 00:42:50.950
calculate delta S for this
reaction.

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:55.302
Well, I will show you how to do
that in a minute.

00:42:55.302 --> 00:43:00.288
But the bottom line for this
reaction is that delta S is

00:43:00.288 --> 00:43:06.000
minus 0.242 kilojoules per
degree Kelvin per mole.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.674
If I put that delta S into this
expression and calculate delta

00:43:11.674 --> 00:43:17.255
G, well, you can see I am going
to have a minus 890 plus some

00:43:17.255 --> 00:43:20.325
number.
That is going to give me a

00:43:20.325 --> 00:43:24.139
negative number,
and that negative number,

00:43:24.139 --> 00:43:30.000
that delta G is going to be
less negative than delta H.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.769
Not all of this enthalpy is
available to do useful work to

00:43:35.769 --> 00:43:40.730
heat up that water.
Some of that energy has gotten

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:46.297
stuck in these internal degrees
of freedom, effectively,

00:43:46.297 --> 00:43:50.650
of the product molecules.
On the other hand,

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.990
let's look at what your body
does.

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:58.546
It doesn't burn methane,
but it burns glucose,

00:43:58.546 --> 00:44:03.000
minus 2,816 kilojoules per
mole.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.464
If we go to calculate the
entropy for that reaction,

00:44:08.464 --> 00:44:15.107
that entropy is positive 0.233
kilojoules per degree Kelvin per

00:44:15.107 --> 00:44:18.321
mole.
Positive entropy means we

00:44:18.321 --> 00:44:24.642
increase the disorder when we go
from reactants to products.

00:44:24.642 --> 00:44:30.000
Let's calculate delta G for
this reaction.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.796
Delta G here is this delta H
minus, then a positive number.

00:44:36.796 --> 00:44:44.179
We are going to get for delta G
minus 2,885 kilojoules per mole.

00:44:44.179 --> 00:44:48.984
Look at this.
Delta G for this reaction is

00:44:48.984 --> 00:44:54.492
even more negative than delta H.
In other words,

00:44:54.492 --> 00:45:00.000
in this case we are going to
get out --

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.045
Your body gets out of the
oxidation of glucose all of the

00:45:05.045 --> 00:45:08.648
enthalpy to do useful work and
then some.

00:45:08.648 --> 00:45:12.252
Your body has figured out how
to do this.

00:45:12.252 --> 00:45:17.477
It gets even more energy out.
And it does so because it has

00:45:17.477 --> 00:45:22.162
gotten that energy from the
nooks and crannies of the

00:45:22.162 --> 00:45:26.576
reactant molecules,
the centrally internal motions

00:45:26.576 --> 00:45:32.379
of the reactant molecules.
There are more ways to store

00:45:32.379 --> 00:45:37.478
energy in the reactant molecules
than there is in the product

00:45:37.478 --> 00:45:42.747
molecules, and so delta G here
is even more negative than delta

00:45:42.747 --> 00:45:45.297
H.
You get all that delta H out

00:45:45.297 --> 00:45:50.056
and then you get even more
because you don't have as many

00:45:50.056 --> 00:45:54.560
ways to store energy in the
products as you did in the

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.045
reactants.
And so the energy has got to be

00:45:58.045 --> 00:46:02.549
conserved.
It is going to come out.

00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:07.435
And it comes out.
Delta G is more negative than

00:46:07.435 --> 00:46:10.728
delta H.
This works really well.

00:46:10.728 --> 00:46:15.827
Now here is entropy.
I told you we to know how to

00:46:15.827 --> 00:46:20.501
calculate that,
entropy change for a chemical

00:46:20.501 --> 00:46:24.644
reaction.
If you want to calculate that,

00:46:24.644 --> 00:46:31.561
you need to do so in this way.
The entropy for a reaction is

00:46:31.561 --> 00:46:37.213
the sum of the entropies for all
of the products of the reaction,

00:46:37.213 --> 00:46:42.512
but you have to multiply it by
the appropriate stoichiometric

00:46:42.512 --> 00:46:46.840
number, because these entropies
here are per mole,

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:51.521
minus the sum of the entropies
of all of the reactants

00:46:51.521 --> 00:46:55.054
multiplied by this
stoichiometric number.

00:46:55.054 --> 00:47:00.000
These entropies are actually
absolute values.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.925
That not too often happens in
thermodynamics,

00:47:03.925 --> 00:47:08.474
having an absolute value.
These are absolute values.

00:47:08.474 --> 00:47:12.667
They are not deltas.
Those absolute values are a

00:47:12.667 --> 00:47:16.325
result of the third law of
thermodynamics,

00:47:16.325 --> 00:47:20.250
again, discussed in exquisite
detail in 5.60.

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:21.250
See you Monday.
