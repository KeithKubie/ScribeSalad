Mark Wood: Cloud Sherpas is one of Google's
most successful Google Apps resellers.

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:10.542
We resell Google Apps
and other Google products.

00:00:10.542 --> 00:00:13.500
We migrate customers to Google Apps.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.000
We provide custom app development
services and we build products

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.333
on top of Google infrastructure to help make
that transition as smooth as possible.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.667
We migrated hundreds
of thousands of customers

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:28.208
and our app has been the number one
admin app in the marketplace,

00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:30.000
well, since the marketplace launched.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.250
Sherpa Tools is the industry's
number one app in the admin space.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.667
We have tripled our revenue
year over year.

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:39.875
We're growing really, really fast.

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:45.125
And it's all part of being really, really
tightly integrated in the Google process.

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:48.208
We plug ourselves not just
into the Google technology,

00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:51.833
but into the Google partner side
of business as well.

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:55.917
And so what we do at Cloud Sherpas is
we come in with a very structured process

00:00:55.917 --> 00:00:57.250
that we've learned over the years, 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.042
how to help customers eat this
elephant in bite-sized chunks.

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:02.667
We start off with small deployments.

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:03.667
We get them up to speed.

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:07.292
We select some key customers,
some key internal users,

00:01:07.292 --> 00:01:10.542
who are gonna be champions
for the whole process.

00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:11.667
Get them excited about it.

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:12.417
Get them involved.

00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:13.167
Get them migrated.

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:17.000
Get them talking to their co-workers
about how awesome it's gonna be.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.958
And then that tends to help the whole
thing flow a little bit more easily.

00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:25.167
So it's a combination of
solid product from Google

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:28.167
and well-established process
from Cloud Sherpas.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:35.250
Some of the benefits people talk
about after having migrated

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.458
really relate to the productivity
improvements they see.

00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:41.917
The ability to collaborate,
to be able to share documents,

00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:44.292
to be able to reduce travel costs.

00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:45.125
Sites.

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:49.250
Sites is probably the most
underappreciated component

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.792
of Google Apps on the market today.

00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:56.375
You have each department able now to take
control of its own workflow and its own space,

00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:58.667
where they couldn't do it
before run from a software.

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:00.458
It's a huge, huge win across the board.

00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:03.750
We have case study after
case study of customers

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.000
not only being happy with the move to
Google Apps from an email perspective,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.875
but once they get there, they realize,

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:13.250
"Wow. These collaboration impacts
these sites, these docs,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.333
YouTube, the ability to deliver videos.

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:19.125
All of this stuff really has made a fundamental
difference to the way we do our business."

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:20.542
And it's been great.
