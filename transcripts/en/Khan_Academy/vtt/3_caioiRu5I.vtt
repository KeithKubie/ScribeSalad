00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.610
Let's see if we can write
1.501 as a percentage.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.030
Now we really just want
to write this quantity

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.050
as something over 100.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.880
So what we can do is
we can say that this

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.480
is the same thing
as 1.501 over 1.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.940
We haven't changed its value.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.504
And let's multiply
it times 100/100.

00:00:22.504 --> 00:00:24.920
When we do this product-- and
I haven't changed the value.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.770
This is just multiplying
something times 1.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.770
But when we do it, we're
going to change the way

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.895
that we're representing it.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:33.570
The denominator now is
going to be 1 times 100.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.000
So that's pretty
straightforward.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.980
That's just going to be 100.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.740
And then the
numerator, we're going

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.730
to want to multiply
1.501 times 100.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.460
And so if we multiply
this times 10,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.250
we would move the
decimal one over.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.750
We want to multiply
it by 100, so we

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.600
want to multiply by 10 again.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.970
So we're going to move the
decimal over to the right

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.470
twice.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.000
We're multiplying
it by 10 twice,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.907
or you're multiplying it by 100.

00:00:57.907 --> 00:00:58.990
This is multiplying by 10.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.310
This is multiplying by 100.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.310
So this is where the
decimal's going to sit now.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.060
So we're going to get 150.1.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.340
And so we've rewritten the
1.501 as 150.1 over 100,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.731
or 150.1 per 100.

00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:15.480
Let me write that.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.530
150.1 per 100, which
is the same thing

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:32.980
as 150.1 per cent, which is
the same thing as 150.1%.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.687
And we're done.

00:01:33.687 --> 00:01:35.770
And, essentially, all
you're doing-- if you really

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.740
want to simplify the process--
we're multiplying this

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.380
by 100 to get 150.1.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.575
And then we're saying,
that is the percentage.

00:01:43.575 --> 00:01:45.950
So you want to make sure that
you write the percent there

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.150
or the percent symbol.
