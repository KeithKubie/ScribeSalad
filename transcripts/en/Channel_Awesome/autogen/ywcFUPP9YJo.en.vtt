00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:39.190 align:start position:0%
really distracting that's what makes it
 

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
really distracting that's what makes it
feel<00:17:39.340><c> like</c><00:17:39.520><c> areas</c><00:17:39.790><c> like</c><00:17:39.909><c> it's</c><00:17:40.090><c> future</c><00:17:40.390><c> around</c>

the<00:17:40.659><c> light</c><00:17:40.840><c> and</c>

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:41.830 align:start position:0%
the light and
 

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
the light and
man<00:17:42.160><c> if</c><00:17:42.310><c> I</c><00:17:42.430><c> change</c><00:17:42.700><c> the</c><00:17:42.910><c> voices</c><00:17:43.480><c> it's</c><00:17:44.290><c> not</c><00:17:44.590><c> as</c>

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:44.770 align:start position:0%
man if I change the voices it's not as
 

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.430 align:start position:0%
man if I change the voices it's not as
bad<00:17:45.010><c> and</c><00:17:45.460><c> then</c><00:17:46.180><c> obviously</c><00:17:46.510><c> the</c><00:17:46.840><c> animation</c>

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
bad and then obviously the animation
 

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.530 align:start position:0%
bad and then obviously the animation
style<00:17:47.740><c> kind</c><00:17:48.160><c> of</c><00:17:48.250><c> is</c><00:17:48.400><c> but</c><00:17:48.700><c> I'm</c><00:17:48.910><c> just</c><00:17:48.940><c> like</c><00:17:49.180><c> a</c><00:17:49.360><c> lot</c>

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:49.540 align:start position:0%
style kind of is but I'm just like a lot
 

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.910 align:start position:0%
style kind of is but I'm just like a lot
of<00:17:49.690><c> it</c><00:17:49.780><c> to</c><00:17:49.870><c> me</c><00:17:49.990><c> is</c><00:17:50.050><c> just</c><00:17:50.200><c> the</c><00:17:50.320><c> voice</c><00:17:50.590><c> work</c>

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
of it to me is just the voice work
 

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
of it to me is just the voice work
sounds<00:17:51.280><c> so</c><00:17:51.610><c> familiar</c><00:17:52.600><c> if</c><00:17:53.320><c> you've</c><00:17:53.500><c> seen</c><00:17:53.770><c> the</c>

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:53.950 align:start position:0%
sounds so familiar if you've seen the
 

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.770 align:start position:0%
sounds so familiar if you've seen the
future<00:17:54.100><c> I</c><00:17:54.250><c> think</c><00:17:54.280><c> that's</c><00:17:54.610><c> why</c><00:17:54.820><c> like</c><00:17:55.360><c> the</c>

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:55.780 align:start position:0%
future I think that's why like the
 

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
future I think that's why like the
character<00:17:56.290><c> probably</c><00:17:56.560><c> gets</c><00:17:56.680><c> the</c><00:17:56.800><c> most</c><00:17:56.980><c> laughs</c>

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:57.250 align:start position:0%
character probably gets the most laughs
 

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
character probably gets the most laughs
is<00:17:57.520><c> the</c><00:17:57.820><c> Lucy</c><00:17:58.210><c> it</c><00:17:58.540><c> character</c><00:17:59.140><c> because</c><00:17:59.470><c> there's</c>

00:17:59.760 --> 00:17:59.770 align:start position:0%
is the Lucy it character because there's
 

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.070 align:start position:0%
is the Lucy it character because there's
nothing<00:18:00.010><c> like</c><00:18:00.430><c> that</c><00:18:00.790><c> on</c><00:18:01.060><c> that</c><00:18:01.090><c> yeah</c><00:18:01.360><c> that's</c>

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
nothing like that on that yeah that's
 

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
nothing like that on that yeah that's
just<00:18:02.470><c> in</c><00:18:02.590><c> the</c><00:18:02.680><c> theory</c><00:18:03.640><c> there</c><00:18:03.910><c> actually</c><00:18:04.330><c> is</c><00:18:04.450><c> and</c>

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:04.690 align:start position:0%
just in the theory there actually is and
 

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
just in the theory there actually is and
this<00:18:04.780><c> is</c><00:18:04.840><c> where</c><00:18:05.110><c> I</c><00:18:05.170><c> think</c><00:18:05.410><c> the</c><00:18:05.650><c> voice</c><00:18:05.800><c> acting</c>

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:06.250 align:start position:0%
this is where I think the voice acting
 

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.210 align:start position:0%
this is where I think the voice acting
is<00:18:06.370><c> detrimental</c><00:18:07.170><c> like</c><00:18:08.170><c> I</c><00:18:08.320><c> go</c><00:18:08.500><c> well</c><00:18:08.860><c> the</c><00:18:09.010><c> king</c>

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:09.220 align:start position:0%
is detrimental like I go well the king
 

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
is detrimental like I go well the king
it's<00:18:09.400><c> bender</c><00:18:09.970><c> and</c><00:18:10.240><c> yet</c><00:18:10.990><c> really</c><00:18:11.440><c> the</c><00:18:11.620><c> true</c>

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:11.950 align:start position:0%
it's bender and yet really the true
 

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.950 align:start position:0%
it's bender and yet really the true

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
bender character is Lucy he's actually
 

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.560 align:start position:0%

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.890 align:start position:0%

think<00:18:18.670><c> about</c><00:18:18.850><c> it</c><00:18:19.120><c> till</c><00:18:19.270><c> like</c><00:18:19.390><c> halfway</c><00:18:19.660><c> through</c>

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:19.900 align:start position:0%
think about it till like halfway through
 

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
think about it till like halfway through
I<00:18:19.930><c> was</c><00:18:20.020><c> like</c><00:18:20.110><c> I</c><00:18:20.260><c> I</c><00:18:20.560><c> guess</c><00:18:20.920><c> he</c><00:18:21.070><c> is</c><00:18:21.160><c> like</c><00:18:21.310><c> an</c>

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:21.430 align:start position:0%
I was like I I guess he is like an

I was like I I guess he is like an
enabling<00:18:21.940><c> smoking</c><00:18:22.390><c> drinking</c><00:18:22.540><c> like</c><00:18:22.750><c> he's</c>

enabling smoking drinking like he's
 

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.570 align:start position:0%
enabling smoking drinking like he's
really<00:18:23.320><c> probably</c><00:18:23.560><c> more</c><00:18:23.920><c> the</c><00:18:24.070><c> bender</c><00:18:24.340><c> all</c><00:18:24.490><c> the</c>

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:24.580 align:start position:0%
really probably more the bender all the
 

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.730 align:start position:0%
really probably more the bender all the
kings<00:18:24.760><c> just</c><00:18:25.060><c> you</c><00:18:25.180><c> know</c><00:18:25.300><c> a</c><00:18:25.570><c> slob</c><00:18:26.200><c> or</c><00:18:26.470><c> whatever</c>

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:26.740 align:start position:0%
kings just you know a slob or whatever
 

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.430 align:start position:0%
kings just you know a slob or whatever
but<00:18:26.920><c> it</c><00:18:27.190><c> so</c><00:18:28.090><c> yeah</c><00:18:28.210><c> I</c><00:18:28.240><c> think</c><00:18:28.630><c> that's</c><00:18:28.960><c> a</c><00:18:29.140><c> problem</c>

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
but it so yeah I think that's a problem
 

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.650 align:start position:0%
but it so yeah I think that's a problem
that<00:18:29.470><c> it</c><00:18:30.430><c> can't</c><00:18:30.700><c> be</c><00:18:30.820><c> fixed</c><00:18:31.090><c> now</c><00:18:31.300><c> you're</c><00:18:31.540><c> just</c>

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:31.660 align:start position:0%
that it can't be fixed now you're just
 

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
that it can't be fixed now you're just

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:32.950 align:start position:0%
gonna have to come up with writing well
 

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
gonna have to come up with writing well
good<00:18:33.220><c> but</c><00:18:33.550><c> there's</c><00:18:34.090><c> a</c><00:18:34.180><c> tough</c><00:18:34.470><c> spot</c><00:18:35.470><c> there</c><00:18:35.680><c> into</c>

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.010 align:start position:0%
good but there's a tough spot there into
 

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.010 align:start position:0%
