1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,220
I like in the upper right hand corner,

2
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:07,221
Maggot hat boy refuses to apologize
and infuriating interview.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,190
That kid looked drugged and coached
like he was just probably both. Yeah,

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,740
it probably put them on some PROZAC.
Yeah, get out there. A little fella.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,470
Apparently that native
American guy though,

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,380
they did an interview with him and it
was a disaster because he said a bunch of

7
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:21,450
things that just absolutely weren't true.

8
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:24,810
And they're questioning whether
or not he actually was in Vietnam.

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,090
He definitely didn't serve in Vietnam,
but he wasn't in combat. Right.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,940
But you know, he had some,
some conflicting stories.

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,480
Yeah. None of these people were
prepared for this kind of attention.

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,630
It's like I was offended as as hell by
those kids and I'm a fucking big old

13
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:46,480
bleeding heart lefty for sure. And
I hate those, those fucking hats.

14
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:49,360
But like I in the state at the same time,

15
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,130
every teenage boys a fucking idiot.
Everyone, you know and like it's,

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,100
but those boys were standing there
doing their schools chance while these,

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,700
there's a long video and the video is
two hours long. I haven't watched it,

18
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,310
but I've watched segments of
it and in the segments of it,

19
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:08,780
you see those native American guys walk
up to those boys and chants with their

20
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:10,920
drums. So they're all there
for different reasons. Yeah.

21
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,400
So the boys were there
for the march for life,

22
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:18,070
which is a pro life march right there
from a Catholic school and they were

23
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:21,470
wearing their stupid red hats and then
the native American guy was there for for

24
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:24,550
a different reason. Yeah.
Well there are, there are a
couple, there was, there was a,

25
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,650
it was a native American celebration.

26
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:30,190
That's their yearly and you'd think
they'd coordinate these things.

27
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,720
There's all these different,

28
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,310
so a sort of marches going on and
that's all that's our right as citizens,

29
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:39,910
but it's just that they were all
in the Lincoln memorial together.

30
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,380
Well not only that, these boys
did not have like a good chaperon,

31
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:46,660
like boys were wild.
They yelled,

32
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,190
they said something like it's
not rape if you enjoy it. Yeah.

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,720
One kid yelled at again, by
the way, there's 40 kids want,

34
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,950
if you have one asshole kid doesn't mean
everybody should be beat up because one

35
00:01:56,951 --> 00:02:00,610
of your stupid fucking classmates has
something really dumb because he thinks

36
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:02,170
he's funny.
Was 15,

37
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:06,500
I sat in an in an assembly once where
a friend of mine was in like, uh,

38
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,480
in Chicago to frame.

39
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,440
I was doing a play and they were doing
like a scene from the play on stage and a

40
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:14,260
woman would come on stage and they
would, these kids, these boys,

41
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:17,680
I'm behind him and they're saying
the worst shit I can imagine.

42
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,380
And it was just like Jesus Christ.
And if that,

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,140
it's that it's the race to the bottom,

44
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:27,970
like boys who can say the worst thing
I can, I can, I can yell the n word.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,050
You know, it's staying where it shows your
tits. Yeah. Just trying to make a model.

46
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,930
And it's because, what's the
worst thing? Rape. Right.

47
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:38,950
So this kid's gonna yell something
about, right. It's, and it's, it's, uh,

48
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,330
I their children. Yeah. Yeah. I do
feel they need better supervision,

49
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,490
but here's the thing they do for sure,

50
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:50,050
but they shouldn't be judged publicly
on a global scale like this shop fair.

51
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,940
Yeah. I mean I, I disagree with uh,

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,810
pretty much everything them and
their parents stand for and stuff,

53
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:58,510
but it's their right to demonstrate,
you know what I mean?

54
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:03,511
So I mean they look did tear too young
to know what the fuck they're even

55
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,390
demonstrating a bounce to really
have a good argument about it.

56
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,300
Like to bring kids to a
pro live demonstration,

57
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:15,301
have them chat and yell their
schools songs and put on Maggie hats.

58
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,640
Like the whole thing is so fucked
up. It's really, well we're, I mean,

59
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,170
back to what I said about anxiety,

60
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:22,750
it's just where Eddie showed
there's fucking throats and like,

61
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:26,300
I mean I have a bit in my
act about how like, um, I,

62
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,950
I feel like the Internet was built for
us to tear each other apart because we're

63
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:31,960
just throwing darts and running away and,

64
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,790
and if you put us in a room together
and talk it out, we, I think we,

65
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,680
I think we would mano a Mano and
things like, you know, because we will,

66
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:42,370
the people, we all want the
same thing deep down inside.

67
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,380
We all want to take care of our kids.
We all want to have fun.

68
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:48,430
We all want an a bounty of a life, you
know? But I also say like, I'm also like,

69
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,940
I love people, but I fucking
hate people. Like it's like,

70
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:53,951
you know,

71
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,680
it's like if you go through a whole day
without speaking to another human being,

72
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:59,590
you ever had one of those days,
fuck, that was awesome. Isolation.

73
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,650
That was delicious. It's only if
you have too much though, right?

74
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:05,440
If you get get around people too much,
then those gap days where you just,

75
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,960
you could just recharge. Yeah. And then
you appreciate people when you see them.

76
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,130
Yeah. And do you get that where you,
where you go to, you're on the way,

77
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:14,620
the comedy store and you're
like, I want to fucking go. Like,

78
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,110
I don't want to go up right now. I'm
like, something's messing with me.

79
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,180
But it's like that with therapy,

80
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,630
comedy sometimes and the gym
sometimes where it's like,

81
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,810
I don't want to fucking go, but every
time I'm glad I did. You know what I mean?

82
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:26,710
Yeah.
I know what you're saying.

83
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,550
I could have a set where I eat shit and
I'll drive home laughing and I'm just

84
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:31,840
like, well, that didn't work.

85
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,660
The thing that bothers me most about
this is that they want the docs,

86
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:38,290
these kids and po address out
there in favor of that ever.

87
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,880
It's just so foolish ever.

88
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,570
They're treating them like they're
rational adults that are, you know,

89
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,960
fucking 50 years old that really
know what they're doing. No,

90
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:48,570
and it's not going to
solve anything. It's, no,

91
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:51,640
you're not going to convert these kids'
hearts and minds by ruining their lives.

92
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,510
You know?

93
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,690
I do understand the double standard we
have had with like black youth though,

94
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:57,490
where it's kind of like, uh, you know,

95
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,700
this kid gets strangled to death for
selling cigarettes and be like, Hey,

96
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:05,080
he's a criminal. It's like God damn it,
you know? Whereas these kids honestly,

97
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:07,060
cause they're wider getting
chance after chance after chance,

98
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,150
but I don't think they're last should
be ruined. It's like, I feel like we've,

99
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,230
we've, we've talked enough about it. These
kids did what they did. Let's move on.

100
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,230
Yeah. Well then you know, who knows what
they're getting chance after chance.

101
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:20,430
But during this situation,
like that's, this is,

102
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:22,390
this is the consequences of social media.

103
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:25,090
The fact that you could take a video
of someone doing something incredibly

104
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,860
stupid when they're 16 years old.
Yeah.

105
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,510
And what they did was
not even that stupid.

106
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:31,390
All he did to stand there and
smirk and people wanted him dead.

107
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,780
He was being a shithead.
But like I keep a YC,

108
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:37,420
if he's just standing there and
someone comes up to him beating a drum,

109
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,980
how are you supposed to react? I feel
like, how do you think you would rather,

110
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,750
I feel like the kid walked up to the
native Americans. Correct? Incorrect.

111
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,150
The kid was standing there,

112
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,220
the native American walked up to
him beating the drum. Okay. Walked.

113
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,100
Got Rid of the video.
That will, what happened?

114
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,370
What do you mean the guy was stabbed?

115
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:54,580
That kid wasn't in the video while the
native American gentleman was standing

116
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:56,710
there pounding as drumming.
There are kids around him,

117
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:59,810
but that kid that the main
kid wasn't there, he walked.

118
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:03,740
He ended up walking up to them.
Yeah. Okay. But the video that I saw,

119
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,780
the kid was standing there and that
guy walked up to him. Here's the thing.

120
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,200
This is two hours. There's the, the,

121
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,140
there's video of these people that's
two hours long and the video that I saw,

122
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,640
those kids were standing there chanting
and that guy walked to those kids and

123
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:24,560
was beating his drum.
If that one specific kid walked down,

124
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,910
but still that guy instigated it by
walking to them beating the drum.

125
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,650
Not only that that guy got in that kid's
face and beat that drum inches away

126
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:36,560
from his face, but I thought this
is also talking about that kid.

127
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,830
I thought that kid walked up to the,
to the native American. I'm not sure.

128
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:42,180
The native American guy walked
up to the whole group. Okay,

129
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,260
so you just take care of that.
Haven't seen all of that.

130
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,320
All of that video I saw American guy said
that they were saying build that wall,

131
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:51,650
build that wall. But there's no
evidence of that. Okay. The guy that,

132
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,610
the problem is the guy's a human native
American guys are human, right? Yeah.

133
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:59,800
And he's probably not prepared at
all for this kind of scrutiny. No.

134
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,720
And no one is,
there's a lot there.

135
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,800
There was an interview that he did with
CNN that is just full of holes. Okay.

136
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,370
And uh,
it doesn't match up to the video.

137
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:10,610
It doesn't match up to what happened
is like there's, this is all,

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,860
you could pull it, pull that
video, a pull that article,

139
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,730
but you try to find that
article, the CNN article. Um,

140
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,430
there was an article about the
article that I read. Either way. Yeah.

141
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:26,150
I'm just, I'm just inundated at this
point with all of it. I will say like,

142
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,100
you know, I've, I've said for
years, probably 15, 20 years now.

143
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,160
I'm so glad youtube did not exist
when I was in high school. Oh my God.

144
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,120
Cause you're just, you're just
a decent book. Yeah. Twitter,

145
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,050
the things that you would say on Twitter
or snapchat or any of those things.

146
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:46,460
Yeah. And I mean, I, I did
not grow up like, you know,

147
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:51,140
my parents generation being
mildly racist if you're white.

148
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,490
You know, I, I grew up, uh, pretty woke
as the kids say in Portland, Oregon.

149
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,130
So while you were in Chicago, Chicago's
pretty left wing will Chicago. I wasn't,

150
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,270
I wasn't there until I was born in
Chicago, but I grew up in Portland. Oh.

151
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,250
And then I was, yeah. But it was
also, it's funny, we had, uh,

152
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:07,700
we had,

153
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,500
we had right wing a Nazi groups
moving in when I was in high school,

154
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,570
uh, gangs from La and then from central
Oregon and further toward Idaho. You had,

155
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,740
you had a,
this,

156
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:23,210
this guy named Metzger who had like a
little little camp you cook on partying if

157
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,290
you've seen American history x.

158
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:27,200
It was just like that when you drink free
beer and they'd play punk rock music.

159
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:30,650
And the thing that everyone misses
when they look at those groups,

160
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:35,430
be it a gang or a white supremacist
skinhead group or whatever. It's,

161
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:35,870
it's,

162
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,620
it's a community first for people and
that's where they look at it first and

163
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:42,650
then they, they foreign community,
sadly over focusing hate.

164
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,940
But I just feel like kids back
here. Yeah. I mean, which kit?

165
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:53,300
So they're all, they walked up to
him being in there banging the drums.

166
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,210
That's the kid there and
standing there. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

167
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:59,460
There's a kid walking up to now,
but like you did right.

168
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:02,130
But he's just standing there.
The guy walked right up to him.

169
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:04,530
You're showing me in the video,
the guy walking up to the kid,

170
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,660
and this is exactly what I said, Jamie.
We walked right up to the kid here.

171
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,540
Was this the video?

172
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:14,310
I mean these kids all
mocking to traditional native
American music and rhythm,

173
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,144
but Jamie,

174
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,530
that native American guy just walked
up to that kid and got in his face.

175
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,200
It's clear as day.
I was just bringing up this like,

176
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:24,120
does this angle here he is standing here.

177
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:26,940
There's a group of kids around
them that kids might be managing.

178
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,110
This thing doesn't make any sense.

179
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:31,020
It's just the worst thing
for Philip to the kids.

180
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,310
He walked up to the kids and he walked
up to that kid specifically got in his

181
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:37,620
face. There was a certain amount
of separation between them.

182
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:41,640
He walked to the kid and got in his
face while he's beaten the drum. Okay,

183
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,450
play it again. I'm buying it right
now. He's, yeah, he's walking.

184
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,980
He's walking and the kid standing there
and when the kids 10 that he walks up to

185
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:54,480
the kid so, and they're
doing the Tomahawk Chop Chop.

186
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:58,230
They think it's funny. Like did they
understand that people are filming?

187
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,500
They don't.
So here he goes.

188
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,820
The whole thing is so strange.
So strange.

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,810
Because what are you supposed to do when
someone walks up to you beating a drum?

190
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:10,650
So there's the kid,

191
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:15,180
the kid standing there and the native
American guy now walks up to him

192
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,130
completely violating a space.

193
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,600
Now imagine if this is a man doing
this to a woman. You'd say, okay,

194
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:26,310
he's violating her space a 100% this is
fucked up and aggressive and that's what

195
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:29,550
this guy's doing. He's singing
this kid's face. It's a little kid.

196
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,510
And what is the kid supposed to do?
I don't know it. Should he walk away?

197
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,741
Should he say,

198
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:39,480
I'm sorry that someone in the
past stole your ancestors land?

199
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,290
What is he supposed to do? Yeah, I mean
I'm, no, I'm not saying yes, do that.

200
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,020
I'm saying what is the like the
question is what does your kid do?

201
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,140
But I mean these,
it's just he's,

202
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,350
I get why this guys approaching
because there's just a,

203
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,930
it's a river of people mocking
him and his culture. I get it.

204
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:56,730
But why this one kid and why?

205
00:10:56,731 --> 00:11:00,390
Why get right in this guy's face or you're
beating a drum inches from this kid's

206
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:04,320
face. Yeah. That is the question and
what? Look, it's the fucking hat, man.

207
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,380
That goddamn polarizing. Stupid
hat, hate that had so much.

208
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,850
Look at these given closer to him.

209
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,890
He's put the drum off to the side so he
can get closer to this kid's face music.

210
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:15,930
Expecting the kid to walk away.
I don't know,

211
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,720
but the kid doesn't do anything but silly.
He's blinking because the,

212
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,650
the beating of the drum
is so close to his eyes.

213
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,350
It's weird. Yeah. The
whole thing is very weird.

214
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:31,830
So weird staring that kid down.
I mean,

215
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,090
why wouldn't you walk away just
to define why we don't know.

216
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,910
Everyone else walked away. But what
does he have to, doesn't happen.

217
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,590
He's standing there and the
guy decides to get in his face.

218
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,650
I think you would walk away probably
because the camera locked up on me.

219
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:48,480
I would, I would definitely move.
I think I would probably move to,

220
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:50,970
cause I'd be scared if that
guy got my face like that.

221
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:54,250
I think that guy's going to hit me.
I would, something's gonna go wrong.

222
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,450
And I'm like, this is good. This is
just too weird. But it's not the kids.

223
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,700
He's 16 minutes.
Yeah.

224
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,880
I the grownups fault for getting in a
16 year old kid's face beating a drum.

225
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,630
Yeah. It's just at that
fucking hat, man. I mean,

226
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:09,930
what's also the, he, the,

227
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,390
the native American man rightly
felt like he was being mocked. Yeah.

228
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:18,450
And then his traditions and his heritage
is being mocked and these little kids.

229
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:21,670
Yeah. I mean, I don't think he had the
right to walk up on the kid like that,

230
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:24,190
but it's like where, where is your
breaking point? Well, wait a minute.

231
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,230
I don't think he doesn't have the right,

232
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,750
but this is where
confrontation comes from.

233
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:31,960
Do you have the right to
make confrontation? Yep.
Maybe. Perhaps May. Perhaps,

234
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,880
but that's not really the best way
to communicate. You're seeing a song,

235
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,150
a native American song,

236
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:40,000
and he doesn't know what the fuck you're
singing and you're doing it inches from

237
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,930
his face. Yeah. And everyone's felt,

238
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,240
it's a really a sign of the Times that
people took clips of that and they made

239
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:46,421
it out.

240
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:49,900
Like this little kids that comment and
even raise the Osl on head on is if you

241
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:52,660
ever seen him more punchable
face like, man, that's your,

242
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:55,990
you're calling for violence on a kid,
is that what you're doing? It's, it's,

243
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,580
it's the same, uh, you know,
level of, and again, you know,

244
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,130
as kids, like even when you
were pulling that clip up,

245
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:05,890
I could feel my stomach make a
fist and I'm like, oh, this just,

246
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,450
I don't want to see this.
But you know, uh, like it,

247
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,140
it's like that dude that,
that, that his, that,

248
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,360
that kid at the cub game
who had the game in his,

249
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,370
in his ear phones and he caught the ball,

250
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,920
which the outfielder was definitely
not going to catch anyway.

251
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:24,280
And they blamed him for the cubs lost of
the series and they had to escort that

252
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:28,390
kid out. And I thought the kid
reached forward though. He did. But I,

253
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,660
if you look at the tape, I don't
think that the outfielder had it now.

254
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,790
Outfitter was pointing
like you fucked up kid,

255
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,530
like you ruined it and
it was kind of this,

256
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,870
I understand when you're
playing major league ball,

257
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,110
one mistake could mean the end of your
career, your family's and what I saw.

258
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,110
I think that's different. When I saw that,
I thought that kid fucked up the game.

259
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,130
It, it could be argued, yes, you know
what I'm talking about. Absolutely. Yeah,

260
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:51,250
but that's like you're staying there
with blaming one tiny play on the entire

261
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:53,710
game and you can't do that.
And the fact,

262
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:56,410
the fact that back to what your
point of punched the kid in the face,

263
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,190
that kid had to be escorted out at
Wrigley field because people were going to

264
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,770
kill him,

265
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,730
but they were drunk people that we're
going to throw hit that kid into traffic.

266
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,730
Can we see that video of the
guy who can pull that up?

267
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,460
I think that kid actually
did fuck up that game.

268
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,360
I think the difference is that kid
reached into the playing field.

269
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:17,860
What he did was definitely wrong and
illegal and let's see, I had everything,

270
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:19,540
but yeah, let's check
it out. Tail the tape.

271
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,520
Steve Park. There's the ball. It's
going, it's going. It's going.

272
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,120
Wait a minute. Let me say it one
more time. Back that up. No, no, no,

273
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,670
but just bag it up so slow.
Okay.

274
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,850
I mean, I think I take it
back. I had, I had, uh,

275
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,550
I think

276
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:51,120
it one more time. I think I
remembered it wrong. Oh yeah.

277
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,070
Stole it.
They stole

278
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,740
it from him. Fuck. I'd see and
take it all back. He had the ball.

279
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,360
I take it all back. That kid fucked it
up. Yeah. The literally did. He took it.

280
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,860
He literally took it from him in the
playing field. Yeah. You little cunt.

281
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh,
he's got spray on them.

282
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:09,950
People probably through
beers on them probably,

283
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,300
but the thing of like threatening
a kid's life, that's crazy.

284
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:17,840
But also it's like if you're a
kid and the ball's right there,

285
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,340
you're going to reach for it.

286
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:21,680
You're not going to be thinking
this guy's going to catch her,

287
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:24,620
not going to catch it. It's like
you have a chance to catch the ball.
