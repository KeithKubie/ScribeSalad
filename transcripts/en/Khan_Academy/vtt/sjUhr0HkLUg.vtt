00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.775 --> 00:00:03.438
- [Narrator] We're asked
what are the domain

00:00:03.438 --> 00:00:06.298
and range of the sine function?

00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:09.322
So to think about that,
let's actually draw

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:12.579
the sine function out,
and what I have here,

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.198
on the left hand side right
over here I've got a unit

00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:18.373
circle, and I can, let me
truncate this a little bit.

00:00:18.373 --> 00:00:19.960
I don't need that space right there,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.578
so let me clear that out.

00:00:21.578 --> 00:00:24.161
So I have a unit circle
on the left hand side

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:26.817
right over here, and I'm
gonna use that to figure out

00:00:26.817 --> 00:00:30.076
the values of sine of
theta for a given theta.

00:00:30.076 --> 00:00:34.076
So, on the unit circle
this is X, and this is Y,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.733
or you could even do this, as the, well,

00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.424
we can just use X or Y,
and so for a given theta

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:42.649
we can see where that angle
entered to the terminal side

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.857
of the angle intersects the
unit circle, and then those,

00:00:45.857 --> 00:00:47.625
the Y coordinate of that point

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:49.746
is going to be sine of theta.

00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:52.088
And over here I'm going to graph.

00:00:52.088 --> 00:00:54.758
Still Y in the vertical axis,

00:00:54.758 --> 00:00:59.086
but I'm gonna graph the graph
of Y is equal to sine of theta.

00:00:59.086 --> 00:01:03.253
Y is equal to sine of theta,
and on the horizontal axis

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.215
I'm not gonna graph X,
but I'm gonna graph theta.

00:01:07.215 --> 00:01:09.657
You can do theta as the
independent variable here,

00:01:09.657 --> 00:01:12.520
and it's gonna be theta is
going to be in radians.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.585
So we're essentially going
to pick a bunch of thetas

00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:19.406
and then come up with
what sine of theta is,

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:20.976
and then graph it.

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:23.629
So let's set up a little
bit of a table here.

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:26.562
Let's set up a little bit of a table.

00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:28.827
And so, over here I have theta,

00:01:28.827 --> 00:01:30.723
and over here we're going

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:34.102
to figure out what sine of theta is,

00:01:34.102 --> 00:01:36.743
and we could do a bunch of theta values.

00:01:36.743 --> 00:01:40.910
We could start, we could start,
let's say we start at zero.

00:01:42.372 --> 00:01:45.328
Let's say we start at
theta is equal to zero.

00:01:45.328 --> 00:01:47.064
What is sine of theta gonna be?

00:01:47.064 --> 00:01:48.640
Well, when the angle is zero

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.421
we intersect the unit
circle right over there.

00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:53.815
The Y coordinate of this is still zero.

00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:57.823
This is the point, this is
the point one comma zero.

00:01:57.823 --> 00:02:00.580
The Y coordinate is zero,
so sine of theta is zero.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.724
We could say sine of
zero is equal to zero.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:07.985
Sine of zero is equal to zero.

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:11.568
Now let's try theta is
equal to pi over two.

00:02:13.402 --> 00:02:15.331
Theta is equal to pi over two.

00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:18.041
I'm just doing the ones that
are really easy to figure out.

00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:19.447
So if theta is equal to pi over two,

00:02:19.447 --> 00:02:21.571
that's the same thing
as a 90 degree angle.

00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:24.466
So, the terminal side is going
to be right along the Y axis

00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:28.999
just like that, and where it
intersects, where it intersects

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:33.346
the unit circle is right over
here, and what point is that?

00:02:33.346 --> 00:02:36.429
Well that's the point zero comma one.

00:02:37.513 --> 00:02:40.096
So what is sine of pi over two?

00:02:42.384 --> 00:02:44.430
Well sine of pi over two is just

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.044
the Y coordinate right over here.

00:02:46.044 --> 00:02:46.877
It is one.

00:02:46.877 --> 00:02:48.884
Sine of pi over two is one.

00:02:48.884 --> 00:02:51.407
Let's keep going and you might
see a little pattern here.

00:02:51.407 --> 00:02:54.070
We're just going more and
more around the circle.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.318
So let's think about what's, what,

00:02:56.318 --> 00:02:58.240
what happens when theta is equal to pi.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.990
When theta is equal to
pi, what is sine of pi?

00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:06.666
Well, we intersect the unit
circle right over there.

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:09.921
That coordinate is negative one, zero.

00:03:09.921 --> 00:03:11.951
Sine is the Y coordinate,

00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:14.567
so this right over here is sine of pi.

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:16.924
Sine of pi is zero.

00:03:16.924 --> 00:03:19.382
Let's go to three pi over two.

00:03:19.382 --> 00:03:23.480
Three pi over two, well now
we've gone three quarters

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.563
of the way around, around the circle.

00:03:28.415 --> 00:03:32.028
We intersect the terminal
side of the angle intersects

00:03:32.028 --> 00:03:33.762
the unit circle right over here,

00:03:33.762 --> 00:03:38.558
and so based on that what is
sine of three pi over two?

00:03:38.558 --> 00:03:41.732
Well, this point right over
here is the point negative,

00:03:41.732 --> 00:03:46.723
we gotta be careful, is
zero, is zero negative one.

00:03:46.723 --> 00:03:49.774
The sine of theta is the
same thing as a Y coordinate

00:03:49.774 --> 00:03:52.661
if the Y coordinate is
the sine of theta, so theta,

00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:54.671
when theta's pi over two sine of theta,

00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:56.427
or when theta's three pi over two

00:03:56.427 --> 00:03:59.594
sine of theta is equal to negative one.

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.957
And let's come full circle.

00:04:02.957 --> 00:04:05.046
Let's come full circle here.

00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:08.664
So let's go all the way
to theta equaling two pi.

00:04:08.664 --> 00:04:11.454
Let me do a color, hey, I'll
just use the yellow here.

00:04:11.454 --> 00:04:13.242
What happens when theta is equal to two pi?

00:04:13.242 --> 00:04:16.281
Well then we've gone all
the way around the circle,

00:04:16.281 --> 00:04:18.801
and we are back to where we started,

00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:21.483
and the Y coordinate is zero,

00:04:21.483 --> 00:04:24.333
so sine of two pi is once again zero,

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:25.882
and if we were to keep going around,

00:04:25.882 --> 00:04:28.480
we're gonna start seeing as we
keep incrementing the angle,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.930
we're gonna start seeing the
same pattern emerge again.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.740
Well, let's try to graph this.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.907
So when theta is equal to
zero, sine of theta is zero.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.668
When theta is equal to pi
over two, when theta is equal

00:04:42.668 --> 00:04:46.751
to pi over two, pi over
two, sine of theta is one.

00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:49.751
So, we'll use the same scale.

00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:53.584
So sine of theta, sine
of theta is equal to one.

00:04:55.017 --> 00:04:56.707
This is, I'll just make this,

00:04:56.707 --> 00:04:59.047
this is one on this
axis, and on that axis.

00:04:59.047 --> 00:05:01.607
So we can maybe see a little
bit of a parallel here.

00:05:01.607 --> 00:05:05.849
When theta is equal to
pi, sine of theta is zero.

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.491
So when theta is equal to
pi, sine of theta is zero.

00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:11.887
So we go back right over there.

00:05:11.887 --> 00:05:14.401
When theta is equal to three pi over two,

00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:18.250
so that would be right over
here, three pi over two,

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.667
sine of theta is negative one.

00:05:21.725 --> 00:05:23.241
So this is negative one over here.

00:05:23.241 --> 00:05:25.648
I'll do the same scale over here.

00:05:25.648 --> 00:05:26.828
I'll make this negative.

00:05:26.828 --> 00:05:28.205
I'll make, let me make down a little bit,

00:05:28.205 --> 00:05:30.376
I'll make this negative one, and so,

00:05:30.376 --> 00:05:32.793
sine of theta is negative one.

00:05:33.905 --> 00:05:38.538
And then, when theta is two
pi, sine of theta is zero.

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:42.705
So when theta is two pi, two
pi, sine of theta is zero.

00:05:44.598 --> 00:05:46.020
And so we can connect the dots.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.371
You could try other points in between

00:05:47.371 --> 00:05:49.500
and you get something, you get a graph

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.331
that looks something like this.

00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:54.311
It looks something like this.

00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:56.687
My best attempt at drawing it freehand.

00:05:56.687 --> 00:06:00.020
It looks something, something like this.

00:06:00.877 --> 00:06:02.721
There's a reason why curves
that look like this are called

00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:06.338
sinusoids, because they're
the graph of a sine function.

00:06:06.338 --> 00:06:08.584
So this like, just like this,

00:06:08.584 --> 00:06:09.928
but that's not the entire graph.

00:06:09.928 --> 00:06:11.036
We could keep going.

00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:13.462
We could go, we could
add another pi over two.

00:06:13.462 --> 00:06:16.232
If you added another pi over
two, so if you go to two pi,

00:06:16.232 --> 00:06:18.253
and then you add another pi over two.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.837
So you could view this
as two and a half pi,

00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:21.392
or however you wanna think about it,

00:06:21.392 --> 00:06:23.048
then you're gonna go back over here.

00:06:23.048 --> 00:06:24.298
So then you're gonna get back

00:06:24.298 --> 00:06:26.161
to sine of theta being equal to one.

00:06:26.161 --> 00:06:28.569
So you're gonna go back to
this point right over here,

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:29.899
and you could keep going.

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:31.702
You go another pi over
two, you're gonna go back

00:06:31.702 --> 00:06:33.881
to this point, and you're
gonna be over here,

00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:37.357
and so the curve, the curve
or the function sine of theta

00:06:37.357 --> 00:06:40.255
is really defined for any theta value,

00:06:40.255 --> 00:06:43.255
any real theta value that you choose.

00:06:44.095 --> 00:06:45.569
So any theta value.

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:46.952
Well, what about negatives?

00:06:46.952 --> 00:06:48.818
I mean obviously I agree,
as you keep increasing theta

00:06:48.818 --> 00:06:50.888
like this we just keep going
around and around the circle

00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:52.465
and this pattern kind of emerges,

00:06:52.465 --> 00:06:54.395
but what happens when we go
in the negative direction?

00:06:54.395 --> 00:06:55.654
Well, let's try it out.

00:06:55.654 --> 00:06:58.365
What happens if we were to
take, if we were to take

00:06:58.365 --> 00:07:00.229
negative pi over two?

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:01.575
So let me do that.

00:07:01.575 --> 00:07:05.742
So negative pi over two, well,
that's going right over here,

00:07:08.205 --> 00:07:11.283
and so we intersect the unit
circle right over there.

00:07:11.283 --> 00:07:13.555
The Y coordinate is negative one.

00:07:13.555 --> 00:07:16.721
So sine of negative pi
over two is negative one,

00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:18.950
and we see that it just continues.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:19.931
It just continues.

00:07:19.931 --> 00:07:23.201
So sine of theta is defined
for any positive, negative,

00:07:23.201 --> 00:07:26.198
or any theta, positive or negative,

00:07:26.198 --> 00:07:28.703
non negative, zero, anything.

00:07:28.703 --> 00:07:31.023
So it's defined for anything.

00:07:31.023 --> 00:07:33.345
So, let's go back to the question.

00:07:33.345 --> 00:07:36.648
So I could just keep drawing
this function on and on and on.

00:07:36.648 --> 00:07:38.212
So let's go back to the question.

00:07:38.212 --> 00:07:41.462
What is the domain, what is the domain?

00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:47.121
What is the domain of
sine of the sine function?

00:07:49.656 --> 00:07:52.831
And just as a reminder, the
domain are all of the inputs

00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:54.516
over which the function is defined,

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:56.879
or all of the valid
inputs into the function

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:59.691
that the function will actually
spit out a valid answer.

00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:02.906
So what is the domain
of the sine function?

00:08:02.906 --> 00:08:04.735
Well, we already saw.

00:08:04.735 --> 00:08:07.076
We can put in any theta here.

00:08:07.076 --> 00:08:10.746
So you could say the
domain, the domain is all,

00:08:10.746 --> 00:08:14.496
all real numbers, all
real, all real numbers.

00:08:19.673 --> 00:08:21.560
Now, what about the range?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.310
What about the range?

00:08:26.163 --> 00:08:29.348
Well just as a review,
the range is sometimes

00:08:29.348 --> 00:08:32.358
in more technical math
classes called the image.

00:08:32.358 --> 00:08:34.797
It's the set of all the values that

00:08:34.797 --> 00:08:37.243
the function can actually take on.

00:08:37.243 --> 00:08:38.633
Well what is that set?

00:08:38.633 --> 00:08:39.642
What is the range here?

00:08:39.642 --> 00:08:41.570
What is all the values that Y equals

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.204
sine of theta could actually take on?

00:08:44.204 --> 00:08:48.022
Well, we see that it keeps
going between positive one,

00:08:48.022 --> 00:08:52.379
it keeps going between positive
one and then to negative one

00:08:52.379 --> 00:08:54.312
and then back to positive
one and then negative one.

00:08:54.312 --> 00:08:57.755
It takes on all the values in between.

00:08:57.755 --> 00:09:01.977
So you see that sine of
theta, sine of theta is always

00:09:01.977 --> 00:09:04.267
going to be less than or equal to one,

00:09:04.267 --> 00:09:05.678
and it's always going to be greater than

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:07.599
or equal to negative one.

00:09:07.599 --> 00:09:10.137
So you could say that
the range of sine of theta

00:09:10.137 --> 00:09:13.147
is the set of all numbers
between negative one

00:09:13.147 --> 00:09:17.036
and positive one, and it
includes negative one and one,

00:09:17.036 --> 00:09:21.203
and that's why we put brackets
here instead of parentheses.
