(electronic music)

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.330
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.410
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.360
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.720
Our guest today is Yuri Slezkine,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.420
who is professor of
history at UC Berkeley,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.720
and director of its Institute
for Slavic, East European,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.140
and Eurasian Studies.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.020
His most recent book
is The Jewish Century.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.050
Yuri, welcome to our program.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.335
- Thank you.

00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:50.168
- Where were you born and raised?

00:00:50.168 --> 00:00:51.260
- Moscow, Russia.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.980
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.903
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.733
- That's a really big question.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.910
Well, they were against the regime,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.293
so I grew up anti-Soviet.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.310
So that's the main contribution, I guess,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.120
to my political upbringing.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.730
- And was it a very political household

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.290
that you lived in with your parents?

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.370
- Yes, there were a lot of
conversations about politics.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.560
- And for quite a while, you
didn't know you were Jewish,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.360
but one day you found
out a neighborhood girl

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.910
who you, I guess, were
interested in was Jewish,

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.903
and what did your father tell you?

00:01:35.854 --> 00:01:36.790
- Well, it actually was a boy,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.510
and I found out that he was
Jewish, and I told my father.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.700
I don't remember how old I was,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.190
but anyway, I told my father,
did you know that so-and-so

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.590
from apartment 15 was Jewish?

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.054
And so my father turned to me and said,

00:01:53.054 --> 00:01:55.240
let me tell you something.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.000
- So after he told you,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.480
which I guess was that
you had Jewish ancestors.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.750
- On my mother's side.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.340
He himself is not Jewish, but he told me,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.420
well, I'll tell you
something about your mother.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.400
It was quite a blow.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.800
- In what sense?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.410
- Well, because it
wasn't cool to be Jewish.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.255
- I see. (laughs)

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:15.327
I see.

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:20.850
And after that, how did that reorient you,

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.798
finding out that you were Jewish?

00:02:22.798 --> 00:02:25.100
Was it something you kept inside

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.930
or did your political ideas get influenced

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.880
by that Jewish identity?

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.010
- Well, the two influenced each other,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.010
because being Jewish, since it
was not a religious identity,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.620
and it was cultural in a
certain peculiar sense.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.140
So it was political to a great degree,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.960
and so being Jewish,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.730
at least in Moscow among
the intelligentsia,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.023
it meant being anti-Soviet.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.720
And so the two sort of
reinforced each other,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.660
that being anti-Soviet
meant, not automatically,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.660
but did mean in many contexts
that you were probably Jewish,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.930
and being Jewish meant
in a lot of contexts

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.630
that you were probably anti-Soviet.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.393
Again, it wasn't 100% guarantee,
but it was likely enough.

00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.770
- What year would this have
been when you discovered

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.500
that you had Jewish ancestry?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.410
- In the mid-60s, I would guess.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.330
Early to mid-60s.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.520
- Right, so really at the
height of the Cold War?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.480
- Yes, although, again, the
Cold War is an American concept,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.833
not really a Russian one.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.380
- In what sense?

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.140
- At the time, we didn't
really refer to it

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.832
as the Cold War.
- Cold War.

00:03:39.832 --> 00:03:40.665
- Or Cold War era.

00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:43.640
Now it's used in Russia
to refer to that period,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.700
but at the time, Cold War was something

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.623
that was associated with
Western terminology.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.760
- And so, let's talk a little
about your Soviet identity,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.833
as a citizen of the Soviet Union.

00:04:02.606 --> 00:04:04.240
You said you were anti-Soviet,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.960
but help us understand
exactly what that means.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.370
Was it Communism or was
it the Soviet regime

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.100
that was the thing that you didn't like?

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.300
- Well, both.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.300
The idea was that the idea of
Communism was a utopian one

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.680
and perhaps an undesirable one,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.653
and that the regime based on
that idea was illegitimate.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.003
So it was both.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.560
It was being anti-Communist in principle

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.870
and being anti-Soviet in
that the regime was seen

00:04:43.856 --> 00:04:46.453
as illegitimate.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.243
- Did you have an identity as a Russian?

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.063
- I suppose so.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.490
But, you know, when you live in Russia,

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.583
it's a default identity, really.

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:03.740
It didn't mean as much
to then as it does now.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.700
Now I strongly identify with Russia.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.973
At the time, since everyone did,

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.960
but it was also an
ideology to some extent,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.593
in that clearly I was taught,
as a matter of principle,

00:05:17.544 --> 00:05:20.450
to love the Russian language
and Russian literature,

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.140
and as I actually tried
to write in the book,

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.600
this love of the Russian
language and literature

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.070
is a kind of secular religion

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.330
in the Soviet Union, was
and still is in Russia.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.330
- In your article about
Russian Soviet nationalism

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.010
or nationalism within the Soviet Union,

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.900
there was a few sentences there.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.560
We'll talk later about that article,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.057
but you wrote, "Every
Soviet citizen was born

00:05:48.057 --> 00:05:50.807
"into a certain nationality,
took it to daycare,

00:05:50.807 --> 00:05:52.007
"and through high school,

00:05:52.007 --> 00:05:54.657
"had it officially
confirmed at the age of 16,

00:05:54.657 --> 00:05:56.337
"and then carried it to the grave

00:05:56.337 --> 00:05:58.927
"through thousands of
application forms, certificates,

00:05:58.927 --> 00:06:01.087
"questionnaires, and reception desks.

00:06:01.087 --> 00:06:02.997
"It made a difference in school admissions

00:06:02.997 --> 00:06:05.847
"and it could be crucial
in employment, promotions,

00:06:05.847 --> 00:06:07.380
"and draft assignments."

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.100
So you're describing a world
that you knew pretty well,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.400
I guess.
- Absolutely.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.400
- And so as a Jew, as a
person of Jewish ancestry,

00:06:19.648 --> 00:06:22.740
it's a better way to
say that, you basically

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.070
would put your Jewish identity, or not,

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.620
or would it be a Russian identity?

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.435
What were you in the context that this--

00:06:31.435 --> 00:06:35.290
- In my own mind, and indeed, there was,

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.420
according to the prevailing
Soviet terminology,

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.379
I was a half-breed,

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:41.300
(Harry laughs)

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.740
and I would refer to myself
when asked in conversation,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.260
by friends and so on, I'd
say I am half and half,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.290
half Jewish, half Russian.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.530
Because, again, Jewishness
was an ethnic category

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.693
in the Soviet Union.

00:06:54.274 --> 00:06:57.290
It had to do with your
blood, not your convictions,

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.653
or whatever religion.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.490
But I was, I guess, unprincipled enough

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.003
to put down Russian in
all my official paperwork,

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.280
because, obviously, it made it much easier

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.983
to get into college and
to avoid being ridiculed

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.990
and that sort of thing.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.990
Again, it wasn't really
being unprincipled,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.460
because certainly when I was young

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.420
and I didn't really think
of myself as Jewish.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.420
I just knew that my mother
had a Jewish background.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.630
- So then tell us a little
about your education

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.540
in the Soviet Union.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.750
What did you study?

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.000
What were your interests?

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.230
- Well, I was interested in history,

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.480
but I studied literature.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.790
I was interested in literature as well,

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.810
but history departments
were heavily ideological

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.750
with a lot of time devoted to
the study of Marxist Leninism.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:05.283
So studying literature
seemed to be a better option.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.110
So I studied.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.180
I went to Moscow University,

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.230
to the so-called philology department,

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.733
where I studied
linguistics and literature.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.857
But I was always interested in history

00:08:19.857 --> 00:08:23.570
and so when I came over here,
I went to graduate school

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.653
in the department of history.

00:08:26.766 --> 00:08:29.680
- And before you came
here to do graduate work

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.120
at the University of Texas,
you did some traveling.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.450
Tell us a little about that

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.360
because I think you mention in your book

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.140
that it sensitized you
to some of the issues

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.570
that you became interested in over time.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.529
You were in Mozambique.
- Right.

00:08:46.529 --> 00:08:49.130
- And that was after
your degree in Moscow,

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.485
and before you came here.

00:08:50.485 --> 00:08:55.485
- Right, so I was there for
a year, and then I went back.

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:57.110
- [Harry] Were you teaching?

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.250
- No, I was an interpreter.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:59.890
- [Harry] Interpreter, okay.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.550
- Portuguese, Russian interpreter,

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.940
and then I went back to Russia,

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.030
worked for about a year and a half there

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.100
in a publishing house,
and then I immigrated

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.590
and I left for Portugal
where I lived for a year,

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.810
and so I first came to this country

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.463
as a Portuguese graduate student.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.343
- With a Portuguese passport?

00:09:24.944 --> 00:09:27.417
So you have multiple identities?

00:09:27.417 --> 00:09:28.454
- [Yuri] I do.

00:09:28.454 --> 00:09:29.770
(laughing)

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.160
- Which makes you flexible
and also will be an insight

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.000
when we talk about your work in a minute.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.170
And when did you come to
the University of Texas?

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.260
What year?

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.700
- It was in January 1983.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.670
- Okay, 1983.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.233
Before the Soviet Union collapsed.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.200
How did the collapse of the Soviet Union

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.453
affect your thinking?

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.950
- Well, it made me feel different

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:16.350
about my home country.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.543
I mean, it made me feel different
about a number of things.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.890
Obviously, it's not every
day that the country

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.853
where you were born
disappears from the map.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.700
It forced me to think of Soviet history

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.310
in different ways, I guess,

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:39.310
but most important for
me, it made me realize

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.060
that I had immigrated
from the Soviet Union,

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.223
not really from Russia.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.700
So I identified more, I guess,
strongly with Russia today

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.050
than I did before the
Soviet Union collapsed.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.930
So now that the regime, in
other words, is not in the way,

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.630
it's kind of easier to be Russian.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:08.730
- So in what ways was this disorienting?

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.730
Or was it less disorienting
and giving you more

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.070
a sense of who you were?

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.900
- It was exhilarating and exciting.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.403
I felt bad I was here
during the events of 1991,

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.760
the attempted coup d'etat,
the fall of the Soviet Union,

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.430
the rallies, the demonstrations,

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.640
the anticipation, the change.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.030
I started going back.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.190
I went back for the first
time in '89, I think.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.840
- After the fall?

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.230
- Right.
- Yeah.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.240
- Well, it was the Soviet
Union, it still existed,

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.930
but the regime that I
had sort of grown up with

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.763
was no longer there for
all practical purposes.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.560
So there was freedom of expression.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.010
There was street demonstrations.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.173
There were all kinds of
articles in newspapers.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.250
So it was a very exciting time to go back.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.005
- Before we talk about your book,

00:12:04.005 --> 00:12:06.683
let's talk a little about doing history.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.050
What do you think are the important skills

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:16.030
for students to have if they
wanted to pursue a career

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.480
in Russian history?

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.730
My sense is that, for you,
literature is very important

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.450
in understanding what's going on.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.640
- You mean Russian literature?

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.090
Russian history specifically,

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.620
as opposed to history in general.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.060
I think obviously you have
to know the language, right?

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.993
In addition to being curious.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.680
And I think it's true of
the study of any culture

00:12:40.378 --> 00:12:42.740
that you should know the
language and the culture.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.000
It may even be true of Russia

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.610
because of this intense cult of literature

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.540
in Russian society, and the
frequency with which people use

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.083
quotations from poetry in their speech,

00:12:58.029 --> 00:12:59.290
in their writings.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.160
So if you want to
understand those nuances,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.443
then you better read a lot of literature.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.440
- Now let's talk a little about your book,

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.710
and I will show it to our audience again,

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.840
The Jewish Century.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.840
It's a very complex book with many themes

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:26.030
and I wanna pursue some
of the important themes,

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.060
and one is, in your first chapter,

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:36.060
you place the Jewish people
in the context, really,

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.520
of other people, similar
social and functional roles.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.910
Now I think you mention that
you were sensitized to this

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.040
because of your trip to Mozambique.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.390
You saw the Indians there and their role.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.760
Talk a little about that,

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.363
and then let's talk a
little about your argument,

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.250
seeing the Jews as what
you call Mercurians,

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.113
as opposed to Apollonians.

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:13.125
- Yeah, it's not a very
particular regional observation,

00:14:13.125 --> 00:14:18.125
because the Indians are known,
or some people call them,

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.093
the Jews of East Africa.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.500
But it was striking to me
when I was in East Africa

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:29.510
to see Indians perform pretty
much the same functions

00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:36.955
as Jews had in Central Europe
and the Russian Empire.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.410
And not only perform the same functions,

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.327
but being perceived in the same way,

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.940
feared, disliked, admired in
pretty much the same terms.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:56.510
Moreover, I didn't know
many Indians in Mozambique,

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.280
but I knew some and my sense at the time

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:04.280
was that they viewed their
neighbors, clients, customers,

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.320
in ways that were similar
to the way the Russian Jews

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.170
had viewed their Persian,
Ukrainian, Belarussian,

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.840
Lithuanian neighbors.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.130
And so it just sort of struck me

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:25.820
how similar their situations,

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.700
and in some way, identities were,

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.700
and made me curious about this
as a comparative phenomenon.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:40.220
- You conceptualize this status and role

00:15:41.862 --> 00:15:45.490
and name it after the
gods, the god Mercury.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:50.490
So explain what a Mercurian
is, in your terms,

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.950
a concept which you apply both to the Jews

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.860
and to the Indians and
other peoples, actually.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:03.700
- Well, what I argue is that
in traditional societies,

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.850
and I do not, in this context, talk about

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.920
industrial, post-industrial societies,

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.580
but in so-called traditional societies,

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.253
one could divide societies

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.903
into two basic categories,

00:16:21.767 --> 00:16:24.650
food producers and service providers.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:29.030
Obviously, there are service
providers within any society,

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.330
but what I find interesting

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.530
is that there were whole ethnic groups,

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.160
demographically complete societies

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.603
that did not engage in food production,

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.830
and specialized in providing services

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.730
to the surrounding food
producing population.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:52.130
And those communities,
again, those ethnic groups

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.660
that specialized exclusively
in the provision of services,

00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.660
I call Mercurians after the
god of commerce and trade

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.660
and the god of messengers,
guides, healers,

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.075
all kinds of border
crossers and go-betweens.

00:17:10.075 --> 00:17:14.560
- And what are their characteristics?

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.080
- Well, they are strangers
by vocation, by trade,

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.093
by definition.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:25.420
They have to be strangers in
order to perform their function

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.430
and they can perform their function

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.083
because they're strangers.

00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:34.147
So in order to remain
strangers, they have to

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.340
do certain things or be a certain way,

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.430
behave in a certain way,

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:47.110
and so it is true of most Mercurians,

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:52.110
of most ethnic groups who do these things,

00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:57.650
that they tend to speak a
language that is foreign

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.390
to the surrounding population.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.750
They either bring such
a language with them,

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:05.373
or they invent one.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.320
They tend to have fairly
rigid dietary taboos.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:18.540
They do not share meals
with their clients.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.030
They tend to be endogamous.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.770
They do not share wives
with their clients,

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.720
and if you don't share wives
and meals with your neighbors,

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.510
you clearly are going to
be a radical stranger.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:34.510
That is one way not to engage with others,

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.560
not to be able to accept hospitality,

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.003
or indeed to offer hospitality.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.420
They are, again by definition,
transients, wanderers,

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:51.420
travelers, and that is true
not only of nomadic groups,

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.170
but even of settled groups
such as Eastern European Jews

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.040
who think of themselves as exiles,

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.770
who may live in one place
for hundreds of years,

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.950
but are committed to the idea

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.760
that they are not from around here,

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.553
that they belong somewhere else.

00:19:14.636 --> 00:19:17.300
And they tend to present
themselves in a way

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.520
that would be sort of a
mirror image to the way

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.623
they understand their hosts to be.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.520
Men usually pointedly nonbelligerent,

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.840
so, again, not fighting is
a good way not to engage

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.080
in cross-cultural interaction.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.280
The women, on the other hand,
are perceived as aggressive,

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.890
and sometimes, therefore,
attractive, and so on.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:49.040
So they share certain traits.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.070
- [Harry] These groups?

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.670
- All of those groups, right,

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:56.670
and they tend to view their
clients and customers and hosts,

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:58.840
however you call them,

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.370
in similar ways, and
they tend to be perceived

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.800
by those groups in similar ways,

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.690
and I think it's true of overseas Chinese

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.010
in Southeast Asia, and Indians in Africa,

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.823
and the Lebanese in West Africa,

00:20:14.384 --> 00:20:19.180
or, indeed, in South America,
and all sorts of other groups,

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.240
in the Middle East, in particular.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.820
- Now distinguish the Mercurians.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.820
Briefly tell us a little
about the other main category,

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.393
which is identified with the god Apollo.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.150
- Well, Apollonian,
again, Apollo was the god

00:20:37.084 --> 00:20:38.250
of both livestock and agriculture.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:41.120
So Apollonian societies,
the way I use the term,

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.333
are societies that are organized
around food production,

00:20:47.257 --> 00:20:48.090
that can feed themselves,

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:52.660
societies that consist
in the traditional era,

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.230
that used to consist mostly of peasants

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:00.300
and various combinations
of warriors and priests

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:07.300
who expropriate peasant labor
by controlling the access

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.943
to land or salvation.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.320
But essentially those are societies

00:21:13.454 --> 00:21:15.654
whose origins are in
the production of food,

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.470
or a particular way of producing food.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.890
Usually traditional
ethnographers distinguish

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:29.560
between hunting-gathering, agricultural,

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.360
and pastoral societies.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:37.360
And so what I am proposing is
that we add another category

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.770
that was another way of making a living,

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:44.180
that was actually quite
traditional and fairly common,

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.290
this way that can be known as Jewish,

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:48.410
or, if you will, Armenian,

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:53.410
but it is an old way of
life, way of making a living,

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.743
to specialize exclusively in
the provision of services.

00:22:02.937 --> 00:22:04.910
- You were talking again
about the Mercurian--

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.711
- Right, sort of
juxtaposing the Apollonians

00:22:07.711 --> 00:22:08.640
and the Mercurians.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.317
- Now your hypothesis here really offers

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.900
an important insight into
the roots of anti-Semitism.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.080
Talk a little about that.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.030
And not just anti-Semitism,

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:26.890
the riots against Chinese
communities in Southeast Asia

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.797
and so on and so forth.

00:22:30.126 --> 00:22:32.737
It sort of follows almost from
what you're proposing, right?

00:22:32.737 --> 00:22:36.470
- Right, so the idea is that
there is really nothing unique

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.030
about anti-Semitism.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.800
There may be something
unique about particular forms

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.420
of anti-Semitism,

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:46.520
but this particular dislike of the Jews

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.820
is comparable and, indeed, very similar

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:55.730
to the dislike of the overseas
Chinese in Southeast Asia

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.040
or Indonesia, of the
Indians in East Africa,

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:05.040
Armenians in the Ottoman Empire,
in what is now Azerbaijan,

00:23:06.877 --> 00:23:08.173
and so on and so forth.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.430
- Now the next important
element in the equation

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:18.430
that you're proposing is
really the extent to which

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.210
Mercurians, and in
particular, the Jews in Europe

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.370
played a central role
because of these skills,

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:31.790
because of their social role
in positioning themselves

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:36.790
as agents of modernity as
modernization came to Europe,

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.070
changed Europe, through industrialization,

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:44.390
through international commerce and so on.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:45.710
Talk a little about that

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.540
because it becomes a
very important element

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.340
in the story you're telling.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.173
- Right.

00:23:53.273 --> 00:23:57.230
And again, I do not argue that
the Jews were instrumental

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.970
in bringing modernity to Europe.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:03.970
What I am arguing is that
they were very successful

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.030
at being modern

00:24:10.664 --> 00:24:13.464
because some of the things
that they had specialized in,

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.920
finance, law, entrepreneurship, medicine,

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.023
things that used to be dangerous,

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.660
used to be viewed with suspicion,
were now in great demand,

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.660
moreover, were now the
most fundamental features

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:38.350
of modernity, those most in demand,

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.100
those that would lead to
a great deal of success,

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.730
prestige, and so on.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:48.730
And so these traditional
Jewish specialties,

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:51.923
such as entrepreneurship, law, medicine,

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.833
what would become the media,

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:02.313
in other words, these
intermediary activities,

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.370
would place them at the top,

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:10.490
or at least in some key
positions in the modern world.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.110
And that obviously leads
to success on the one hand

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.483
and to resentment on the other.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:22.320
- Now as a historian of Russia
and of the Soviet Union,

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.910
you see the Jews

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:35.420
as performing a very important role,

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.820
bringing these skills to the aftermath

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:42.870
of the Communist revolution.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.320
Talk a little about that,

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.270
because this wasn't the first time

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:47.700
this had happened in Russia.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.550
In an earlier period, it had been Germans

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.870
that had played an important role

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:57.403
in the consolidation and
modernization of the tsar estate.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:02.530
- Right, well, the Jews
were prominent enough

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:04.663
in some of the same spheres, banking,

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.220
various forms of
entrepreneurship, law, medicine,

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.230
in Imperial Russia as well,

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:18.030
but there were various
constraints on their status,

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.030
on how far they could go.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:22.190
And so after the revolution,

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:26.710
with the evolution of the
so-called Pale of Settlement,

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:31.687
of all kinds of restrictions,
residential and otherwise,

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:38.260
they migrated en masse from
the former Pale of Settlement

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.252
from where they used to live

00:26:40.252 --> 00:26:43.423
in what is now Belarussia,
Ukraine, and Lithuania primarily,

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.470
to the big cities of the Soviet Union,

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:51.573
and did exceedingly well in the
new Soviet education system.

00:26:54.507 --> 00:26:55.550
And that's a big part of the story

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.500
that I am telling in the book.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.300
What's important to me
is not only to talk about

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:07.253
the role of Jews in the
creation of the Soviet state,

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:11.130
and by the way, not only
did they do very well

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.680
in the Soviet education system,

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.910
but they welcomed the Soviet regime

00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:20.003
more formally,

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:27.010
so to speak, then most other groups

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.273
in the Soviet Union.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.810
But, in any case, it was
important for me to point out

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.793
that this was a migration,

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:41.130
that we could talk about
this movement of Jews

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:45.230
to Moscow, Leningrad, and other
cities of the Soviet Union

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:49.160
in the same way we could
talk about the movement

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.500
of their cousins, brothers,
sisters, at the same time

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:58.500
to Palestine and to the United
States, among other places.

00:27:58.733 --> 00:28:03.720
- Just to pursue this point
about the Jewish impact

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.430
as a result of the migration,

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:09.314
it is also the case that
in the interwar period,

00:28:09.314 --> 00:28:10.350
and maybe even a little before,

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:15.350
Jews assumed very important
roles in other parts of Europe,

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.680
for example, Austria,
Hungary, and even Germany.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.393
- Right, right.

00:28:24.373 --> 00:28:29.373
But, again, in some of the
same spheres of activity,

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:34.323
higher education, law,
medicine, and so on,

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:41.053
science, journalism, entertainment.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.700
I suppose the greatest
difference was that number one,

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.710
that, of course, private
entrepreneurship was outlawed

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:54.453
in the Soviet Union, and Jews
suffered disproportionately

00:28:55.795 --> 00:28:56.883
as a result.

00:28:58.114 --> 00:29:01.813
So a very high proportion
of traders, businessmen,

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.733
who were deprived of their
rights and often arrested,

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.820
had their property
confiscated, were Jewish.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:17.360
On the other hand, I suppose
the other important difference

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.223
was that in the Soviet Union,

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:26.453
state employment was open.

00:29:27.287 --> 00:29:29.260
There was no official anti-Semitism at all

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.200
in the Soviet Union.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.410
There were fairly effective
campaigns against anti-Semitism

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:37.200
in the Soviet Union in
the interwar period,

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.200
and so that resulted in the fact

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.850
that there was a very high
proportion of ethnic Jews.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.220
And again, we know
we're talking about Jews

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.223
as an ethnic group in this case, right?

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.730
We can call them just immigrants

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.390
from the Jewish Pale of Settlement,

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.010
or people from Jewish homes,

00:29:56.010 --> 00:30:00.480
they were very well represented
in government positions,

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:05.480
in the police, in the armed
forces, among generals,

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:08.890
and so on.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:09.750
- And scientists, too.

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.390
- And diplomats.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.325
As I'm saying, in the
science, medicine, law,

00:30:14.325 --> 00:30:16.320
that was common, right, throughout Europe,

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.350
but if we look at some of the differences

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:19.900
between the position of
Jews in the Soviet Union

00:30:21.562 --> 00:30:25.100
in that period, and the
position of Jews in Europe,

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.800
the greatest differences would be the lack

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.410
of this entrepreneurial
route in the Soviet Union,

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:37.083
but on the other hand,
the openness of the state,

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:40.610
and again, the fact that, of
course, the Russian Revolution

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:44.143
resulted in the destruction
of the old elite,

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.650
sort of gentry elite,
or ethnic German elite.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.680
They were gone.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:55.680
And so there was no
former pre-existing elite

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.890
for these emerging young
Jews to compete with.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:03.740
So their success was even more spectacular

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.710
than their success in
places such as Budapest

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:09.113
or Berlin or Vienna or New York.

00:31:10.334 --> 00:31:13.200
- And now to the next chapter

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.040
in the story that you're telling,

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:20.040
and that really is that
what Jews confronted

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:27.950
after being the agents and
participants in modernization

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:33.520
was the rise of a nationalism
which essentially tapped

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:42.250
this need on the part

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.860
of the people you identify with Apollo

00:31:47.516 --> 00:31:52.516
to exclude the strangers,
to turn against the groups,

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.160
and in Europe, Jews were very important,

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.620
that had helped bring this new era.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:05.620
But now the new era was encapsulated

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:09.200
in the nationalist form.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.623
Talk a little about that.

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.840
- Well, the Jews were
identified with modernity,

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.840
and some of the most obvious new traits

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:27.270
of European states, and
admired as a consequence,

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:30.723
but also resented.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.650
In the Soviet Union, the
story was interesting

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.640
in that, of course, the regime started out

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.520
as a cosmopolitan internationalist regime,

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.283
opposed to nationalism in principle,

00:32:45.605 --> 00:32:49.677
a regime that assumed
that a Communist future

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:57.533
would be without ethnicity,
without tribalism.

00:32:59.708 --> 00:33:04.200
And that, of course, is
what attracted so many Jews

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.150
to Communism, or at
least one of the things

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.823
that attracted them to Communism,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.210
but that began to change
in the Soviet Union

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:19.210
in the interwar period, basically
starting in the mid-1930s,

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:25.030
and the Soviet Union began
to be identified increasingly

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:28.763
with the Russian Empire.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.800
The regime began increasingly
to think of itself as an heir,

00:33:36.186 --> 00:33:38.800
of the Russian Empire, Russian culture,

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.510
Russian sort of imperial idea, and so on.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:45.010
And it became associated increasingly

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:50.010
with the Russian people
understood in ethnic terms,

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.090
and particularly after the
so-called Great Terror,

00:33:55.090 --> 00:34:00.090
most of the new top
officials in the Soviet Union

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.880
were newly promoted ethnic Russians

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.200
of peasant and blue collar background.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.950
And so the atmosphere changed

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:14.370
and the ideology began
slowly, but surely to change,

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:18.040
and so all of a sudden, it turned out

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.390
that this new Soviet intelligentsia,

00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:22.303
of which the regime was so proud,

00:34:23.918 --> 00:34:26.560
and Stalin, in particular, was so proud,

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.860
was in some ways not Soviet
because it wasn't Russian,

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.880
because so many of them were ethnic Jews.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.880
And that became a more
or less explicit issue

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:45.940
for both parties, for the
state, and for the former Jews

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:50.010
who were now Soviet intellectuals
or officials, whatever,

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.873
during the war, during World War II.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:57.650
- And the hidden secret here
was the importance of Russia

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:59.130
and the Russian identity,

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:04.130
which was submerged
within the Soviet identity

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:10.390
as the policy makers were
reinforcing the ethnic identities

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.470
of all the people who
were part of the Empire.

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:14.809
- Right, well, yes.

00:35:14.809 --> 00:35:19.809
As I say, the Soviet Union
was increasingly represented

00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:26.170
as primarily Russia and
then various allied nations

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:29.120
and quasi-states around it,

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.740
and the Soviet people were represented

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:36.740
as a fraternal group led
by the older brother,

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.440
the first among equals, the Russians.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.610
And Stalin emphasized that during the war

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:52.320
'cause he clearly used
traditional Russian patriotism,

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.833
well, Russian, actually, Christianity,

00:35:57.557 --> 00:36:00.060
as an important way to
mobilize the population,

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:05.060
the majority of the
population for the war effort,

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.270
and even more so after the war,

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:13.273
more explicitly so after the war.

00:36:14.776 --> 00:36:17.520
One of Stalin's most famous speeches

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.150
was a toast he raised publicly

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:24.620
after the war to the great Russian nation,

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.290
which he characterized
as the glorious nation,

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:29.320
a special nation

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.530
that was responsible for
defeating the Nazis, and so on.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:34.900
So as a result of that,

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.840
and there were other nations recognized

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.900
as a part of the Soviet Union,

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.370
but Jews were not.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:42.630
And, of course, at the same time

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.900
that the Soviet state
was emphasizing the role

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.663
of ethnic Russians, some
of these ethnic Jews,

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.293
as a result of what the Nazis were doing,

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.473
as well as a result of what
Stalin was doing and saying,

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.680
were thinking of themselves
as Jews more and more,

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:09.190
and wondering more and
more about what it meant.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:11.790
Because, clearly, since the
Germans singled them out

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.030
from among the Soviets,

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.910
and then some Soviets
began to single them out

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.590
as not quite Soviet

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:22.610
because they weren't quite
Russians or anything else

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.980
associated with the Soviet Republic.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.710
They began to wonder more and more,

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:30.090
and, of course, that in turn
reinforced the suspicion

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:35.090
on the part of some members of
this new ruling establishment

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.500
within the Communist Party.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:42.200
- So the Jewish dilemma became

00:37:44.286 --> 00:37:48.880
that their great success
as cosmopolitans, in a way,

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:53.880
now confronted different
types of nationalism

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.770
or organizations that
promoted nationalism,

00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:01.110
and they were essentially
a people without a place

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:06.110
where they could realize their
nationalism within Europe.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:08.723
- Right.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:14.470
In a world of various nationalisms,

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:17.450
in a world of states organized

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:20.950
around the concept of ethnicity,

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.470
in a world of nation-states,

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:28.470
they seemed to be outsiders and outcasts.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.440
In the Soviet case, it was ironic

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:38.440
because they, in some
ways, were more loyal

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:43.013
to the official ideology
than a lot of other people,

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:45.973
more committed to it.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:52.180
And that made the dilemma all the stranger

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.353
in the Soviet Union.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.700
And that's what makes their
trajectory in the Russian case

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:06.700
so peculiar, and that was one
of the questions that I had

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.530
when I first approached this subject

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:13.090
is sort of the riddle
of the transformation

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:16.590
of the most Soviet and the most successful

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:20.070
of all Soviet ethnic groups
into the most anti-Soviet

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:24.200
and still the most successful
of all Soviet ethnic groups.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:29.200
The dilemma that struck
me in college, actually,

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.500
when I surrounded by ethnic Jews,

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.680
all of whom were members

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.830
of this sort of Westernizing
anti-Soviet wing

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:38.633
of the Soviet intelligentsia,

00:39:39.486 --> 00:39:44.020
and many of whom were the
grandchildren of Communists,

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.730
and none of them at the time wondered

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:50.120
how that transformation had occurred.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.340
'Cause they took their sort of anti-Soviet

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:56.120
intelligentsia status for granted

00:39:59.593 --> 00:40:02.820
and we didn't tend to
kinda wonder why it was so.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:11.750
- Now for the next chapter,
to explain what happens next,

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:16.750
you turn to Sholem Aleichem's
Tevye the Dairyman,

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:20.540
which was made in America
into the musical and movie

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:25.540
Fiddler on the Roof, and
you look at the choices

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:30.690
of three of his daughters,
and in a way, each one of them

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:31.810
makes a choice

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:34.470
that actually was a choice
for the Jewish people,

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:38.620
and that is a choice
between going to Palestine,

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:43.200
finding at last the
homeland, going to Russia,

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.070
which we've just talked
about and how that unraveled,

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:50.143
and then thirdly coming
to the United States.

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:54.620
Talk a little about those three options

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:59.050
and how they played out.

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:00.970
What was distinctive about America?

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:03.005
What was distinctive about Russia?

00:41:03.005 --> 00:41:05.138
And what was distinctive about Palestine?

00:41:05.138 --> 00:41:08.323
- Well, you characterize them very well.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:13.830
Those three migrations, as you say,

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:17.520
were also three ideological pilgrimages,

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.580
three political, existential options,

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:22.410
three ways of being Jewish
in the modern world,

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:25.700
and, indeed, three ways of being
modern in the modern world.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:29.260
And so one was non-ethnic
liberal statehood

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.773
in the United States.

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:39.020
Another one was secular ethnic
nationalism in Palestine

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.323
and the third was Communism,

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.050
this hope to create a world

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:55.320
without either capitalism or tribalism,

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:58.390
a world that was sort of
based on the rejection

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:01.540
of the American way on the one hand,

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:04.383
and the Zionist way on the other,

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.050
in the minds of many of
the Jews who opted for it.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:11.490
And so what is important
for me to emphasize

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:15.710
is just how terribly important
the Communist route was,

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:20.580
that the migration to Moscow
was incomparably larger

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.050
than the migration to Palestine,

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:27.710
and it was about as large as the migration

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:32.160
from the Russian Empire to America,

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.200
but it was much more politically charged.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.850
Again, this is not to say
that every participant

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:42.040
in one of those three
migrations did it consciously

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.050
and made a rational choice,

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:48.360
but I think those migrations do reflect

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:53.360
the three dominant positions
within the Jewish community

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:56.280
in Eastern Europe at the time.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:00.660
- Now the Jewish community
in the United States,

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:04.620
the Jewish community,
well, the Jews in Israel,

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.400
and the Jews in the Soviet Union,

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:13.020
their interaction, in a way,
played an important role

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:14.870
in the fall of the Soviet Union

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:19.870
in the sense that the Jewish Neocons here

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:24.280
were influencing legislation
about immigration of the Jews

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.660
from the Soviet Union,

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.940
so this was a piece of the whole pressure

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.810
on the Soviet Union which
led to its collapse,

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:34.420
and the immigrants from the Soviet Union,

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:37.870
one of their destinations was Israel,

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:42.870
which needed more people
to balance the birth rates

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.463
of the Arab population.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.610
What are your thoughts on that
interplay of these forces?

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:54.780
This is not the only explanation

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.560
of why the Soviet Union fell,

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.520
but it's a kind of a dialogue

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.040
between these three communities

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.363
that became very important
in shaping what happened.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:06.537
- Yes, it was.

00:44:08.014 --> 00:44:10.530
It's very important, I think, to remember

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:13.530
that the people who,
at about the same time,

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:16.240
migrated from pretty much the same place

00:44:17.476 --> 00:44:21.773
to the United States, to
Russia, and to Palestine,

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:26.550
that they were, in some
cases, interchange--

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:29.490
They were the same people or
they were closely related.

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:33.310
They would be relatives
literally in some cases

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:36.133
or they'd be neighbors, and
some would go to New York,

00:44:37.641 --> 00:44:39.350
and some would go to Moscow,

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:43.590
and very few would go to Palestine.

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:47.200
And they retained, I think,
many of them retained

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.040
some memory of their common origins.

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.260
Certainly for the longest time,

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.140
they corresponded with each other.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.740
Some people, and I have
some examples in my book,

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:57.780
would go to one place and then to another

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.430
and then to the third, and so on.

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:05.600
Of course, many Jewish
immigrants to the United States

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:11.110
were Communist.

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:13.860
American Communism as an
ideology, as a movement,

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:17.913
was largely a Russian Jewish phenomenon.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:22.660
There were many in Palestine
early on who sympathized

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:23.980
with the Soviet Union.

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.880
There were some Zionists in
Russia and so on and so forth.

00:45:30.953 --> 00:45:32.540
And throughout the century,

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.580
they all kept sorta looking at each other,

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:39.580
and I think in the eyes of
most Jews who immigrated

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.590
from the Russian Empire,

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:44.610
and that including parts
of Poland and so on,

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:49.220
the Soviet option was by
far the most successful.

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.760
I would say that for
the majority of the Jews

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.247
in the interwar period.

00:45:56.068 --> 00:45:59.070
In the 1920s and '30s, it
was the migrants to Moscow

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:05.230
who had the best deal, who
were the most successful,

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:08.510
who were associated
with the greatest hope,

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:13.510
with this wonderful experiment,
and so on and so forth.

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:18.193
But then, of course,
things began to change.

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:23.750
The Six Day War, the emergence,
the creation of Israel,

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:27.030
was a very important event, of course,

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:30.053
and the war, the Six Day War,

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:35.130
which played a very important role

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:40.130
in creating a sort of new
nationalist Jewish ideology

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:44.640
among Soviet Jews.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.290
It was at least as important
in the Soviet Union

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:52.707
for the Soviet Jews as it was
for the American Jews here,

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.860
and the turn in the United States

00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:01.473
within the Jewish
community from liberalism,

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:08.313
in some quarters, let's
say, to Jewish nationalism,

00:47:09.205 --> 00:47:11.860
the special relationship with Israel

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:15.760
and a strong identification with Israel,

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:19.020
support for Israel politically,

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:23.720
special pride associated
with Israel, and so on.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:26.362
And so, of course, all those things,

00:47:26.362 --> 00:47:30.863
all three communities kept
influencing each other,

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:34.890
and so speaking specifically

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:37.370
of the collapse of the
Soviet Union, of course,

00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:39.170
those are not the causes of the collapse

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:40.480
of the Soviet Union,

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.103
but it was an important
element in late Soviet history,

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:51.270
and certainly in the story of Soviet Jews,

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:54.733
that there was Israel that
presented an alternative,

00:47:57.365 --> 00:47:59.610
and helped them form
a new kind of national

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:02.170
and nationalist identity.

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:07.100
And then, of course, the
fact that American Jews

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:12.100
in the 1970s, sorta late
'60s, 1970s, so many of them

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:16.790
were turning from radicalism,
sort of 1960s radicalism,

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:21.790
which in turn was clearly
related to genealogical

00:48:22.017 --> 00:48:27.017
to various forms of socialism
in the 1920s and '30s,

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:32.810
and sort of universal
liberalism, as I said,

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:35.100
to various forms of Jewish nationalism,

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.633
and a part of that, one
consequence of that,

00:48:38.863 --> 00:48:43.767
was the movement to help Jewish emigration

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:47.250
from the Soviet Union.

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:52.150
- So in a way, we can say that
the American Jews realized

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:58.753
best in the long term the Mercurian role.

00:49:01.205 --> 00:49:05.240
They received the most
fruits from the genealogy

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.230
of having that Mercurian role,

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:12.230
whereas in Israel, what
you had was becoming like

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.340
the disciples of Apollo, basically.

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.200
What were the consequences
of those things?

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.440
Does that help us understand, for example,

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:27.672
some of the actions that
Israel has wound up taking?

00:49:27.672 --> 00:49:29.900
That is, the notion that in Israel,

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.510
the Jews were gonna be
like all the other nations,

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.470
but now we're engaged in activities

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:38.300
that are being criticized
by the community of nations.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.270
- Yeah, clearly, the Zionist option

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:45.720
was an explicit rejection of
the Mercurian way of life,

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:49.003
as I call it, of sort of
diaspora Jewish culture.

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:54.320
It was something embarrassing,
something to get away from.

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:58.373
So the idea was to create
a nation of warriors,

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.433
a nation of farmers.

00:50:04.389 --> 00:50:09.260
So it was resolute rejection

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:13.253
of traditional diaspora Jewish life.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.160
As you say, in the
United States, of course,

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.230
the greatest difference was the fact

00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:25.730
that the American state
is not ethnically defined,

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:28.360
that the American nation
is not ethnically defined,

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:33.360
and so Jews could pursue the
things that they were good at

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.650
without being punished, so to speak,

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:40.170
or resented by any group that could claim

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:44.380
the monopoly of politics or could claim

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:46.170
that the state was by right theirs,

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:48.010
the way ethnic Russians could in Russia,

00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:50.164
and the Spanish could in Spain,

00:50:50.164 --> 00:50:54.280
and the Germans could and
certainly did in Germany.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:58.693
So in some ways, the United
States ended up being,

00:51:00.065 --> 00:51:02.060
or the American option ended up being

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.173
the most successful one.

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.853
- One final question,
and the question is this,

00:51:12.498 --> 00:51:13.960
and before you answer it,
I'm gonna read something

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.430
from the preface of your book.

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:18.570
In finding the story of the
Jews in the 20th century,

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:20.450
what did you learn about yourself?

00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:21.730
That's my final question.

00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:25.080
And then I wanna go back to your preface,

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.053
where you write about
your two grandmothers,

00:51:29.185 --> 00:51:30.570
and excuse my pronunciations,

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:34.603
but one of your grandmothers
was Angelina Zhdanovich,

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:37.870
and she had Cossack ancestors

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:40.390
and she lost everything in the revolution,

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:42.757
and you write of her,
"At the end of her life,

00:51:42.757 --> 00:51:46.427
"she was a loyal Soviet
citizen at peace with her past

00:51:46.427 --> 00:51:48.900
"and at home in her country."

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:51.400
And your other grandmother
was Berta Kostrinskaia,

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.230
and she was born in the Pale.

00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:57.100
She emigrated to Argentina.

00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.230
She returned in the 1930s to take part

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:02.270
in the building of socialism.

00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:04.527
And then, quote, you
write, "In her old age,

00:52:04.527 --> 00:52:07.527
"she took great pride
in her Jewish ancestors

00:52:07.527 --> 00:52:11.157
"and considered most of her
life to have been a mistake.

00:52:11.157 --> 00:52:15.320
"This book is dedicated to her memory."

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:19.430
So my question is, in telling
this story about the Jews

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:22.180
in the 20th century, what
did you learn about yourself?

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.450
- Well, I now have a slightly better idea

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:31.690
of what it means to be Jewish

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:36.683
than I did when I first asked
my father about my neighbor.

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:42.460
I also have a slightly
better idea of what it means,

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:47.460
I am more self-reflexive about
what it means to be Russian,

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:52.140
but I learned a lot more
about my grandparents

00:52:53.232 --> 00:52:54.390
than I did really about myself,

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:56.690
although, of course, one
way to learn about ourselves

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:58.740
is to learn about our grandparents,

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.690
and that's partly what history's about.

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:06.610
But I think I at least
try to answer the question

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:10.110
and answered it more or
less to my own satisfaction

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:15.110
of why such grandmothers
raised such grandchildren,

00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:20.740
sort of answered the
question that occurred to me

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:24.800
when I was back in Russia in college.

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:29.800
So that would be the most
important one, I guess.

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.700
- Yuri, on that note, I wanna
thank you for being here.

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.080
Thank you for writing this book

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:38.560
and let me show the book
again, The Jewish Century,

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.173
published by Princeton University.

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:43.970
Thank you again for joining us.

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:45.267
- Thank you.

00:53:45.267 --> 00:53:47.250
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:49.897
for this Conversation with History.
