Speaker 1:          00:00          You do what? You Ping Pong? Hate off of one another. Yeah, unless it's funny. It can be funny sometimes funny. Sometimes he hey, good. Hey, funny. It's just between yourselves. It's like Patrice. Patrice was, it was one of the best, one of the best funny haters. Okay. You okay? You, you bring up a good point. Comedic hate is a different guy. A different kind of hate. Yeah. Communicate Right. [inaudible] in peace. One of the, not one of the, probably the best Patrice. Patrice [inaudible] time. I remember when I would talk and if I was saying something to you would just here now, what would you tell him about? He's like, Ugh, what? What are you talking about? He's like, just the way you talk voice, everything about your voice just makes me want to punch you in the face. We talking about here.

Speaker 2:          01:00          Go after you to, it's kind of made you feel good too. Like if you're a comment specially if you're a comic, like a, I called opie and Anthony once I was talking to them and Anthony. Anthony always has a gun on him. He carries a gun everywhere. Like he has a concealed carry permit and shit. And I said to him, I said, do you ever worry that maybe you're putting out this energy and you're manifesting something like some sort of an attack on you? Yeah. Because you're constantly dwelling on it and you always have this gun and Patrice goes, Joe, believe in

Speaker 1:          01:31          magic. Believe me. Conjuring up to where, hey man, a positive relative just starts laughing at sea. He is mad. And I'm like, when he would go after you mad, it's like you just want to step back and watch. I remember he got bill burrs so mad on time. Oh bill used to get so fucking mad. Beautiful thing about bill burble. We'd be snap it. Bill bill was got to get my bag here. Funny if you went up to him. None of it's funny. You're laughing. Can you build like where's the punchline in it? There's no punchline. He is so fucking mad. We the comedy cellar, the days that we had their man Bill Berber trees on nail, Keith Robinson, Jim Norton, Collin Quinn, myself. Um, when I say we would sit at this table, we sit at this table for four to five hours and it will be nothing but beautiful trash bins to one another.

Speaker 1:          02:34          When I say they used to give me so much shit, that's probably why it's so hard to bother me. Mouth the trashcans that I took from the age 20 to 24 and my young comedic career about how awful I was. I had a joke, I had a joke way at the beginning of my career because at a time, let me preface this, this was way in the beginning of my career was a joke that I had about uh, about a little people midgets at the time and it's, you know, it was so bad. She was, I got robbed by cross side Niche and the joke was I didn't know he was robbing me cause I was with somebody else. So he was looking at my friend but he was robbing me. It was like a play on being crowd was very, very awful joke. I remember telling this joke and a phone book comes flying on the state, put trace through a fucking phone book at me. I'm talking, this is the where the Boston comedy club, people in the crowd, tiny little place. All you heard was, and you sit back, it hits the floor. And I say, Yo, what the fuck was that? And Patrice said, read it is better material in it than what you're saying now.

Speaker 1:          03:57          Crawls does laughing. He's Ugh. They all, they used to trash me so bad. So bad man. Uh, d your legendary Patrice of news story, a corporate trees jerking off at my house before I moved to La. I'm staying in the two bedroom apartment. I had just got there. Patrice was coming out. I said, Yo, you need play Sas. I got two bedrooms. You can come there. It's my ex wife at the time. Uh, you know, I come home, it's like afternoon, like Patrice. I'm like, Yo, you haul but traced, portrays. I go out in the back, open up the door. I said, as big as computer Paul, all I see is his back hunched over like, like, it's like baby oil. Right? And I come in, I'm like, Yo, what you doing? He's like, Yo, get out. Get Out. Get Out. You're jerking off at my house.

Speaker 1:          04:58          He's so sick. He's so fucking sick. Daddy. He didn't stop. He was so concerned with finishing that he didn't even break stride. He didn't turn around. If we nothing you get out. Can you just saw his back hunch? He came out like seven minutes later. It was like my bed. I ain't know you was coming home. Did I fucking Patrice Man, I love him to death. Love him to death. Yeah. He had the most, don't give a fuck of any comic I ever met. 100%. Most 100%. Good and bad though. You know, there was, there was a good to it and there was also some bad to, you know, a lot of things that didn't have been for Patrice probably could have happened, but I think the level of not giving a fuck, uh, prevented some of those days where he was almost two authentic. Yes. Like his like GMC. That was it. Charlie Sheen's

Speaker 2:          05:58          rose who's roast was it that he did where he just torching everybody else that was on the rose window and then he got up there and after he signed he saw the fuckers on my level. Why am I here? What you guys, who the fuck is this man? Who's this bitch? Oh my God. Patrice has so many of those things. Yeah. So many things. One of, one of the best to do it. Uh, if you, if you are listening in, I educated at one Patrice on, yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:24          just I asked did you just watch a elephant in the room?

Speaker 2:          06:29          One of his specialists, some of that, some of the funniest shit ever, man. And so insightful. He was so wide, very business smart. The way people thought and behaved would say shit. Like one of the things that he said that I tell people all the time, it's a, it's a brilliant thing that he said it was, um, I forget what controversy it was, but he was on television with some woman who was saying that you should never tell jokes about certain things, you know, and they were, they were getting mad at someone, I think it was opie and Anthony about a joke and he said, you got to understand that all jokes come from the same place, the ones you like and the ones you don't like, the ones they make you laugh. And the ones that make you mad, they all come from the same place. Someone's just trying to be funny. Yeah. Like sometimes they just don't work.

Speaker 1:          07:10          I, I had a talk, I had a talk with the, the, I forgot her name, I forgot her name, but it was when I was doing all the promo of upside and I kept trying to break down, you know, where, where, where the jokes come from. You know, Kevin, these uh, insensitive jokes that you told back then why? What makes you, why would you even say those things? And the hardest thing for me to explain, I was like, do you think people think of jokes and while thinking of them think that they're not going to be funny? Everything that you think of in a joke form, you're thinking of it because you think you're going to get a laugh behind it. Yeah. The gamble is if I get the lab versus not get the lab, you don't get the laugh. The joke was not funny.

Speaker 1:          08:03          If I get a laugh and I guess I'm on to something, there isn't a bunch of thought that goes into the funny moments that we think may be great bits. Yeah. I wish that I had a more logical answer to put behind it. I said, well, I don't, especially at that time, my career, I just thought it would be funny. The same way that some people thinks are jokes funded offer. It's a thought. Comedians are constantly throwing shit out there. Yeah. You're constantly rolling a dice shit out there. Had the shits. You role and good. Right. It's not going to be good. The other half, maybe all right, may be kind of good, but it's all with the intent of entertaining is not what the intent of being malicious is. Not what the intent of sparking hatred is all trying to make you laugh. Yeah. That's it. Like it's, it's literally that simple from a thought within a comedian's mind. Yeah. Nothing, nothing else. And they kept trying to look for this, like a hard definition of why. And I was like, I don't have it. I don't have the reason why I thought it would be funny. And it wasn't. That's the downfall.
