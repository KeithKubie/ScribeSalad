The correct answer is .

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, of course, you can use other ones,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but--well, really, or

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
are the only ones that are remotely applicable.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And is nice because it will give you like

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
a big box to draw in

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
or to--in our case--paste into.
