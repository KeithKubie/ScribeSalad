00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.440
JIMMY: Hi, I'm Jimmy.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.648
I won't waste too much of
your time by being up here.

00:00:09.648 --> 00:00:12.540
I'm just here to introduce
Brian, host of Techmeme's "Ride

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.190
Home" podcast.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.800
Recently wrote a book called
"How The Internet Happened,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.110
From Netscape to the iPhone."

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.770
Brian's got a history of
working in the tech industry

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.490
and startups.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.050
He'll talk more about that.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.300
But essentially, amassed
a whole lot of knowledge

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.675
about the history
of the internet

00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:31.600
and wrote this book in his own
words, because no one else had.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.480
And will share a lot
of interesting things

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.260
that he learned along
the way with us.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.910
I'll also just note that
there are books for sale,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.040
as usual with these things,
at the subsidized price

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.760
for Googlers.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.900
So feel free to pick
one up on your way out.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.783
And with that, Brian McCullough.

00:00:45.783 --> 00:00:47.755
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.840
BRIAN MCCULLOUGH:
Thank you, Jimmy.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.290
I'm going to stand up here
so I can quote from the book

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.180
once or twice.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.100
Thank you all for coming,
and thanks, Google,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.890
for having me come.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.850
As Jimmy said, I'm actually
not a historian or a writer.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.610
This is my first book.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.030
I'm a three time web founder.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.460
Actually, funny
enough, I've said this

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.630
on many of my podcasts,
my first company

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.340
I founded in '99
I've said many times

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.577
was 100% built on AdWords back
in the day when it was still

00:01:25.577 --> 00:01:26.910
useful and not filled with spam.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.730
But in my memory, the day that
y'all opened it up for the self

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.990
serve thing is the day that
I got on AdWords and, god,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.626
I can remember paying $0.08 a
click for the keyword resume

00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:40.500
and things like that.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.840
It was nutty times.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.870
So the reason that
I did this book,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.910
my second startup was
2002, my third 2005.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.295
It just sort of
bothered me that there's

00:01:53.295 --> 00:01:55.170
excellent books, of
course, about the history

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.690
of the ARPANET and
things like that,

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.810
but the actual internet
going mainstream

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.600
and entering normal people's
lives, no one had done.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.410
And I just got tired of
no one writing that book.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.750
So like any other startup
I've done, I was like, well,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.874
someone's going to do that.

00:02:10.874 --> 00:02:11.570
Why not me?

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.600
It's the dumb startup mentality.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.600
So the reason I give
you that background

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.080
is it's also sort of my career.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.340
It's what I lived.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.669
So I thought it
would be easy to do.

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.210
And so what I want
to do in this talk

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.329
is tell you some
of the fun things

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.870
that I learned in
doing the research.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.480
It was five years of
writing, essentially.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.360
And I did actual
go to the library

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.840
and find defunct magazines
and things like real research.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.470
Also, by the way, and
also, because I'm a web guy

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.605
and I'm used to
instant gratification,

00:02:45.605 --> 00:02:46.980
over the course
of the writing, I

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.357
launched the "Internet
History Podcast,"

00:02:49.357 --> 00:02:50.940
which there's almost
200 episodes now,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.720
which was me doing interviews
for primary sources.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.190
I just had just this
week Ken Norton of GV.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.530
Last month we had Matt Cutts.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.790
I've had Charlie Ayres on.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.430
So there's plenty of Googlers
that have been on the show

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.844
if you want to check that out.

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:10.260
But the reason I give you that
background is, like I said,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.174
I just want to go through
and sort of chronologically

00:03:14.174 --> 00:03:16.590
and tell you some of the things
that even though I thought

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.120
I knew all this stuff
because I lived it

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.240
that were sort of
surprising to me.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.890
What has been
surprising to me as I

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.120
do media hits for this book
is, they almost can't help

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.470
themselves, the first question,
especially on radio, is always,

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.940
I thought Al Gore
invented the internet.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.800
So I have come up,
fortunately it's in the book,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.750
I have a pat answer for that.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.880
In 1992, or actually
1991, there was a bill

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.860
passed called the High
Performance Computing

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.860
Act, which was colloquially
known as the Gore bill.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.620
And it funded a bunch of
supercomputer facilities

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.130
around the country, one of
which was the NCSA, which

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.710
is where the Mosaic web
browser came out of,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.230
which was where Marc Andreessen
was going to school, which

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.600
is where all the Mosaic
kids that would later found

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.270
Netscape all went to school.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.900
And so, as I say in the
book, essentially when

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.860
they were being paid
$6 an hour to code

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.560
in the basement of the NCSA
at the University of Illinois,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.560
they were being paid
by Al Gore's Gore bill.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.770
So it's not exactly apples
to apples, but in a way,

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.730
you could say that that played
a major role in the internet

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.460
going mainstream.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.420
Because as I make the
argument in the book,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.320
Netscape was the first true
dot-com, or web company,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.250
as we would think of it today.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.330
So let's begin there,
actually, because there's

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.650
a million reasons
why I think Netscape

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.670
was the big bang for the modern
era, as I call it in the book.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.520
Not the least of
which is the culture.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.290
When I started
researching, the reason

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.040
I threw it up as a
podcast is I worked my way

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.680
through the entire
Mosaic engineering

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.090
team that went out to
California to found Netscape,

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.420
sans Marc Andreessen, who
even though we talk on Twitter

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.230
refuses to come on the show.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.790
But the thing that
I found fascinating

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.010
was this idea of startup
culture and how a lot of it

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.040
was borne by the media
attention that Netscape

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.680
got when it IPO-ed 1995, which
we'll get to in a second.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.140
To a person, all
of the Mosaic slash

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.700
Netscape engineers,
almost unbidden by me,

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.170
wanted to make the point that
they're like this sort of work

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.950
hard, sleep under your desk,
party hard sort of startup

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.650
culture, they're like
we didn't do that.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.320
The media did that to us.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.620
They really were the
original Mosaic six

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.140
that went out to found Netscape
with Marc Andreessen and Jim

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.950
Clark.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.100
These were literal corn-fed
Midwesterners fresh out

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.840
of college, 22, 23, 24.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.535
And so as Aleks Totic told me in
the book, and I'm quoting him,

00:06:11.535 --> 00:06:12.910
"We were working
around the clock

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.902
because that's what
you use to do before.

00:06:14.902 --> 00:06:17.110
Four years later, five years
later, the entire valley

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.910
would be living
the same lifestyle.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.921
But those people
actually have lives.

00:06:20.921 --> 00:06:23.170
We really didn't have any
lives outside of the office.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.950
So of course, we were going to
be at the office all the time.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.080
I mean, I had no furniture.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.040
Why should I ever go home?"

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.510
And Lou Montulli, who
some of you might know,

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.040
said, "The press
just take what they

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.140
think is interesting,
juicy, and fascinating out

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.056
of their limited time
and they publicize that.

00:06:37.056 --> 00:06:39.102
Especially post
Netscape in '98, '99,

00:06:39.102 --> 00:06:40.810
every startup was
trying to do the things

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.351
that they read about
in the magazines

00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:43.540
that they read about us.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.400
I would catch four or five
hours of sleep at the office,

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.920
wake up, do another 20, go
home, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.720
But I wouldn't recommend doing
that for your average startup.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.360
Unfortunately, a lot
of startup people

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.776
think that that's the way it
should be done because of all

00:06:54.776 --> 00:06:57.730
the publicity that we had."

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.560
Another point that
I make in the book

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:07.030
is that Netscape was the big
bang because the rock star

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.090
entrepreneur universe
that we live in,

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.630
if you were around in the
'80s and the early '90s,

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.070
that wasn't a thing.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.637
Kids grew up to want to be
rock stars and sports heroes,

00:07:19.637 --> 00:07:21.220
and maybe if you
were super ambitious,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.220
you went to Wall Street.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.960
But the idea that you
would start a company,

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.280
that was not in the zeitgeist.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.990
And the fact that Netscape had
this famous IPO in 1995 that

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.880
made, I actually
remember clearly,

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.320
it made the nightly news
and things like that.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.306
The idea that there
was a new company,

00:07:41.306 --> 00:07:43.180
that there was a company
that had been around

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.350
for 18 months that had no
profits that was worth $2

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.040
billion on the day of its IPO.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.610
I've interviewed
Wall Street people.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.460
It blew their minds
at the time too.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.450
So I devote the
entire first chapter

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.450
to telling the Netscape
story because of some

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:05.887
of the things, the groundwork
that it laid for this era

00:08:05.887 --> 00:08:08.470
that we've been living in ever
since, essentially, the last 25

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.750
years.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.880
Back to their sort of work
hard, play hard culture.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.270
The other thing
that Netscape did,

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.630
and this is obvious when
you state it, but think

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.011
of how conceptually
what a leap this was.

00:08:23.011 --> 00:08:27.580
These were the first guys to
have a product where you would

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.230
distribute it on the internet.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.549
Literally before them, you would
still put software in boxes,

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.980
shrink wrap it, and put
it on a shelf, right?

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:41.260
So this concept of doing
versions, that you get feedback

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.520
from your users, and you put
out a dot whatever release,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.470
two weeks later another release.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.460
So one of the reasons,
obviously, that we now

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.900
live in this 24/7
product cycle is

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.790
because they were
the first people

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:02.050
to jump on that sort of
a distribution mechanism

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.500
as a way to do
software products.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:11.230
But also because, like everyone
else at the time, this is 1995,

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.480
they were outracing Bill Gates.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.090
And so another thing that
I was surprised when I did

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:20.440
the research, because again,
most of my career was spent

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.910
in the '00s.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.310
And god bless them,
no offense Microsoft,

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:29.150
but they've been in a sort
of lost decade in the 2000s.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.460
It was a surprising reminder
to me how much everything

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:37.360
in the '90s, what everyone was
doing was in relation to what

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.840
Microsoft might do
or try to stand--

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.540
Googlers have told me on the
"Internet History Podcast" when

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.480
AdWords finally
took off and were

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.750
making butt loads of
money, it was a thing,

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.460
don't tell anybody.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.290
Don't let the word
get out until we're

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:58.300
far enough along that Gates
can't catch us, essentially.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:03.730
So that was surprising to me how
much in the first few chapters

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.870
Microsoft constantly comes up.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:13.360
I go into in depth how Bill
Gates got internet religion.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.055
I talked to a bunch
of Microsoft people.

00:10:15.055 --> 00:10:16.930
It was really very much
a generational thing.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:20.770
It was the guys at Microsoft in
their late 20's and early 30's

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.290
who had used the
internet in college.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.580
Not that Bill Gates hadn't.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.400
In fact, he and Paul
Allen, when they

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.357
were writing their
first software products,

00:10:29.357 --> 00:10:31.940
were using because they were on
opposite sides of the country,

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.640
so they were FTP-ing
back together.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.920
It was more generational
in the sense

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.670
that a guy like
Gates, born in '55,

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.390
baby boomer, as much
as he loved computers,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:47.440
he really didn't
believe that computers

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.600
were mainstream enough.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.700
If you guys remember things
like web TV and stuff

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.920
like that they did.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.878
And if you remember a
term like the information

00:10:53.878 --> 00:10:55.714
superhighway,
which people think,

00:10:55.714 --> 00:10:56.880
well, that was the internet.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.280
No, they had a vision that
they were going to deliver.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.400
Once broadband became
ubiquitous, which Gates figured

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.030
would happen after the year
2000, which he was 100% right,

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.120
then they would deliver
this curated Microsoft,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.080
safe for the masses,
interconnected computing

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.680
product via the TV, because
the TV was the one thing.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.100
It wasn't until 1998
or '99, don't quote me

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:24.270
on that, that
computers penetrated

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.490
50% of US households.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.070
So again, if you're
Bill Gates in '94, '95,

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.180
you're not worried about the
internet, because it's not

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.870
going to ever be mainstream.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.460
It's not good enough,
because it's not broadband.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.560
You can't do movies
and things like that.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.990
The thing that he missed
was that it was good enough.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.030
And people were excited
about it and were

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.330
willing to put up with it
takes two minutes to download

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.000
a JPEG or something like that.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.370
So I want to give credit to
the people like Brad Silverberg

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.880
and Slivka.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.900
I can't remember his first name.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.460
The younger guys that had to do
sort of the generational push

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.100
to the older people
at Microsoft to say,

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.040
this is really happening and
we've got to jump on board.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.620
Another reason that
I did this book is I

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.151
still dabble in a little bit
of angel investing and things

00:12:20.151 --> 00:12:20.650
like that.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:27.180
And when I meet with young
people, young founders, 26, 27,

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.160
and they say, oh, you
remember the dot-com.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.618
You were there for
the dot-com era.

00:12:30.618 --> 00:12:32.210
What was that like?

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.850
When I've done episodes
on AOL, when I get emails

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.110
and tweets saying, thank you.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.660
I've never really understood
what AOL's business model even

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.800
was.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.450
Which I get if the internet's
just always been in the ether.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.150
AOL was always pejoratively
called the training wheels

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.470
for the internet.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:57.090
But I argue in the book that
was incredibly valuable.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.310
Somebody needed to be
the training wheels.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.250
This book is very much about
how the internet went mainstream

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.070
to people like our parents.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.210
And many, many Americans,
at some point something

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.060
like 70% of all internet
traffic in the US

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.820
was going through AOL's pipes.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.780
So many people got their first
taste of not only the web

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.980
and the internet but computing
and living online, learning

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:27.000
what it means to have an online
persona and a screen name.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.670
And that can mean going
into the chat rooms

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.890
and talking sexy chat
and stuff like that.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.880
But also finding
those little areas

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.250
of the internet where
your interests are,

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.840
where your people are.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:46.030
So I spent a long time talking
about AOL, giving them credit.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:51.659
I interviewed Jan Brandt, who
was the marketing guru behind--

00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:53.700
if you were alive then,
there was a time when you

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.310
couldn't open a magazine,
you couldn't-- they put them

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.502
on sports stadiums.

00:13:57.502 --> 00:13:58.710
They put him in Omaha Steaks.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:03.930
You couldn't go anywhere
without getting a free AOL disk.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.470
Originally disks and
eventually CD-ROMs.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:14.490
Her brilliant insight was,
again, this is '95, '96,

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.090
computers are only in
30%, 40% of households.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.939
She had the choice
of this is a product

00:14:19.939 --> 00:14:21.480
that no one understands,
and either I

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.580
have to spend all
of my marketing time

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.190
educating people on what
it means to go online

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.690
and what you can do and why
you would even want to do it.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.445
She told me that
they would have--

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.479
what do you call it?

00:14:34.479 --> 00:14:36.770
They're behind the mirror
and they're having consumers.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.830
Right, focus groups
and things like that.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.341
And people would sit in front
of a computer, take the mouse,

00:14:41.341 --> 00:14:42.840
and put it on the
floor because they

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.790
think it's like a sewing machine
pedal and things like that.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.330
So her insight is forget that.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.850
I just need them to try it.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:51.810
That's it.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:56.040
So if I can just get these
disks so that they're

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.680
collecting in corners like
tumbleweeds, if I can just

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.882
get somebody to put this
in their computer one time,

00:15:01.882 --> 00:15:03.090
I don't have to educate them.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.660
They'll figure out
what is useful to them

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.730
about this product.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.400
So it's gone down in history as
one of the greatest marketing

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.290
campaigns of all time.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.790
When she started
that campaign, I

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.970
think AOL had less than
400,000 subscribers.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.760
Obviously, at its height
it had 30 million.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.610
So all credit to Jan Brandt.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.790
I also give a lot
of credit to Yahoo!

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.320
for being what I call the
first great web company,

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.070
the first great company
that couldn't have

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.919
existed without the internet.

00:15:33.919 --> 00:15:36.210
Because you can argue that
Netscape with a web browser,

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:38.230
that's still a software product.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.630
But Yahoo! even though it wasn't
technically a search engine,

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.570
it was a human
curated directory,

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.820
but they essentially did
search for most people

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:48.958
at the very beginning.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.840
I look at Amazon.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.840
The thing that I found
fascinating about Amazon

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:04.150
is that so many of the stories
that I'm telling in this book

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.360
are about the leaders
that go first,

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.220
get all the arrows
in their back,

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.657
and then someone
comes to behind them.

00:16:11.657 --> 00:16:13.990
First there were Six Degrees,
then there was Friendster,

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:18.370
then there was Myspace, and
then Facebook, blah, blah, blah.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:23.560
The only major example that
I can think of any category

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.060
in the modern tech era where
the major leader that came out

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:33.290
first is still the undisputed
800 pound gorilla in its space.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.770
And obviously Amazon
was not the first people

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.090
to do e-commerce online.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.520
They weren't even the first
people to sell books online.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.360
But the fact that they
were the first people

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.680
to popularize e-commerce
and that they're still

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.910
the ones that are
killing it today,

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.870
that's the thing
that's the most amazing

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.020
if you look at it from
a certain perspective.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:59.560
And again, I mentioned
I went to the library

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.290
to look up old issues of
"Forbes" and "Fortune"

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.230
but also things like "Industry
Standard" and magazines

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.690
that haven't existed
for 20 years.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:11.740
It was amazing to me how late
you would still get articles

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.020
about, are we ever going
to be able to convince

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.515
consumers to buy online?

00:17:15.515 --> 00:17:17.890
Are we ever going to be able
to convince consumers to put

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.420
their credit cards online?

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.599
I'm talking about as
late as Christmas of '98.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:26.869
Christmas of '99 was really kind
of thought of as this, well,

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:32.200
this is finally when Americans
have accepted e-commerce

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.730
in a major way.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.680
Which we'll get to the
dot-com companies in a second.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.460
But before I get there, I
want to spare a word for eBay,

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.050
because eBay was
another company.

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:45.670
We don't think of
eBay, again, god

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.930
bless them, as a major
player in tech today.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.390
But think of three
major things that

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:56.580
eBay did where I can't
imagine the world if they

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.830
hadn't pioneered these things.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.960
Number one, they taught
Americans to trust strangers.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.307
And like I just said,
people were like,

00:18:04.307 --> 00:18:06.640
are we ever going to convince
people to put their credit

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.240
cards online?

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.300
Are we ever going to convince
them that they can buy and sell

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.700
from a company?

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.890
Well, eBay convinced people
you could buy and sell

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.740
from somebody in South Dakota
that you would never meet,

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.840
never even know
their name, and you

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.600
could expect a reasonable
chance that you

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.870
could do a successful
transaction with them.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.940
And because eBay had that--

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.560
anybody has a hobby.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.100
Everyone has some sort of
hobby that eBay could serve.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.050
So eBay, again, like AOL, was
a lot of normal people's entry

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:43.960
onto not just surfing web sites
but being active on the web.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.920
So that's number one.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.420
Number two, how were
they able to do this?

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.120
That five star rating system.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:58.570
eBay invented the idea of
online reputation systems

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.007
that things like
Uber, Airbnb, Yelp,

00:19:01.007 --> 00:19:02.090
all these sorts of things.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:06.340
We live in the tyranny of
the five star rating now.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.400
And there are good and
very bad things about that.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.950
And it was never perfect
even when they created it.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.080
But the fact that they created
the system that allowed people

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:22.270
to have a reasonable level
of trust of strangers,

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.564
that your reputation
followed you around,

00:19:24.564 --> 00:19:26.230
that was one of the
reasons why eBay won

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:28.600
is because once you invested,
it's the network effect,

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.390
once you invest if
you're a buyer or seller

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.460
and have a good
reputation on eBay.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.340
Amazon, Yahoo, tons
of people came at them

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.140
in the auction market.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.530
But so many people
had invested so much

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.050
in building this reputation
on eBay that they weren't

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.490
going to go anywhere else.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.290
And then the third
thing would be--

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:53.520
I'm blanking on it right now.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.220
Reputation.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.646
Oh.

00:19:56.646 --> 00:19:58.270
And this is dead
obvious when I say it.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:01.300
But again, put
yourself back in 1998.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.190
They didn't own anything.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.130
They didn't even take
possession of the goods.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:10.390
So now when we think of any
platform business, especially

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:15.260
social media, all of the value
is in what the users are doing.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.500
There's a story
that's in the book

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:21.070
that newspaper chains came
to kick the tires at eBay

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:22.340
at some point.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.450
Which, for whatever anyone
says, the newspaper industry

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:26.990
was not stupid.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.280
They could see that their
cash cow of classified ads

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.690
was at risk via the internet.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.290
So all the chains came and
wanted to either partner

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.600
with eBay or buy them out.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.100
And one of the
newspaper executives

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.190
takes Pierre and
Jeff Skoll aside

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.677
and he says, they really
want to do this deal,

00:20:47.677 --> 00:20:49.260
but they know that
there's no way they

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.600
can sell it to the
C-suite because you

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.310
don't have any factories.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.420
You don't have any trucks.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.800
So the C-suite is going to
be like, what are we buying?

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.610
Despite the fact that our sales
are going up 1,000% a month

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.720
or whatever it was at the time.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.390
So that's the third one.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:10.350
This idea that you can
build a business that

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:14.670
has no tangible assets
other than your users

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.040
and whatever activity
they do on your platform.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.120
So eBay deserves more credit
for being a pioneer that's

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.470
created our modern world.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.770
I fought hard to
keep a lot of stuff

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.910
about the dot-com bubble in the
book, because not only is it

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:36.930
just friggin'
fascinating, but I think

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.780
coming from the
tech industry, it's

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.195
sort of like I say in the book.

00:21:41.195 --> 00:21:43.320
My grandparents lived
through the Great Depression.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.807
So any time anything
got too good,

00:21:45.807 --> 00:21:47.640
they were always convinced
that a depression

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.990
was around the corner.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.630
And I feel like in
tech, anytime all

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:55.342
of a sudden there's a big
IPO or VC investing goes up

00:21:55.342 --> 00:21:57.300
by whatever, whatever,
everyone's like, there's

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.870
another bubble, there's another
bubble, there's another bubble.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:06.670
I did a ton of research, and
I hope if you read the book.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:09.600
The dot-com bubble, for a
lot of structural reasons,

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.470
is something that we're not
likely to ever see again.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.020
It came at the end of the
longest bull market in history.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.710
The baby boomers were in their
peak retirement savings years.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.426
There was a ton of money
that had to go somewhere.

00:22:22.426 --> 00:22:24.300
The journalist Maggie
Mahar says in the book,

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.967
if the dot-com companies
hadn't come along,

00:22:27.967 --> 00:22:29.550
someone would have
had to invent them,

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:34.470
because Wall Street needed
to invest in something.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:35.970
I mean, there's
always going to be

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:40.900
bubbles in any new industry or
new tech and things like that.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:47.610
But this idea that
in '98, '99, CNBC

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:51.846
was on every TV and
everybody was invested.

00:22:51.846 --> 00:22:55.320
Among the million
fantastic stories,

00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:01.752
the idea that K-tel, who
marketed those top 40

00:23:01.752 --> 00:23:02.460
hits or whatever.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:06.480
It was a music
label, essentially

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.946
in late '98 or early '99.

00:23:08.946 --> 00:23:10.320
All they did was
send out a press

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.960
release that said that they
were going to create a website.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:18.210
And in 24 hours, the stock
went from like $4 to 32.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.720
There's so many stories
like that in this book.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:27.420
Pixelon was a company that
raised $20 million in VC

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.470
and blew all of it on their
launch party in Las Vegas.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:32.430
They had The Who play.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.770
They had the Dixie Chicks play.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:38.804
It turned out that actually the
founder was a legit scammer.

00:23:38.804 --> 00:23:39.720
He was under an alias.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.920
The FBI eventually came and
arrested him, blah, blah, blah.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.850
But as I also point
out in the book,

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.707
it was this weird time where--

00:23:50.707 --> 00:23:52.290
I actually don't
have the page, so I'm

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:54.164
going to try to do this
somewhat from memory.

00:23:54.164 --> 00:24:00.180
But in I think it
was January of '98,

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:05.910
if you invested $1,000 in
Amazon and $1,000 and Yahoo!

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.700
by the end of '98,
that $2,000 investment

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.420
would be worth
something like $78,000.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.150
Now, these are not tiny stocks
that no one had ever heard of.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:19.150
These are companies that are
on CNBC every day or whatever.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.170
So there's this time
period where you can just

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:26.010
pick any company, and if you
get in at the right time,

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:29.550
you can 30x, 100x.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.900
Some of the best--

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.930
the best investment
of the time was eBay.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:38.310
If you invested in
eBay's IPO, I think

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:41.010
you did something like 10,000%.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.350
And by the way, eBay
went down a little bit

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.030
after the bubble
burst, but it actually

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.640
continued to go up
after the bubble.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.050
So if you want to go
back in a time machine

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:53.670
and do your best dot-com era
investment, it's eBay again.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:59.190
The dot-com bubble
is funny in the sense

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:06.690
that it was obviously
the greater fools thing.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.182
Everyone knew it was a bubble.

00:25:08.182 --> 00:25:10.140
You're just trying to
ride it as far as you can

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:14.700
and hopefully get out before
the people behind you get out.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.150
And towards the
end, you just had

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.970
to have a pulse and a business
plan written on a napkin.

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:24.090
Again, there's a story in
here about one of the VC firms

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:27.030
where they shared their
numbers and in '96, they

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.390
would get 400
business plans a year.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.610
By '98, it's 2,000.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:36.990
By 2000, it's something
like 15,000 business plans.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:38.670
And there's a quote
in there from one

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.190
of the entrepreneurs that
says, yeah, you just showed up

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:43.530
and you just said you
were an internet company

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.820
and they would just
hand you money.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.680
So there was a lot of garbage.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.220
And that's the reason
why the bubble burst.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.540
However, and I'm not the first
person to point this out,

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:59.190
how many of the ideas that were
crazy in the dot-com bubble

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.600
have come true today?

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.580
One of the most famous
ones was Webvan,

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.560
which is grocery delivery.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.090
Go down the list from Instacart
to Amazon to whatever.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:13.200
We all remember pets.com
because of the sock puppet.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.710
But they were also famous for--

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:20.760
famously dog food
is a 40 pound bag.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.340
They were doing free shipping.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.500
Again, the statistics
are there in the book.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:30.360
But they were essentially
losing not only money

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.910
on every order they shipped.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:37.151
They were losing $2 for
every dollar they brought in.

00:26:37.151 --> 00:26:39.150
But again, that's something
that has been fixed.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:42.146
You can go buy dog
food online now,

00:26:42.146 --> 00:26:43.770
and people have
figured this stuff out.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.720
The logistics have
gotten better.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.450
Myspace.com was a
company that IPO-ed.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.340
It's not the Myspace
you're thinking of.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.632
It was literally you would
put a widget on your desktop

00:26:52.632 --> 00:26:54.006
and you could put
files in there.

00:26:54.006 --> 00:26:54.900
It was cloud storage.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:02.730
There's tons of examples of
this that it was just too soon.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.830
The infrastructure wasn't there.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.940
But they're good ideas.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.940
And so that's one
of the reasons why

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.580
I think doing a book
like this is valuable.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.391
Everybody in tech wants someone
to come up and tell them, well,

00:27:14.391 --> 00:27:15.390
where are we going next?

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:16.752
What's next?

00:27:16.752 --> 00:27:19.860
How much can you
learn by looking back

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.789
at the things that
were either dumb ideas

00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:24.330
and are always going
to be dumb ideas

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.000
and learn that
lesson or that were

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.100
a dumb idea in a different time
but didn't work for reasons

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.240
that now would work?

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.740
And one of the things about
the dot-com bubble, that we'll

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.880
talk about Google
here in a second,

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.070
that the people that came after
the bubble took advantage of

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:46.050
was they laid this entire
infrastructure of fiber.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.300
There was a bubble
that no one remembers

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.190
concurrent with
the dot-com bubble.

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.740
Things like Global Crossing
and Enron and all this stuff.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.770
They laid all of this
fiber all around the world

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:59.280
so that when Google
comes along and there's

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.940
90% unused fiber
around the world,

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.180
Google is able to pick
it up on the cheap.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.790
So the dot-com bubble
has to be remembered

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.750
as A, the lessons of the
ideas that were too soon

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.280
but maybe can work later.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.230
But then also the
infrastructure that

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:19.860
created the circumstances
that allowed

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.880
the resurrection and
Web 2.0 that Google

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.100
was very much a part of.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.920
We debated how much I
should talk about Google

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.040
at Google, because I don't
know how much you guys know

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:32.610
about Google.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.370
There's actually the
better part of two chapters

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.200
about the Google story.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.580
Cute stuff about
Larry and Sergey

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.440
meeting each other in
college, which you probably

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.130
have heard these stories.

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.838
And they didn't like
each other at first,

00:28:45.838 --> 00:28:48.220
because they're both the
smartest guys in the room.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.520
And so there was a little bit of
friction, like the frisson of,

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.230
well, I'm going to
one up this guy.

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:55.650
I'm going to one
up, one up, one up.

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.750
You probably know
some of that stuff.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.860
The thing that I
liked to focus on

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:05.250
was, obviously, fixing search.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.670
How would the web
and the internet

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.930
function had they not done that?

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.990
That's Google's
miracle number one.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:14.940
Google's business
miracle number two

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.640
is obviously AdWords,
AdSense, creating

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.150
the greatest advertising
engine devised by man.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.820
But y'all didn't invent that.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:28.470
A company called goto.com did.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:33.870
And GoTo was a bubble
era company, came out

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:37.230
of an incubator, and
it was a straight pay

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.200
for position search engine.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.950
Actually got a lot of success.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.950
It went on to power
the paid search

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:50.124
for Yahoo! and AOL and
others as Overture.

00:29:50.124 --> 00:29:51.540
They changed the
name to Overture.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.867
And again, I actually
used GoTo at the time

00:29:53.867 --> 00:29:54.950
before AdWords came along.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:56.480
But why did I switch to AdWords?

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.390
Because like Google
tends to do, even

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:03.480
if they don't think
of the idea first,

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.260
Googlers tend to think they
can always do it better.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:11.360
And they did, because instead
of a straight pay for position,

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:15.980
when AdWords launches,
it has the quality scores

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.250
and things like that.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:20.360
So as I point out
in the book, there's

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.180
almost no example of
this that I can think

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.520
of in even any other industry.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.320
It was a win-win-win
for everybody,

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:31.730
because they did the
testing and the users

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:35.390
actually preferred the ads
because of the quality score.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:37.130
They were useful.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.380
You do the AB testing
and you put the ads there

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.010
and there's actually people are
happier and do more clicking.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.980
Advertisers like
me at the time are

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.620
paying less, because if
my ad is more relevant,

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:52.070
it goes to the top, but I'm
still paying what I'm bidding.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:55.550
And Google's happier
because, again,

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:58.520
even if someone's
willing to pay $1 a click

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:03.440
and I'm only willing to pay
a nickel a click but over 100

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.140
searches I get
clicked on 21 times

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.530
and that dollar bid only
gets clicked on once,

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.070
Google makes more money.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:12.950
Win-win-win.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:16.850
It's a miraculous market.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.610
That's the second miracle
that I give Google credit for.

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:27.470
Another company or
story that I thought

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:30.200
I knew that then actually
doing it I realized what

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.720
the real story was was Napster.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.760
So if you remember Napster,
you think music piracy, a bunch

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.720
of college kids that just--

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.740
broadband is
becoming ubiquitous.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.590
And so this is the
first time that media

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:50.070
has to deal with
piracy in a major way.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.610
I talked to a bunch
of the Napster guys.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.956
And it's so funny.

00:31:54.956 --> 00:31:57.690
And most of them to this
day still cling to this.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:01.970
And if you read their
quotes, they were right.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:04.400
They said at the time,
they say to this day,

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.760
we knew this was the
better distribution method.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.160
That again, why do you
put something in a box,

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.220
shrink wrap it, and
put it on a shelf?

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.090
And they were talking
about things like Spotify,

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:20.480
like Netflix for a
slightly different model.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.500
In 1999, Sean Parker is on
MTV talking about, well,

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.010
we think it'll be
a subscription,

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:26.810
you're going to
be able to get it

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:28.904
on your phone or your
computer or whatever

00:32:28.904 --> 00:32:30.070
the device of the future is.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.355
He has a quote.

00:32:32.355 --> 00:32:33.480
They were right about that.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:38.690
But what I realized that the
true story of Napster was is

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:43.520
we live now in a world of
unlimited selection and instant

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.730
gratification.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:48.957
If I tell you about a song, a
movie, a book, a TV show, hey,

00:32:48.957 --> 00:32:50.540
this is cool, you
should check it out,

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:56.240
you expect that in 10
seconds, you can try it out.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.140
Unlimited selection,
instant gratification.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:02.060
They were screaming
this in 1999, 2000.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.750
This is what the consumer wants.

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:08.900
And actually, if you give it
to them, they'll pay for it.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.370
And it's true.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.110
What does Spotify have?

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:15.980
I think it's approaching 90
million paying subscribers now.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:20.090
Netflix is approaching
200 or 250 million

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:24.230
paying subscribers worldwide.

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:27.890
The unlimited selection
part of that equation,

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:31.040
instant gratification is
probably what makes people pay.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.950
But I don't think
that we appreciate

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.730
the unlimited
selection part of that.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.070
I remember the first time
I came to New York in 1998.

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:42.070
The thing that I wanted
to do more than anything

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:43.490
was go to Tower
Records, because I

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.950
knew that they would have
CDs that I couldn't get back

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.630
in Florida.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:50.690
And you can talk about
the good and the bad

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:55.730
of that, of the idea of
discovery and serendipity

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.310
is maybe lost when you
can get anything you

00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:59.540
want as soon as you want it.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:04.130
But I think that
Napster deserves

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.490
to be thought of not
just as a story of piracy

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:12.500
but as essentially laying
the template for media

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.010
in the digital age, even
though they didn't get there

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.560
because of Sean Parker's
unfortunate emails that

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.900
got brought up in
discovery in the trial.

00:34:25.171 --> 00:34:25.670
Let's see.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:29.550
For the purposes of time, what
else do I want to talk about?

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:32.870
The Web 2.0 era, to bring
Google back into this,

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:35.489
because again, I was there
and I was doing companies

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:35.989
at the time.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:46.020
It's sort of like you have to
be in a zeitgeist to just know.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:50.219
In 2004, 2005, you
could feel that there

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:51.780
was stuff happening again.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:55.170
Google's IPO was a
big part of that.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.782
I'll never forget people
just being like, when we all

00:34:57.782 --> 00:35:00.240
found out that Google was making
the amount of money it was

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.640
making, it was like, holy S.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:08.010
Because y'all really did
make the internet make money

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.550
at scale for the first time.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.440
No one had.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.740
This is at a time in 2003
when Amazon's a $5 stock

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:17.340
and people are thinking
they might go under.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.920
Basically no one
in the Web 2.0 era

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.087
had proven that they
could make money.

00:35:23.087 --> 00:35:23.680
Yahoo!

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.560
AOL, they all kind
of rode the bubble,

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.890
but they weren't
sustainable businesses.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:32.200
So your guys's IPO in 2004
is a big part of that.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:36.660
But then I remember Flickr
for the first time, Delicious,

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.680
and reading "Tech Crunch."

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.110
When "Tech Crunch"
first came out,

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:45.120
you would read it every
day not because they

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.260
were doing these journalistic
stories about the tech

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.740
industry, but because
Mike was just posting

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.382
new startups every single day.

00:35:54.382 --> 00:35:56.340
And you would literally
email Mike and be like,

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.923
hey, Mike, I'm doing this, and
he would write a post about it.

00:35:58.923 --> 00:36:01.980
It was just this
weirdly magical time

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.430
when you would read a blog post
and find out about something

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.860
like Flickr and then
dig a little deeper

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.880
and then find out about things
like taxonomy and tagging.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:17.010
And it was this 1,000 flowers
blooming sort of period where,

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.490
which I want to point out, and
I said this last week on a radio

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:23.950
thing, why did that happen?

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:28.950
We kind of have to credit the
Microsoft antitrust trial.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:30.870
Why was Google able to flourish?

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:33.787
Why did Amazon not
swoop in and buy--

00:36:33.787 --> 00:36:35.370
why did Microsoft
not swoop in and buy

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:37.530
Amazon in 1998 or whatever?

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:40.390
Why were all these
companies like Google,

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.960
like Facebook, like name any.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.250
Because there was not
this rapacious 800 pound

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:50.160
gorilla that is willing
to come in and cherry

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:55.230
pick all of the most
promising crop of startups.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.940
I'm not here to
talk about things

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.460
like regulating tech and
antitrust and things like that.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:04.890
But the '00s are an entire
decade where companies can come

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:08.610
up and there's not this
oligopoly at the top

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.580
that's going to sharecrop
everybody off and Borg-like

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.500
absorb them.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.270
And there was this
whole flowering

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:16.860
of all of the companies
that we're now

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.330
very familiar with today.

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:20.790
So something to think about.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.370
That if you have
a period of time

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:27.930
where you're allowing companies
to innovate and to find

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:31.740
their product market fit without
being absorbed by the Borg

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:36.630
right away, a lot of
good things can happen.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.480
The Facebook chapter.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:45.270
I essentially wanted to sort
of write the anti movie,

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:47.140
because everybody
knows the movie.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.650
And while the movie
was not inaccurate,

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:54.360
there's obviously some
Sorkin-ing going on there

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.310
and changes made for
entertainment value.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:02.880
I kind of focused
more on this idea

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.100
of this modern
startup, a startup

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.450
like we think of it today.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.300
A kid in a dorm room
has a great idea.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:13.140
Again, in the wake of
the bubble bursting,

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.540
I think it was the
Digg guys or something,

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.750
there's a quote in there
about how I think digg.com,

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:23.220
if you remember that,
they launched for $10,000.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.560
And within six months,
they're getting more traffic

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.030
than "The New York Times."

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:30.540
It's because, again, the
infrastructure had been laid.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.310
We now have things--

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.080
if you start a
startup now, there's

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.717
all these open source tools
you just pull off the shelf.

00:38:36.717 --> 00:38:38.550
Google had the advantage
of after the bubble

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:40.690
burst, everybody's out of work.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.260
So Google is the only game
in town for picking off

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.240
the best talent.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:51.540
But in the Facebook story,
I more wanted to tell--

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:55.890
because it's fascinating, and
there's a lot of Sean Parker

00:38:55.890 --> 00:39:00.030
quotes that illustrate
this, how much it was a lark

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.430
and for how long it was a lark.

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.860
Even after they go
out to California,

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:08.970
even after they don't
go back to Harvard,

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:11.310
Zuckerberg wanted
to do a thing called

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:15.400
Wirehog, which was like a
Napster 2.0 sort of thing.

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.460
And again, this is from
Sean Parker speaking,

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.030
so take this with
a grain of salt.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.720
But he essentially has
to take Zuckerberg aside

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.070
and say, forget Napster.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.653
I know that was the
coolest thing that

00:39:24.653 --> 00:39:27.310
ever happened when you were 19,
but you've got something here.

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:28.060
This is the thing.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.730
Facebook is the thing.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:33.300
So I was fascinated
by how much--

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.660
and there's the famous stories
about showing up to VC meetings

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.120
in pajamas and I'm
the CEO, bitch.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:44.460
How much it was kids playing
adult for how long it was.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.440
Insert your thoughts
about what that

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.600
did to the culture
of the company here.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:52.950
But I'm also fascinated
by, famously,

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:57.810
another Harvard
dropout was Bill Gates.

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:00.614
And Bill Gates is a
genius in a lot of ways.

00:40:00.614 --> 00:40:02.280
But the argument that
I make in the book

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.640
is the interesting entrepreneurs
are the entrepreneurs that were

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.040
not born to be entrepreneurs.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.060
But they stumble on
an idea that's genius

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:15.480
and then they make themselves
into the person that

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.260
can bring that idea to life.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.200
I think that Bill Gates
was a person like that.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.240
If you read
biographies of Gates,

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.740
he was an enfant terrible
of the tech industry.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.925
Stories of strippers and
things like that back

00:40:30.925 --> 00:40:32.550
in the early '80s
and things like that.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:37.230
He evolved into a person
that could create the most

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:40.860
valuable company in the world.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:45.540
The Facebook story is a lot
about Zuckerberg turning down

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.300
$1 billion from Yahoo!

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.800
Viacom wants to come in.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.020
They want to turn it into MTV.

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.360
When Myspace gets
bought for $700 million,

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.930
everyone's like, wow, maybe
that's the price we should.

00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:01.470
So what I was interested
in in the Facebook story

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:04.890
was that evolution of Zuckerberg
and the evolution of the idea

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:08.340
into believing that
this is a product.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.670
What other product,
before Facebook,

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:15.540
was your potential addressable
market every human being

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.130
on the planet?

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:18.150
Maybe Coca Cola.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.830
I think that realizing
that and then

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:27.150
being able to execute on that
is the thing that fascinates me

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:30.210
about the Facebook
and Zuckerberg story.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:33.900
To wind up here, and
again to come back

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:37.800
to the notion of too
soon, I do tell the story

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.890
of the proto social companies.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:43.830
Six Degrees was founded in 1997.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:46.480
And it's essentially a social
network as we know it today.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.350
Want to know one of the
reasons why it didn't work?

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:51.790
There weren't digital cameras.

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:53.200
There's a quote
in here about how

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.450
they're having board meetings.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.420
And how can we convince people
to get photos and print them

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:59.820
out and then fax
them to us so that we

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.460
can have profile pictures?

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:05.149
When you think of an idea,
why does an idea not work?

00:42:05.149 --> 00:42:05.940
Why is it too soon?

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.281
Because the technology wasn't
ubiquitous to have profile

00:42:09.281 --> 00:42:09.780
pictures.

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.550
Friendster didn't work
because, famously, they

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:18.249
didn't engineer it well enough.

00:42:18.249 --> 00:42:20.040
I had him on the podcast
and he'll straight

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.290
up admit that, yeah.

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:26.910
The ability to engineer
something at that scale,

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:29.670
again, people like
Google and Facebook

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:34.080
deserve credit for putting
that sort of stuff together.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.420
And then why did
Facebook beat Myspace?

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.360
I go into that as well.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.669
I go into forever I can
remember hearing that mobile is

00:42:43.669 --> 00:42:44.960
going to be the next big thing.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.080
You're going to get the
internet on your phone.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.775
And I, like everyone
else, was like, well, why?

00:42:49.775 --> 00:42:51.150
If I want to get
on the internet,

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:53.760
I'll sit down and do it.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.670
So Palm and then
Newton and BlackBerry.

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.790
I tell those stories.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:02.370
And I'm going to end with
this like I end with the book.

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:07.560
What I realized in writing
the conclusion of the book,

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.490
because I knew I wanted
to end with the iPhone

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:13.680
and with Steve making
that demo on stage.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.139
And it's three things.

00:43:15.139 --> 00:43:15.930
Are you getting it?

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.200
It's not this, this, this.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.010
It's one device.

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:25.650
I think that the reason
that mobile didn't take off

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:30.360
for so many years when you could
have had a phone that would get

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.890
you the internet in
2000, 2002, for all

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:38.884
the various reasons, Wi-Fi,
4G, broadband wasn't built out.

00:43:38.884 --> 00:43:40.050
All these different reasons.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:42.660
The real reason is
because there wasn't

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:45.300
anything for normal
people to do with it.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.320
The iPhone comes out in 2007.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:53.580
Six months later, Facebook
opens registration to everybody.

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:57.300
When the app store
is launched in 2008,

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.930
one of the first 20
partner apps is Facebook.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:05.680
So mobile didn't take
off because there

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.910
wasn't anything for normal
people to do with it.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:09.285
And then all of
a sudden, there's

00:44:09.285 --> 00:44:11.620
this one device that is
not only the perfect device

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:16.630
for consumption of social stuff.

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:20.390
It's the perfect tool for
creating social content.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:26.080
So maybe you had to have
Facebook go mainstream

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.480
for the iPhone and
smartphones to go

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.820
mainstream and vise versa.

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:35.530
Because would my mom
care about Facebook

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:38.740
if she couldn't pick up her
phone and check it 30 times

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:39.770
a day?

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:43.280
And she couldn't take pictures
and share stuff herself.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:47.200
So I think, getting to
this theme of too soon

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.070
or having the perfect
timing, I think

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:55.090
that the reason that the modern
world is mobile and social

00:44:55.090 --> 00:45:00.820
today is because the
iPhone and Facebook opening

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.820
registration happened within
18 months of each other

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.490
and the two complemented
each other perfectly.

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:10.280
And that's the modern
world we now live in.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.340
And I think I'm right on time.

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:14.020
So if anybody has
questions, I'd be

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.360
happy to take questions
for a few minutes.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:22.994 --> 00:45:23.660
Thank you, guys.

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:28.490
Don't be shy.

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:33.710
AUDIENCE: Hi, and
thanks for coming.

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:35.420
Do you have any
examples of things

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.540
you discovered researching that
the world wasn't ready for yet

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.970
but that you think the world
now is ready for that we

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:43.940
don't have yet?

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:48.529
BRIAN MCCULLOUGH: Isn't
it funny VR and AR?

00:45:48.529 --> 00:45:50.570
This is not really going
to answer your question.

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:54.860
But I remember in the '90s
that VR was the next big thing.

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:56.554
And Jaron and everybody.

00:45:56.554 --> 00:45:58.220
Some of the same
people were telling you

00:45:58.220 --> 00:45:59.761
that that are telling
you that today.

00:46:03.704 --> 00:46:05.690
Maybe I'm thinking
of this as my answer

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:07.850
because I was just talking
about the mobile stuff.

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:13.250
It's like, when are we going to
get what I just said is people

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:17.900
sometimes call it a killer app,
but for things like VR and AR.

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:22.160
We're not just it's the
VisiCalc for PCs or whatever.

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.800
But it's the thing that's
it's like, oh yeah, that's

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.690
why I would buy this device.

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:30.110
So in a way, I'm
answering your question

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:34.370
by saying, isn't that where
we are now for VR and AR?

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:36.900
Except it's just not happening.

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:40.250
And I'm not a skeptic
or a pessimist on this.

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:44.910
I'm actually genuinely,
at this point, confused.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:49.905
But something that is
the right time for now?

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.040
All of the dot-com
companies, like I said,

00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:02.037
have basically
borne fruit in 2.0.

00:47:02.037 --> 00:47:02.620
You know what?

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:04.480
I don't have a good
answer for that one.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.320
AUDIENCE: That's OK.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.520
If there was great answer,
someone would probably

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.990
have done it already.

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:09.730
BRIAN MCCULLOUGH: No, no, no.

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:10.720
AUDIENCE: No, that's
not how that works?

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.595
BRIAN MCCULLOUGH: No.

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:13.630
And when you think--

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.850
the famous story
about Google is who

00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:17.261
needed another search engine?

00:47:17.261 --> 00:47:19.510
There was Altavista, there
was Yahoo! there was Excite

00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:21.910
or whatever.

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:23.440
That was the
dumbest startup idea

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.530
in the world except for one
little thing is that it worked.

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:28.330
So even if the
market is saturated,

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:31.030
even if everyone's like, well,
we've tried that 1,000 times

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:32.300
and it doesn't work.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.750
But if yours does,
then it doesn't matter.

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:36.841
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:36.841 --> 00:47:37.340
Thanks.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.298
BRIAN MCCULLOUGH: Yeah.

00:47:45.047 --> 00:47:46.380
You can line up too if you want.

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:52.080
AUDIENCE: So one thing
about the internet

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:56.130
was that until fairly recently,
the majority of the world

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:57.790
was still not using it.

00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:01.350
And so you could come up
with this crazy new idea

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:04.470
and there was all
this room for growth.

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:06.180
But we're slowly
getting to the point

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:09.990
where we're hitting
that saturation.

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:11.720
The growth of the
internet is starting

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:15.210
to slow down in terms of
penetration worldwide.

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:17.610
Do you think that once
we get to the point

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:24.540
where most people who can afford
to have any kind of connection

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:28.530
have one that there's
still going to be room

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:30.180
to have these crazy new ideas?

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:33.600
Or will we end up in the sort
of mature internet market

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.184
where it's like
everything else again?

00:48:35.184 --> 00:48:36.766
BRIAN MCCULLOUGH: I
would argue you're

00:48:36.766 --> 00:48:38.190
going to get better companies.

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:42.240
Because what you're describing
is the low hanging fruit

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.040
has already been eaten.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.760
So all you had to do even five
or eight years ago was just

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:51.540
come up with a chat app that did
something slightly differently.

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.730
And then in 18 months,
you have a billion users.

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:57.690
OK, maybe that
market's saturated now.

00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:01.539
So how are you going to build
the next great chat platform,

00:49:01.539 --> 00:49:02.580
communications, whatever?

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.030
You've got to do it better.

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:07.610
As opposed to just you're the
first one in this virgin market

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:09.510
and just because you
planted your flag first,

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:11.880
you get to reap all the rewards.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:15.090
So right, that is over, perhaps.

00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:17.430
I mean, I would argue
that around the edges

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:21.510
because we're still
far away from 100%

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:24.300
penetration on a
lot of key details.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:26.940
But even if we are,
then all that means

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.620
is you're going to
have to differentiate

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:30.828
by doing something truly
different as opposed to just

00:49:30.828 --> 00:49:32.980
being the first one to show up.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:37.376
So I would argue that from
a consumer side of it,

00:49:37.376 --> 00:49:39.000
it's going to be
better, because you're

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.680
going to get more interesting
ideas and more interesting

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.720
companies.

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:45.310
Is it going to be
harder from a founder?

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:46.644
Is it going to be a harder slog?

00:49:46.644 --> 00:49:48.393
Is it going to be
harder to differentiate?

00:49:48.393 --> 00:49:48.900
Yeah.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:49.590
But guess what?

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:52.920
Then do the work and
you'll reap the rewards.

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.000
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious
if in your research

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.292
you found anything about how
changing notions of privacy

00:50:04.292 --> 00:50:06.000
have affected the
course of the internet.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.520
Because I was thinking about
how you mentioned getting over

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.590
this hurdle of I shouldn't
put my credit card information

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:11.256
on the internet.

00:50:11.256 --> 00:50:12.750
And I certainly
remember, don't put

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:13.770
your real name on the internet.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:15.990
Don't meet people who you
haven't met in real life

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:18.600
on the internet, which have
kind of all washed away.

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.970
BRIAN MCCULLOUGH: Or even
as late as 2006 or whatever,

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:24.554
articles of don't make
your Facebook private.

00:50:24.554 --> 00:50:25.470
Don't put anything up.

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:27.026
No one will hire you.

00:50:27.026 --> 00:50:28.650
Versus now today,
would you hire anyone

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:30.487
that didn't have a
social media presence?

00:50:30.487 --> 00:50:32.070
They'd be like,
that's a little weird.

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:32.610
Go on, sorry.

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:33.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah, well, so
that's the other thing.

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.150
Now it's almost like there's
a reversal of that trend

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:38.880
where, debatable to
what point, but kind

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.550
of the general internet user
is becoming more conscious

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:42.872
of privacy again.

00:50:42.872 --> 00:50:43.830
BRIAN MCCULLOUGH: Yeah.

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:46.350
It's almost like we're
through the looking glass.

00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:48.720
Again, when I'm in the library
looking at articles from

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:53.670
'99, 2000, DoubleClick would
do things that would make

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:55.875
the front page of "The New
York Times" that if I--

00:50:55.875 --> 00:50:57.500
I can't remember the
details right now,

00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:00.690
but if I describe it to you,
you'd be like, they did that

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:03.120
and it caused a privacy
uproar or whatever?

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.890
I'm actually
formulating a theory

00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:08.444
about this, which is that
because the bubble happened

00:51:08.444 --> 00:51:10.110
and people thought
that the internet was

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:14.140
a fad that was over, people
stopped paying attention.

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:18.390
And so when these companies
started to make money again

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:23.430
and they were doing things
that were data sucking

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:25.936
and things that annoy
us now today, it's

00:51:25.936 --> 00:51:27.310
just no one was
paying attention.

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:31.860
And then when people start to
use their products, especially

00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:34.539
the social products, it
just seemed fun and good

00:51:34.539 --> 00:51:35.080
and whatever.

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:38.220
And so it was just this
period of about a decade

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.660
where no one was
paying attention

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:41.700
and all the products
on first glance

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.210
just seem to be net good.

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:48.000
So it's sort of like
the fox got away

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.150
with raiding the
henhouse for a while.

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:54.030
Yes, people are coming around to
paying attention to this stuff

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:54.990
again.

00:51:54.990 --> 00:52:00.960
And so from people being super,
super almost too excessively

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.660
worried about privacy,
to not paying attention

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:08.370
at all, to now waking up to this
there's nothing you can hide

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:11.640
and I have no control
over any of my data.

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.070
I think we're through the
looking glass on that.

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:17.880
And to previous
questions, I think

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.837
that the way to
differentiate, especially

00:52:19.837 --> 00:52:21.420
if we're entering
an era where there's

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:24.960
going to be greater regulations
and things like that, one way

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:31.170
to differentiate is really
going to be, you can trust us.

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:35.250
The famous don't be
evil motto was primarily

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:36.270
aimed at Microsoft.

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:37.770
Hey, don't go work
for Microsoft.

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:38.610
Work for us.

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:40.920
We're not like those idiots.

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:46.830
But it was also people
generally believe

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:50.190
in Google as a force for good
and organizing the world's

00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:52.210
information and
things like that.

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:56.220
So I think that a startup
that could brand itself,

00:52:56.220 --> 00:53:01.410
not just for branding purposes,
but as in a legitimate we care

00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:07.230
about you first and our products
separate, second, and making

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:11.550
money third, I think
that you could stand out

00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:13.520
in the current environment.

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:17.070
Because I don't see the backlash
ebbing away anytime soon.

00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:18.930
I think that leaning
in that direction

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:21.430
is something that could be
pretty powerful right now.

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.930
AUDIENCE: Interesting.

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:22.429
Thanks.

00:53:28.366 --> 00:53:29.740
AUDIENCE: I'm
curious if you have

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:31.230
any thoughts on this
assistant thing,

00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:32.080
where you think
it's going to go.

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:34.570
Is it going to change the
way we use the internet?

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:38.260
BRIAN MCCULLOUGH: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:41.420
I mentioned earlier, I do the
"Daily Techmeme" podcast also.

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:45.310
And I almost did a segment
last week about someone

00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:52.300
wrote a piece about what are the
assistants doing right now that

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:56.950
are functionally better than
another input mechanism?

00:53:56.950 --> 00:54:00.760
Aside from, hey,
Google, play this song.

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:03.640
Now, I know the argument can
be made, well, hey, Google,

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.410
buy this for me or hey.

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:07.120
But we're still at
this point where

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.280
functionally, for
a lot of things,

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.930
even if you get the latency
and things like that

00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:17.134
and the ability to
recognize normal speech

00:54:17.134 --> 00:54:19.300
and things like that, even
if you guys fix all that,

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:22.840
which you're working on,
there's still not anything--

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.360
yet again, it's the whole
idea of a killer app.

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:29.920
Where it's like, well, I will
speak this to an assistant

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:33.280
because it's functionally better
than sitting down at a keyboard

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:36.220
or using a mouse or tapping.

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:38.630
I haven't seen that yet.

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:40.660
And I have yet to be
convinced that there

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:43.570
is an entire class of computing
that in the long term--

00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:46.390
because we've been
able to dictate speech

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:49.210
to text to our computers
for-- how many of you

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:52.090
actually when you write
emails do it over dictation?

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:52.930
You could.

00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:55.030
You've been able to do
that for a decade now.

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:56.230
But you don't.

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:59.770
So I don't actually remember
what your question was.

00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:03.390
But I'm still skeptical about--

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:05.530
convince me that
there is a class

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:09.340
of computing that that's
actually the better input

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:10.310
paradigm for.

00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:12.043
I'm willing to be convinced.

00:55:18.619 --> 00:55:20.410
AUDIENCE: This touches
a little bit on that

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:24.940
question about internet
saturation and just the fact

00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:26.740
that there's a lot
of big companies

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:31.904
now compared to 10 years ago.

00:55:31.904 --> 00:55:34.570
A lot of those markets seem like
they have really strong network

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:36.010
effects.

00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:38.440
So how do you see things
potentially playing out there?

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:46.380
BRIAN MCCULLOUGH: You know
that even five years ago, I

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:49.530
think right now today, even
after the recent stock market

00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:51.690
stuff, eight of the
top 10 companies

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:54.720
in the world by market
cap are tech companies.

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.090
And each and every
one of them you

00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:59.360
can point to certain
network effects in them.

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:04.260
Five years ago, even,
though there was only one.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.760
It was either you
guys or Microsoft,

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.110
I can't remember, in the top 10.

00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:11.470
One of the things
that concerns me

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:14.130
is that it is an oligopoly and
a consolidation at the top.

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:15.701
It gets back to
that Microsoft thing

00:56:15.701 --> 00:56:17.200
about there was a
decade where there

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:21.760
was no one to come in and
scoop up the innovators.

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.490
But I also wonder
about that in the sense

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:29.410
that because there are so many--

00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:32.320
there's not a network
effect for everything.

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:36.520
And there are certain
companies, the fangs among them,

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:40.330
that have these network
effects in certain markets

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:45.040
that are functionally
Buffett's moats.

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:48.130
And so this is not really
answering your question again.

00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:52.750
But is it going to be
chipping away at those moats?

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:54.940
Because we know that
an innovator can

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:57.970
come around and eat someone's
lunch from below at any time.

00:56:57.970 --> 00:57:02.830
But if you have these five or
six overlapping strong network

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:06.600
effect markets that
are essentially killed,

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.700
then is innovation going
to have to go around that

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:10.870
into other markets?

00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:14.350
But then is the only playbook
that we know how to do

00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:17.710
is to work with network effects
and build platforms and choke

00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:18.760
off everybody else?

00:57:21.501 --> 00:57:22.000
Here.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.342
I've got an answer for you.

00:57:23.342 --> 00:57:25.300
I don't think that the
current state of affairs

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.680
can last very long.

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.750
Not only because,
inevitably, there

00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:31.460
will be innovators
coming up from below,

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:34.330
but I think you
guys, the big guys,

00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:37.780
are going to start chipping away
at each other in various ways

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.880
that are going to weaken
some players and whatever.

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:44.980
And if you do get some sort of
a period of five to 10 years

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:48.590
of heavy battle on things like
assistants and smart speakers,

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:50.770
which everybody seems to
want to play in that field,

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:54.040
then just if everybody's
shooting guns

00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:57.910
at each other "Reservoir Dog"
style, no one notices the guy

00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:01.629
that's coming in the
room on the other side.

00:58:01.629 --> 00:58:03.670
AUDIENCE: So here's a
related follow on question.

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:06.610
It seems like we've gone from
a world where things were

00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:07.750
for a while very federated.

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:10.120
Like email was very
federated protocol.

00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:10.960
Anybody can do that.

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.100
To a whole lot of silos.

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.970
You have more inboxes
now you used to.

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:19.390
Do you see that sort
of thing reversing?

00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:23.440
Not just that someone
comes in and takes over one

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:25.030
of these things and becomes--

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:27.292
takes over a strong
networking effect area.

00:58:27.292 --> 00:58:28.750
BRIAN MCCULLOUGH:
What is Facebook?

00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:36.940
You can already, for 25 years,
dial up your own web page.

00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.150
You could share your photos.

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:40.150
You could do daily updates
and things like that.

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:42.280
All that any of
these guys have done

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.800
have just made it easier
to make a web page.

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.650
My mom didn't have
to know how to code.

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:52.670
I'm talking beyond things like
Weebly and things like that.

00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:56.350
I'm talking about literally
all they did is make it simpler

00:58:56.350 --> 00:59:00.410
to communicate digitally online.

00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:04.520
So just go simpler beyond
that and beyond that.

00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:09.580
I think that if you
extrapolate beyond,

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:12.910
you can go beyond the silos.

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:15.010
I can see a world--

00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:19.690
Twitter should be thought
of as a web utility, not as

00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:20.780
a company.

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:21.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that's the people

00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:22.550
who have been lost in Twitter.

00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:23.633
BRIAN MCCULLOUGH: Exactly.

00:59:23.633 --> 00:59:27.640
So I can see that one
route of innovation

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:29.710
is to just continue to simplify.

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:31.930
And you can simplify
your way out of the silos

00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:35.890
into what it would functionally
be sort of an open source

00:59:35.890 --> 00:59:40.220
sort of environment where
messages can't be owned.

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.940
Think of it from that
sort of weird look at it

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:44.230
from another angle.

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:46.360
Why are messages in silos?

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.860
There's no functional reason.

00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:48.940
It's text.

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:49.600
It's just text.

00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:51.475
Because all your friends
are on this network,

00:59:51.475 --> 00:59:54.240
so you're on that
network or whatever.

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:57.460
There used to be you
couldn't-- if you were on AIM,

00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:01.090
you couldn't talk to someone on
MSN chat and things like that.

01:00:01.090 --> 01:00:04.090
I think that, and I
hope this is true,

01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:07.930
I think that the web tends
to bend towards open.

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:09.760
And we might 10
years from now look

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.130
back at this period as
an aberration, simply

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:14.920
because information
does want to be free.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.110
And there's not
really any reason

01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:19.960
why things like
texts or pictures

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.472
have to be siloed other
than those network effects.

01:00:22.472 --> 01:00:23.180
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:00:26.607 --> 01:00:28.440
BRIAN MCCULLOUGH: I
think we should wrap up?

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.270
All right.

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:30.740
Thanks, everybody, for coming.

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.450
Appreciate it.

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:35.200
