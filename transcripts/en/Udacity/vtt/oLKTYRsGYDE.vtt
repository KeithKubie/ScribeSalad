Okay, so I want to make a band object. I don't see any

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.390
new object thing. Alright, can you help get me started here, Sam?

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, if you go to the elements tab, that's

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.890
where you can find all the stuff that you can create.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.070
&gt;&gt; Okay, object. Oh, and I can just drag it. Oh,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.710
that was cool. Okay, so create new object, I'm going to call it

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.060
band. Fill out the rest. Okay. So I've gotten my object

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.470
with the default fields and then kind of just drag fields onto

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.720
it, too.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So these are almost all of the same

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.820
fields that you have in the Field Creation Wizard. A

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.080
couple have been taken out, but for the most part

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.100
they're all here. Just drag the fields directly onto the object.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.440
&gt;&gt; Cool. So, I did it. I added all

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.870
these different fields. It's got a couple of check boxes,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.040
a couple of picklists for set time and genre,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.910
phone number, text for the Twitter handle. It's pretty easy.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:46.740
&gt;&gt; Great, looks good.
