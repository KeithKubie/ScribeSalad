BROMLEIGH MCCLENEGHAN:
Good afternoon.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.730
I'm very excited to
be with you today.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.040
When I learned that
Google did author talks

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.720
was a number of years ago, when
we had actually first written

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.770
our parenting book.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.110
But it was from a
fairly small press,

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.030
and it was definitely written
for a limited churchy audience.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.090
And they didn't
think that it would

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.390
be particularly interesting.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.610
But when I came to Lauren and
said, I have this book called,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.490
"Good Christian Sex,"
certainly people

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.130
would be interested in that.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.160
So I'm delighted to be here.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.370
It's a funny topic to
be writing and talking

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.890
about as someone who
is working in churches.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.072
This is not a particularly
academic text.

00:00:56.072 --> 00:00:58.030
One of the great things
about pastoral ministry

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.790
is that I get to
be a generalist.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.960
So I get to write,
and I get to read,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.340
and I get to hear
people's stories.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.020
And I get to be a part of
the life of a community.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.010
And all of my education always
has been interdisciplinary,

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.482
and so allows me to know about
a lot of different things.

00:01:16.482 --> 00:01:17.940
So we're going to
talk a little bit

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.740
today about some of the
biblical stories that

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.900
have shaped the way that
American Christians talk

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.660
about sexuality.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.970
But I am not someone who can
get into an argument with you

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.220
about the proper pronunciation
or meaning about the Greek

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.290
or Hebrew.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.300
You are not going to
ever see my Greek grades

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.430
from that year in seminary.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.490
Another thing that I don't
address in the book at any rate

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.590
is some of the
biblical texts that

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.140
are known in the church
as clobber passages.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.370
Those are the seven
that people like

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.050
to trot out to bash queer
folks over the head with.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.150
And I don't really
address those.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.230
They've been looked at by
scholars on all kinds of sides

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.120
of the issue.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.850
And so I don't really
talk about those.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.660
I don't want to parse what
has already been discussed.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.190
But I did think that there
was a place for this book.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.410
So just to draw
nice, broad strokes.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.760
In the Christian
tradition-- the part

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.050
of the Christian tradition
that I grew up in-- I'm

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.829
a preacher's kid,
actually, who has now

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:33.870
written a book about sex.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.410
My parents are
super proud of me.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.380
And the church that I grew up
in was progressive in some ways,

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.130
but also largely silent about
issues around sexuality--

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.090
about the experiences
of sexuality.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.630
We had some, like,
Christian sex ed

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.990
that we were made to go to
as junior high students.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.190
Ours was led at least in part
by my father, which was not even

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.330
remotely awkward, and
didn't shape me at all.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.830
But we learned a lot
about the creation story

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.820
and God's good
gift of sexuality,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.190
and then basically sort
of, use birth control.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.260
And that was sort of the
end of that discussion.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.710
And so for me personally, a
lot of the-- at least growing

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.050
up-- a lot of the narratives
that I had about what healthy

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.830
sexuality looked like came from
sophomore health class taught

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.290
by the JV basketball coach
and 90210 or "Dawson's Creek"

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.399
or, you know, you're 16.

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:37.690
You should probably be sleeping
with whatever boyfriend

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.540
you have.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.740
The other sort of strand of
American Christianity that

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.200
really started talking a
lot about sex in the '90s,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.520
when I was a teenager,
continued an emphasis

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.880
that had begun in the
'80s when it first--

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.400
when abstinence-only education
became a part of something that

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.452
could get funding in schools.

00:04:02.452 --> 00:04:04.660
It actually started during
the Reagan administration,

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.630
but sort of ramped up as
part of the Clinton welfare

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.290
reform in '96.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.730
And then again, certainly,
when President Bush

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.960
introduced the Office of
Faith-based Initiatives.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.460
And so they talked
a lot about that.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.640
And that part of
Christianity really

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.030
emphasized abstinence only--
abstinence-only education

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.570
and that teenagers,
young adults, everybody

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.450
should be fully chaste--
that was the word, chastity--

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.730
until they were married.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.140
And anything outside of marriage
was problematic and wrong.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.960
And that narrative
came to really dominate

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.010
what people understood was the
Christian understanding of what

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.040
holy, good sex was.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.260
And in our world,
and particularly

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.260
in the mainline
Protestant congregations

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.030
that we grew up in, that was--
I had no idea that was going on.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.530
By the time I read the sort of
seminal text of that movement,

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.490
"i Kissed Dating
Goodbye," by Josh Harris.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.640
I was in grad school.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.080
And I read it, and I was like,
well, that ship has sailed.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.350
I'm sort of done with that.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.920
But I was also actually
really angry about it

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.200
because it's sort
of a terrible book.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.320
But also because the author,
who was at that point

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.360
just a 21-year-old kid
himself wrote this tome

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.220
that sort of suggested that--
not just sex, but really

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.720
any sort of feeling of
pleasure, or desire,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.310
or of romantic relationship
outside of something that

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.650
was leading directly to
marriage-- and in fact

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.616
in the moment after
marriage-- was very wrong.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.230
There's one book that he talks
about-- he has the first book,

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.688
"I Kissed Dating
Goodbye," and then

00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:07.910
he has the sequel is
when he met his wife

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.650
and when they started courting--
they did courting, not dating,

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.500
which is holier.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.640
At one point, he's sitting
in a hammock-- they're

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.280
like head-to-foot, so they're
sitting next to each other

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.950
in a hammock.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.110
And they're not even
really touching at all.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:31.100
But he looks, and he
starts to admire her legs.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.600
And he then is overcome by a
feeling of his own sinfulness.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.760
And he has to picture Jesus
bleeding on the cross in order

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.860
to right his mind and get his
mind out of the gutter again.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.207
This is, like, a month
before their wedding.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.387
So that book had
a huge effect on--

00:06:54.387 --> 00:06:56.720
AUDIENCE: --you'd think it'd
mess up his wedding at all.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.280
BROMLEIGH MCCLENEGHAN: No.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.981
No.

00:06:57.981 --> 00:06:58.480
No.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.780
They are going to just
totally set that baggage aside

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.420
right away.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.970
But not only for them, but
for really a generation

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.020
of American
Christians growing up

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.050
in a certain part of the
church, his book and others

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.270
then like it, along with
True Love Waits and some

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.960
of these other movements,
really affected the way

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.060
that we talk about sexuality.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.750
As someone who
identifies as a Christian

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.990
and had some really wonderful
experiences before I

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.290
was married, I was
frustrated by the sense

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.060
that somehow our sexuality
was something that

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.260
could be turned on and off.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.770
There are a whole lot of
disciplines who tell you

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.830
that's a terrible idea.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.320
But also the fact
that healthy sexuality

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.090
was somehow wholly
distinct from what it

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.020
meant to be a faithful person.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.360
So this book has
sort of come out

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.770
of this cultural moment
and my personal experience,

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.820
but also a real
desire to just talk

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.830
about what it feels
like to fall in love,

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.413
and, like, meet
somebody that you want

00:08:02.413 --> 00:08:04.100
to touch and be touched by.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.560
I'm ordained in the United
Methodist Church, which,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.490
like many other
churches, we were often

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.181
very silent on issues of what
healthy sexuality looked like.

00:08:15.181 --> 00:08:17.430
But we definitely have a,
like, don't ask, don't tell.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.914
You'll probably figure it out.

00:08:18.914 --> 00:08:20.330
If you really are
in a crisis, you

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.704
can come and talk
to your pastor,

00:08:21.704 --> 00:08:23.540
and maybe they will
give you good advise.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.246
Maybe not.

00:08:24.246 --> 00:08:25.870
But the issue that
we really focused on

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.820
is LGBTQ inclusion around
ordination, around marriage.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.260
That has been the dominant
conversation and fight.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.830
And it's been ugly and horrible.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.029
And while some denominations
are on the better side of it,

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:41.070
the Methodist Church is
still really mired in it.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.350
And so part of my hope then,
too, in addressing these topics

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.887
is to help offer an entry point.

00:08:52.887 --> 00:08:54.470
I don't think all
people are the same,

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.261
and all people believe
all the same things.

00:08:56.261 --> 00:09:00.850
But I do think that it
can be helpful to folks

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:06.030
to give them a way to
identify with other people.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.650
So I kind of wanted to
unpack the experience

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.740
of falling in love, or
of seeking pleasure,

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.918
or of following your desires.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.430
So the book takes up
questions of sexuality,

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.700
but also relationships and love.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.740
And then the final
impetus-- I now

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.960
work in a local congregation.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.490
But I used to work at the
University of Chicago.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.960
And so I worked with a lot of
college students and graduate

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.950
students.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:41.030
And certainly with some
of the Title IX stuff,

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.790
and just being on
a college campus,

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:48.379
you can't ignore the very
open wounds of rape culture.

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:49.420
That's really all around.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.060
The questions about what's
the nature of consent?

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.170
And how do we get it?

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.670
And how do we ask for it?

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.940
There's lots of hand-wringing
about hook up culture.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:03.590
And I really wanted to
not do hand-wringing.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.200
I don't know.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.600
I went to college,
and I met some people.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.080
But at the same
time, I was talking

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.830
to a friend of mine
just the other day who

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.910
is a college chaplain.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.950
And she and her husband, who's
on the faculty at the college

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.920
where she works also--
the students came to them,

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:27.290
and they wanted the couple
to do panel discussion

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.590
on how you date.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.780
They know how to get wasted
and sleep with somebody

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:33.800
they don't really know.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.610
But they have no idea
how to build intimacy.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.400
Aside from any
moral questions we

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.880
might have about what it means
that you have to knock yourself

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.270
out in order to
pursue something,

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.140
it's very hard to
have enjoyable,

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.030
pleasurable experiences
if you can't communicate

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.570
at all with your partner.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.620
So there's probably some need to
like teach communication skills

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.280
to people.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.220
So that's my interest
in-- for younger readers.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:10.090
So that's kind of the framework
in which this book came out of.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.360
And so I wanted to
then share with you--

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.900
since the introduction
to the book

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.310
went up on a Facebook
first reads program,

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.240
I've started getting
all kinds of comments.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.073
I know I've really made
it because I finally

00:11:22.073 --> 00:11:23.600
started getting trolled.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.356
All these folks
who are convinced

00:11:27.356 --> 00:11:28.730
that I am a heretic
and a sinner,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.438
and I am leading people
down the primrose

00:11:30.438 --> 00:11:31.770
path all the way into hell.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.400
And they like to
pull out Bible verses

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.640
to tell me why I am wrong
for suggesting that sexuality

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.530
is a part of who we are.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.470
And that our bodies are
not separate from our minds

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.010
or spirits, but that
we're all sort of just

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.750
humans with bodies, and
souls, and all these things.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.920
And that focusing on sexual
ethics, which is my interest,

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.890
as opposed to sexual
morality, is a problem.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.930
So they proof text
about all the things.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.680
You have to shun fornication.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.485
And don't you know your body
is a temple of the Holy Spirit.

00:12:03.485 --> 00:12:04.360
And all these things.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:15.770
And so I try to engage the Bible
in-- it's certainly not new,

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:16.890
but a different way.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.770
I don't want to proof text.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:23.040
The great Christian
ethicist-- she just retired,

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.060
I believe, from Yale-- I mean,
I believe she just retired.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:26.970
She was at Yale.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:32.390
Margaret Farley wrote
this wonderful book

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.170
called, "Just Love."

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.250
And it's sort of a
Christian sexual ethics.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:43.300
And I mean, it's firmly
within the tradition

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.670
of Christian ethics.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:50.700
But she challenges
enough-- she's not a nun,

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.170
but she's taken orders.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:56.337
So she's a Catholic holy woman.

00:12:56.337 --> 00:12:58.420
I can't think of what the
word I'm looking for is.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.300
But she's a woman religious.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.000
There you go.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.830
And she got in trouble with
the Vatican for this book.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:06.740
So it's great.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.890
You know it's good when it's
been knocked by the Vatican.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.300
But it's very much in
keeping with the tradition.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.750
But she has this
great line that's

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.060
basically like, you
shouldn't proof text

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.130
the Bible about anything.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.270
But you really shouldn't proof
text the Bible about sexuality.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.980
Proof texting, of course,
means just pulling things out

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.690
of context and then sort of
saying, well, here it is.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:30.980
Here's the coherent
list of rules

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.620
that we've got right here.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.530
Because that's really just
not how the Bible is written.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.240
It was written over an
extended period of time

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.910
by multiple authors.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:44.140
Parts of it are-- and
have always been--

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.070
understood as allegorical.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.930
Parts of them are histories
intentionally offered

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.936
from different perspectives.

00:13:51.936 --> 00:13:53.310
Parts of them are
letters written

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:59.150
to very particular communities
at different moments in time.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.240
So she says, we have
to be really careful

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.810
when we think about
how we're going

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.510
to look at biblical texts,
particularly around issues

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.987
of sexuality since
they're so fraught.

00:14:10.987 --> 00:14:12.070
So she's really wonderful.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.690
And if you ever feel like
you have some weeks to spend

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.220
on Christian sexual ethics,
"Just Love" is where to get

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:18.969
started.

00:14:18.969 --> 00:14:20.510
But if you don't
have that much time,

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.480
you can read my book, which
is far easier to understand,

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.280
I think.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:33.190
The Bible certainly
does offer points

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:37.730
where things seem to
be-- well, let's just

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.480
say the Bible offers a
whole bunch of everything.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.410
My biblical hermeneutic--
that's the churchy word

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.720
for interpreting
the Bible-- is, yeah

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.295
there is a lot of
stuff in there.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.210
And part of my job
then as a pastor

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.560
is to interpret the
Bible for people,

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.640
like people in my community.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:05.320
And again, I try not to-- I'm
not an academic in so far as,

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.000
I don't parse.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.450
I don't read the original
language most of the time.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.450
But I want to think about
what this story meant

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.960
for people in the past, and
what it means for us today.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.650
So one example that
I want to start with

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.000
is actually from
the book of Joshua.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.070
And this is an example
of how Joshua is-- he's

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.340
the one who succeeds Moses.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.014
So Moses has led the people
out of slavery in Egypt,

00:15:34.014 --> 00:15:35.680
and they've gone
through the wilderness.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.300
But Moses doesn't get to
go into the promised land

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.530
because he's made some
errors of his own.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.617
And so Joshua takes
over and becomes

00:15:44.617 --> 00:15:45.825
the new leader of the people.

00:15:48.647 --> 00:15:50.730
The Lord says, I brought
you to the promised land,

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.340
and you should go into it.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.600
And it will be yours.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.120
Here it is.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.070
I've given it to you.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.930
The problem when Joshua
and the people arrived

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.600
is that the land is
already inhabited.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.810
And in the Book of
Joshua, then the Lord

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.710
says, well, no, it's yours.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.120
So go ahead and
wipe everybody out.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.400
Especially make sure you
get the women and children.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.520
You know, like, take them out.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.210
So this is a hugely problematic.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.680
The Lord is commanding genocide.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.390
That is not cool.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.880
So this came up
in the lectionary,

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.630
which is one of the ways
of ordering our preaching

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:27.130
schedule.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.380
And so I had it,
and I'm like, well,

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.921
God, what am I going
to do with this?

00:16:29.921 --> 00:16:31.800
Because this is terrible.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.170
But I pull out the commentaries
and the academic work.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:39.630
And this is not a
historical moment.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.660
This genocide didn't
actually happen.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:49.940
The people were a small
and struggling population.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.740
And as they told these
stories over time

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.580
about how they had come
to live in the land,

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.650
they needed to feel as
though they were powerful

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.000
and they were safe.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.490
And so this story becomes,
God commanded us to come in,

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.319
and we, by the power of
God, wiped everybody out,

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.069
and now it's ours.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.839
So I think that's an
example-- obviously,

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:13.339
that one's not about sexuality--
but an example of how

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:17.430
biblical texts really have to
be looked at in their context.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.736
And some of them, I mean,
you read at face value,

00:17:20.736 --> 00:17:22.069
and you're like, no, I get that.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.950
That makes sense.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.760
But some of them, the distance
is a little bit farther.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.569
So the one I want to start with
is actually about masturbation

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:31.400
because you've got
to dive right in.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.210
When I first wrote the
draft of this book,

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:40.490
this first chapter on
self-love didn't exist.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:44.160
But it became increasingly
clear that I needed to have it.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.040
So I wrote it, and I sent
a draft in to my editor.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.540
And she was like,
do you really want

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.010
to start the book this way?

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.837
Everybody is going to
put it down right away.

00:17:52.837 --> 00:17:54.920
But I think it's actually
a really important thing

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.870
because it allows
us-- I mean, one,

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.410
it's just an important thing.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:04.920
I surveyed 350 people
using a Google form,

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:11.140
you guys, about their
history and practice,

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:15.010
their first romantic experience,
their first sexual experience,

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.760
about what they heard from
the church growing up.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.592
It was really open-ended.

00:18:21.592 --> 00:18:23.050
You are the right
people, probably,

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.210
to ask for help
analyzing my data.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:29.500
But I was really looking to just
kind of hear people's stories.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.300
And one of my questions was,
did you masturbate as a child?

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.210
And then how did
you understand it?

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:39.180
And there were a few folks who
were like, no, not interested.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.700
And certainly, no.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.310
That would be a sin
against my chastity.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.560
I can just imagine a
10-year-old telling you that.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.360
But then a whole bunch
of people were like, yes.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.380
Absolutely.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.090
I understood it as awesome.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.340
And some others were like, yes.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.980
Constantly.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.810
So that was refreshing.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.602
But because there was such
an overwhelming response

00:19:02.602 --> 00:19:04.810
to that particular question,
it seemed like something

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.940
that had to be lifted up.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:12.770
But also self-love invites us to
consider the topic of pleasure

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:17.050
without asking about a partner,
or desire as something--

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.170
I mean, it's just
like-- it's sort

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:24.340
of a purer form of pleasure
without complication.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.920
I don't know if I only know
this because of history classes

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.960
and my particular
interest in the topic,

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.620
but once upon a time,
masturbation was often

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.230
referred to as onanism.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:37.610
Anybody heard that term ever?

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:38.110
OK.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.610
Right.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.550
And so particularly
in the Victorian era,

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.410
you could read about
how engaging in onanism

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.040
will give you hairy palms,
and turn you blind, and acne,

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.890
and all sorts of
terrible things.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:55.690
So I wanted to share with
you the story of Onan.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.550
It appears in Genesis, so
the first book of the Bible,

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.880
later on in it.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.130
So it goes like this.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.300
"It happened at that
time that Judah went down

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.260
from his brothers and settled
near a certain Adullamite whose

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.160
his name was Hirah.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.590
There, Judah saw the daughter
of a certain Canaanite

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.900
whose name was Shua.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.960
He married her
and went into her.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.780
She conceived and bore a
son and he named him Er.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.810
Again, she conceived and bore
a son whom she named Onan.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.450
Yet again she bore a son,
and she named him Shelah.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.020
She was in Chezib
when she bore him.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.140
Judah took a wife for
Er, his firstborn,

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.050
and her name was Tamar.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.110
But Er, Judah's firstborn,
was wicked in the sight

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.710
of the Lord.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.510
And the Lord put him to death."

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:40.600
As you do.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.310
"Then Judah said to Onan,
go into your brother's wife

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.550
and perform the duty of
a brother-in-law to her.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.350
Raise up offspring
for your brother.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.410
But since Onan knew that the
offspring would not be his,

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.320
he spilled his
semen on the ground

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.980
whenever he went into his
brother's wife"-- Whenever,

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.150
so more than once.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.680
"--so that he would not give
offspring to his brother.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.410
What he did was displeasing
in the sight of the Lord,

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.250
and he put him to death also."

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.300
The end.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.510
Several things to know
about this passage.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.940
Judah has two sons--
an older and a younger.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.320
They're both married.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:21.420
And the first one, Er,
whose wife is Tamar, dies.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.890
He was wicked, so he's dead now.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.110
But to be a woman in
a biblical culture

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.340
without attachment
to a man was a hugely

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.290
problematic and dangerous thing.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.515
You didn't count at all.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.850
If you had a son, great.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.580
You were sort of safe, and
you had a place in society

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.390
because you had to
raise him so that he

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.050
could have property and a life.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.140
So you mattered that way.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.396
Or you could have a husband.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:54.330
Onan is encouraged not to
marry Tamar, his sister-in-law,

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.760
but rather to give her a son.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.810
And he enjoys her.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.330
But does not give her
a son and, in fact,

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.970
actively prevents giving
her a son in the only way

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.470
that you could in
biblical Israel.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.530
And so he spills his seed.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.270
And this is displeasing
to the Lord.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:17.630
So this is the story,
then, of male pleasure

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:21.360
without conception that
becomes the doctrine

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.590
of the church-- that sex
should be for procreation.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.350
This is the story
that gets used to talk

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.380
about why that's so critical.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.112
AUDIENCE: It sound like it's
very anti the rhythm method.

00:22:32.112 --> 00:22:33.320
BROMLEIGH MCCLENEGHAN: Right.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:33.830
Oh, yes.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.380
Well, because you're not
supposed to use that.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:36.880
No.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.580
I mean, even good
Catholics are not

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.050
supposed to use
the rhythm method.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:40.760
Not really.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.770
Because every occasion
of sexual congress,

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:48.520
you should be open
to children, right?

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.300
Which is, man, I
have three children.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.680
And that is a lot of work.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.480
You have children.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.890
They are a lot of work.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.280
So I can't quite imagine that.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:04.920
So here is a story then
about a sexual relationship

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.350
that has gone awry
and has become sinful.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.740
It's not a mutual sexual
relationship, exactly.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.130
I mean, she's probably
glad in theory

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:18.170
to have the opportunity
to have a son

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:22.442
and then have a
life and livelihood.

00:23:22.442 --> 00:23:24.150
But it doesn't actually
seem like this is

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.864
a story about self-love, right?

00:23:27.864 --> 00:23:29.530
He has a partner, so,
like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.460
In my read of the story,
then, Onan's real sin

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.500
is that he is shirking his
duty to his sister-in-law.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.210
He's having sex with her,
and presumably enjoying it,

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.430
without fulfilling
his obligation,

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.379
and actually then
doing injury to her.

00:23:43.379 --> 00:23:45.670
The practice of marrying your
sister-in-law, as I said,

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.320
or giving your dead
brother an heir

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.620
was a means of
security and protection

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.760
for a woman who would
otherwise be without support.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.690
Onan has sex with
Tamar but denies

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.540
her the means to protect
or sustain herself.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.040
So here, is I think the
actual moral of this text,

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.330
if you can sort of say that.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:07.860
Pursuing pleasure at
a cost to another,

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:12.230
especially a vulnerable other,
is displeasing to the Lord.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.330
So shame on Onan.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.810
I think it's important to
think about these things.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.360
The church, as I
say, that I grew

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.490
up in-- the only conversation--
the very limited conversation

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:27.350
that we had was, like, sexuality
is a good gift from God, right?

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:32.370
We had all these nice, happy,
healthy growing up books,

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:37.550
and really there was sort
of no discussion about what

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.310
might count as sexual sin.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:45.520
And so I think it's important
to both affirm that sexuality

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.310
is not something dirty,
or shameful, or horrible,

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:54.800
but also to say that there
are ways you can do it wrong.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.590
And not in terms
of who you're with

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:02.700
and not talking about
positions or whatever.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.780
But there are ways
you can do it wrong.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.560
And one of them is
by taking advantage

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.810
of a vulnerable other.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.594
The rest of the book
goes through a number

00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:13.260
of these things.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.210
And I want to really
just open ourselves

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:18.130
up to questions fairly shortly.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:22.190
But I wanted to just
sort of suggest to you

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:24.290
that over the centuries,
biblical texts have

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.670
been interpreted in
a number of ways.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.370
And they really
always have been.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:34.190
I'm going to read to you in
closing in just a second,

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.510
and as we move into
the time for questions,

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:40.660
a piece of the Song of Songs,
or the Song of Solomon, which

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.730
over time has been
used to describe

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:50.220
the sort of wonderful, mutual,
loving relationship between God

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.980
and Israel-- the people of
Israel-- or between Christ

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.240
and the Church-- the
mutual connection

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.510
and mystical union
that is there.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.400
But if you've ever actually
read the Song of Songs,

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.860
you might take a different
interpretation of it.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.850
There are two voices in it,
and it moves back and forth.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:16.810
So the woman speaks
in this excerpt first.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:20.640
"I was sleeping, but
my heart was awake.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.150
A sound.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.360
My love is knocking.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.430
He says, open for me my
sister, my dearest, my dove,

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:31.050
my perfect one.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:35.610
My head is soaked with dew,
my hair with the night mists."

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.300
She says, "I have
taken off my tunic.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.680
Why should I put it on again?

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.440
I have bathed my feet.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.020
Why should I get them dirty?

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.730
My love put his hand in
through the latch hole,

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.490
and my body ached for him.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:52.600
I rose.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:57.680
I went to open for my love,
and my hands dripped myrrh.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:04.980
My fingers, liquid myrrh over
the handles of the lock."

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:11.000
I read that, and I don't exactly
think of Christ and the church.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:11.670
I don't know.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.977
So there's this erotic
love poem here situated

00:27:13.977 --> 00:27:15.060
in the midst of the Bible.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.260
So part of my-- again,
my hope for the book

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:23.920
is to affirm that
desire and pleasure are

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.970
important parts of what
it means to be human,

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.080
to seek to be in relationship.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.650
To know someone in a
particularly intimate way

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:37.440
can be a remarkably
grace-filled experience.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:42.910
Grace-- in one of the
thinkers that I particularly

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:47.320
love is-- experiencing grace
is like the feeling of knowing

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.500
that you are accepted.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.290
And to be vulnerable
with a partner

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:57.570
and to feel seen,
and known, and loved

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:02.100
is like an the experience
of grace, then, in my mind.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.700
To feel that acceptance.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.720
And can be a powerful,
then, and holy thing.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.910
And so I think this is
such a vital conversation.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:15.920
I don't think-- to
counter those who

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.500
criticize me on
my Facebook page,

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:23.880
that everything always is good.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.120
Not every sexual
thing, because it

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.480
is done with our bodies, which
are created by God, we say,

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.800
is a good thing.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.870
There are in fact
things that harm others.

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:34.370
And I think that's
one of the things

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.230
that looking at some of the
texts can suggest to us.

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.750
It's not just about
the letter of the law,

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.730
but the spirit of the law.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:45.757
And part of sexual ethics,
then, in the church--

00:28:45.757 --> 00:28:48.090
and I think for all people,
even outside of the church--

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:54.020
is to think about, what are
the norms by which we determine

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:58.750
what is good, and what is
holy, and what is loving?

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.160
One more.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:04.450
In Matthew's Gospel, Jesus is
asked point blank the greatest

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:05.980
of the commandments.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.630
There are hundreds of
laws for the people Israel

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.740
and certainly,
countless admonitions

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:15.870
from the apostle Paul
and in the other letters.

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:18.580
But in the Gospels,
from the voice of Jesus,

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:23.470
we hear that his
reply to this question

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.950
about what the greatest
of commandments is.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.440
"You must love the Lord your
God with all your heart,

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.230
with all your being,
and with all your mind.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.600
This is the first and
greatest commandment.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.200
And the second is like it.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.750
You must love your neighbor
as you love yourself.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:42.490
All the Law and the prophets
depend on these two commands."

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.970
So my hope in this book, in
telling embarrassing stories

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:46.510
about myself and
saying words that

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.540
make me blush in public, in
writing something my kid can't

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.840
read yet-- she's super mad
about that-- my hope in this

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.700
is to start to invite
people to think

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.070
about what a faithful
sexual ethics looks like.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:01.020
What are the things that help
us in all our relationships

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.400
to fulfill these commandments?

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.000
How do you love God, and
yourself, and your neighbor

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.961
as best you can?

00:30:08.961 --> 00:30:09.460
Thank you.

00:30:16.082 --> 00:30:17.231
Are there any questions?

00:30:19.771 --> 00:30:21.270
AUDIENCE: One of
the things I wonder

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:24.080
about is the
relationship between sex

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.550
and marriage and the fact that,
in a lot of different cultures,

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:31.640
over the years, they've
been closely tied.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.030
And you could
almost see marriage

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:38.930
as coming from some sort of
a societal stamp of approval

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:40.760
on a sexual relationship.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.350
Or involvement in some way.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:49.220
And right now,
marriage is almost

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.260
like a big ceremony
and a legal proceeding,

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.800
and it seems like
it's disassociated

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.140
from its original kind of
stamp of approval on the sex,

00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.770
essentially.

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:06.730
Do you see any role for the
larger community in blessing

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.964
a sexual relationship?

00:31:08.964 --> 00:31:10.630
BROMLEIGH MCCLENEGHAN:
Like in marriage?

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:12.100
AUDIENCE: Like in marriage.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.300
The use of marriage
for that is like-- it's

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.690
been disassociated with that.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:17.880
And is that appropriate?

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.110
And if so, is there
some other way

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.464
to have the larger
community involved?

00:31:23.464 --> 00:31:24.880
BROMLEIGH MCCLENEGHAN:
So marriage

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.960
is a funny thing, right?

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.760
Because it has
not been certainly

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.430
the same thing in
all times and places.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.420
I mean, yes, it was in some
ways, a stamp of approval,

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.060
saying this is the person
you get to have sex with.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.420
And more often than
not, this is the woman

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.230
that you kind of like paid
enough to get to have sex with.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:47.340
Hopefully, she's
interested, too.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.480
I think that like
our sense of marriage

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.231
as a romantic
partnering over time

00:31:53.231 --> 00:31:54.980
that then receives
this blessing-- I mean,

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.870
that is in some ways a
very modern invention.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:03.430
I like to think
about love and sex

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:08.010
and marriage is a Venn
diagram, where they're each

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:12.110
their own thing, but
there is definitely

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:14.280
a place where they all
kind of come together.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.860
And I think that's a
really wonderful thing when

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:20.510
they can all come together.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:24.080
And I think there
are certainly--

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.270
I know why churches
bless marriages.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:30.190
There is something
amazing about-- I always

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:34.380
say I never liked the phrase,
taking a leap of faith

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.740
until I got married.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.127
I never understood what it was.

00:32:37.127 --> 00:32:38.960
I always thought it was
doing something dumb

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.370
and hoping for the best.

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.050
But in some ways, that's
what getting married is.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:46.220
You make this huge
promise that you're

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.960
going to live together with
somebody and be with them

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:54.590
and love them and be faithful
to them, for the most part.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.840
That's usually what people
promise in their marriages.

00:32:59.514 --> 00:33:01.680
And you don't know if it's
going to turn out or not.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.513
I mean, it's written
right there in the vows

00:33:03.513 --> 00:33:07.810
that you're going to stay even
in sickness and in health,

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:09.130
and richer and poorer.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:12.745
So I think that that's a
wonderful and holy thing.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.570
So I don't want the
church to get out

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.100
of the marriage business.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.990
But I think there's
also the possibility

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:26.164
for holy and wonderful sexual
relationships not in marriage.

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:32.960
Maybe this is more
than you want to hear.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.650
There's a theologian
who talks about how

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:40.860
any sexual relationship that
you can see the end of-- it's

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.500
not holy.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.400
So basically he's saying
you have to be married.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.350
But you can't really know.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:49.250
I think.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:54.220
You can't really know if a
marriage is going to end.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.300
You can't really know.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:59.377
And so to say that
something isn't holy

00:33:59.377 --> 00:34:00.960
simply because you
don't know how it's

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.661
going to turn out years from
now doesn't seem quite accurate

00:34:04.661 --> 00:34:05.160
either.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.030
Does that kind of get
what you were wanting?

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:11.659
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to
hear thoughts on the subject.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:12.020
BROMLEIGH MCCLENEGHAN: Yeah.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:12.940
AUDIENCE: So that was good.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:13.439
Thanks.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.760
AUDIENCE: In this room,
perhaps a year or so ago,

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:28.170
an author spoke about her
book about the real Amazons.

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:30.900
And among the
points she made were

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:38.290
that, when you had nomadic
peoples-- before their society

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:41.429
started cutting
up pieces of land

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:49.960
and declaring them
owned by people--

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:54.639
the relationship between the
sexes was more equitable.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.910
But that movement to
an agrarian society

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.930
resulted in
effectively ownership

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:04.660
of women being important because
you were contributing your land

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:07.210
and your effort to
feed the offspring,

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.020
which might not be yours.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.900
And so that in some
way could be viewed

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:18.650
as the origin of the need to
have societal blessed unions.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:24.720
And also, the taboo of sex
outside that union because it

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:28.980
undermined that
structure of society.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:32.070
It seems to me, we're
moving in a direction

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:36.520
where the needs of that
no longer really apply.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:42.320
For the most part, we don't
have all of the land cut up

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.070
and occupied by the
owner of the land who

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:47.720
lives there, creating crops.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.760
Many, many people live
in rented apartments.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:56.300
You can move in with your mom
if your relationship breaks up.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.740
It seems to me a more
fluid environment.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:04.790
And so I'm hopeful that we
will over time transition

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:09.600
from structural support
for a society functioning

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.440
to more a bond between people.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.840
More holy union rather than--
more matrimony rather than

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.780
marriage, you might say.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:26.180
Less about the finances
and more about the part

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.930
that matters-- the love
in the sense of caring,

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:32.080
rather than love in the
sense of euphemism for sex.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.980
BROMLEIGH MCCLENEGHAN: Yeah.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:34.640
Yeah.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.640
Societies are going
to organize themselves

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.020
as they will around any
number of different things.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.244
I counsel a lot of people
that about getting married.

00:36:47.244 --> 00:36:48.660
I meet with them
a bunch of times,

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.370
and we plan their
service and talk

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:52.100
about what it means
to be married.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.670
And almost every
wedding I've ever done,

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:58.670
the couple has already
lived together.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:03.590
So they certainly don't seem
to care for my blessing about

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:06.270
whether or not they're
going to be having sex.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.440
Which is cool.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:14.910
But we do always talk about
the details of married life,

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:20.950
that it's amazing how who's
doing the dishes or not

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:22.980
can affect whether
or not you feel

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.782
like going to bed with
them at the end of the day.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:34.620
I do think that I would
much prefer people

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:39.910
to marry because they desire
to be committed to one another

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:44.700
than because it is
economically feasible.

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.150
But I don't think that
we can ever really

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:58.030
divorce the ephemeral
and emotional commitments

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:03.662
from the day-to-day
tasks of life together.

00:38:03.662 --> 00:38:05.870
When my husband and I bought
our first house together

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:07.720
the real estate
lawyer's sitting there.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.980
And he's just like, now you
have to both pay for this,

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.260
even if this doesn't work out.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.675
We're like, oh, gee thanks.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:23.730
But honestly, once you have
kids, or you have property,

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:30.562
or whatever-- you
may well have more--

00:38:30.562 --> 00:38:32.970
I don't like to speak in
crass economic terms--

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:36.032
but you sort of have more
incentive to work on it

00:38:36.032 --> 00:38:37.740
because you can't just
pick up and leave.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.765
Your lives are enmeshed
in certain ways.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.080
But the way that we think about
relationships are different.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.880
And I think part of the
important thing then for us

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.780
going forward is not
necessarily being

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.820
wed to a particular structure
or a particular institution

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.370
as we've understood
it in whatever

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:03.810
historical period,
but to ask, who

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:04.976
does this render vulnerable?

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:11.690
Marriage is good for
raising children.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:14.930
Children need some stability.

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:18.840
Not all marriages, but
in general, stability

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.750
is good for children.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:23.570
So if we're going to move away
from marriage, how all else

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:25.990
are we going to make sure
that children are cared for

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:27.567
and have what they need?

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:35.220
But at the same time, I think
that an emphasis on marriage--

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.450
when marriage equality
passed, we rejoiced.

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:40.350
And that was a wonderful thing.

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:42.790
But there were also voices
within the queer community

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.390
that were like, we have a
lot more pressing issues

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:46.590
than marriage.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:47.550
Thank you very much.

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:49.220
All the victories
have not yet been won.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.870
So I think that, as we
continue in conversation,

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.540
we have to keep
track of, how are

00:39:55.540 --> 00:40:01.292
vulnerable people being affected
by whatever changes we see?

00:40:01.292 --> 00:40:02.750
AUDIENCE: My comment
on moving away

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:07.000
from the financial structure
provided by the way

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.460
marriage has been for probably
millennia in some regard,

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:16.890
is that I feel like we need to
divorce the financial contract

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:22.330
from-- that was not an
intentional pun, sorry--

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:25.820
the financial contract from
the union of two people who

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:29.890
care for each other in that
way, in that intimate way.

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:34.630
Because I grew up with what I
consider relatively traditional

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:38.200
family environment, where we
had multiple generations living

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.080
together-- a brother and
sister who just inherited

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.930
the house that they grew up in
and continued to live in it.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:46.000
The one who had the better
salary kept working,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.850
and the other one took
care of stuff at home.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:52.660
But the law would not allow
them to pool their income

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.590
and file for taxes together.

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:56.090
There was no possible
way they could

00:40:56.090 --> 00:41:00.310
because they were siblings,
even if they were to pretend.

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.170
And so we have
financial contracts

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.170
that are tied to
traditional relationships,

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:08.470
regardless of whether
the contract really

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:10.820
has any need for
that, and people

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:17.560
who are bound by the
expectation of a married couple

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.460
with children, even if
they've never had children.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:24.630
And so it seems to
me that by having

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.890
the birth of a
child or a mortgage,

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:31.250
you have stepped into
this structure that

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:35.730
is necessary to support
that, while you were still

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:39.090
single-- the living together
situation we have now.

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:41.034
Society sees that
you're living together.

00:41:41.034 --> 00:41:42.950
Your friends know that
you're living together.

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.210
If one of you goes
out with someone else,

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:47.640
your friends are all going to
look at you askance and ask,

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.760
what's going on here?

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:56.930
So we have that not fully
married concept socially.

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:58.254
We just don't have it legally.

00:41:58.254 --> 00:41:59.462
BROMLEIGH MCCLENEGHAN: Right.

00:41:59.462 --> 00:42:01.790
I have another degree
in public policy, too.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:04.881
And so we do organizational
theory and things like that.

00:42:04.881 --> 00:42:06.630
One of the things that
they just emphasize

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:09.810
is, institutions are doing
what they're supposed to do.

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:11.460
They're inherently conservative.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:15.170
They're supposed to keep
things the same over time.

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:20.620
And so helping
institutions which

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:25.290
are inherently conservative
to adapt to social changes

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:28.340
is ongoing work and doesn't
happen very quickly.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:34.200
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
that the current view

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.020
is relatively recent.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.460
There's a whole different
spread of ages here.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.370
So my entire life, as far
as I've been able to tell,

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:46.580
the dominant Christian viewpoint
has been abstinence only.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.140
This is bad.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.050
And so on.

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:55.831
So how do you think that
can-- to say be changed sounds

00:42:55.831 --> 00:42:58.080
like going in and like forcing
other people to believe

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.720
something else, which
isn't good either.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.560
But besides, I
guess, writing a book

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.685
that might perhaps appeal--

00:43:03.685 --> 00:43:05.810
BROMLEIGH MCCLENEGHAN:
That's what I'm going to do.

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:07.539
What are you going to do?

00:43:07.539 --> 00:43:10.080
AUDIENCE: How would you suggest
going about-- as you've seen,

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.500
on your Facebook page, you
mentioned lots of people

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.480
take offense to
what you're saying.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.690
How do you think we
can help spread it

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:22.947
into the country and
even beyond the country?

00:43:22.947 --> 00:43:25.030
BROMLEIGH MCCLENEGHAN: In
the church, for example,

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:29.040
in trying to shift the way that
we talk about sexuality, we,

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:34.140
for the last generation,
in the mainline church,

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.190
we've talked about
rights language.

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:38.250
And we've talked about justice.

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:42.200
And I think that's
critically important.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.960
I mean, you don't do ethics
without a concern for justice,

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.700
right?

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.210
That's not very good ethics.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:55.770
But I think that you
change hearts and minds

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:59.540
by building bridges, and
inviting conversation,

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.660
and asking people to reflect
on their experiences.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.010
In the first church
that I served,

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:10.260
it was a super tiny congregation
with basically little

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.050
old ladies.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:17.060
And our town was
increasingly home

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:21.700
to this-- the town had--
the chamber of commerce

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:25.400
had specifically started
encouraging members

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.490
of the queer community to
move to it because they had

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:31.390
great affordable bungalows,
and it was close to the city,

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:32.690
and it was great.

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:37.509
And so for this reason, like,
we have this growing population.

00:44:37.509 --> 00:44:39.550
We should have this
conversation about sexuality.

00:44:42.276 --> 00:44:44.402
And to see if we could
make a public statement

00:44:44.402 --> 00:44:46.360
about whether or not they
would be welcome here

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.264
in this congregation.

00:44:47.264 --> 00:44:49.180
And so we started having
this conversation, me

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:55.970
and all the old ladies,
and in some ways,

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:57.840
it was just such a
surprising thing.

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.910
We started having a
conversation, and this one

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:05.070
woman, Liz, who may or
may not yet be living,

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:07.180
but she said, you know,
when I got married,

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.700
I married a Catholic.

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:11.780
And the priest wouldn't
marry us because it was

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.140
just outside of the practice.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:17.240
And she was like,
it's the same thing.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.980
In her mind, her experience
of being turned away

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:24.230
from the church because
of who she was-- it

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:25.730
was totally analogous.

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:31.710
And so I think by asking-- I
mean, it's a little different.

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:35.300
But I think encouraging
people to think

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.320
about their experiences
and how they

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.620
might be similar to other
people's experiences

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:43.310
I think can be a
way of doing that.

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:45.750
And then for the
church, I think we

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:48.610
have to do the nitty gritty
work of looking at the text

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:51.200
and reflecting on our
theology and making

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:56.530
the case that there's an
alternative-- that there's not

00:45:56.530 --> 00:46:01.229
only one Christian way
of talking about this.

00:46:01.229 --> 00:46:02.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.000
BROMLEIGH MCCLENEGHAN: Thanks.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:03.500
OK.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.850
Thank you.
