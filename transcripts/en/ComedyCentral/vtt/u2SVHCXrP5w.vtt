00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.939
(soft music)

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:10.076
- [Myra] Voila.

00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:12.011
- Thank you.

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:12.846
Wow.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.715
Okay.

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:16.549
I'm going in.

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:17.417
- Just go for it.

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:20.954
(soft music)

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:32.298
(phone buzzing)

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:39.372
- Hello?

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:44.711
What?

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.981
Oh, my god.

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:50.616
- What's going on?

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:51.451
(sobbing)

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.252
- My mom.

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:54.487
- Oh.

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.289
(sobbing)

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.725
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:00:59.492
Come here.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.128
Fuck diabetes, by the way.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:03.163
It's such an asshole.

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:06.466
Just,

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.302
promise me that

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:11.671
neither of us will ever die.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:16.609
(slow, dramatic music)

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:19.145
- Hello, Myra.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:23.316
Just so you know, I will not
be looking at your penis today.

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:24.651
- No, it's not that.

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:28.922 align:start size:81% position:19%
I've just been
incredibly hungry.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.156
I'm starving.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.457
I'm so thirsty.

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.859 align:start size:88% position:13%
Drinking so much, but
it just never goes away.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.294
The thirst never goes away.

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:37.464
I'm peeing more than I'm not.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:41.701 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's just one constant
stream of urine.

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.436
I had to duct tape my cock.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.707
No matter where I am,
it just keeps coming.

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:49.008
I can't stop it.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:49.608
- [Doctor] You're
peeing right now?

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:50.709
- Yeah.

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.878
My vision has been so blurry.

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:53.813
I can't even see.

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:55.815
I don't know where I am.

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:56.983
I'm so tired.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:01:59.452
I'm wildly fatigued.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:01.720
- You don't have diabetes.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.888
- Yes, I do.

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:04.724
I definitely have it.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:07.126
(sobbing)

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:09.696
(upbeat music)

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:13.399
(door opening)

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:17.570
Where were you?

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:20.506
- Having my mom cremated.

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:21.708
- But I missed you.

00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:24.810
- What do you want me to say?

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.045
- Will you just come over here?

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.514
I made some cupcakes.

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.154
I love you,

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:37.423 align:start size:88% position:13%
and this probably is
gonna be so hard to say.

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:39.658
But just promise me when I die,

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:41.594 align:start size:84% position:16%
you'll turn my skin
into a leather satchel

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.429
and carry me around 24/7.

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:45.865
- Why would you die?

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:48.902
- Well, 'cause, I have diabetes.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:53.840
- That's paper.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.013
- At least you just went
through this with your mom,

00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:03.216
so now you know how
to take care of me.

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:05.418
(coughing)

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:13.292
I just can't believe my
time has come so soon.

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:15.461
I'm gonna go sit down by
the blood pressure machine.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.463
Promise to walk me
out when you're done.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.972
(coughing)

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:30.943
- [Doctor] Jade.

00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:32.078
- Dr. Jay.

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:33.312 align:start size:97% position:3%
Hi.
- I heard about your mother.

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:34.547 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Yes.
- She's dead.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:35.781
- Yes, I know.

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:38.050 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I am so sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.884
I know.

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:39.719
And now Myra too.

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:41.487
- What?

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:43.456
Myra?

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:44.290
I just,

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:47.159
last month, I took
a look at his penis.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.061
Was there an accident?

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:48.895
How did he die?

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:49.729
- Oh, no, no.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.330
He has diabetes.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.498
- Oh.

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.099 align:start size:84% position:16%
No, please, he
doesn't have diabetes.

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.735 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh you should
see him, he's sick.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.803
- No, he's fine.

00:03:57.803 --> 00:03:59.505
Physically, he's fine.

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:01.140
- He...

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.974
- No.

00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:02.775
- You...

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:09.248
(coughing)

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:10.983
You don't have diabetes?

00:04:10.983 --> 00:04:12.585
- Not technically, no, but,

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:17.590 align:start size:84% position:16%
baby, when you're
dying, you just know.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.159 align:start size:81% position:19%
I don't expect
you to understand.

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.527 align:start size:81% position:19%
Just to wait on
me, hand and foot,

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:23.029
until my final days.

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:25.098
(sobbing)

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.700
