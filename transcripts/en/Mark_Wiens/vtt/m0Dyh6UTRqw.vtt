00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300
And the falafel is sort of squished so that all of the insides and

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.680
the crunchy bits all get mixed into that bread

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.140
That is wonderful!

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.780
Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.200
in Amman Jordan, we arrive early this morning at about 5 AM from Bangkok

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.580
and then came straight to the hotel ate breakfast

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.960
and then took a nap and just woke up

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.960
It's still kind of drizzly today and overcast and it keeps drizzling every now and then

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.080
We just drove for about 15 minutes

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.120
and we're going to a restaurant called Al-Quds

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.880
which is famous in downtown Amman for serving falafel

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.240
Oh!

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.240
Jordan is known for having some of the best falafel in the Middle East

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.000
and so this place only serves falafel sandwiches and

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.920
you can choose your size of bread, I got, I'm not sure what size it is,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.500
but it is a bun and then they're gonna fill the falafels inside of the bun

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.040
with all the different toppings and ingridients

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.920
and serve it as a sandwich and this is a popular little spot, it's only a take away

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.820
-Okay umm, this is
-Oh yeah!
-This is your first glimpse of Jordanian hospitality,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.800
-they saw you're doing this and this is
-Oh, so they gave us same falafels not in the buns

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.040
-For you to try
-Thank you!

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.500
Right as I was saying that they don't serve falafel on its own,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.720
they gave me some to sample on their own and so this is like the special falafel treament here

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.220
A combination of ground chickpeas and some spices then deep fried into these little patties and

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.760
-I think that is tahini, is that tahini on top?
-Yes

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.020
They look like miniature little cupcakes, they're like flat on the bottom and kinda rounded on the top

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.300
Oh that's incredible!

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.680
That blend of spices and the turmeric in there and there's like an herb

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.700
flavor to it and then it's really crispy

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.420
kinda like dry, but fluffy and moist all at the same time on the inside

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.120
That's delicious! Oh, that's really really good!

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.540
He is so fast with the falafel mixture and he puts it into a little mould

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.740
and then straight into the oil and you can just smell the aroma coming out that oil

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.520
it's incredible! We got our sandwiches now for our main course and it is

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.140
in a sesame bun you can see the bun is just loaded with sesame seeds

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.440
And the falafel is sort of squished so that all of the insides and

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.800
the crunchy bits all get mixed into that bread

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.800
There are tomatoes in here, there are pickles, there are cucumbers

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.220
and then that sauce, I believe is tahini, which is sesame paste

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.820
And I'm not sure what else there is, oh yeah, I did get it spicy so

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.020
you can see a little bit of like chili, oh yeah, there is some chili powder in there as well

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.760
Wow that's beautiful! I'm gonna try to take as big of a bite as possible to get everything in one bite

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.960
What I really love

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.960
about this sandwich just from my first bite

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.440
is there so many different crispy dimensions of texture

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:28.560
The bread is crisp in a baked kind of way and then the falafel is crispy in the deep fried kind of a way

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.400
I think that tahini is also really good making it nice and moist

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.020
and then the addition of the pickles, the tomato is juicy

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.720
That is wonderful!

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.140
And even those sesame seeds are really really good as well, those crispy

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.660
it tastes like crispy roasted sesame seeds on the bun

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.800
The falafel was incredible, we're now walking down rainbow street

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.900
I think we're gonna go try some Arabic ice cream next

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.300
-Yes, Gerard!
-We're going to a place called Gerard Ice Cream
-It's a local ice cream place

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.400
You can see that they have different flavours

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:13.000
Also all the new very popular flavours all over the world like chocolate bar flavours, nutella, snickers, kinder

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.520
you name it, but traditional ice cream is that one over there, it's called Arabic ice cream

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.100
I got a scoop of the Arabic ice cream in a cone and it comes

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.600
there's pistachios in here and the main flavouring is from Arabic gum

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.060
which is a sap from a tree

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.820
Oh what I really love are those little pieces of pistachios, little creamy pistachios

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:49.180
and then the flavour it's kind of like a cross between vanilla with a little hint of caramel

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:07.360
We're just arriving to a place called Wild Jordan, which is kind of a conservation restaurant and cafe

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.300
On the entrace floor of this place there is a handicraft store where they sell a lot of

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:22.380
handicrafts and art from around Jordan and this cafe also has really nice view of the city

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.560
and you can see on the opposite hill across from this cafe there is the citadel

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:36.000
which I think we will visit tomorrow, but we're just gonna sit here for a little while. relax, and I just ordered up a tea

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.560
That is a giant tea bag!

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.040
Another name for this tea is called Malise

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.900
Oh Yeah!

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.180
That is a very relaxing tea

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.120
I don't know what is all going on in there, but there are definitely a lot of herbs

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:33.880
We drove to an area of Amman called Abduon which is, Fadhi calls it the Beverly Hills of Amman

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.280
so it's a very high end area and we have stopped to the place called

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.460
the Delights Shop to try some different dates

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.260
Everything they have here are dates,

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.640
but then they are covered in a variety of different chocolates and a variety of different toppings

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.680
And this one, they have given me to try which mint with dark chocolate

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.720
and there's a date on the inside of this

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:06.940
Wow!

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.640
That is

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.120
really

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.700
rich and sweet

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.260
It's just tasty

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:19.780
on the inside and then covered in a dark chocolate and then with just a hint of a mint flavour at the end

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:25.460
And they gave us a little to go pack of chocolate covered dates as well

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.560
Just a very short ride from where we eat the dates

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.000
we have come to a restaurant, a local restaurant called Al Osrah

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:45.440
And this is a restaurant that serves just good and traditional food

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:54.160
we ordered just a full table of different foods, the colors and the different dishes are incredibly beautiful

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.060
One of the dishes i don't think I've ever had before is called fatteh

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:08.000
and it is, it's kind of a dipped paste in texture, but there is actually bread inside of it

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.180
-bread mixed with hummus and then I think this are pine nuts
-Yes

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.500
Pine nuts on top and to eat all this food I have a stack of bread,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.120
but the actual fatteh because there is bread already included in it,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.260
you don't need to eat it with bread you eat it more like a almost like a pudding with a spoon

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.280
Wow!

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:38.780
Hummus is usually more like heavy and filling,

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.240
but with the addition of that bread, that kinda soaked bread inside of the hummus

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.680
it's more light and fluffy, it's like a light and fluffy hummus

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.520
It tastes kinda like whipped hummus

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.300
And I'm gonna try this chicken liver

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.820
It's a good

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.260
idea to add different things together so

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.180
a little bit of hummus on top of this, that looks delicious! And all of that olive oil

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.280
I'm gonna add a little bit of chili sauce to finish off this bite

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.960
Oh this is a beautiful beautiful bite!

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:36.580
That liver, is so creamy and like soft in texture that it actually blends in to the texture of the hummus

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:42.780
You can taste the kind of irony richness of that liver which is really good

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.600
And then just that little bit of chili sauce just completely completes that single bite

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.520
-Take a piece of the falafel
-Oh yeah!

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.200
-Okay, go to the hummus
-And then dip

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.040
Oh one more thing, and then the chili

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.200
Oh yeah!

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.760
-That's a good bite
-That is a good idea
-Try it!

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.380
Fadhi has recommended

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.920
a combination that includes the bread

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.120
and then with the falafel in the middle

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.900
Add some hummus

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.060
Some hummus in there

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.940
And then the final addition is some of that chili sauce

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.620
All right!

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.680
This is a pickled cucumber and carrot

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.160
Wow!

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.100
That carrot is really really crisp

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.260
And then

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.140
a little bit sour and mostly salty

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:49.140
And this one is the ful which is mashed up fava beans

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.480
Really really good, and it has a little bit of, I think there is some lemon juice

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.980
on there you can taste like the lemon fresh taste to it

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.720
A little bit spicy, but really good flavour

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:14.060
To end the meal, there are some slices of  fresh lemon which is common to

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.320
use at the end of the meal just to kind of clean your mouth

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.700
I haven't eaten it yet, but Ying tried one and said it is extremely sour

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.720
so I am anticipating some serious sourness coming out of this lemon

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:44.060
Yeah, oh wow, it like builds with sourness, oh wow, I can immediately feel my tongue tingling

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.020
It's like a shock to the mouth

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.720
Okay, I think one piece is good enough

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:08.760
For our final stop this evening, we've come to a place called Tamriyeh Omar

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.380
And this is just a little closet sized shop, but it's really really well known

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.540
And this place has been here for 44 years, what they are more famous for serving here is

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:26.560
called a tamriyeh and it is a sweet and what he does is he takes a piece of dough

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:33.660
and he makes it into a huge very thin sheet and then adds in a slice

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:40.300
I think it's seminola cake which he adds in the middle and then presses it down into

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.600
a patty shape and then he puts that straight into the hot oil and then he

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:50.860
deep fries until a golden crisp and then when it's done cooking then it's transferred for it to drain and then

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.880
I think it's dusted with some powdered sugar

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.520
That's right out of the oil, it is like burning my palm right now

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:02.860
and so this is it, it's in like a patty shape, I'm gonna test it

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.040
Oh wow!

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.360
That is really hot and fresh and crispy

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.140
We just made it back to the hotel, thinking about going to bed pretty soon it's been a long day

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.660
and so I will see you all tomorrow on the next vlog

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.840
