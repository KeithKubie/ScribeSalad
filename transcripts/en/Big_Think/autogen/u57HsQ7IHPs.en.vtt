means sacrificing so much of the rest of
their life and so if we really want to

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690
their life and so if we really want to
 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.110
their life and so if we really want to
tackle why there aren't more women in

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120
tackle why there aren't more women in
 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.540

different kinds of leaders and what I

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319
different kinds of leaders and what I
 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.949
different kinds of leaders and what I
call a diversity of leadership it really

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959

create alternative paths to leadership
and what that really means is what is

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080
and what that really means is what is
 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.410
and what that really means is what is
the problem if it's not leaning in and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420
the problem if it's not leaning in and
 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.330
the problem if it's not leaning in and
it's not confidence what's stopping

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340
it's not confidence what's stopping

rocket science it's that jobs today are

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030
rocket science it's that jobs today are

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.050
90 100 hours a week in order to achieve
success in the organization and to me

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060
success in the organization and to me
 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.069
success in the organization and to me
that is both short-sighted on behalf of

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079
that is both short-sighted on behalf of
 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.640
that is both short-sighted on behalf of
organizations because I don't think

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650
organizations because I don't think
 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.140
organizations because I don't think
they're getting the best of people and

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150
they're getting the best of people and
 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.580
they're getting the best of people and
they're limiting their talent pool and

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590
they're limiting their talent pool and
 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.150
they're limiting their talent pool and
obviously individuals who may desire to

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160
obviously individuals who may desire to
 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.800
obviously individuals who may desire to
exercise their talents if they're lucky

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810
exercise their talents if they're lucky
 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.229
exercise their talents if they're lucky

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239
enough to have them to rise to the top
 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.140
enough to have them to rise to the top
in a way that you know they can do it

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150
in a way that you know they can do it
 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.390
in a way that you know they can do it

with still allowing for other things in
 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.319
with still allowing for other things in
their life so I think you've got to

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329
their life so I think you've got to
 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.180
their life so I think you've got to
reexamine how organizations are

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190
reexamine how organizations are
