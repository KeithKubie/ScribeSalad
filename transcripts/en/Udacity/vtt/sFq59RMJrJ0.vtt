00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.250
Because we have two copies of the ABO gene,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.490
you can have one A allele, and one B allele.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.340
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Remember that if you have a A allele, you'll get the antigen

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.790
A on your blood cells, and if you have a B allele, you'll get

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.130
the antigen B on your blood cells. So you have both alleles you can

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.720
end up with both antigens on your blood cells, and that's how you're type AB.
