00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.253
Okay, this first set here represents a full-sibling

00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:07.860
relationship; and the second set represents a parent-child relationship.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.530
Now, why is this? Well, let's start with the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.880
parental one. Remember that you receive a whole chromosome

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.450
from one parent, and a whole chromosome from another

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.260
parent. So if you compared your IBS score, the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.080
SNV's on your chromosomes You should have a complete

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.750
matching set for the whole length of a chromosome.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.300
But two siblings, on the other hand, didn't

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.160
receive the same kind of chromosome form each parent

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.770
because of what? Recombination during meiosis. So instead

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.770
they share segments of certain chromosomes with each other

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.600
from both parents. So in the chromosome they

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.630
got from dad, they'll share some segments. But remember,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.920
dad's chromosomes recombine. And so it's not the same

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.530
for both children. The same thing with mom's chromosomes.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.700
You'll notice that there's roughly 50% here in

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.010
the parental child relationship, sharing 50% of the

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.790
DNA. Right one whole chromosome set matches and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.290
the other one doesn't. And even in the full

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.070
sibling case, you end up with roughly 50%. If we add up the shaded region it's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.895
about 50%, in the unshaded regions that's also

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:16.660
50%. So even though you're half related To your

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.820
full parents and your full siblings. The half that's related is

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300
different when we look at the order of the SNVs on the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.040
chromosome. This king of analysis is the basis for something we'll learn

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.014
about in just a little bit, called identity by descent or IBD.
