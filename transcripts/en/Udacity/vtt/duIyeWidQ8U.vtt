00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.100
It's time to update your weather app,
one last time.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.060
Here's what I want you to do.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.810
First, add a web app manifest file and
the relevant types for

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.860
Safari and Windows.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.250
Be sure to include all the recommended
icons and set the appropriate colors.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.320
Next, minify and inline the CSS and
perform any other optimizations.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.580
Finally, deploy your site to
a secure hosting provider.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.592
When you've completed this step,
try adding your weather app to the home

00:00:32.592 --> 00:00:35.840
screen and verify that the right
title and icons are shown.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.968
Make sure you got the add to home
screen banner to appear on Android.

00:00:39.968 --> 00:00:46.530
And verify that app that works when
your online, offline or in life-like.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.320
Be sure to compare your app to
the link in the instructor notes below

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.650
to make sure that it
works exactly the same.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.920
And don't forget to test
it in other browsers.
