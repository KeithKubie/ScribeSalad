00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.170
With California facing a megadrought, many
fear that fire season this year will be bigger

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.070
and more devastating than previous years.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:14.030
But is there a way we could fight forest fires,
with fire?

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.630
Hey guys Julia here for Dnews

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.179
With drought drying up the west, the threat
of wildfires is more dire than ever.

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.650
In the past five years, many states have seen
the biggest fires in 50 years.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.380
Previous wildfires have caused millions of
dollars in damage to homes and property.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.779
Some fires even were deadly.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.320
So it’s no wonder the US Government spends
billions every year to fight them.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.570
But unfortunately it’s not a simple case
as some bear in a hat wants us to believe.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.610
Historically, places like California saw big
burns every year.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.240
But as more and more people moved west, forest
fires had to be stopped.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.800
But decades of fighting forest fires actually
made things worse for a little while.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.230
It made some ecosystems less diverse.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.480
And suppressing natural fires led to a buildup
of debris and clutter on the forest floor,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.820
setting the stage for disasters to come.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.330
After the Yellowstone fires of 1988 and the
fire season of 2000, people began to understand

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.089
that some ecosystems NEED fire, they’ve
evolved to make use of it.

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.250
Fire is part of their natural lifecycle.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.729
Fire benefits an ecosystem in a few ways.

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.799
Sometimes it breaks down nutrients in a flash,
literally.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.850
Nutrients from leaves, logs, and other debris
that otherwise would have taken years or decades

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.990
to break down and return to the soil.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.600
Some plants actually need fire and heat to
thrive.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.520
Like the giant sequoias in Sierra Nevada region
in California.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.210
They need the heat of fire to reproduce!

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.670
Sequoias make large cones, that only open
and disperse their seeds when they dry up.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.369
One of the primary ways they dry out, is from,
you guess it kids, the heat of a fire.

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:34.740
And they aren’t the only ones.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.070
In the Pinelands in new jersey, there’s
several species that need fire to reproduce

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.090
including the pygmy pitch pine.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.069
This small plant evolved a few ways to fight
fire.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.319
It’s got thick bark that protects it from
the heat.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.170
But if the trunk happens to be damaged by
fire, it can regrow sprouts from the wound!

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.579
Fire doesn’t just help things grow, sometimes
its powers of destruction, are for good!

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.959
By clearing out clutter, it can destroy invasive
species or harmful insects and can even open

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.359
up the dense forest canopy to allow sunlight
to reach the forest floor, so more things

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:02.359
can grow.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.399
It also creates new areas of grasslands which
some species of animals depend on for shelter

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:07.399
or food.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.200
so what do we do? is there a way we can protect
our homes while still allowing these delicate

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.550
ecosystems to thrive?

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.670
Well every year some forestry services practice
what’s called controlled burn or prescribed

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.670
fireY.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.200
yes there are people whose job it is to set
fires.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.200
ON PURPOSE.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.290
But it’s a tricky business.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.200
The conditions have to be just right or a
fire could quickly get out of control.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.600
If conditions are too dry, the fire can get
too hot or too big too quickly, and there

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.100
are a few cases of controlled burns getting
out of control.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.890
If too damp, well nothing’s going to burn.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.920
In the Pinelands of New Jersey parameters
for burning are tight, like under 55 degrees,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.810
wind speeds of 7 to 12 miles per hour and
about two or three days since the last rainfall.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.280
In some years, they can burn up to 22,000
acres of forest.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.790
And this policy seems to be helping.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.250
One study published in the journal Ecosphere,
found that areas that were purposely burned

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.540
had twice as many native plant species as
nonburned areas after 10 years.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.150
And other studies from the Ecological Society
of America show that prescribed burns reduce

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.630
the severity of wildfires.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.760
But these are small, very well managed, controlled
burns.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.390
So it seems it really pays to fight fire with
fire.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:20.530
But only if you’re a professional with a
permit, so still listen to that bear in a

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.580
hat.
