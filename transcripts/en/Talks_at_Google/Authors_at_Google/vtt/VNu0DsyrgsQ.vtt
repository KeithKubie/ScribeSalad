[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.192 --> 00:00:08.150
MICHAEL JASCZ: So I have
a couple of questions.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.680
How many of you know
at least 100 people?

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.930
200?

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.640
Right, we all know
a lot of people.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.440
Do you have a
different relationship

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.260
with each of those people?

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.560
Right?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.420
The person at the
deli, your family--

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.170
but if I ask you are you in a
relationship, do you look at me

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.000
and say, what kind
of question is

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.580
that I don't know 200 people.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.050
Why is the word relationship
come to mean significant other.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.510
Newspapers, magazines, the
internet, and of course,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.400
we all want to have a partner.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.990
We want to have companionship.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.090
We want to have that sort
of lasting bond with someone

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.860
that we're close to.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.450
So we look at the
word relationship

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.750
as how can we have healthy
relationships with everyone

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.700
in our life and not just
our urge and impetus

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.720
to be with a significant other.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.310
So about six-- well, no,
actually almost 10 years ago,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.970
I was doing a
relationship coaching.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.630
And I had been
working with someone

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.790
who was an administrator,
parent coordinator,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.300
in fact, at the lab school
on the 17th Street just

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.500
up the block.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.290
And after we had worked
for a bit, he said,

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.160
would you come in to speak
to a group of junior boys?

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.590
And I said yes because
I couldn't find the no.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.250
Do some of you remember
there was something

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.140
you know you had to
do but you didn't

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.180
know why you were doing it?

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.910
And I went and I started
speaking with these boys.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.270
I was sitting down,
and I could see

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.520
they weren't paying attention.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.800
And somehow something
happened and I stood up.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.770
And like a drill Sergeant
I said, listen up.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.570
It's a bit out of my character.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.860
However, later that day, the
administrator sent an email

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.110
to the principal
saying, he had not

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.590
seen a group of boys transformed
in 42 minutes in his 10 years

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.789
in the school.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.840
What I teach relationship Ed
as a component of health Ed.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.310
How many of you had
relationship Ed in school?

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.920
No hands up, OK.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.420
So 10 years later, I
went into the school,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.980
spent the rest of the entire
2008, 2009 school year there.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.460
And 10 years later, we've
been in over 40 schools.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.420
We've been to colleges.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.410
We've worked with social
service organizations.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.316
And we have a curriculum.

00:02:41.316 --> 00:02:44.970
If the camera could
come in close,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.380
healthy relationships 101.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.430
And we say there's no
102 because you kind

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.330
get what's in this book
and carry forward with it.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.860
And we've also written a book.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.250
Some of you got the
book when you came in.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.930
And this is a compilation of my
experiences coaching and using

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.630
very much the same
approach to coaching

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.790
as we use when we
go in the classroom.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.010
Mostly we're working with
high school students.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.302
And before each chapter, some
of you who have the book,

00:03:13.302 --> 00:03:15.000
you'll notice there's
a student journal

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.930
entry because one of the things
we had students start to do

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.150
is keep journals on how they
saw relationships portrayed

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.380
in society.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.130
So we have a book.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.040
We have a curriculum.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.123
We also have a guide book.

00:03:25.123 --> 00:03:28.140
Our guide books being used by
mental health organizations.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.760
It's being used by women's
organizations, organizations

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.750
that work with trafficked
women to help them rebuild

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.740
and restore their lives,
and most recently, prison

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.700
counselors.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.860
We did a workshop
with prison counselors

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.720
who go to Rikers Island.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.790
And we have found out
that they're already

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.860
starting-- the
prisoners are already

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.520
starting to speak
differently to their spouses

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.510
when they have their limited
time to be on the phone.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.260
So I have another question.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.040
What do you do when you
want to get good at a sport?

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.790
AUDIENCE: Practice

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.720
MICHAEL JASCZ: Practice?

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.815
Feel free to call
out the answer.

00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:08.190
How about if you
want to get good

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.578
in a language, foreign language?

00:04:10.578 --> 00:04:11.370
AUDIENCE: Practice.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.120
MICHAEL JASCZ: Practice.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.376
How about if you want to
get good at an instrument?

00:04:14.376 --> 00:04:15.248
AUDIENCE: Practice.

00:04:15.248 --> 00:04:17.040
MICHAEL JASCZ: What do
you do when you want

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.779
to get good at a relationship?

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.130
AUDIENCE: Practice.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.300
MICHAEL JASCZ: Who
said practice loudly?

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.570
Could you come on stage?

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.888
I think you should leave
the rest of the talk.

00:04:27.888 --> 00:04:29.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.300
Who tells us to
practice relationships?

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.940
So 100 years ago or more
than-- about the turn

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.970
of the 20th century, the
life expectancy was about 47.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.090
Up until then, the life
expectancy between 30 and 40

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.580
because modern medicine
is what's kept us going.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.090
And so we are actually in a
new period of human evolution.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.560
Now we live twice as long
as most other humans.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.290
We don't think about that.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.400
We are living twice as long as
most people have ever lived.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.410
How do we cultivate, sustain,
and have relationships

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.990
that flourish and
thrive for decades

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.370
and decades and decades?

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.270
Some of you may have
experienced a breakup.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.750
Has anyone experienced a
breakup with a intimate partner?

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.860
Has anyone experienced
their parents breaking up?

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.820
Few hands going up.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.690
It can be difficult.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.720
So we-- there's a
lot of information

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.670
out about relationships.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.700
In fact, 20 years
ago, some of you

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.670
may know a professor
Dan Goldman.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.430
He wrote a book called
"Emotional intelligence."

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.490
And then he wrote a book
called "Social Intelligence."

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.160
And many of you may have heard
of the social and emotional

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.380
learning movement,
which is more and more

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.390
is coming into schools.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.320
And Harville Hendricks-- he
was here about a year ago.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.350
Has anyone-- was anyone
here for Harville Hendrix?

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.850
Harville Hendrix
wrote a book called

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.660
"Getting The Love You Want,"
which someone gave to Oprah--

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.870
does anyone know who Oprah is?

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.970
--a little over 20 years ago.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.780
And he-- Harville
went on the show.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.990
She's named him as one of
the 20 most important guests

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.650
that she's ever had on her
show Harville Hendrix is what

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.430
I would call a modern master.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.870
I was fortunate enough to
sit-in on one of his workshops.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.790
And he can read people.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.670
He can read how people
are in relationships.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.250
And I saw people
that hadn't slept

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.000
in the same room for 25 years
crying, holding each other,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.630
ready to do it over again.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.500
So I recommend his book,
"Getting The Love You Want."

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.590
And I recommend that you look
into other relationship authors

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.720
because it's so much
a part of our life.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.060
Has anyone heard of Tony Porter?

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.400
He has an organization
called A Call To Men.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:57.380
And he is an extraordinary
YouTube video, a Ted Talk.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.350
It's 3 million viewers.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.200
Amazingly, inspiring, and
we show it in the classroom.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.820
So these people I think
amongst many other

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.400
should be household
names, given how

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.010
we are challenged
by relationships

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.300
and learning to
respect each other.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.805
And so how many of you
have been in therapy?

00:07:22.805 --> 00:07:24.225
A few hands went up.

00:07:24.225 --> 00:07:26.100
How many of you don't
like raising your hands

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.663
when this question is asked?

00:07:27.663 --> 00:07:28.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.970
OK, well, I went to therapy.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.580
And I spoke about my parents.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.450
And I blamed my father and
my mother for my problems.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.560
And then one day I asked myself,
well, who instructed them?

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.660
My grandparents were
born when the light bulb

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.640
was relatively new.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.020
What did they know?

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.150
It was about survival.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.540
Would we have enough food?

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.450
Would we be able to
keep warm at night?

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.450
So there came the day when
I realized my parents were

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.815
doing the best they could.

00:07:59.815 --> 00:08:01.440
My father lived
through the Depression.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.970
I hardly ever saw him.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.630
He had a wholesale toy
business before the big toy

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:10.200
companies came along and all
the little toy stores went away.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.790
And I would say my mom was very
lonely and probably depressed

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.620
because my dad was never around.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.390
And so I didn't
have a male mentor.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:24.840
I didn't have a male role model
and that affected my childhood

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.350
and my outlook on life.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:32.370
So when you look at-- does
anyone blame their parents

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.319
for anything?

00:08:33.319 --> 00:08:34.549
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:39.720
I just hear smiles, and they
didn't do anything wrong.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.690
Keep in mind, you
may have spent time

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.730
with your grandparents,
who shower you

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.030
with love because they didn't
have to deal with your growing

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.630
years.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.910
But what was it like
for your parents

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.040
to grow up with
your grandparents

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.540
and if your
grandparents split up

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.770
and if your parents split up?

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.100
So there's this disruption
that goes on in relationships

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.690
and it affects all of us.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.010
OK, OK, we're going to
do a quick exercise.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.390
Everyone has a handout.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.120
Empathy-- there's the
dictionary definition.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.890
The ability to
share and understand

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.640
the feelings of another.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.780
How-- anyone want to describe
empathy what comes to mind?

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.600
When you think of
empathy, there's

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.180
a phrase that's fairly common.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.430
AUDIENCE: Feeling other's pain.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.440
MICHAEL JASCZ:
Feeling others pain.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.507
MICHAEL JASCZ: Putting
yourself in somebody else's--

00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:34.370
AUDIENCE: Shoes.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.983
MICHAEL JASCZ: Right,
but putting yours--

00:09:36.983 --> 00:09:38.900
you can't put yourself
in someone else's shoes

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.950
when they're going
through a difficult time.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.050
So I'd like everyone
to pick a partner, an A

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:49.010
and a B. The simplest would be
A would have the longest hair.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.590
And if you have the
long hair but it's up,

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.500
let's do this quickly.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.810
Get the-- everyone has
the empathy exercise

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.230
if you'll take a look at it.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.240
So what A is going
to do and B, A you're

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.050
going to turn to B.
You're going to tell them

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.120
something that annoyed
or disappointed you

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.190
about transportation the subway
into work, something that

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.010
happened at home with your
sink, something that happened

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.260
at work with a computer,
something simple

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.670
not something tragic like my
building blew up yesterday.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.750
There was a gas explosion.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.980
Something simple.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:28.850
Take a second.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:29.550
Think about it.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.760
Everybody can think of
something that's annoyed them.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.940
So B, you're going
to go down the list.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.470
One after another
you can say, you

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.820
think you had a tough
time getting to work.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.960
Let me tell you about me.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.580
One upping.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.160
Has anyone experienced
one upping?

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.280
Yes.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.090
Or, you know, maybe you
should get up earlier.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:52.190
Has anyone experienced
unrequested advice?

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.960
Yes.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.960
OK, so we're going to
practice empathy blocking.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.990
Then we're going to
practice empathic, what

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.520
we call empathic listening.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.027
And there are books this thick
on the neuroscience of empathy.

00:11:06.027 --> 00:11:07.860
But we're going to do
something very simple.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.360
So A are you ready?

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.270
Turn to B. Tell
them something that

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.950
annoyed or disappointed you.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.377
And B, you go down the
list and block empathy.

00:11:16.377 --> 00:11:39.750
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.430
MICHAEL JASCZ: B,
you tell A something

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.340
annoyed or disappointed
you and see if you

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.810
can look in their left eye.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.160
Stay connected.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.330
And partner A, you will
enjoy blocking empathy

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.280
as it sounds like you
are enjoying this.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.600
OK, again.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.890
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.810
So now, you're going to do what
we call empathic listening.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.270
A, say the same thing to B.
And B, if you can imagine,

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:06.360
this is someone your partner,
someone you really love them.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.730
You care about them.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.930
It's someone you would
like to be closer with.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.532
You-- they're going to just say.

00:12:11.532 --> 00:12:12.990
I had a rough time
getting in here,

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.820
and you're going to
look at them and say.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.140
I hear you.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.290
Like you really-- and then
say, is there more to that.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.790
Tell me more.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:25.410
That is our simple approach
to empathy is to simply say.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.228
I mean, even when I'm
on the elevator now.

00:12:27.228 --> 00:12:28.770
And someone gets
in, they go, I can't

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.100
believe the weather today.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.640
This is my Italian
Brooklyn accent.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.520
You know, I can't
believe-- and you know,

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.480
I can't understand why the Mets
can't win a game, you know.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.740
And I say, I hear you.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.900
That's all I say is I hear you.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.220
And you should see the
look on people's face.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.990
So A turn to B. Tell them again
something, and you're just--

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.050
B is simply just going
to say I hear you.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.840
Tell me more as best
you can sincerely,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.732
imagining that person they
may already be someone

00:12:57.732 --> 00:12:58.690
that you're close with.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.224
OK, A again.

00:13:01.224 --> 00:13:21.430
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.570
Moving on.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:26.950
Again, and would anyone
like to share anything?

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.410
Now keep in mind
at the end, you may

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.090
want to get the contact person.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.400
This person is there
stranger, and they might

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.890
become your empathy buddy.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.600
So you call them up and say, I
got to tell you what happened.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.170
They say, tell me more.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:40.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.690
Because we all want
to be received, right?

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.040
How about when we were young.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.400
For some of us,
we'd say to whoever

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:52.600
it was, a grandparent, a
parent, caretaker, later, later.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.990
And so that leaves
something, a mark

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.810
where are we not good
enough to be heard.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.490
We all want to be received.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:02.470
This is our empathy exercise.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.540
And we have a chapter about it.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.910
And it starts with
the empathy exercise.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:12.100
OK, the ACEs-- anyone heard
of the Adverse Childhood

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.350
Experiences?

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.200
Raise your hand if
you've heard of the ACEs.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.670
OK, fair number of
people know about it.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.670
It's based on a study that
was done by the CDC and Kaiser

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:28.360
Permanente in San Diego in
the mid '90s, where they

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.580
had over 17,000 participants.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:36.040
And what they identified in
this study was that they all--

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.800
2/3 of them had
at least one ACE.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.370
Take a look at your ACEs list.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:50.170
There's three abuse, to
neglect, five family challenges.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.535
Do some of you know people
who have some of these ACEs?

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.310
And are they struggling
because of those ACEs,

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.320
but they don't
remember them maybe.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:07.200
And in modern psychology, there
is a fair amount of information

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.230
how people block
out their trauma.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.190
And then it comes.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.280
Then they realize why
they've had certain diseases.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.210
What they actually
found is that there

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.950
were health risks to this.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:25.690
The CDC is calling the ACEs the
nation's worst health crisis

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.260
and its least known
because we don't

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.540
want to talk about our shame.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:35.640
Do you go to a social event and
say, how many ACEs do you have?

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.260
I have three.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.610
Never saw my dad.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.010
My mom was depressed,
maybe mentally ill.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.800
And I don't remember anybody
holding me, saying I love you,

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.558
tucking me in a bed.

00:15:45.558 --> 00:15:47.100
And there were no
books in our house.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.230
And I have trouble reading.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.500
And I've recently realized this.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.000
And I've cried about it.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.580
In May of 2012, I saw an
article on the internet.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.240
It said suspension
days drop 85%.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.030
And there were 400,000
hits on the article.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.520
It was about a school
in Washington state

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.450
in a small town called Walla
Walla, where the principal had

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.450
gone to a talk on brain science
and found out about the ACEs.

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.240
It's a guy that loved
people, loved kids.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.530
His name is Jim Sporleder.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.223
When he realized that his
kids had ACEs, because this

00:16:26.223 --> 00:16:27.890
was an alternative
school where the kids

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:29.240
went who got thrown out.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:34.130
There was gangs, meth,
pregnancies, bullying,

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.480
other drugs.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.000
Kids would say f you to the
teacher, go to the principal,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.920
and he'd say look,
Smith, I gotta

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.520
put you out for five days.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.760
But it wouldn't be like,
you know, you're a bad kid.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.220
And you know you're going
to ruin it for everybody.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.430
Now, Smith says f
you to the teacher.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:50.180
Goes to principal.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.810
Instead of saying,
what's wrong with you?

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:57.250
He would say what
happened to you?

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.330
Well, my dad's drinking.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.227
My mom's not around.

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:00.310
There's domestic violence.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.360
The kid would calm down.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.790
And in a three year
period, suspension days

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.790
went from 796 to 135.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.430
Graduation rates
went up five times.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.970
What do our schools
want in this country?

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.780
Do we want suspension
rates to drop down?

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.859
Do we want truancy to go down?

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:21.450
Do we want grades to go up?

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.510
So this is what
happened in his school.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.220
Somehow another I
found his email.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.250
I said, great what
you're doing there.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.180
He emailed me back.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.125
Great what you're
doing in New York.

00:17:31.125 --> 00:17:32.000
He flew me out there.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.250
I gave a daylong
workshop for his staff.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.260
A week later, Jamie
Redford came in

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.350
and spent a year in the school
documenting the transformation

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.600
and made a film
called "Paper Tigers".

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.880
He's actually since made
a film called "Resilience"

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.210
and has organized a whole
movement about the ACEs

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.690
and building resilience.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.040
So what these children
experience was resilience.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.440
And what they had for the
first time in their life

00:17:54.440 --> 00:18:02.370
was a stable caring adult. ACEs
effect the brain architecture.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.820
Adrenaline and cortisol
floods into the brain's--

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.290
into the blood system.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.210
And there is an
unhealthy-- there

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.708
is a brain that has been
abused, and next to it

00:18:12.708 --> 00:18:13.500
is a healthy brain.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.175
Look at the frontal
lobe in the beginning.

00:18:17.175 --> 00:18:18.550
Do we know some
people that might

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:23.170
need some caring stable
love in their life?

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.720
The brain has plasticitiy.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.950
It can regenerate.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.900
And that's what
happened in this school.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.630
The kids' brains regenerated
because their teachers

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.630
and their administrators,
the cafeteria workers,

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.380
the janitors all agreed when
they looked at that kid,

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:45.010
they looked at a student who
had disruptive brain chemistry.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:49.540
So they saw this.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:54.160
Kids who did not have a behavior
problem had a brain problem.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.760
Does everybody get that?

00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:00.280
Can that be something we
can bring into our schools?

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.150
The toughest kids are seen
by teachers who are ready.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.990
And it takes time for a teacher,
who's been treated poorly

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.710
by students for 25 years.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.500
It might not be so
easy to see this,

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:18.430
to see that their behavior
is a coping mechanism,

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:21.130
and that their behavior
is out of their control.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.340
So we've all seen
things in the newspaper

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.670
or on the internet
about these bad kids.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.970
In April, Oprah Winfrey
went on "60 Minutes"

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.892
and talked about
trauma informed care.

00:19:32.892 --> 00:19:35.100
And said it was the most
important thing she had ever

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.630
discovered.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:42.310
She said, that boy in park
land, we have to ask what not

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:46.700
what's wrong with him,
what happened to him.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.250
Who of us was asking
that question.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.590
He was in and out
of foster homes.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.840
What was his brain
chemistry like?

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:59.650
And the worst case scenario,
which all takes us to the floor

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.610
is when there's that
kind of violence.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.790
So this is the ACEs study.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.370
I've been to six conferences,
or three conferences this year

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.000
with 600 participants,
superintendents

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.610
from whole school
districts saying,

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.620
we have to do it differently.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.850
How about that?

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.650
The change we've
been looking for,

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.500
the stories we've heard about
schools and the problems that

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.930
are there, this is the
piece of the puzzle

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.510
that may help schools become
safer and more productive.

00:20:33.282 --> 00:20:34.990
We have a piece that
we introduced called

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:38.000
nonviolent communication.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.010
And it's this book by
Marshall Rosenberg.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.840
This book changed my life.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.170
And it's what we
bring into schools.

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:52.230
And it's a major part of
what's in our curriculum.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.450
And by the way,
Jim Sporleder has

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.780
written a book called-- which
schools can now access called

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.180
"The Trauma Informed School."

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.670
And another professor
that I've met,

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:08.010
Melissa Sadin, a
very simple book,

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.190
"Teachers Guide To Trauma."

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.040
This is a typical page.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.290
There is so much
in this book that

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:19.940
could help teachers and help
parents understand and support

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.650
the children.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:26.380
OK, nonviolent communication.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.070
Has anybody
experienced this world?

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:33.090
Anybody ever been judged,
judgment, blame, shame?

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.565
Anybody grow up with this?

00:21:35.565 --> 00:21:38.240
A few of us, right?

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:45.040
OK, so we use the-- if you
look at your needs and feelings

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.170
list, what is that?

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.020
What is the needs
and feelings list?

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.660
I was taught as a boy
don't show your feelings.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:55.360
Be a man.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.800
Man up.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.470
Tony Porter points this
out in his Ted talk.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:06.120
So now look at the
needs list first.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.700
We know all these words.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.680
If you look in the
middle row, who

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.350
doesn't have a need for
harmony raise your hand?

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.940
Who doesn't have in mind
a need for peace of mind?

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.120
Who is in need for order?

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.880
Are there any
artists in the room?

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.220
Are paints scattered around?

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.670
Do you find artists don't
have the same need for order

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.610
that, well, I have
because I have an office

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.620
and I want to keep it orderly.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.500
So I have a need for order.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:41.910
Under on the right side, under
connection, how many of you

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.620
have a significant other?

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.550
Quite a few.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:51.300
Affection, acceptance,
appreciation, care, closeness,

00:22:51.300 --> 00:23:00.160
belonging, empathy, inclusion,
love, nurturing, companionship.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.650
A need at the bottom
that I realized

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:04.420
having grown up in
the situation I did,

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.580
I have a need for warmth.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.170
But I didn't know
that till I had

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:11.400
a list of what are my needs.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:16.240
So let's say teachers
what needs do they have?

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.240
Competence.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.480
What do you have at Google?

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.590
Effectiveness, efficiency,
creativity, discovery.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.110
We're not thinking
these words necessarily,

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:29.245
but they are key words for
an organization to succeed.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:38.890
Learning-- in a significant
other relationship,

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:44.970
if you communicate in the
beginning about your childhood

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.440
and what your needs are--

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.240
so let's say you
have someone that

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.910
grew up in punishing silence.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:52.740
They were alone.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:57.930
They meet someone who grew up
with hovering, micromanaging

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.700
and controlling family members.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.910
Anyone grow up in
that situation?

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.152
Nobody.

00:24:04.152 --> 00:24:05.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.370
OK, so they meet, and
they fall in love.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:11.880
But I don't fall
in love anymore.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.430
I rise in love.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:14.910
Fall.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:17.000
These are some of
the phrases we use.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.520
I'd rather rise in love.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:25.560
So quickly, the person
who needs inclusion

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.180
says, you know, I
need you need space.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.710
If you look on your needs
list, you'll see space.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:34.020
I laminate the needs
and feelings list.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.520
And I carry it with me
because I'm still learning.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.790
I have a lifetime
of conditioning.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:41.860
Space at the bottom
under autonomy.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.930
And I say, or the person
that needs inclusion says,

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:48.360
I'm going to spend more time
with my cousins and my friends

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.260
because I know you need space.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.210
What need does that
immediately meet?

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.500
Few lines Up.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.810
Safety.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:02.980
Now it's safe to be around this
person who needs inclusion, who

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.680
wants to do everything together,
and the person who's space

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.970
can say, go away.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:12.640
And that person
doesn't feel-- well,

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.000
look at your feelings list,
sad, disappointed, , anxious,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.720
frustrated, worried, confused.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.010
Now that they may
feel those feelings,

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.400
but there's a bond
has been created

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.910
where there's an understanding
about needs and feelings.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:29.710
So this is what we
bring into the classroom

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.080
is to get students
familiar with who they

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.315
are as needs, feelings, people.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.390
We go from this world.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.350
This is nonviolent
communication.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:47.860
So what do you call someone
who doesn't have any needs?

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.560
AUDIENCE: Dead.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.180
MICHAEL JASCZ: Dead, right?

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:56.160
Well, OK, so we have air,
water, shelter, food, dead.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.460
So needs are about life.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:04.035
This is about our
life force, our needs.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.980
So we can live in this world,
a world of people needs

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:10.740
and feelings.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.040
And I'll finish with
two quick stories.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.480
I live in the East Village.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.580
And I was working,
and I was going

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.580
to a class in Jackson
Heights Queens.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.790
So I had 54 kids in the class.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.535
I went and bought, they didn't
have money for journals.

00:26:26.535 --> 00:26:28.380
The kids keep journals.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:33.170
And I bought 54
journals, put them

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:37.662
in two shopping bags,
put it on my bike,

00:26:37.662 --> 00:26:38.870
didn't have a city bike then.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.670
It was a few years ago.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:43.160
And I biked to the El train.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.440
Then I went on the El
train to Union Square.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.260
And I took the six
train to Grand Central.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.850
And then I took the seven train
to Jackson Heights and got off.

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.770
And those of you who've
been on an elevated subway,

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.150
you come down partway.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.030
And there's a flat space.

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:01.970
And as I neared the flat space,
I saw someone coming up slowly.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.130
Then I saw someone with that
hurried look in their face.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.505
And I thought, if they
go around that person,

00:27:07.505 --> 00:27:08.755
I must have stopped my tracks.

00:27:08.755 --> 00:27:12.690
And I remember thinking, don't.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:13.680
They did.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.450
I stopped in my tracks.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:20.513
First words came to mind,
thoughtless, inconsiderate.

00:27:20.513 --> 00:27:21.930
I won't tell you
what words came--

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:26.143
would have come to my mind
before I started doing this.

00:27:26.143 --> 00:27:27.810
As my foot touched
the sidewalk, I said,

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.610
I wonder what their needs are.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.060
Maybe they're going to see
their aunt Eva, who has an hour

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.050
to live, who met their need for
love, appreciation, affection,

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:38.190
acceptance.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:43.110
Their strategy to meet their
needs included cutting me off.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.910
But were they a bad person?

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.600
Were they my judgments?

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.100
And I began to imagine.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.440
Maybe they save someone's life
who was drowning a month ago.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.670
Maybe they are a living
Saint in their neighborhood

00:27:55.670 --> 00:28:00.330
and helped raise money
for community services.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:04.830
And it was as though I
experienced my neuropathways.

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.930
There was-- it shifted.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.620
Neurons that fired
together wired together.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.340
There was a firing in
my brain, and I went,

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.720
I don't have to judge people.

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:21.733
Does everybody see
how this can happen?

00:28:21.733 --> 00:28:22.900
You're riding down the road.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.330
Somebody cuts you off, right?

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.100
You roll down your
window and you say,

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.070
that didn't meet my need
for safety and stability.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:35.170
No, you idiot, or
some other words.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:37.450
But maybe they save
someone's life.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.400
Maybe they're a living Saint.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.460
Maybe they're rushing to pick
up their child at school.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.120
The lights have gone off.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.340
And it's getting dark and
they're ride didn't come.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.977
Do I drive up to them?

00:28:49.977 --> 00:28:51.310
Say, could you pull over please?

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:55.090
I went, I need to interview you,
find out why you cut me off.

00:28:55.090 --> 00:29:00.480
No, but I don't have to carry
this anger and resentment.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.830
And I still get triggered.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:04.170
I ride my bike
everywhere in the city.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.810
When cabs get too
close to me, you

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.210
don't want to know what I think.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:12.210
But I don't drive
up to the stoplight

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:14.160
because of course,
they had to stop.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.920
They didn't have to
get so close to me.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.140
But I don't do this, hey,
you want to kill somebody?

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.110
I could use the money
from the insurance.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:26.440
It's like, I don't know
who's in the backseat.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.530
Are they rushing to
a hospital to-- is

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.390
somebody about to give birth?

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:34.440
Are they sending someone
with medical assistance

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.460
to save someone's life?

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.540
So we can use our
minds to imagine

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.990
what's right with people,
what's OK with them,

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:44.910
and not our judgments.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:49.145
So I highly recommend my book.

00:29:49.145 --> 00:29:52.580
It has a chapter on
nonviolent communication

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.260
and a chapter on empathy.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.530
And we have journal entries
before chapter and definitely

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.870
nonviolent communication.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:01.860
This could change the world.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:05.190
And it's a major part
of our curriculum.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:09.470
And I thank everybody for
coming today and hearing

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:11.037
about the ACEs.

00:30:11.037 --> 00:30:12.620
You'll be hearing
about it a lot more.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:17.300
The trauma informed school
movement is exploding.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.790
And schools around
the country are

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:23.960
saying let's be
there for these kids

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.150
because when you
don't punish them

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:32.000
and re traumatize them, after
a while the teacher says,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.950
are you having a bad day?

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:35.000
F you.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.500
Did you have breakfast
this morning?

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.590
Come on to the cafeteria.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.320
When you stop getting
punishment, getting punished,

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.410
what's the alternative?

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:44.630
What else should I do?

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:48.560
I'll study, and that's
why at Lincoln High,

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.310
graduation rates
went up five times.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.910
And our goal is to make a
contribution to the education

00:30:55.910 --> 00:31:01.910
system so that we will have more
productive safe and successful

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:05.120
schools, and to bring this to
the parents and the teachers

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.970
so we have a more
harmonious society.

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:12.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.650
HENRY FAULKNER:
Thank you, Michael,

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:17.720
since we have a
little bit of time.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.340
I have a few
questions, and we're

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.490
going to also open up
the mics on the side

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:24.105
if you've got questions for
Michael about the program.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.650
I think there is sort of
this kind of two buckets.

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:32.960
One is on relationships and
how we are in the world.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.840
And the other is
the work of taking

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.430
this curriculum
and this training

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:40.430
and bringing it into schools.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:41.300
I'm curious.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.790
Thinking at scale,
what do you think

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.880
it would take for a
relationship training like

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.020
to be in mass like a part
of the common education

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:51.980
system in the US?

00:31:54.218 --> 00:31:55.510
MICHAEL JASCZ: It's a movement.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.820
There is actually a
movement that's growing.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.330
And I think through
educational publications,

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.300
through teacher and
administrator publications,

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.120
and there's many-- there's--

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.910
principal conferences.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.010
There's teacher trainings.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:15.190
The subject gets brought
up and explained.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:18.460
And teachers and
parents and ministers

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:23.230
look at the brains, the
structure of the brain.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:27.370
How can we contribute to
the regeneration of neurons

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:31.180
in this students brain
chemistry so that they

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:35.170
will be successful
and a contributor,

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.050
and that the school
feel like their home.

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:42.130
HENRY FAULKNER: So then thinking
locally on this as a parent,

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:44.620
yes, I want this in
my child's school.

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:50.560
What do you encourage parents
to do to make this happen?

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.450
MICHAEL JASCZ: Parents, first
of all, have limited time.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:57.280
Most are working.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.860
At night, there are
responsibilities in childcare.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:04.510
As best as possibly, get
to parent, parent-teacher

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:09.550
meetings, and/or at least
be communicating and inquire

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:13.420
is there something going
on around this trauma

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:17.200
informed school movement, trauma
sensitive school movement?

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.790
We're very interested in it.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:20.150
We'd like to know about it.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:26.290
We'd like to have it
considered for our school

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:30.760
because we've heard that
it can bring about change

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.650
that can make a difference.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:36.020
HENRY FAULKNER: OK, in terms
of sort of the audience here

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.080
at Google and a lot of
technologists and people

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.580
who create tools, how do
you think, what can we

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:46.090
do to make technology
foster relationships

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:50.540
rather than be something
that divides us?

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.028
MICHAEL JASCZ: I'm not sure.

00:33:52.028 --> 00:33:53.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.855
Technology has saved
lives in many ways.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:05.380
I find it hard to read
something that's harsh.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.540
I guess it's called trolling.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.250
It just hurts.

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:14.830
I actually physically know who
is-- but I think-- but I'm also

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:17.580
thinking, who is that person?

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.420
What are they going through?

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.679
What--

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:24.780
Instead of my judgments,
what a jerk, what,

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.420
who, how could they say this?

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.400
It's changed the way I think.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.750
I don't like it.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:31.980
But I feel pain.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.060
I feel sad.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:42.760
But I-- technology, it
can bring people closer.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.070
It can-- it's a way to
stay in touch with people.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:50.020
And just a quick note,
caring, thinking about you,

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.219
how's your day?

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:55.540
Something like that can
pick you up, make your day.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:59.650
And instead of maybe
statements and judgments,

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:01.270
what do you think about this?

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.880
A lot on people's
minds are politics.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:13.830
And because I've
learned not to judge,

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:16.980
and I still judge when
I see things going on

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.880
in the political world.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.030
But I'm not making
that person wrong

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:24.460
because I don't know what
their childhood was like.

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.620
I don't know what their
brain chemistry is like.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:32.790
I know their strategy to meet
their need for acceptance,

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:39.630
appreciation, community,
included a strategy to say,

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:40.528
we like these people.

00:35:40.528 --> 00:35:41.820
But we don't like those people.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.240
So, and that I feel sad.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.920
HENRY FAULKNER: This
is interesting is

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.060
I think when we
talk about empathy,

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.700
I'm thinking about
this other person

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.640
and how can I think about them.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.820
But when you describe
like, oh, try

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.000
to-- when you're
reading trolling reviews

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.960
and having some empathy
for the person there,

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.970
that seems like that's for me.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:07.620
That's something,
that almost seems

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.431
like empathy is self-defense.

00:36:12.139 --> 00:36:13.222
MICHAEL JASCZ: I hear you.

00:36:13.222 --> 00:36:15.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.470
I wouldn't say I have--

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:22.280
that empathy comes up for me.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:28.130
It's more what do I feel,
my feeling, and noticing

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:32.270
that I'm just not judging.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:34.730
Mary Louise is our office
manager sitting here.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:39.770
Corinne is our intern
from Dartmouth University.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:45.055
Have you heard me say any
judgment words about anyone?

00:36:45.055 --> 00:36:46.840
AUDIENCE: Never.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.130
MICHAEL JASCZ: Except
myself maybe, right?

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:54.340
Because it brings
the atmosphere down.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.290
I don't know what's
wrong with somebody.

00:36:56.290 --> 00:37:00.170
I'm just wondering what
their unmet needs are.

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:01.730
What are our unmet needs.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:05.560
And I just also want to mention
while people are still here,

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.520
in New York, there's
an amazing organization

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.820
called New York Center for
nonviolent communication.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.160
NYCNVC.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.310
And they have monthly--

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:18.400
the first Monday
of the month, they

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:23.080
have a bi donation, whatever you
can spare for an introduction

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.520
to NVC.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:29.320
NYCNVC is-- that's where I've
learned most of what I know

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.590
about nonviolent communication.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:34.660
And we don't-- this
word nonviolent.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.760
We don't think of ourself
as violent people.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.240
We associate it with wars
and beatings and killings.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.200
But are some of the words
we say hurtful and have

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.760
a lot of hurtful words between
countries led to violence?

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.430
Hey, your country stinks.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.060
Hey, your country stinks, too.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.828
All right, let's go to war.

00:37:54.828 --> 00:37:55.870
We can do it differently.

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:57.453
I think that's usually
how it happens.

00:37:57.453 --> 00:37:58.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.150
HENRY FAULKNER: All right,
so one last question

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:04.605
is that, I mean, obviously,
there's graduation rates

00:38:04.605 --> 00:38:05.480
and things like this.

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:09.520
But in terms of just applying
this in our relationships,

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.080
how are we going to
know we got this right?

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.340
Like what's the metric.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.090
What should we be looking at?

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:18.100
We're all-- there's a lot
of data scientist here.

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.900
We like numbers.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:26.140
MICHAEL JASCZ: OK, I only
have one number for you

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.793
at the moment.

00:38:27.793 --> 00:38:29.210
My friend Marissa's
in the office.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:31.650
She's a relationship
extraordinaire.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:33.770
We've coached couples together.

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:36.580
And one of the very
first things that

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:40.120
as couples when we meet
couples, they're blaming,

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.550
shaming, right,
wrong, should, should.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:48.790
We have them practice
saying tell me more.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:49.690
I hear you.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:53.590
Not defending, not
criticizing back.

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:54.550
I hear you.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:55.670
Tell me more.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:57.880
And we can see
the transformation

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.330
in their faces and
their physiology.

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.370
It's to add that
to your vocabulary.

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:05.090
It doesn't mean you won't
criticize and defend,

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:09.290
because that's been our
programming for a lot of--

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:10.540
but simple words.

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.580
I hear you.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.840
Is there more to that?

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.780
Tell me more.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:15.950
And what are you feeling?

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:17.760
What are you needing?

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.930
Do you need affection,
acceptance, appreciation?

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:25.320
Are you feeling
like you need space.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.670
Let's meet up in 20
minutes because I

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:30.280
had the toughest day at work.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.080
I need space.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.130
I need connection.

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:38.260
That's the key word that I get
from nonviolent communication

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.680
is connection, connection,
connection, connection, which

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.900
seems to go on here,
a focus on connection

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.420
because you're
connecting the world.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.230
And here you have
the opportunity

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:52.620
to connect with each other.

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.850
HENRY FAULKNER: Well, and on
that note, thank you very much,

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:57.280
Michael, pleasure.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.030
[APPLAUSE]
