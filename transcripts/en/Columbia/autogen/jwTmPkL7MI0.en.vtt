but the support of assisted suicide is
around its lower surround forty percent

00:45:58.819 --> 00:45:58.829
around its lower surround forty percent
 

00:45:58.829 --> 00:46:02.999
around its lower surround forty percent
weight is difference because I mean that

Indian assist in the United States
 

00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:07.859
Indian assist in the United States
should be is exactly the concert

a now here the support of uterine

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:11.650
a now here the support of uterine
 

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:15.930
a now here the support of uterine
euthanasia soso but in fact you have two

states the half baths regulation of
 

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:26.539
states the half baths regulation of
assisted suicide and why the difference

00:46:26.539 --> 00:46:26.549
 

00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:29.910
I think it we put a bigger emphasis on

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920
I think it we put a bigger emphasis on
 

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:33.720

assisted suicide or making this early
Earth like that before someone's helping

00:46:40.109 --> 00:46:40.119
Earth like that before someone's helping

this is the point so in the United

00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359
this is the point so in the United
 

00:46:49.359 --> 00:46:51.420
this is the point so in the United
States for you the consideration of

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:51.430
States for you the consideration of
 

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:55.410
States for you the consideration of
autonomy is so important than do you

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:55.420
autonomy is so important than do you
 

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.420

have to preserve abbr tana me until the

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:57.430
have to preserve abbr tana me until the
 

00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:02.279
have to preserve abbr tana me until the
end so you have to take the drugs so if

00:47:02.279 --> 00:47:02.289
end so you have to take the drugs so if
 

00:47:02.289 --> 00:47:04.140
end so you have to take the drugs so if
you are taking the drugs this is your

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:04.150
you are taking the drugs this is your
 

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:07.190
you are taking the drugs this is your
problem this is your decision and some

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200
problem this is your decision and some
 

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.829
problem this is your decision and some
aspects but in Europe this is not so

00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839
aspects but in Europe this is not so
 

00:47:10.839 --> 00:47:14.130
aspects but in Europe this is not so
important so because we have to consider

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:14.140
important so because we have to consider
 

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:17.069
important so because we have to consider
but many for example in Spain many many

00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:17.079
but many for example in Spain many many
 

00:47:17.079 --> 00:47:20.220
but many for example in Spain many many
people should be scared about about the

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:20.230
people should be scared about about the
 

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:24.180
people should be scared about about the
idea of taking the drugs by their own so

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:24.190
idea of taking the drugs by their own so
 

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:27.329
idea of taking the drugs by their own so
they prefer the help of a health curve

00:47:27.329 --> 00:47:27.339
they prefer the help of a health curve
 

00:47:27.339 --> 00:47:30.809
they prefer the help of a health curve
but here in the states not you prefer to

00:47:30.809 --> 00:47:30.819
but here in the states not you prefer to
 

00:47:30.819 --> 00:47:33.420
but here in the states not you prefer to
preserve the freedom and the autonomy

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:33.430
preserve the freedom and the autonomy
 

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:35.849
preserve the freedom and the autonomy
until the end this is a warranty of this

00:47:35.849 --> 00:47:35.859
until the end this is a warranty of this
 

00:47:35.859 --> 00:47:37.739
until the end this is a warranty of this
as a sister she say I mean this is the

00:47:37.739 --> 00:47:37.749
as a sister she say I mean this is the
 

00:47:37.749 --> 00:47:39.210
as a sister she say I mean this is the
difference and i have to say that

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:39.220
difference and i have to say that
 

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:42.239
difference and i have to say that
probably many people in spain really

00:47:42.239 --> 00:47:42.249
probably many people in spain really
 

00:47:42.249 --> 00:47:43.950
probably many people in spain really
doesn't understand clearly what is

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:43.960
doesn't understand clearly what is
 

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:48.890
doesn't understand clearly what is
assisted suicide i have to say also this

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:48.900
 

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:52.960
well

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:52.970
 

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.880
andalusia started but then to other

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:55.890
andalusia started but then to other
 

00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:59.420
andalusia started but then to other
regions have developed similar laws and

00:47:59.420 --> 00:47:59.430
regions have developed similar laws and
 

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:06.200
regions have developed similar laws and
a draft of a basic law a federal law was

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:06.210
a draft of a basic law a federal law was
 

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:10.150
a draft of a basic law a federal law was
prepared and went to the Parliament in

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160
prepared and went to the Parliament in
 

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:15.040
prepared and went to the Parliament in
2011 but then we went on elections and

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:15.050
2011 but then we went on elections and
 

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:18.200
2011 but then we went on elections and
so now this draft probably the new

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:18.210
so now this draft probably the new
 

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:20.330
so now this draft probably the new
government that is a conservative goblin

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:20.340
government that is a conservative goblin
 

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.990
government that is a conservative goblin
is has decided not to continue with the

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000
is has decided not to continue with the
 

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.660
is has decided not to continue with the
debate of this draft so probably the

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:26.670
debate of this draft so probably the
 

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.570
debate of this draft so probably the
regulation this type of regulations

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:29.580
regulation this type of regulations
 

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.790
regulation this type of regulations
probably will remain in these three

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800
probably will remain in these three
 

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:35.599
probably will remain in these three
regions for a lot of time and we will

00:48:35.599 --> 00:48:35.609
regions for a lot of time and we will
 

00:48:35.609 --> 00:48:37.670
regions for a lot of time and we will
not have a federal regulation I mean it

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680
not have a federal regulation I mean it
 

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:41.450
not have a federal regulation I mean it
is a pity but this is the situation so

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:41.460
is a pity but this is the situation so
 

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:44.450
is a pity but this is the situation so
of all the contents I am going just to

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:44.460
of all the contents I am going just to
 

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.910
of all the contents I am going just to
refer to this point because I mean this

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920
refer to this point because I mean this
 

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.089
refer to this point because I mean this
is the most interest and you can

00:48:50.089 --> 00:48:50.099
is the most interest and you can
 

00:48:50.099 --> 00:48:53.510
is the most interest and you can
probably the debate about what is

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520
probably the debate about what is
 

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:57.560
probably the debate about what is
futility is quite similar we have the

00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:57.570
futility is quite similar we have the
 

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:00.310
futility is quite similar we have the
same problems that you have probably I

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:00.320
same problems that you have probably I
 

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:05.500
same problems that you have probably I
am going to try to show you this before

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:05.510
am going to try to show you this before
 

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:08.260
am going to try to show you this before
for example the andalusia before that

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:08.270
for example the andalusia before that
 

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:11.329
for example the andalusia before that
the law is law this is the law from the

Lucia and do some important questions

00:49:16.579 --> 00:49:16.589
Lucia and do some important questions
 

00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:21.349
Lucia and do some important questions
for example includes criteria to

00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359
for example includes criteria to
 

00:49:21.359 --> 00:49:23.930
for example includes criteria to
stablish the capacity of people and if

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:23.940
stablish the capacity of people and if
 

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.810
stablish the capacity of people and if
you if you are familiar with the dis

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:26.820
you if you are familiar with the dis
 

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:29.810
you if you are familiar with the dis
criteria standards you will find

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:29.820
criteria standards you will find
 

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.630
criteria standards you will find
something interesting if the patient has

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640
something interesting if the patient has
 

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.660
something interesting if the patient has
so you have to evaluate if the patient

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:35.670
so you have to evaluate if the patient
 

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:37.570
so you have to evaluate if the patient
has difficulty in comprehending

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:37.580
has difficulty in comprehending
 

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:42.109
has difficulty in comprehending
information I am going to leave this if

00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119
information I am going to leave this if
 

00:49:42.119 --> 00:49:44.480
information I am going to leave this if
the patient does not use information in

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:44.490
the patient does not use information in
 

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:46.579
the patient does not use information in
a logical way during the decision-making

00:49:46.579 --> 00:49:46.589
a logical way during the decision-making
 

00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:49.040
a logical way during the decision-making
process if the patient fails to

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:49.050
process if the patient fails to
 

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:52.060
process if the patient fails to
appreciate the possible outcome of

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:52.070
appreciate the possible outcome of
 

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:54.320
appreciate the possible outcome of
different alternatives and if the

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:54.330
different alternatives and if the
 

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:56.599
different alternatives and if the
patient is unable to milk to make a

00:49:56.599 --> 00:49:56.609
patient is unable to milk to make a
 

00:49:56.609 --> 00:50:00.250
patient is unable to milk to make a
final decision

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:00.260
 

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:03.130
some idea about where this criteria

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:03.140
some idea about where this criteria
 

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:07.590
some idea about where this criteria
coming from are you familiar with the

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:07.600
coming from are you familiar with the
 

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.910
coming from are you familiar with the
standards to evaluate capacity of

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920
standards to evaluate capacity of
 

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.480
standards to evaluate capacity of
patients now this hardly create the

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:13.490
patients now this hardly create the
 

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:18.580
patients now this hardly create the
standards of upper bound this this this

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:18.590
standards of upper bound this this this
 

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:22.090
standards of upper bound this this this
and this these are the more famous are

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:22.100
and this these are the more famous are
 

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.950
and this these are the more famous are
more important standards to evaluate

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:23.960
more important standards to evaluate
 

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:27.310
more important standards to evaluate
capacity that we have and we have also

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:27.320
capacity that we have and we have also
 

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:32.760
capacity that we have and we have also
add this one that it deals with memory

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:32.770
add this one that it deals with memory

until the end so this is the way that

01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360
until the end so this is the way that

many physicists have been thinking until

01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640
many physicists have been thinking until
 

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:24.140
many physicists have been thinking until
now probably even now many cases are

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:24.150
now probably even now many cases are
 

01:17:24.150 --> 01:17:26.450
now probably even now many cases are
doing that but I mean that the framework

01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:26.460
doing that but I mean that the framework
 

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:31.010
doing that but I mean that the framework
is allowing them to to take the decision

01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:31.020
is allowing them to to take the decision
 

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.500
is allowing them to to take the decision
in another way feeling because because

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:33.510
in another way feeling because because
