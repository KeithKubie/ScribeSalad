&gt;&gt; HELENA: Hi, I'm Helena and I work on the
Android 2 experience. One of the things I

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.090
like best about the phone is what you can
do during a phone call. You can look up one

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.050
of your contacts, you can look up something
on Maps, or you can surf the Internet. Okay,

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:22.199
let me show you.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.570
Hi, Emma.
&gt;&gt; EMMA: Helena?

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.880
&gt;&gt; HELENA: Hi, are you doing?
&gt;&gt; EMMA: Good. How are you?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:35.979
&gt;&gt; HELENA: Pretty good. What’s up?
&gt;&gt; EMMA: I'm trying to find Lombard Street

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:36.219
where it gets all curvy, and I’m at Polk
&amp; Lombard. How much farther do I have to go?

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.449
&gt;&gt; HELENA: I don’t know for sure, but I
can look it up. Let me check on Maps.

00:00:39.449 --> 00:01:00.780
&gt;&gt; EMMA: Okay.
&gt;&gt; HELENA: Hold on for a sec.
Okay, I'm looking it up as we speak.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.449
All right, Emma, you're only two blocks away.
Just keep going east and you’ll get there.
