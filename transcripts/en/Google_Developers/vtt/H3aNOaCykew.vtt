00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.080
My name is Ali.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.820
I came to Istanbul
about two years ago

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.150
with a multinational company.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.460
I love Istanbul.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.060
I love the city, but
I just hated traffic.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.700
I realized that 8 out
of 10 cars in traffic

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.430
have only the driver.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.830
And I decided to do
something about it.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.580
One interesting thing
is I started fundraising

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.620
at the same time as well.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.470
And one investor was
like this will never

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.490
work here because this is
not part of the culture.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.900
And I kind of
disagreed with him,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.900
and I took it as a challenge
to prove him wrong.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.670
So I started
hitchhiking in the city.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.750
And it's like in Istanbul
doing that you should be crazy

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.560
or an entrepreneur.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.350
So I started hitchhiking.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.281
And obviously,
hitchhiking on the street,

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:51.280
no one will pick you up.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.950
But I hitchhike inside
the residential compound

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.690
where I live, where there
is gated security, which

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.590
is the main feature.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.910
It's one of our biggest
features, which is communities.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.110
People trust each other
inside communities.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.740
I hitchhike and the first car--
the first time I tried it,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.040
the first car stopped
and picked me up.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.420
And this was the
idea behind launching

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.950
Volt around communities.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.030
This is where it came to life.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.310
It's not just a market place.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.071
It's not only about drivers
offering their empty seats

00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:23.820
to passengers going
in the same direction.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.470
It's not only about
supply and demand.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.520
In our case, we have
so many parts moving.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.510
So you have drivers
driving around,

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.460
and passengers going
in the same direction.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.140
But they need to be going in
the same direction from point A

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.290
to point B at the same time.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.240
So that's a fourth element.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.920
And they need to
trust each other.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.920
So we call it a five
vector marketplace.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.330
It's not only supply and demand.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.220
It's not only chicken and egg.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.230
It's supply, demand,
geolocation, time, and trust.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.360
And that's really one of
the toughest challenges

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.280
we have to crack.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.780
And we're still working on.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.460
To solve one aspect
is the communities,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.850
which we already spoke about.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.290
We launched inside universities,
inside big companies.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.800
We launched inside big
residential compounds.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.614
Which solves anyway,
the geolocation.

00:02:12.614 --> 00:02:14.030
The time, because
most people come

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.770
to this building at the same
time, leave at the same time.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.190
And the trust, because if
I see-- even if there's

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.370
someone who works at Google
or at Procter and Gamble

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.810
that I don't know, there's
a chance the company is big.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.151
If I see the logo of this
company on their profile,

00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:31.150
it means that they have
an email at this company

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.770
so I can trust them.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.620
The way we've
solved it is we made

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.510
it effortless for
the driver to use.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.780
Before, we required planning.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.500
So we required you to say, hey,
I'm leaving today at 8:00 PM.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.400
But in inner city, things
have to be real time.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.320
And that's a big
learning we've learned.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.910
So we made it effortless for
the driver to use, in the sense

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.780
that you don't have to plan.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.190
You just have to
fire up the apps

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.590
and just say start driving.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.460
When you fire up the
app and start driving,

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.070
your earn Volt miles for
every kilometer you travel.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.480
So for every kilometer,
you earn one mile.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.385
If you get a passenger,
you earn two miles.

00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:10.010
And then there are
other rules that can

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.301
make you accelerate your miles.

00:03:11.301 --> 00:03:14.800
And these miles-- you can use
them for gifts or discounts

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.900
at certain outlets.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.280
So it makes it engaging for the
driver to stay on the system

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.510
because it's effortless.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.800
And there's gamification
with the miles.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.400
You see levels and everything.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.080
So the drivers
will stick around,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.790
and are sticking around.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.232
And at the same
time, passengers,

00:03:29.232 --> 00:03:30.690
whenever they fire
up the app, they

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.355
see drivers moving on the map,
which gets the marketplace

00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:35.590
to start rolling.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.140
