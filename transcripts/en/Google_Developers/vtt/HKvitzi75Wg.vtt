TODD KERPELMAN: Hello, there.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.170
I'm Todd Kerpelman for
the Developer Show,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.660
and this is your update on
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.330
from Google in the last week.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.000
A few weeks ago at Google I/O,
we released a major update

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.690
to AR core, Google's augmented
reality development platform.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.340
We built some
experiences to showcase

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.940
how the new API
has come to life,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.290
including this totally fun
multiplayer game that I played,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.090
and they are now open-sourced.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.952
So to see these
experiences in action,

00:00:25.952 --> 00:00:27.660
get some insights from
behind the scenes,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.610
and find links to
the GitHub repos,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.915
head on over to the
post in the link below.

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:34.540
The latest What's
New in Chrome is out,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.240
highlighting everything
new in Chrome 67.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.100
Check out the post and
video to learn more

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.190
about desktop Progressive
Web Apps, the Generic Sensor

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.970
API, and BigInts.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.800
Oh, I like BigInts,
and I cannot lie.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.510
As you may have
heard, on May 25,

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.360
a new piece of European
legislation came into force--

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.330
the General Data Protection
Regulation, or GDPR,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.216
as the cool kids
like to call it.

00:00:57.216 --> 00:00:58.840
The Firebase team
has been working hard

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.464
over the past few
months to help ensure

00:01:00.464 --> 00:01:02.290
that you have the
resources you need

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.040
to comply with
these regulations,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.700
including new
GDPR-friendly terms, a way

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.090
to specify a data processing
officer or EU representative

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.420
in the Firebase console, as
well as new doxxing guides.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.310
Check out the post for
screenshots and links

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.330
to everything.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.180
Also, you now have another email
from some company about how

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.030
they've updated
their privacy policy,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.490
and maybe you should read it.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.860
Data Studio is Google's next gen
business intelligence and data

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.620
visualization platform,
and community connections

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.720
for Data Studio let
you build connectors

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.450
to internet-accessible data
sources using Google Apps

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.370
Script, which means
that you can view data

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.460
from many different sources
in one convenient report.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.260
Check out the post
for some more detail

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.780
as well as a link to the new
Community Connector code lab

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.140
so you can get started today.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.240
As part of our constant
efforts to improve

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.640
Google's OAuth
application ecosystem,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.230
we're launching
additional protections

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.410
that can limit the spread
of malicious applications.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.300
Apps requiring OAuth
will be subject

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.620
to a daily total new user cap
and a new user acquisition rate

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.690
limit, although these
rates will initially

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.150
be set to something close
to your app's current usage.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.030
So the impact for most of
you should be pretty minimal.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.970
But for more details and a link
to request a rate limit quota

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.635
increase, head on
over to the post.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:16.510
So there you have it.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.400

subscribe, and share.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.190
I'm Todd Kerpelman for
the Developer Show.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.910
Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.732
Crazy 2's-- 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:29.690
Oh, I kicked something.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.590
Sorry.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.440
[LAUGHTER]
