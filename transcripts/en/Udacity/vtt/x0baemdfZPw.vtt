00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.650
All right, we're almost at the end now.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.800
Hopefully you've had a lot of fun and
interesting experiences playing around

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.210
with Photocraft and
computation at the same time.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.350
We've actually had a lot
of interesting lectures.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.680
Hopefully you've enjoyed all of
the material we've covered so

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.160
far and all of the fun assignments
that you've gone through

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.960
to learn about the building blocks
of computational photography.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.140
While the lecture part of
this class is over now,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.540
I actually do want to say that I'm
going to be now adding on Piazza and

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.050
other types of sites, a variety
of additional advanced concepts.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.390
These will be in forms of research
papers, websites and videos.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.070
I do want you to look at all
of this material, study it and

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.840
engage with me and the rest of the class
in a variety of conversations on what

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.970
you think about these advanced concepts.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.257
These are concepts that could be
practical to the kinds of things that

00:00:45.257 --> 00:00:48.140
you've seen in existing
software packages that you use,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.450
to much more researchy,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.100
kind of pointing a direction towards
future of computational photography.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.170
I'm going to try to come up with
a variety of interesting topics.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.380
Again, my request is,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.040
engage with this material on Piazza,
chat with each other.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.976
We're going to have a lot of fun
trying to play around with a variety

00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:06.920
of topics in this area.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.840
But again, it's new advanced
concepts that I think you'll enjoy.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.040
With that, I'd just like to say thank
you, it's been a lot of fun and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.490
remember, have fun
computing with photographs.
