00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.100
every breath of air that we take there's
about a million particles of dust and if

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.750
you can imagine you're trying to build
lasers to the size that they're a

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.270
hundred times smaller than the width of
a single human hair where there's all

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.489
these giant things floating around its
approximately like trying to do

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:26.279
chemistry in a chemistry lab when you
got blimps floating around in the room

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.730
and so if one of these blimps lands on
your chemistry experiment your experiment

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.430
is ruined and we see the same sort of
things with our lasers if we have a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.120
particle of dust that lands in the wrong
place it will ruin our laser or whatever

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.089
else you're trying to make so at UC San
Diego we have a giant clean room

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.120
facility and they've got impressive
filters that are just filtering and

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.989
filtering out all this dust as best they
can and so they've got it down from

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.339
a million particles of dust in every
breath of air to something like ten to a

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.650
hundred particles but to keep the dust
that low they have to wear these full

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.970
body suits and that's not so much to
protect us from the things in the clean

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.549
room its to protect the cleanroom from
us so that we keep our personal dust

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.480
contained and keep it out of the clean
room

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.900
