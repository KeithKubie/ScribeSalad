particular when it comes to the young
generations one of the most serious

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390
generations one of the most serious
 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.980
generations one of the most serious
topics we see this not only in the world

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990
topics we see this not only in the world
 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.680
topics we see this not only in the world
but also in Turkey when I look into

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690
but also in Turkey when I look into
 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.740
but also in Turkey when I look into
Turkey roughly 400,000 graduates every

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750
Turkey roughly 400,000 graduates every
 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.779
Turkey roughly 400,000 graduates every
year and a huge percentage of them are

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789
year and a huge percentage of them are
 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.790
year and a huge percentage of them are
unemployed and I think what we in

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
unemployed and I think what we in
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.220
unemployed and I think what we in
particular have to do is focus to bring

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
particular have to do is focus to bring
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.960

and give this young generation

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970
and give this young generation
 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.060
and give this young generation
opportunity now I think the technology

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
opportunity now I think the technology
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.470
opportunity now I think the technology
overall that we are having it gives us a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480
overall that we are having it gives us a
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.160
overall that we are having it gives us a
young generation a chance actually to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
young generation a chance actually to
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.130
young generation a chance actually to
start their career early enough and for

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
start their career early enough and for
 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.869
start their career early enough and for
this we have to in particular I believe

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879
this we have to in particular I believe
 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.940
this we have to in particular I believe
strongly to use the social media

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950
strongly to use the social media
 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.940

generation a chance but investing for
them is of course also to being very

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
them is of course also to being very
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.330
them is of course also to being very
much proactive and I think that is

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340
much proactive and I think that is
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.000
much proactive and I think that is
actually the future education proactive

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010
actually the future education proactive
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.760
actually the future education proactive
