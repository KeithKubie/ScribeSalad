MARCEL: Please help me
welcome Dr. Ivan Paulino-Lima.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.630
IVAN PAULINO-LIMA: Thank you,
Marcel for the invitation.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.750
I am really happy
to be here talking

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.690
a little bit about my
work on extremophiles

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.680
and how it relates to
human space exploration.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.210
I'm a visiting scientist at
Universities Space Research

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.060
Association, which is an
organization with almost

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.050
50 years of existence.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.640
It was established in 1969
in the age of space race.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.640
So there was a demand for
scientists and engineers.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.090
It was the age where
astronauts were bringing

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.060
rock samples from the moon.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.280
NASA was developing many
different programs and research

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.140
projects.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.140
And the USA played a very
important role in this mission

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.660
to NASA.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.430
USRA is currently managing the
NASA post-doctoral program,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.269
which is a one to three year
assignments for researchers

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.080
and is a very
competitive program.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.210
And people from different
countries can apply as well.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.174
It's open for foreign
nationals and US citizens.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:16.860
I am an alumni
from this program.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.900
I completed my post-doctoral
research at NASA last year

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.510
and then moved on to
the visiting scientist

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.620
position at USRA.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.870
USRA also supports
STEM education.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.280
We recently opened up a
center for STEM education

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.470
in Columbia, Maryland to
provide a place for students

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.180
to study and work on robotics.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.870
The institute within
USRA that I am affiliated

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.070
is called Research Institute
for Advanced Computer Science.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.240
And they have different
programs on computer science,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.370
including quantum
computing, supercomputing,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.630
cloud computing, and
one of the branches

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.030
that they are starting right
now is synthetic biology.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.160
So they recently
established partnership

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.900
with NASA's Synthetic
Biology Initiative.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.805
And the goal is to harness
engineer and biological systems

00:02:15.805 --> 00:02:19.200
to further space
exploration and science

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.630
to search for life beyond Earth
and to improve life on Earth.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.490
So NASA is leading these
efforts in synthetic biology

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.730
for space applications.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.540
And the lab where I'm
working on at NASA Ames

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.040
is Lynn Rothschild's lab.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.440
There is different
lines of research.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.140
I'm currently involved in
the development, delivery,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.540
and ground controls for
the PowerCell, payload

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.840
on the DLR CROPiS mission.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.660
It's a partnership between NASA
and German space agency DLR.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.970
And I'm also
continuing my NPP work

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.110
on extremophiles in radiation.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.750
What really interested
me is the limits of life.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.010
So the topic of my
research is to test

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.420
what are the limits of life
and working specifically

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.930
with extremophiles and looking
at radiation resistance.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.260
So what are extremophiles?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.340
Some people think that the
concept of extremophiles

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.660
is an anthropocentric concept.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.860
But it's really not,
because these organisms,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.630
they can thrive in
extreme conditions

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.010
where the conditions
in the environment

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.400
is close to the stability
for organic molecules.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.360
So they're almost dying.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.920
It's really difficult even
for them to live these places.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.840
So it's not an
anthropocentric view.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.010
And there are many
places on Earth

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.650
where we can find very
extreme conditions

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.980
and different examples of life
thriving in those environments.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.020
Basically, whatever we
can find liquid water

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.320
being Antarctica or high
lakes in the Altiplanos,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.500
in Hawaii, hydrothermal
systems, Yellowstone.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.630
Wherever there is liquid water,
we can find examples of life

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.140
from microorganisms
that comprise

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.870
the vast majority of
life beings on Earth

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.810
and also a few other more
complex forms of life.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.620
So the existence
of extremophiles

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.130
in such extreme
environments on Earth

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.470
make us think that it may be
possible for extremophiles

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.330
to exist in other places other
than Earth like planet Mars,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.460
the moons of the giant
planets in our solar system,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.610
and also more
recently, astronomy

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.650
is passing through a truly
scientific revolution

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.080
with the detection
of exoplanets.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.270
So the scientists are
characterizing the conditions

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.540
on these planets
where are planets that

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.360
can be potentially habitable.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.520
So there are places
in our neighborhood

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.530
in the galaxy where
we can in the future

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.370
potentially find
signals of life.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.350
And this is the
cover of a document

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.070
that has been put together
and published last year.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.190
It is a NASA
document introducing

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.050
the topic of astrobiology.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.780
So astrobiology is a
scientific endeavor

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.340
that seeks to answer three basic
question-- the origin of life,

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.280
the distribution of
life, whether life

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.590
exists beyond Earth, and
also the future of life.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.180
These are the three basic
questions of astrobiology.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.190
And I think extremophiles is
one of the things that motivates

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.350
the scientists to create this
scientific endeavor called

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.200
astrobiology.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.910
The discovery of
specifically thermophiles,

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.680
organisms that live in high
temperature environments,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.660
back in the '60s and '70s was
the same age of the space race.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.680
So everything collaborated
to the creation

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.590
of the concept of astrobiology.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.260
And there are different
categories of extremophiles,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.140
as you can see here in the
first column in this table.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.220
And here in the
column to the right,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.240
there is different
examples of organisms.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.090
And as I said, I'm particularly
interested in the organisms

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.040
that can resist high doses
of radiation, both ionizing

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.820
and non-ionizing radiation.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.460
And one of the most
studied biological models

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.790
for radiation resistance
is Deinococcus radiodurans.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.590
There are other
biological models,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.380
but Deinococcus is by
far the most studied,

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.550
the most characterized.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.270
And I use these organisms as
a reference in my studies.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.200
So why the study of radiation
and its effects on materials

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.680
in biology is important?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.350
We know that radiation is a
major concern in space research

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.200
and space operations.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.970
It impacts
satellites, especially

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.860
communications satellites,
that orbit geostationary

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.790
orbits of both of the
Earth's magnetic fields.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.170
But it also is a concern for
the International Space Station,

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.370
for low Earth orbit
satellites, and also

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.710
for human missions beyond
Earth's magnetic field,

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.990
like missions to the Moon and
missions to Mars and so on.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:31.040
And it is really a concern
for NASA's journey to Mars.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.580
NASA is currently developing
a very solid program

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.840
to send humans to Mars in the
next two or three decades.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.090
And this graph shows different
radiation limits for,

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.910
just as an example, astronauts
spending six months on ISS

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.050
are exposed to 75
millisieverts of radiation.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.130
This is a unit of
absorbed radiation.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:01.400
And this is much more than the
annual limits for a Department

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.130
of Energy radiation worker.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:09.040
And a trip to Mars will
subject any astronaut

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.260
to a dose of 466
millisievert as measured

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.560
by an instrument
on the Mars Science

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:22.320
Laboratory, the last big robot
that NASA sent to Mars in 2011.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.700
So it's really a limiting
factor for the expansion

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.210
of the presence of
humans in space.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.800
And it's very difficult to
shield against radiation.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.510
It's very expensive to bring
heavy material to orbit.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.740
So luckily, we have
examples in nature

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.220
where we can find organisms
dealing and coping

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.690
with radiation much
better than humans

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.830
and other biological models.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.660
And what are the effects
of radiation on biology?

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:53.050
We know genetic information
is stored on the DNA molecule.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.390
And when damage caused
by radiation affects DNA,

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.740
it is a problem.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.520
The cells have the
whole DNA machinery

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.000
to repair those damages.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.530
In the case of
high-energy radiation,

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.990
it can cause strand breaks
on DNA, double strands

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.710
and single-strand breaks.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.740
And that's the most
severe type of damage

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.230
for most of the cells.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:19.340
And some of these organisms are
very resistant to radiation.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.770
They are specializing in
repairing this type of damage,

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:22.910
strand breaks on the DNA.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.910
Just to give you an
idea of the importance

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.040
of the works on DNA repair.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.810
Last year, the Nobel
Prize for chemistry

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.840
was awarded through
these three researchers

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.190
working on the mechanistic
studies of DNA repair.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.570
And so most of the
knowledge about DNA repair

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.930
came from the studies
of these groups.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.280
But everything we know
about radiation resistance

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.000
comes from things that we can
work in the laboratory, things

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.900
that we can cultivate, isolate,
and work in the laboratory,

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.320
because we have to
create survival curves.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.070
That's the most
traditional way to measure

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.520
radiation resistance.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.200
So this graph shows
different survival curves

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.560
for different
organisms, including

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.870
human cells and some other
examples of very sensitive

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.890
organisms to radiation.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.710
And these are different
types of radiation.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.610
X-rays, it's ionizing
radiation, very high energy.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.220
And then UV-C, a little
bit lower energy,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.140
and it also causes
damage to the DNA.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.830
And desiccation is also
an environmental parameter

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.900
that causes the
same type of damage,

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.680
so it correlates with
the damage of radiation,

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:43.220
and it's sometimes is used as a
proxy for radiation resistance.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.420
There are also
other forms of life

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:52.537
that are resistant to radiation
like these ones-- amoeba,

00:10:52.537 --> 00:10:56.060
and fungi, rotifers, insects.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:01.010
Some biological models are also
very resistant to radiation

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:06.101
if they survive those higher
than 1,000 grays of ionizing

00:11:06.101 --> 00:11:06.600
radiation.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.940
Radiation resistance is
a widespread phenotype

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.300
with representative organisms
from the three domains of life.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.100
And its a multi-factor
phenotype.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.900
So there are different
things contributing

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.990
for radiation resistance.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:29.030
As an example,
Deinococcus radiodurans,

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.800
the biological model for
radiation resistance,

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.890
shares a large part of its gene
pool with Thermus thermophilus.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.670
And yet Thermus thermophilus
is very sensitive,

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.210
while Deinococcus is very
resistant to radiation.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.510
So clearly, there are
physiological factors

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.790
affecting radiation resistance.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.110
So one of these factors,
maybe the most important

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.290
physiological factor
that factor that

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.920
contributes for
radiation resistance,

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.940
is the accumulation
of manganese.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.580
Actually, it's the ratio between
manganese intracellularly.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.460
This was demonstrated
almost 12 years ago

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.460
by the group of Michael Daly.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.080
They are survival curves for
different biological models.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.650
And if you pass a line
through the level of radiation

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.050
that kills 90% of
the population,

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.260
this is a logarithmic scale.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.560
So this is the
dose that kills 90%

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.350
of a population of Deinococcus.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.430
And these are the values for
each one of these survival

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:29.330
curves.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.140
If you transferred this to
this graph here on the right

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.990
and try to correlate with
intracellular manganese-to-iron

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:39.450
ratio, you can see there
is this general trend

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.730
being sensitive
organisms, they have

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:47.170
a low ratio between manganese
and iron intracellularly.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:52.130
And the resistant ones
has have high intraceullar

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.760
manganese-to-iron ratio.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:00.760
And this suggested actually
that maybe proteins also

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.850
play-- the damage to proteins
is also critical for recovery

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.080
after radiation.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.660
And that's what they
demonstrated a few years ago,

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.900
irradiating total proteins
for sensitive organisms

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:19.350
here on the left and resistant
organisms to the right.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.780
So they used a
compound called DNPH

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.070
to reveal the presence
of carbonyl groups

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.840
in those proteins.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.800
And when they are
heavily radiated,

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.510
all the proteins become
oxidated and generate

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.120
this carbonyl groups.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.680
And it's revealed here.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.770
And Deinococcus radiodurans
and other resistant organisms,

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.440
even with a large dose of
radiation of 4 kilograys,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.450
their proteins do not
oxidate and remain active

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:52.060
and are able to repair
the damage on the DNA.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.040
And this is just a
translation of these data.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.310
So organisms that are very
sensitive to radiation, there's

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.980
a lot of carbonyl groups
formed after radiation.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.670
And the ones that are
resistant, the proteins

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.910
remain active because
they're not oxidated.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.660
And based on all
these data, this

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:17.540
is the current model of
extreme radiation resistance.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.560
We can think of
this graph as two.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.740
We can divide this graph into
two parts-- sensitive cells

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.870
on the top and resistant
cells at the bottom.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:30.600
So when a cell is
exposed to radiation,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.422
there are direct effects and
indirect effects on the genome

00:14:34.422 --> 00:14:36.780
and throughout the cell.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:42.390
If the cell cannot repair this
damage, it leads to cell death.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.745
There are indirect effects which
is the generation of shower

00:14:46.745 --> 00:14:50.050
of free radicals, so
hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.070
peroxide, and superoxide.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.590
The hydroxyl
radicals, the damage

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.360
caused by this type
of free radical

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.890
is uniformly distributed
cellular damage.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:02.090
So every component of
the cell are damaged

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.160
by this type of free radical.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.050
And these two are more
specific for proteins.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:08.550
And in the case of
sensitive cells,

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.710
these proteins get oxidated
and cannot repair the damage

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:12.450
in the DNA.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.040
And the cell dies.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.110
In the case of
resistant cells, they

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.880
accumulate a lot of manganese,
manganese-to-iron ratio.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.750
And these manganese
forms complexes

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.870
with small peptides and
nucleosides inside the cell.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.980
And then it ends up
quenching and scavenging

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.740
the effects of these free
radicals on the cells.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.420
And then the proteins
remain active

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.080
and are able to repair
cellular functions.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.020
And the cells remain alive.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.796
But what are these
manganese complexes?

00:15:45.796 --> 00:15:47.170
Manganese is a
transitional model

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.900
that is able to combine
with different molecules,

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.210
especially small metabolites
like nucleosides, amino acids,

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.500
and peptides, and
aryl phosphates.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:03.490
And these complexes can
then scavenge, protect,

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:07.490
act like a shield against
these small free radicals

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.860
in the cell.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.750
And there are some
research already

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.910
being done by
Michael Daly's group

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.100
using these
intracellular manganese

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.690
complexes in human cells.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.030
We can see here
human cells treated

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.140
with [INAUDIBLE]
manganese pyrophosphate

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.140
is significantly more resistant
than the known treated control.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.410
So this is a very
interesting line of research

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.810
that could benefit future
astronauts going to Mars.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.730
But that brings the question of
whether Deinococcus radiodurans

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.700
is is the last frontier
of radiation resistance.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.930
All of this is based on
Deinococcus radiodurans

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.960
and a few other
biological models.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.960
And the question we
have is whether there

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.600
are other biological
models available in nature

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.000
that we don't know yet.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.820
So maybe other organisms
could accumulate higher levels

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.220
of manganese, may have
more efficient DNA repair,

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.280
and may produce antioxidant
secondary metabolites

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.710
that are more higher level
of these metabolites.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.960
Or maybe these metabolites
can be better applied

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.599
to human cell lineages.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:17.050
So this motivated us to
go through extreme places

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.109
on Earth, actually deserts,
enriched in manganese,

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:23.069
so combining the
dessication factor

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:25.619
and the manganese availability.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:29.580
So I've been through the
Sonoran Desert in Arizona

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.730
in a collaboration
with a company called

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:32.900
American Manganese.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.690
They collaborated with
providing soil to us.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.130
And also I went to
the Atacama Desert

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.560
to collect some sand
samples there and also

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.230
a few samples from NASA's
Ames campus as a control.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.540
So this is a picture of
myself collecting samples

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.390
in the Atacama.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.452
And I don't think
it's very easy for you

00:17:53.452 --> 00:17:56.240
to see the blue
atmosphere here, which

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.660
is the best indication
that it's not Mars,

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.150
because a picture of that
resembles a lot of Mars.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.420
You cannot see any
green, any grass.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.670
There is no indication of
life in this environment.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:11.700
It's hard to breathe.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.290
We spent two hours in this
environment, collected

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.480
a few samples, and then we were
ready to go back to Antofagasta

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.410
where we were staying.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.010
So it's a very, very,
very extreme environment.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.960
It is considered a Martian
analog, because of its dryness.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.880
Sometimes the dryness
of the Atacama Desert

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.790
is even higher than
similar situations

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.670
on Mars, some places on Mars.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.830
So it is really an
extreme environment.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:39.610
So after bringing back
to NASA Ames the samples,

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.830
we exposes these samples
to different doses

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:46.750
of UV-C radiation, which can be
generated by a fluorescent lamp

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.850
without this white coating.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.350
So it's a very reliable,
very cheap method

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.990
to isolate radiation
resistant organisms.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.060
And after a period
of incubation,

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:02.600
we isolated the colonies that
grew after the largest doses

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.570
and performed survival curves,
characterized the extracellular

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.150
and intracellular
manganese-to-iron

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:12.380
ratio through ICPMS and did some
optical and electro-microscopy

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.030
studies.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:19.120
So we were surprised to see
high diversity on samples coming

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.020
from the Atacama Desert
compared to samples

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.480
from the manganese
mine in Arizona

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.270
and also very low diversity
of radiation resistant

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.210
isolates from NASA
Ames as expected.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.460
But this was surprising,
the high diversity

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.050
of very resistant organisms
through UV-C radiation.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.000
And we also compared true
methods, a filtration method,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.430
where you elute the soil
particulates in a buffer

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.220
and then filter to get
rid of the soil particles.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.240
But of course, you lose
a lot of the diversity,

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.730
and that's exactly what
this graph is showing here.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.020
Most of the organisms
obtained by this method

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.080
was represented by
Bacillus and Sporosarcina

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.730
and Planomicrobium.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:04.000
And so the sprinkling
method is the best one

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.130
to generate a higher diversity
of resistant organisms.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.360
And then after isolating
these organisms,

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.490
we cultivated them
individually, and exposed

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:18.170
to another round of radiation,
and generated this continuum

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:22.250
of radiation resistance compared
to Deinococcus radiodurans

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:27.300
up there, which survives
100% to this dose and E. coli

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.460
at the bottom here.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.330
So we now have this
microbiological culture

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.820
collection with
radiation-resistant organisms

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.990
with different levels
of radiation resistance.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.710
And then we looked into the
extracellular and intracellular

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:47.820
manganese ratio and
compared to the survival

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.200
of these organisms.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.290
So this graph shows that the
extracellular manganese-to-iron

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.600
ratio, the availability
of these metals

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.000
does not determine the
survival of organisms

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.540
from this environment,
but actually,

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.950
the intracellular
manganese-to-iron ratio,

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:11.560
there is a trend towards high
intracellular manganese-to-iron

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.770
ratio and radiation
resistance as was demonstrated

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.790
by Michael Daly's group
for laboratory strains

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.400
using gamma irradiation.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.410
So this we demonstrated
for the first time

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.660
that this is also true
for environmental isolates

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.110
and for another
type of radiation,

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.010
which is UV-C radiation.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.210
And this happens
because the inputs,

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:37.980
the uptake of manganese,
occurs as an active mechanism.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.010
So the cells needs need to have
molecular mechanisms to uptake

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.975
manganese from the environment.

00:21:42.975 --> 00:21:45.100
So the availability of
manganese in the environment

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.250
does not determine
radiation resistance.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.480
But those that can accumulate
high manganese-to-iron ratio,

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.447
they will have a better chance
to be radiation resistant.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.990
So then we did survival
curves with the most radiation

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.050
resistant ones.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:03.860
And we actually found one
organism more resistant

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.070
than Deinococcus
radiodurans, which

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:10.170
is this one in red
compared to Deinococcus

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:11.730
radiodurans in blue.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.240
So the question
whether Deinococcus

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.340
is the last frontier?

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.329
Probably not.

00:22:16.329 --> 00:22:18.370
Probably there are other
organisms more resistant

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:21.810
than Deinococcus in
nature and that we just

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.000
didn't discover yet.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.042
This is another organism
called Geodermatophilus.

00:22:27.042 --> 00:22:28.750
It produces a black pigment.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.110
It forms cell clumps.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:33.800
That's why the survival curve
seems like a broken curve here.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:38.020
So that means that cells
outside of the clumps

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.470
get inactivated faster than
the ones inside the core.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.460
But these ones, it's
truly more resistant,

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.960
because it doesn't
form cell clumps,

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.100
and it produces a very
light pink pigment.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.280
But when we did radiation
with gamma rays,

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.410
Deinococcus is still
much better at repairing

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.170
double strand breaks
and the damage caused

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.190
by high-energy radiation.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:04.260
But still, the discovery
of these organisms

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.280
and a few others very
resistant to radiation,

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.970
represents a new
front in efforts

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.640
to harness mechanisms
of radiation resistance

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.050
from nature.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.840
So this is just a picture of
both organisms, Hymenobacter

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.050
here to the left,
so clearly showing

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.700
that doesn't form cell clumps.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.760
And this is Geodermatophilus
representing

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.540
a more passive mechanism
of radiation protection,

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.860
not resistance,
not active repair.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.280
But it produces a black pigment.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.390
And it forms cell clumps.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.770
That's why it's very resistant.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.740
This is a picture
of Hymenobacter

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.900
grown on a plate showing
the light pink pigment.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:52.340
So we think there are active
mechanisms of DNA repair going

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:57.840
on here that is very interesting
to study and understand.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:03.370
And these organisms also
have some internal vesicles

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:06.280
that may or may not play a
role on radiation resistance.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.810
We don't know if this
is viral particles that

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:14.090
could have DNA repair
enzymes like polymerases.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:19.390
We recently published a
draft genome of this organism

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:22.224
in "Genome Announcements"
earlier this year.

00:24:22.224 --> 00:24:23.640
So the information
is right there.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.420
And we are currently
investigating

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.920
what type of DNA
repair genes it has

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.810
and what type of
pigment production

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:39.130
it does, internal cellular
metabolites, and so on.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:42.210
An interesting spin off from
my post-doctoral research

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:45.430
was a collaboration with
astronomers from the Max Planck

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.600
Institute now at
Cornell University.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.960
Lisa Kaltenegger is the director
of the Carl Sagan Center

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.415
for Studies of Exoplanets.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:00.190
And her PhD student at
the time, Siddarth Hegde,

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:05.140
is now her post-doc researcher,
collaborated with us

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.190
at NASA Ames.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:09.380
And Lynn Rothschild provided
the guidance and interpretation

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.760
of the data.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.810
Basically, we created
artificial microbiomats

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.650
to measure absolute
reflectance spectra,

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:21.350
because up till last
year, most of the data set

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:29.810
about reflectance spectra was
about phototrophic organisms,

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:32.785
so green stuff,
microalgae, algae,

00:25:32.785 --> 00:25:36.440
and plants and just a few
heterotrophic microbes

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.710
with different
color of pigments.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:46.890
And in our study, we opened
the spectrum of the diversity

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:48.300
of pigments analyzed.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:53.470
We now have a databank of
137 different organisms,

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.320
different pigments, spectra.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.690
This is how the data looks like.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.970
This is a Geodermatophilus
strain, the one that

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:04.460
produced the black pigment.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.460
That's why the reflectance on
the visible region is very low.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.810
And there is a lot of reflection
on the near infrared region,

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:14.870
which is a very interesting
region for astronomers.

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:20.380
And now, this data
set, this catalog,

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.150
is available online
and open to the public.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:27.430
Other researchers can
contribute other data.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:33.310
And we hope that this
spectra of different pigments

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.010
will help astronomers.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.230
It's actually already
helping astronomers

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:41.620
to analyze data from exoplanets,
searching for a biosignature.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.920
So when astronomers combine
different information

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.260
from the gravity of the planets
and distance from the sun

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.050
if the planet is available,
with this type of information,

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.360
they can at least
suggest whether there

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.490
is any potential
biosignature on exoplanets.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.490
And with all this
research on extremophiles,

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:08.170
how does this relate to
human space exploration?

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:11.750
So we know that there are
different industries on Earth

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.260
right now using
extremophiles for production

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:19.520
of different things from food,
biofuels, materials, and so on.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.710
And we think that
all this capability

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:27.590
will be transferred to
Mars during the human space

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.350
missions in the future.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:31.440
And we are currently
developing the science

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.790
that will enable
this goal that NASA

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:37.110
has to send humans to Mars
within the next two or three

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.850
decades.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:43.999
And so one way we
think about it is

00:27:43.999 --> 00:27:47.050
there are organisms on Earth
that it's very cheap, very

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:49.490
reliable, very
easy to cultivate,

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.290
which are the cyanobacteria.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:55.120
These are bacteria that
can do photosynthesis.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.900
So it has chlorophyll inside.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:02.130
They only need solar energy, and
water, and a few micronutrients

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:08.440
that are all available on Mars
already as part of its surface.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.620
And we can cultivate this
type of cyanobacteria on Mars

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.430
and then generate
organic compounds that

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:19.090
can be used by heterotrophic
organisms, other types

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:22.030
of bacteria that
can then produce

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:24.530
the biomaterials,
biocompounds, and everything

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:28.730
that the astronauts will
need for their mission.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.960
So this is a picture that
has been put together

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.370
by our collaborator,
Cyprien Verseux.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:38.080
This is a person who is spending
one year on a Mars simulation

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:43.780
mission on Hawaii
in a Martian dome.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:47.000
He's going to leave
the dome next week.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.070
And he's doing research there.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:50.540
It is a crew of six people.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:51.570
He's one of them.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.030
He collaborates
in our laboratory.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.350
He collects samples.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.580
And he's doing research
with cyanobacteria there

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.260
and has some very
interesting results.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.180
So we think that
a Martian colony

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.450
in the future in the
next, I don't know,

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.820
several decades
or centuries, this

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:16.030
is how it will look like, a
cyanobacteria pond generating

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:20.400
food and primary products
that will enter a production

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.670
chain for different
applications-- biofuels,

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:27.440
nutrients, and so on.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.880
And we think that
synthetic biology--

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.090
I think the same way
that astronomy is passing

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:36.580
through a revolution with
the detection of exoplanets,

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.850
biology is also passing
through a similar revolution

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:43.340
on the same scale through
synthetic biology.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.280
There is a lot of
synthetic biology tools

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.430
to engineer organisms in
a much more efficient way

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.160
than 10 years ago.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.520
And these will be
crucial to improve

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.130
the performance of
any organisms that we

00:29:56.130 --> 00:30:00.190
will support the mission
of astronauts on Mars.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:03.490
And this is a more
complex picture

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.680
of the same type
of Martian colony.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.080
I just would like you to
imagine an astronaut on Mars

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.820
in a very long mission
to Mars getting sick.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.662
And there is no
precise diagnostic.

00:30:19.662 --> 00:30:21.120
And there is no
laboratories there.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.510
There is no hospitals.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:25.915
And one thing that
can be done is

00:30:25.915 --> 00:30:29.630
if there is any sequence or
any type of facility that

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:34.460
can analyze human
materials like blood,

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:39.840
and then send this information
through radio frequency

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.000
to Earth, then on Earth we
have a lot of hospitals,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.390
a lot of laboratories
to work on a solution,

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.530
provide vaccine
information, and then

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:52.410
this information can be
sent back to Mars and then

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:54.710
whatever compound that
is needed can be produced

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.190
on Mars and then people
on Earth contributing

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:01.690
to improve the performance
of astronauts on Mars.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:05.730
So this is a reality that
is envisioned by NASA.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:08.570
And that's something that we
are working with small steps

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:09.470
right now.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:14.250
But it's something that we
envision for the future.

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.580
But before doing
all that, we have

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.350
to know whether synthetic
biology tools that

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:22.230
are used nowadays
on Earth will work

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:26.120
the same way in other worlds,
in different gravity levels.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:30.560
And that's what these
mission is addressing.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.630
We have an experiment
called PowerCells

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:34.960
on a mission called EuCROPiS.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.200
EuCROPiS stands for Euglena
Combined Regenerative Organic

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.440
Food Production in Space.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.070
It's a very long acronym.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:44.387
This is, as I said, is a
partnership between NASA

00:31:44.387 --> 00:31:45.630
and DLR.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.290
And they have their own
experiments with Euglena.

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:51.170
And also they're going
to grow tomatoes in space

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.520
in a satellite in orbit
for the first time.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.660
Last year, astronauts
were able to grow lettuce.

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.170
There are other
things being produced.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:04.810
So in small steps, we are
creating our little crops

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:06.060
in orbit.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:13.240
So the idea of this project
is to perform two experiments

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.890
that we call PowerCell.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.650
This first one is
basically a co-culture.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.640
We're using a strain
of Anabaena that

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.450
has been genetically
engineered in our lab

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:27.240
to produce and secrete sucrose
and release to the culture

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.010
medium so that other organisms,
a second organism, Bacillus

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:34.560
subtilis, which is a
widespread biological model

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.180
used in different
industries, we will

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:39.110
be able to use this
resource and then

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:42.790
produce different types
of biomaterials-- food

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:44.680
and compounds and so on.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:49.870
And we're going to do these in
a microfluidics device, four

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:52.350
rows of 12 wells.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:58.010
We are currently in the final
step of sampling the payloads.

00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:00.580
These payloads will
be sent to Germany

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.950
where it will be integrated
to the satellite.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:05.130
And it will be
launched next year

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:10.430
from Vandenberg Launch Facility
in Southern California.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:14.310
The second experiment is
genetic transformation,

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:22.530
which is a basic tool for
every microbiology laboratory

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.020
on Earth.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.520
That's going to
be the first time

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.610
that these type of experiments
will be performed in space

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.170
in four different
gravity levels,

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.200
because we are going
to be able to control

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.900
the spinning of the
satellites to simulate

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:39.020
the gravity of Mars, and
moon, and also microgravity.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.540
And then the fourth
gravity level

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:45.280
is our ground
controls at NASA Ames.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.820
And then you can
think of why focusing

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.940
on space rather than
the other problems

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.730
that we already have on Earth.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:57.110
I think besides all the
technological heritage provided

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:59.690
by space exploration,
there is one thing that

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:03.100
is more important than all
that is the human spirit.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.070
And Konstantin
Tsiolkovsky, which

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:07.480
is the father of astronautics,
the Russian father

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.520
of astronautics, used
to say that the Earth is

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.380
the cradle of humanity.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.750
But one cannot live
in a cradle forever.

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:18.920
And once someone
asked me what we

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.699
are going to do with the cradle
after we leave the cradle.

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:26.020
I answered that we
will do the same thing

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.159
that with our own
cradles in our homes.

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.980
We will pass it on to
the new generations.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.600
We will take good
care of this cradle.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.040
And Earth will always be
the birthplace of humanity.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.060
And we will never forget
that we were born here.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.989
Whatever happens in
the future I think

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:46.280
we don't want to give up
the dream of expanding

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:52.840
the presence of humans in
space in reality, which may

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.969
mean going to other planets.

00:34:56.969 --> 00:35:00.550
And the benefit of
going to other planets

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:06.310
is also avoiding
large-scale catastrophies

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:08.260
that could extinct humans.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:11.360
So it's really a
matter of survival

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.640
if you think on
long-term scales.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.870
We know for a fact that the
Sun in 4.5 billion years

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:18.240
will expand.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.990
And there's going
to be no more Earth.

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:21.400
So at some point
at least we will

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.980
have to address this question.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:27.110
And the best way to predict
the future is build the future.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:29.130
That's exactly what
we're doing now.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:33.890
And I think if we
think carefully and do

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:39.416
it the right way, I think that's
the vision that NASA shares.

00:35:39.416 --> 00:35:43.300
And that's the future
that lies ahead

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.870
of us, starting from
a small step, which

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:49.860
is Martian colonization
in the next few decades

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.823
or the next few centuries.

00:35:52.823 --> 00:35:59.280
And in the bigger scale, we
know that almost all stars

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.210
that we see in the
night sky today

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:02.770
is actually not a single star.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:06.470
It's a planetary system with
planets orbiting around them.

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:09.490
So we know that many
of these planets

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:13.490
are potentially habitable
so our new destinations

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:14.790
for future generations.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:17.530
We currently don't
have any technology

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:19.460
to go to other stars,
even the nearest

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:25.740
one is 4.5, 4.6 light
years from Earth,

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:30.210
which is there is no
possibility to go there

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.460
with current technology.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.750
But that doesn't mean
that it won't happen.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:35.930
There's a lot of technology
that exists today

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:39.050
that we even didn't think of.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:41.550
But I think this simple
fact of recognizing

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:45.250
that there are places in our
neighborhood in the galaxy that

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:46.910
can be potentially habitable.

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:50.770
It brings a sense of hope
for humanity and also

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:53.980
responsibility to take
care of our planet

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.190
and the other
destinations that humanity

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:58.860
will have in the future.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.680
And I think this is the vision
that the scientific community

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.280
shares.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:08.840
And it is very fascinating
time to be a scientist,

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:12.310
to be an engineer working
at NASA with leading

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:14.550
all these efforts.

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:17.340
So I think we are
privileged to live

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:24.120
in such time of scientific and
technological breakthroughs.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.850
And with that, I just
would like to acknowledge

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:31.220
my team and the international
collaborators that

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:36.130
have been playing a role
on my research and also,

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:37.730
the facilities and
institutions that

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.380
funded and provided the
conditions for me to develop

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.610
my research.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:44.850
And I thank you all for your
time, for your attention,

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:47.920
and I'd like to open for
questions that you guys have.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.712
Thank you very much.

00:37:49.712 --> 00:37:51.676
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:56.180
AUDIENCE: I believe
it's the case

00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:00.110
that on all of the
missions to Mars, the stuff

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:02.870
we send there is very
carefully sterilized so

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:05.590
that if we do find
life on Mars, we

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.130
know that it's indigenous,
not something that we sent up

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.400
there.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.210
At what point do
we give up on that?

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:13.480
IVAN PAULINO-LIMA:
So this is a matter

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:19.930
of debate, actually, for all
these missions, human missions

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.360
to Mars.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.280
We know that any
human mission to Mars

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.920
will eventually
contaminate Mars.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.540
That we know.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.890
This is something
that we know for sure.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:34.770
And I think in the past, the
protocols for sterilization

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:38.450
of spacecraft, they were not
as rigid as they are today.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:42.530
We think that some of the
earlier missions sent to Mars

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:46.460
may have carried some
bio-burden on Mars.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.760
But we think that
this bio-burden

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.650
won't do anything there, because
the environment is so hostile.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:56.230
There's no water,
a lot of radiation.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:00.810
It's very hard to think of
any type of growth there.

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:03.560
So I think it's
currently being decided.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.230
It is an ethical question
if we have the right

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:11.630
to go to another planet knowing
that contamination will happen.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:15.580
And it is interesting
to note that the most

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.820
interesting places
to detect life, which

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:22.650
are the aquifers, places
where there is more water,

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:25.770
are also the best places for
humans to go there and make

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:28.620
use of those resources.

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:38.350
But we are still
debating, actually,

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.660
what are the implications
of contaminating Mars,

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.612
the extent we accept that.

00:39:44.612 --> 00:39:45.800
This is a matter of debate.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.520
We recently had a meeting,
I think last year at NASA,

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.520
to debate that.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.910
It was called Planetary
Protection on knowledge gaps

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:56.780
that we have in this area.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:04.120
So I think we cannot give up
on exploration just with fear

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:08.210
of contaminating stuff, because
if this is a matter of our own

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:12.720
survival, then I think it puts
a lot of weight on the ethical

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.540
debate.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:18.130
AUDIENCE: Hi, there is a fungi
inside the Chernobyl reactor.

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:21.550
I was just wondering how
the radiation tolerance

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:25.690
of that organism compares to
the ones that you were analyzing

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:27.880
and are the
mechanisms different?

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:31.390
There's a lot of [INAUDIBLE] for
energy production potentially.

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:33.950
IVAN PAULINO-LIMA: Yeah, this
is very interesting actually.

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:38.060
The question is
about fungi that was

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.727
found inside a nuclear reactor.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:47.860
It's not clear how they
resist to such high levels

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.180
of radiation.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:53.930
I think the method to determine
their radiation resistance

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:57.760
it's not quite similar
to what I've shown here.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.560
But I would rate these organisms
as very, very resistant,

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.750
very interesting.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:06.410
They started to look at these
organisms five years ago.

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:08.370
And they're still
characterizing.

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:11.747
It seems that it can convert
the energy of gamma rays

00:41:11.747 --> 00:41:15.107
to a usable form of
energy after there

00:41:15.107 --> 00:41:17.750
is some effect inside the cell.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:20.840
It's very interesting to know
that there are organisms even

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.260
living within nuclear reactors.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:28.400
But I think they would be as
resistant or very close to what

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:33.520
I've shown here to Deinococcus
and all the other organisms.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.260
AUDIENCE: You showed a
curve of the pigments,

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.286
and it had two very
distinct drops.

00:41:38.286 --> 00:41:39.496
What's up with that?

00:41:39.496 --> 00:41:41.746
IVAN PAULINO-LIMA: Those are
water absorption features

00:41:41.746 --> 00:41:42.860
on these spectra.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:46.040
And these features we
observe for all samples,

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.580
because they all have water.

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:49.510
And that's something
that astronomers

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:53.390
will observe if there's any life
form detected in exoplanets.

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:55.150
So these are just
water molecules.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.530
And if we do the
experiment long enough,

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:01.970
the samples get dehydrated and
those features get extinct.

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:06.890
So these are just
water absorption lines.

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:09.860
AUDIENCE: So
maganese-containing compounds

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.920
is not the only
antioxidant then obviously.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:17.240
Any reasons this seems
to be particularly chosen

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.780
for these bacteria?

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.340
IVAN PAULINO-LIMA:
Well, of course,

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.830
any organisms that are
resistant to radiation

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:28.760
have to have
genetic information.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.820
So the basic machinery to repair
the DNA needs to be there.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.430
And the information needs
to be encoded by DNA.

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:41.510
But I think late '90s,
beginning of the 2000s,

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:44.790
people started to think of other
factors, physiological factors.

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:47.890
And they tested different
things, different compounds,

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:50.630
different metals, different
nutrients that could

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:52.280
affect radiation resistance.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.170
And then they started to see
that organisms that accumulate

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:58.410
high manganese had
these trend of being

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:00.320
resistant to radiation.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.140
And just in the
past few years, that

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:08.060
has been elucidated that these
manganese complexes helps

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.300
to protect the proteins
against oxidation.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.780
And then the proteins
remain active

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:15.550
and can do the DNA repair.

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:17.580
And in fact,
Deinococcus radiodurans

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:21.830
is specialized in
double-strand break repair.

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:26.440
Compared to other organisms, it
lacks a few genes of DNA repair

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.820
to oxidative damage like
UV-A and UV-B generates

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.280
a lot of oxidative stress.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:37.150
And Deinococcus is as
resistant as E. coli.

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:39.770
It is sensitive
to UV-A and UV-B,

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:42.220
because it's more specialized
for double-strand break

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.060
resistance.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.020
So that's what
motivates us to seek

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.900
for a more complete set of
genes on an organism that

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:52.390
has a more complete set
of genes or strategies

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:54.390
to survive high
doses of radiation

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:56.080
and also to
understand better how

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.830
we can transfer this capability
to humans in the future.

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:03.450
AUDIENCE: You showed mechanisms
for getting radiation

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:08.510
resistance through
gathering of radicals

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:11.660
and of keeping repair
mechanisms alive.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.300
But are there any
speculations about mechanisms

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.560
that go directly to the DNA?

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.370
Or is that DNA damaged
from the radiation just a

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:21.224
given and has to be dealt with?

00:44:21.224 --> 00:44:22.640
IVAN PAULINO-LIMA:
So the question

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:26.660
is about the radiation
effects on the DNA.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:30.530
So gamma rays, I think the
most severe type of damage

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:32.644
on the DNA caused by
high-energy radiation

00:44:32.644 --> 00:44:34.310
like gamma rays is
double-strand breaks,

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:38.010
but it also generates
a lot of free radicals

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:42.490
and oxidative
stress in the cells.

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:46.020
But I think what determines
the survival or cell

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:50.150
death is the accumulation
of this type of damage.

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:54.190
Even Deinococcus will die if
the dose is high enough, because

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:58.600
of this type of damage that
is not trivial to repair.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.230
It involves a
protein called RecA

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:05.470
to recruit a whole
machinery of other enzymes

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.690
to repair this damage.

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:10.230
But it's very interesting
to know that Deinococcus

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:12.650
does that within four hours.

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:16.880
The genome can be
broken up to 200 pieces.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.160
And it will re-assemble
these pieces

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.410
in the right position in the
right sequence within four

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:23.100
hours.

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.800
So it's very amazing
how efficient

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.720
is the DNA repair mechanism
from Deinococcus radiodurans.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:33.370
AUDIENCE: So as a general rule,
if you have higher radiation

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:36.770
rates in particular, does that
cause higher mutation rates,

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:40.860
which then makes organisms
more easily evolve

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.784
to radiation resistance?

00:45:43.784 --> 00:45:45.700
IVAN PAULINO-LIMA: It
depends on the organism.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:47.740
In the case of
Deinococcus radiodurans,

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:51.060
since they are very efficient
at repairing DNA damages,

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.084
it's hard to get mutants for
Deinococcus radiodurans, which

00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:55.500
doesn't mean that
it's impossible.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:59.440
Actually, there are ways of
getting mutants of Deinococcus.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.990
But other organisms that are
less efficient at doing repair

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:08.010
would be easier to get
mutants from radiation.

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:14.400
That's what has been used I
think in 30, 40 years ago.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:17.945
That was the main method to
generate mutants, just boost

00:46:17.945 --> 00:46:19.220
an organism though radiation.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.360
And then select whatever grows.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.070
And you would isolate mutants.

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:28.320
I did it myself for my
undergraduate research.

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.300
So I generated a lot
of mutants in the fungi

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.990
that I was studying there.

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:36.310
AUDIENCE: We have
seen a lot of progress

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.820
in space exploration
mainly in rocket

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:44.870
and recently a lot of private
initiative, mainly SpaceX.

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:46.960
Is this type of
research a blocker

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.920
for getting into Mars
safely, because you

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.270
seem like the extreme
radiation will

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:55.750
be exposed for a long time?

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:58.260
Are we waiting for
this type of work

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.090
in order to launch
the next rocket?

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:03.080
IVAN PAULINO-LIMA:
No, actually not.

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:07.840
I think people-- this
private initiatives are

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:13.190
contributing actually to develop
the field of space exploration.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:16.120
I think with current technology
with good current knowledge

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.160
about radiation resistance,
we will eventually

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:22.790
go to Mars accepting the risks.

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:25.460
But it would be nice to
come up with strategies

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.330
to improve radiation
resistance of astronauts

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:32.680
by using synthetic biology,
genetic engineering, and so on.

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.050
But it by no means is stopping.

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:36.940
I think it will
happen definitely even

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.550
with current technology
and knowledge.

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:42.120
And this is one
of the reasons why

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:46.260
I believe that the
human mission to Mars

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.310
will happen within
our generation.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:50.800
I think we will be able to
see that, one more reason

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:56.340
to be thankful to live
in this exciting moment.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.480
I'm not that old.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.850
But I hear this story
about sending humans

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:01.090
to Mars for a long time.

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:04.910
But now, I believe that many
things are being put together.

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:07.200
Technology is far faster.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.750
Rockets are being developed.

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:11.990
All of this synthetic biology
revolution is happening.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:16.420
So I really believe now that
within the next two or three

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.040
decades we will see the
first humans on Mars.

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:22.060
And I hope there will not be
people saying that humans never

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.340
went to Mars.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:25.610
IVAN PAULINO-LIMA:
OK, thank you.

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:26.610
Thank you very much.

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:29.060
[APPLAUSE]
