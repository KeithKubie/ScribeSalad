00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:01.447
- [Voiceover] What we're going to do now

00:00:01.447 --> 00:00:04.379
is start to explore a series of tests

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:09.379
to determine whether a series
will converge or diverge

00:00:09.993 --> 00:00:12.142
and the first one I'm going
to go through right now

00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:15.294
is perhaps the most
basic and hopefully see

00:00:15.294 --> 00:00:17.842
the most intuitive and this
is the divergence test.

00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:22.733
The divergence test won't tell
us if a series will converge

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:26.411
but it can tell us if something
will definitely diverge.

00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:29.792
First let me write it in
kind of mathy notation

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:32.650
and then we'll look at an
actual concrete example on it.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.650
The divergence test tells
us that if the limit

00:00:38.073 --> 00:00:43.073
as N approaches infinity of
A sub N does not equal zero,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.930
then the infinite series
going from N equals one

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.110
to infinity of A sub N will diverge.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.929
We've already gone through
what it means to diverge

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.090
and this sum is either going to go

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.300
unbounded to positive infinity

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.523
or unbounded to negative infinity

00:01:09.523 --> 00:01:12.262
or it'll just oscillate between values,

00:01:12.262 --> 00:01:17.262
it'll never really approach
a given sum or given value.

00:01:17.603 --> 00:01:19.531
That's what the divergence test tells us

00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:21.193
and you're probably
thinking, okay all right,

00:01:21.193 --> 00:01:22.965
I can kind of get what this says

00:01:22.965 --> 00:01:25.116
but where is this actually useful?

00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:27.310
To see where it can be useful

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.932
let's look at a candidate series

00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:33.340
and see if we can figure out
if it's going to diverge.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.660
Let's say I had this series

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.660
so the sum from N equals one to infinity

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.102
and in general it doesn't
always have to be N equals one,

00:01:46.102 --> 00:01:47.607
it could be N equals five,

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.720
it could be N equals zero.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.367
The key is, is that this
is an infinite series

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:54.660
that we're talking about
so that's why we care about

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.193
the limit is N approaches infinity.

00:01:56.193 --> 00:02:00.964
Let's say we have the
sum of four N squared

00:02:00.964 --> 00:02:05.964
minus N to the third over seven,

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:12.636
minus three and to the third power.

00:02:12.636 --> 00:02:14.953
Given what we know about
the divergence test,

00:02:14.953 --> 00:02:19.697
is this series going
to converge or diverge?

00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:22.732
Well, let's just look at this,

00:02:22.732 --> 00:02:25.889
what we're taking the sums of.

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.677
So this is essentially
or this is our A sub N

00:02:29.677 --> 00:02:31.899
if we're trying to match to the definition

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.132
or I guess the explanation
of the divergence test.

00:02:34.132 --> 00:02:37.703
Let's think about what the limit,

00:02:37.703 --> 00:02:42.208
as N approaches infinity of four N squared

00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:46.300
minus N to the third over seven

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.100
minus three N to the third is.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.549
I encourage you to pause the
video and think about that.

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.844
Well there's a couple of
ways to think about it,

00:02:53.844 --> 00:02:56.090
one way is, hey look as N goes to infinity

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.323
the highest degree terms

00:02:57.323 --> 00:02:58.254
of the numerator and the denominator

00:02:58.254 --> 00:02:59.371
are the ones that matter.

00:02:59.371 --> 00:03:01.318
So this is going to approach
negative N to the third

00:03:01.318 --> 00:03:03.940
over negative three N to the third

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.698
which will just be which
would approach negative one

00:03:06.698 --> 00:03:10.720
over negative three which
would be positive 1/3

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.140
or we could say if we want
to do a little bit more,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.451
or do a little bit more systematically.

00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:17.883
Limit as N approaches infinity,

00:03:17.883 --> 00:03:19.725
we can divide what the
numerator and the denominator

00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:20.597
by end of the third,

00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:22.191
so if we divide the
numerator by end of the third

00:03:22.191 --> 00:03:25.151
this first third is
going to be four over N

00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:30.151
minus one over seven over N
to the third, minus three.

00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:35.552
Here it becomes clear, the
limit is N approaches infinity,

00:03:35.552 --> 00:03:38.613
that's going to go to zero,
that's going to go to zero

00:03:38.613 --> 00:03:40.796
and so you're going to
be left with negative one

00:03:40.796 --> 00:03:44.739
over negative three which is equal to 1/3.

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.155
Notice, the limit of A sub
N as N approaches infinity

00:03:49.155 --> 00:03:51.658
in this case is not equal to zero,

00:03:51.658 --> 00:03:56.658
therefore this sum will, this
infinite series will diverge.

00:04:00.293 --> 00:04:04.423
Now let's think for a second
why this makes a ton of sense.

00:04:04.423 --> 00:04:07.240
Well, the only way that
you're going to converge

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.693
that you're going to set,

00:04:07.693 --> 00:04:09.639
remember you're taking infinite sum.

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.360
You're taking an infinite sum of things

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.239
so the only reasonable way

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.795
that something might be able
to converge to a finite value

00:04:15.795 --> 00:04:18.883
is if every extra term you're
adding is getting smaller

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.933
and smaller and smaller
as approaching zero.

00:04:20.933 --> 00:04:24.393
If as N approaches
infinity, you go unbounded

00:04:24.393 --> 00:04:26.154
or if it's even equal to 1/3,

00:04:26.154 --> 00:04:27.872
this means that for very large ends

00:04:27.872 --> 00:04:30.295
you just keep adding things
that are getting closer

00:04:30.295 --> 00:04:31.664
and closer to 1/3.

00:04:31.664 --> 00:04:34.576
Well if you add an infinite
number of one-thirds together,

00:04:34.576 --> 00:04:36.323
you're going to go to infinity,

00:04:36.323 --> 00:04:37.558
you're going to be unbounded.

00:04:37.558 --> 00:04:41.296
You are going to diverge so
that's all it's telling us.

00:04:41.296 --> 00:04:43.410
Look, in order for something to converge

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.554
as you're taking infinite sum of them,

00:04:45.554 --> 00:04:46.767
at some point these things
are going to have to get

00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:48.344
really, really, really close to zero.

00:04:48.344 --> 00:04:50.081
If at some point they're
not getting close to zero,

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.811
there's no way is going to converge,

00:04:51.811 --> 00:04:54.120
that thing will diverge

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.599
so hopefully that makes a little sense.

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.200
That also gives you I
guess another insight

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.332
on what the divergence test can't do.

00:05:00.332 --> 00:05:02.391
The divergence test can be used

00:05:02.391 --> 00:05:04.550
to show that something will diverge

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.890
but if something, I guess you could say

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.573
passes the divergence test,

00:05:08.573 --> 00:05:11.887
it doesn't or I guess
fails the divergence test

00:05:11.887 --> 00:05:13.678
or if this isn't true,

00:05:13.678 --> 00:05:16.592
it doesn't mean that the
thing is going to converge.

00:05:16.592 --> 00:05:18.204
Let me give you an example of that.

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:23.933
This right over here from
N equals one to infinity

00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:27.218
of one over N and this is
actually the harmonic series

00:05:27.218 --> 00:05:28.415
right over here.

00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:31.881
This, if we look at, if we try
to apply the divergence test,

00:05:31.881 --> 00:05:33.466
we would say, okay, well what's the limit

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:37.317
as N approaches infinity of one over N.

00:05:37.317 --> 00:05:39.799
Well, hey that is zero, if
that approaches infinity

00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:42.426
this is equal to zero.

00:05:42.426 --> 00:05:46.833
We could say well it's kind
of failing the divergence test

00:05:46.833 --> 00:05:49.813
so we're not just by
using the divergence test

00:05:49.813 --> 00:05:52.650
we can't prove that this
thing is going to diverge

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.128
but that doesn't mean
that it doesn't diverge.

00:05:55.128 --> 00:05:58.260
It actually turns out and we
prove this in several videos,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.566
it actually turns out that
this thing does diverge.

00:06:00.566 --> 00:06:05.566
This thing does diverge,

00:06:05.738 --> 00:06:08.918
it's just that the
divergence test isn't enough,

00:06:08.918 --> 00:06:11.816
it's not enough of a tool
to let us know for sure

00:06:11.816 --> 00:06:14.105
that this diverge, we'll
see the comparison test

00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:16.352
and the integral test can either be used

00:06:16.352 --> 00:06:19.112
to prove that this in fact does diverge.

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:21.932
You can definitely not
say that if something,

00:06:21.932 --> 00:06:24.549
if this does not apply for something.

00:06:24.549 --> 00:06:26.448
If you think the limit
as N approaches infinity

00:06:26.448 --> 00:06:29.830
and it does go to zero,
that still might diverge.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.335
It doesn't necessarily
mean that it converges.

00:06:33.335 --> 00:06:35.076
Now there are things that do converge

00:06:35.076 --> 00:06:37.522
that where they do approach zero

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:41.228
so for example if I take the sum from

00:06:41.228 --> 00:06:45.375
N equals one to infinity
of one over N squared.

00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:47.697
If I try to apply the divergence test,

00:06:47.697 --> 00:06:50.646
I have the limit as N approaches infinity

00:06:50.646 --> 00:06:53.334
of one over N squared,
well this does equal zero.

00:06:53.334 --> 00:06:54.535
This gets really, really large,

00:06:54.535 --> 00:06:56.281
this thing is going to approach zero

00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:59.430
and so once again this is I guess failing

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.544
the test for divergence.

00:07:01.544 --> 00:07:04.523
Just with that alone
you don't know for sure

00:07:04.523 --> 00:07:06.027
that this thing is going to converge,

00:07:06.027 --> 00:07:07.205
it still might diverge,

00:07:07.205 --> 00:07:09.648
the divergence test just
might not have been enough.

00:07:09.648 --> 00:07:11.981
Now it does turn out and
once again we prove this

00:07:11.981 --> 00:07:14.838
in future videos that
this thing does converge.

00:07:14.838 --> 00:07:19.829
This thing does converge
but not because it,

00:07:19.829 --> 00:07:22.372
I guess you could say
fails the divergence test.

00:07:22.372 --> 00:07:24.704
We have to use a different test to show

00:07:24.704 --> 00:07:26.914
that this does in fact converge,

00:07:26.914 --> 00:07:28.385
just as we have to use
a different test to show

00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:30.666
that this does in fact diverge.

00:07:30.666 --> 00:07:32.601
Where the divergence test is useful

00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:36.489
is for the things that actually
pass the divergence test.

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:38.789
When you actually find that
the limit is N approaches

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:41.396
infinity of A sub N does not equal zero,

00:07:41.396 --> 00:07:42.991
like this case right over here.

00:07:42.991 --> 00:07:45.286
In this case the divergence test helps us

00:07:45.286 --> 00:07:48.038
because it helps us make the conclusion

00:07:48.038 --> 00:07:53.038
that this series definitely diverges.
