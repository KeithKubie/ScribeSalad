00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.180
With movie studios spending millions to bring
comic book superheroes to life, and outshine

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.570
the competition, you would think that almost
all of their efforts and energy winds up on

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.570
the screen.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.900
But you'd be surprised to learn that some
of the best superhero stories come from behind

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.290
the camera, before they ever start rolling.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.380
Here is another dose of insider trivia in
our latest edition of Know Your Movies: 20

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.460
Mind-Blowing Facts About Superhero Movies.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.530
Man of Steel
The latest Superman origin story skips over

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.300
most of Clark discovering his abilities as
a kid, but we do get a look at his horrifying

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.300
X-Ray vision.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.420
If the shots seem familiar, they should: the
special effects team turned to John Carpenter's

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.969
"They Live" for the overall look.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.670
The movie gives only a short look at the planet
Krypton before it's destroyed, but to make

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.800
it seem real, Snyder hired a linguist to create
an entire language, alphabet, and sentence

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.520
structure for the ancient society.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.510
The art team made sure to create, then carve
Kryptonian proverbs all over the props and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.300
sets - ready to be translated for any fan
with some free time.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.630
Batman V Superman
It's every kid's dream to be the Batman, so

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.131
it's no surprise that during production of
Batman V Superman, Ben Affleck asked the studio

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.290
if he could have the Dark Knight costume when
filming wrapped.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.210
They told him he could - but would have to
cover the $100,000 cost.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.650
He decided some photos were a nice compromise.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.140
Dawn of Justice might mark the first time
that Batman and Superman share the screen,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.940
but that's not the entire story for the stars
who made the heroes movie icons.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.930
To get a glimpse of the World's Finest an
entire generation dreamed of, just pick up

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.040
Speechless, starring Michael Keaton and Christopher
Reeve.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.030
Fans don't know how DC's movie universe will
play out, but history has already been made,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.540
thanks to Ben Affleck, after playing former
Superman actor George Reeves in Hollywoodland,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.750
Ben Affleck is now the first and only man
to play both of DC's biggest heroes on film

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.100
- and that's one record that he'll probably
hold for good.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.310
Guardians of the Galaxy Star-Lord's ship might
seem cutting-edge, but he reveals that his

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.130
romantic exploits would make it into a Jackson
Pollock painting under a black light.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.860
The black light was scripted, but Chris Pratt's
censor-tempting punchline wasn't.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.130
Director James Gunn only left it in when the
line got the biggest laugh from early test

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.130
audiences.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.252
The creepy Sakaraan soldiers working for Ronan
don't get much time in the spotlight, but

00:02:08.252 --> 00:02:12.640
when they do, it's James Gunn provided their
voices, along with his assistant, Simon Hatt.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.849
Gunn even makes a cameo of sorts, as the unmasked
soldier killed by Yondu.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.200
Ant-Man
The Marvel comedy has plenty of pop culture

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.499
references, but one of its best never made
it to screen.

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:25.780
Paul Rudd had the idea of Michael Pena's character
greeting him outside the prison blasting Peter

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.010
Gabriel's "In Your Eyes" as a nod to the teen
classic Say Anything.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.830
They even filmed the scene... then found out
how much the song would cost to license, and

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.870
cut it.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.730
Iron Man 3
The Miss Chatanooga pageant is played for

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.530
a single laugh in the movie, but the contestant
is anything but random.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.269
When casting the part, director Shane Black
turned to Yvonne Zima, the seven-year-old

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.760
star of The Long Kiss Goodnight, one of his
earlier screenplays.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.709
Iron Man 2
When Tony starts investigating his new nemesis,

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.160
Whiplash, an old photo shows that villain
was once arrested for selling plutonium.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.099
It's not a case of photoshop, but a real photo
of actor Mickey Rourke from a drug arrest

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.810
in his younger days.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.690
X-Men
Fans were probably too distracted by the introduction

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.860
of Rogue in the first X-Men movie to notice
the major cameo.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.560
The truck driver who drops her off in a northern
Canada town is actor George Buza, the unforgettable

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.540
voice of Beast from the classic X-Men cartoon
series.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.900
CG effects have come a long way since the
year 2000, but even back then, the crew found

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.010
a clever way to create the teleporting mutant
boy playing basketball all by himself.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.709
Just hire triplets, and paint them out one
by one, and you'll have fans wondering just

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.099
how much special effects makes possible.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.349
Batman Begins
It may have all been one big fake-out, but

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.959
the first version of the immortal Ra's al
Ghul is hard to forget, played by Ken Watanabe

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.639
But don't bother trying to decipher the language
he's speaking, being translated by Liam Neeson's

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.510
secret villain - it's gibberish, made up by
the actor with some Japanese words scattered

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.510
for flavor.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.469
The first scene that Christian Bale actually
filmed with co-stars Michael Caine and Morgan

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:51.310
Freeman features him waking from a drug-induced
sleep.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.150
As incredible as his performance turned out,
his co-stars weren't quite as impressed when

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.870
Bale actually fell asleep in the Wayne bed,
starting the shoot being poked awake by his

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.870
butler, Alfred.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.930
Somehow, it seems like a perfect start.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.819
Deadpool
Some of the best laughs of the movie come

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.939
from the scenes shared by Deadpool and his
favorite cab driver, Dopinder.

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.790
But fans might not realize that the driver
is actually a tribute to a childhood friend

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.120
of star Ryan Reynolds who passed away when
he was, fitting with the movie's tone, struck

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.120
by lightning.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.120
For real.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.230
Instead of artwork, Wade Wilson decorates
his house with paper targets from a gun range

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.700
he apparently frequents.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.930
The paper targets aren't randomly chosen,
but authentic Firearms Qualification Targets

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.639
used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.590
They wouldn't be hard to find, since Ryan
Reynolds' father and brother are both Mounties.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.330
The movie confirms that Deadpool lives in
the same universe as the X-Men, but the shared

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.940
universe is just as active behind the scenes.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.830
Actress Olivia Munn first tried her hand at
a mutant auditioning for the role of Deadpool's

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.830
girlfriend.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.629
She didn't land the part, but producer Simon
Kinberg decided she was too good to pass up,

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.910
casting her as Psylocke in X-Men: Apocalypse
instead.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.810
The Wolverine
With his second solo movie, actor Hugh Jackman

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.710
finally got into the physical shape he had
always envisioned for Wolverine.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.919
The results were staggering, but in the actual
movie, only a handful of scenes actually showed

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:57.919
them.

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.890
To make the most of Jackman's work - and the
attention it would grab - most of the marketing

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.310
was tweaked to feature the actor in all his
topless glory.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.000
Suicide Squad
It's hard to think of another actress who

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.639
could capture the no-nonsense authority of
Amanda Waller like Oscar-nominated Viola Davis.

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.310
But the studio was apparently eager to land
another world-famous actress for the part:

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.310
Oprah Winfrey.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.180
We still can't decide if that was a terrible
idea, or an incredible one.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.480
Captain America: The Winter Soldier
It might seem like fantasy, but the shi-based

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.479
satellite launch platform infiltrated by Cap
in the movie;s opening scenes is an actual

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:29.479
ship.

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.220
Apparently, after landing the practical set,
the directors decided to find a way to work

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.069
the satellite technology into the plot of
the script - a bit backwards, but it paid

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:38.069
off.

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:40.979
Those are the bits of trivia, easter eggs
and behind-the-scenes secrets we found for

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.050
some of our favorite superhero movies, but
which ones did we miss?
