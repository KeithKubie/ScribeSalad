00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.320
François-Marie Arouet was born in Paris in 1694

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.440
His father, a well-established lawyer, sent him to the best school in the capital,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.240
and by all accounts, he was a brilliant student.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.120
The young Arouet, decided at an early age to make his name as a writer,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.520
or rather to remake his name,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.080
as the first thing he did was to change his name to Voltaire.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.988
The 18th century is often referred to as the Age of Reason,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.920
or the Age of Enlightenment,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.560
but sometimes more fairly simply as the Age of Voltaire.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.295
So, changing his name was a good call.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.600
The age of Arouet, which is not of work quite as well.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.392
Voltaire was precociously talented as a poet.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:52.935
At the age of only 24,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.720
he had his first verse tragedy performed at the Comédie-Française.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.640
By then, he'd already begun work on an epic poem

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.960
about the French religious civil wars of the 16th century,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.320
about the French religious civil wars of the 16th century,

00:01:06.345 --> 00:01:09.736
by pragmatically converting from Protestantism to Catholicism.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.455
This was to be a subject dear to Voltaire's heart,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.040
For under the guise of writing a national epic,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.080
he was dwelling at length on the bloody consequences of religious intolerance.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.800
Right from the start, Voltaire's views on religion were expressed robustly.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.160
He was not an atheist.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.560
In part, because he thought that some minimal belief in a deity

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.560
was useful for social cohesion.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.520
Voltaire's God had created the world,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.920
instilled in us a sense of good and evil and then basically taken a back seat.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.160
This was known as rational religion,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.600
Or in the 18th century called natural religion, or deism.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.200
And it had no truck with metaphysics of any kind.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.480
Voltaire was basically a man of reason,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.000
who loathed fanaticism, idolatry and superstition.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.080
That men can kill each other to defend some bit of religious doctrine,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.480
which they scarcely understand, is something he found repellent.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.840
And he reserved his greatest hatred for the clerics,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.040
who exploited the credulity of believers to maintain their own power base.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.160
Voltaire wanted religion but not the Church.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.320
For obvious reasons, the Catholic authorities

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.120
were not keen for Voltaire's poem about Henry IV,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.720
La Henriade, to be published in France.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.720
So Voltaire decided to go and publish it in London instead,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.640
and in 1726, went and traveled to England.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.600
What began as a business trip soon turned, however, into something quite different.

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:38.625
And Voltaire ended up staying in England for some two and a half years.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.200
He learned to speak English fluently, got to know writers and politicians,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.520
and became a great admirer of English Protestant culture.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.840
He decided to write a book about his experience of England.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.440
And the Letters Concerning the English Nation appeared first in English in 1733.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.360
The French authorities were horrified.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.800
The book was censored and Voltaire only narrowly avoided prison.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.600
That's because the book presented an informal portrait of English culture,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.560
In a witty and ironical style looking in turn at religion, politics, science and literature,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.480
in ways that were critical implicitly of French culture and politics.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.960
Here, for example, is how Voltaire presents the Royal Exchange,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.360
a handsome building in the heart of the City of London,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.920
where merchants from across the world would meet to transact business.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.720
"Take a view of the Royal Exchange," Voltaire wrote,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.560
where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.400
There the Jew, the Muhammadan and a Christian transact together

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.760
as though they all profess the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but the bankrupts.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.575
There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker’s word.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.440
At the breaking up of this pacific and free assembly,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.240
some will withdraw to the synagogue, and others to take a glass.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.360
This man goes and is baptised in a great tub, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost:

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.720
that man has his son’s foreskin cut off,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.640
whilst a set of Hebrew words (quite unintelligible to him) are mumbled over his child.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.006
If one religion only were allowed in England, the government would very possibly become arbitrary;

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.520
if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats;

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.400
but as there as such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace."

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.575
Voltaire's message is clear.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.758
Religious differences are trivial and separate men,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.960
while trade is important and brings them together.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.880
His conclusion, that the plurality of religions in England leads to a more peaceful society,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.800
is, of course, a covert criticism of France, where the Catholic Church was so dominant.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.800
The Letters Concerning the English Nation,

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.419
also discuss Locke and Newton, thinkers then poorly known in France

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.800
The subject-matter might seem challenging, but Voltaire is a past master popularising difficult material.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.224
Ask any schoolchild today what they know about Newton,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.720
and they'll tell you about the apple falling on his head,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.880
and the survival of this anecdote is due entirely to Voltaire.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.440
He heard it from Newton's niece and immediately understood that this simple homely image

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.840
was the perfect way of conveying the simplicity of Newton's explanation of the force of gravity.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.880
After Voltaire used the story in his Letters Concerning the English Nation,

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.120
everyone remembered it and Voltaire left his mark on English popular culture.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.440
Voltaire struggled with the question of good and evil

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.648
the problem at the heart of his best-known work, Candide

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.880
which was published in 1759

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.000
and was a best seller from the moment it appeared.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.060
Translated into every possible language,

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.880
it remains the most widely read work of the European Enlightenment.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.080
It's even left its mark on our language

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.200
Expressions like 'pour encourager les autres' to encourage the others

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.960
or 'il faut cultiver le jardin', we must cultivate our garden

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.660
have entered common usage.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.760
'In the best of all possible worlds', yes, that's another one

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.215
speakers of French or English quote Candide, without even realising it.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.640
And that's the sure mark of a classic.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.680
Candide is a timeless work, as satire of the human condition,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.120
but it's also work of the Enlightenment and its philosophical theme is announced in the title:

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.760
"Candide" or "Optimism".

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.519
The hero of Candide, as his name tells us, is an innocent anti-hero.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.040
He is in thrall to his tutor, Pangloss, who preaches the philosophy of Optimism.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.920
This is not 'optimism' in the modern sense of looking on the bright side.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.560
Optimism, spelled with a capital O and as expounded by the German philosopher, Leibniz,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.560
was an attempt to answer the age-old problem of evil.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.000
Why, if God is good, does he permit the existence of evil in the world?

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.220
To which the 18th century Leibnizian Optimist replies,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.520
evil is all part of some greater pattern of good:

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.080
'All partial evil, universal good' as the English poet "Pope" put it.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.120
In other words, evil doesn't really exist at all.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.840
It's just something which man imagines because of his limited view of the world.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.520
You might think this sounds like a bit of a confidence trick, Voltaire certainly did,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.400
but this idea did find widespread acceptance in the 18th century.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.240
Candide's great mission was to put this philosophy to the test.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.400
Ejected from his comfortable home in an obscure German castle,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.600
after trying to seduce the Baron's beautiful daughter, Cunégonde,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.680
Voltaire's hero, Candide, undergoes many trials and tribulations:

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.080
conscripted into the army, he fights in a war,

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.120
then deserts, only to find himself a witness to an earthquake in Lisbon.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.560
Candide is repeatedly brought face to face with evil in its most extreme forms:

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.920
moral evil, in the case of the earthquake, where man is not apparently to blame;

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.400
and most of all human evil, such as the war, where man is very definitely to blame.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.760
Pangloss's breezy Optimism is clearly an inadequate response to enormities of evil on this scale.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.800
Eventually, even Candide comes to realize this:

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.120
to quote from the book, 'And sometimes Pangloss would say to Candide:

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.600
 

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.020
 

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.180
 

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.440
 

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.680
 

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.160
 

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.160
 

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.840
 

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.840
 

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.200
After 1760, Voltaire took up residence in the château at Ferney, just outside Geneva.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.160
By now, he was the most famous living writer in Europe,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.200
and he became widely known as the ‘patriarch of Ferney’.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.920
He took up a number of public causes.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.240
In 1761, a Protestant merchant Jean Calas,

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.720
was accused of murdering his son and sentenced by the judges of Toulouse

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.815
to be tortured and then broken on the wheel.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.000
The legal processes were, to say the least, irregular,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.880
and the suspicions grew that the judges in his Catholic city

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.000
had acted with excessive zeal out of religious bigotry.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.611
Voltaire became involved in the case

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.560
and mounted an energetic campaign to rehabilitate Calas’ memory

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.800
and help the members of his family, who had been left destitute.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.520
He wrote letters to those in authority and published a stream of pamphlets,

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.960
culminating in 1763 in his Traité sur la tolérance,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.800
which begins with the historical facts of the Calas case

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.720
and broadens out into a history of religious intolerance in European culture.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.720
Voltaire's writings had enormous impact on public opinion,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.520
and eventually the judges in Paris quashed the judgment of the Toulouse court.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.720
Too late to save Calas, but a huge victory for Voltaire,

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.280
who had learnt an important lesson

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.920
about how change could be brought about through the pressure of public opinion.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.920
 

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.800
 

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.000
Voltaire said of himself that he ‘wrote to act’,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.400
and he wanted his writings to change the way people thought and behaved.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.040
In leading his crusades against fanaticism, he even invented a campaign slogan,

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.720
Ecrasez l’Infâme!, which translates roughly as ‘Crush the despicable!’.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.440
L’Infâme stands here for everything that Voltaire hates,

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.520
everything that he had spent his life fighting:

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.880
superstition, intolerance, irrational behaviour of every kind.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.560
We should never forget that Voltaire was also a brilliant writer,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.720
one of the greatest stylist the French language has ever known.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.440
The power of his ideas had a lot to do with the power of his expression.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.080
Many writers made fun of miracles.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.000
No one did so hilariously as Voltaire.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Always, Voltaire had an ear for the telling phrase:

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.000
 

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.280
It's a good line, even in English, and better still in the original French

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.880
where it is more memorable because it is a classical alexandrine line in 12 syllables:

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.640
Si Dieu n’existait pas, il faudrait l’inventer.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.000
Voltaire's legacy in our present debates about religious toleration remain extremely potent.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.080
Hardly a week passes without an article in the press quoting:

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.640
‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.’

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.800
This rallying cry of tolerant multiculturalism is so potent

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.520
that if Voltaire hadn't said it, we would have had to invent it,

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.760
which is what happened.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.800
The expression was invented by an English woman in 1906.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.240
No matter, it expresses a truth which is fundamentally important to our culture,

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.800
so we have adopted the phrase and decided that Voltaire said it.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.160
Voltaire, his name has become synonymous with a set of liberal values:

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.520
freedom of speech, rejection of bigotry and superstition,

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.480
belief in reason and tolerance.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.040
It's a unique, and nowadays, extremely precious legacy.
