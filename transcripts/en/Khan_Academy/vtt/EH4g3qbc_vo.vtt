00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.380
- [Instructor] In a previous video,

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.700
we've given an intuition

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.640
on what foreign exchange
markets are all about.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.640
In particular, we talked about
the foreign exchange market

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.740
between the U.S. dollar
and the Chinese yuan.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.470
What we're going to do
in this video is think

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.730
about the same idea, but think
about it in terms of graphs

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.800
and the types of economic
models that we're used to seeing

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.930
in an introductory macroeconomics course.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.190
So what we're going to
focus on in this video

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.420
is the foreign exchange market.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.140
Foreign exchange

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.630
market

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.710
for the Chinese

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.003
yuan.

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:41.960
Now, we're going to think about it

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.820
in terms of supply and demand curves.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.320
It can be a little bit confusing

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.680
because we're gonna be thinking
of the price of the yuan

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.330
in terms of another currency,
in this case the dollar,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.680
although you could do it in
terms of other currencies,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.180
the pound or the euro or whatever else.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.880
Now, this can be a little bit confusing

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.720
because we're going to be thinking

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.180
about currency on both axes.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.920
But let's first think
about the horizontal axis

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.620
that when we're thinking
about most markets,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.490
that is our quantity axis.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.760
And here once we're going
to think about quantity.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.150
We're gonna think about the quantity.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.610
Quantity of Chinese yuan.

00:01:18.634 --> 00:01:20.280
And then our vertical axis,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.370
we're essentially going to
be thinking about the price

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.000
of the Chinese yuan.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.780
But how do you think about
the price of a currency?

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.720
Well, we're going to think of it

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.520
in terms of another currency.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.700
And for the sake of this video,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.790
that other currency is
going to be the U.S. dollar.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.480
So this is going to be U.S. dollars

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.940
per Chinese yuan.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.830
And I encourage you, pause this video.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.110
Think deeply about why it's
U.S. dollars per Chinese yuan,

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.900
as opposed to Chinese
yuan per U.S. dollars.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.075
And think about why I put the
quantity of Chinese yuan here

00:01:56.075 --> 00:01:57.760
instead of the quantity of U.S. dollars,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.300
because this is the
foreign exchange market

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.320
for the Chinese yuan.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.410
I could have done another chart

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.130
where it's the foreign exchange
market for the U.S. dollar,

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.030
in which case then my
quantity would be U.S. dollar.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.850
And then I would think of how much

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.000
of some other currency per U.S. dollar.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.270
So I would say maybe how much
Chinese yuan per U.S. dollar?

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.610
But here it's the other way around.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.570
I'm in the market for the Chinese yuan.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.730
So let's think about the
supply and demand curves

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.770
and which way they would work.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.270
Well, imagine that people are
offering very few U.S. dollars

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.570
per Chinese yuan.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.070
Well, in that world, a lot of
people might not wanna convert

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.010
their yuan into dollars.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.080
They might not offer them up for supply

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.710
to be converted into U.S. dollars.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.230
The quantity of Chinese yuan,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.750
if the price for the Chinese yuan is low,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.050
might be pretty low.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.280
And as the price people are willing to pay

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.440
in terms of dollars goes up,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.980
well, more and more people
might be willing to transact.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.300
So our supply curve, and here
we're talking about the supply

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.200
for Chinese yuan, is likely to increase

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.190
as people are willing to
pay more for those yuans.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.260
And this is like many markets
that we've seen before.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.400
It's just a little bit less intuitive

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.020
because we're thinking about
markets for one currency

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.080
in terms of another currency.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.480
Now, what about the demand curve?

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.650
Well, the demand curve is gonna look

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.780
like a lot of demand curves we've seen.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.700
If the price of a Chinese yuan is high,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.830
well, very few people
are going to demand it.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.670
And as the price of the Chinese yuan

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.040
in terms of dollars is lower and lower,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.850
more and more people might
demand more Chinese yuan,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.510
go like, "Hey, it's cheaper
now in terms of U.S. dollars."

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.160
So this is what a demand
curve might look like.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.610
And as you can imagine,

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.060
this point is our equilibrium point,

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.350
and it would tell us our
equilibrium exchange rate.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.320
We could call that our
equilibrium exchange rate,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.320
and this would be our
equilibrium quantity.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.940
So, for example, let's say
that our equilibrium quantity,

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.720
and let's say this is the
quantity that changes hands

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.450
in some time period, so let's say per day.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.450
Let's say or equilibrium
quantity is equal to 1,000 yuan.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.113
1,000 yuan.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.150
And let me just call this Q sub one,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.230
is 1,000 yuan.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.200
These numbers are very low.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.620
Real exchange markets, we
might be talking about billions

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.940
or tens or hundreds of billions

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.810
or even sometimes trillions
of various currency.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.270
But let's just say for
argument it's 1,000 yuan

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.410
is our current equilibrium
exchange quantity per day.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.970
And let's say this
exchange rate, e sub one,

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.800
is equal to 10 cents per yuan.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.780
So 10 cents,

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.610
or 1/10 of a U.S. dollar per Chinese yuan.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.630
So that's our current exchange rate.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.310
Now, let's say for some reason,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.940
all of a sudden Americans
become increasingly interested

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.960
in converting their currency.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.870
Maybe they want to invest in China.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.677
Maybe all of a sudden the Chinese say,

00:04:57.677 --> 00:04:59.880
"Hey, Americans, come
buy property in China."

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.700
A lot of people are interested.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.410
Well, what would happen here?

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.640
Well, then the demand
for yuan would increase

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.930
because you could only buy that
property in China with yuan,

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.090
not with U.S. dollars.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.320
What would happen here?

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.560
Well, your demand curve
would shift to the right

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.140
like we've seen before.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.920
If we call this D one,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.160
then we could get to a new demand curve

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.670
that might look something
like this, D two.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.000
Now, what would happen

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.900
if our equilibrium exchange
rate doesn't change?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.600
Well, if this is our exchange rate,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.070
if this were to stay our exchange rate,

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.670
now all of a sudden a higher
quantity is being demanded

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.430
than is being supplied.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.780
The Americans in this situation,

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.420
or it actually doesn't
even have to be Americans.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.660
It could just be whoever's
holding U.S. dollars,

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.810
there's demand for more
than 1,000 yuan per day.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.123
Maybe this is 1,500 yuan
or whatever it might be.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.500
What you would naturally see
is that price of the yuan

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.420
in terms of U.S. dollars will go up

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.260
until you get to an equilibrium point.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.830
And on the first video when
we talk about the intuition

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.180
of foreign exchange markets,

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.310
we talk about why this would be.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.050
So you would then get
to a new equilibrium,

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.760
right over here, this is e sub two,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.580
and a new equilibrium quantity.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.820
Let's call this Q two.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.360
Our new equilibrium quantity, Q two,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.060
might be 1,200 yuan per day
versus 1,000 yuan per day.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.370
And our new equilibrium exchange rate,

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.070
maybe this is now equal
to 15 cents per yuan

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.860
instead of 10 cents per yuan.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.150
So big picture, you can think
of the foreign exchange market

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.270
in a lot of ways like we've looked

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.163
at other markets in macroeconomics.

00:06:42.598 --> 00:06:43.870
It takes a little bit of an intuitive leap

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.340
to just think about the
market for one currency

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.693
in terms of another.
