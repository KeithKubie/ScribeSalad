00:00:00.607 --> 00:00:02.442
- [Voiceover] Part d.

00:00:02.442 --> 00:00:07.341
The pipe can hold 50 cubic feet
of water before overflowing.

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:10.940
For t greater than eight,
water continue to flow

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.342
into and out of the
pipe at the gives rates

00:00:14.342 --> 00:00:17.128
until the pipe begins to overflow.

00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:20.542
Write, but do not solve, an equation

00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:22.690
involving one or more integrals

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.690
that gives the time w when the
pipe will begin to overflow.

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:30.433
All right, so the pipe
is going to overflow.

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:32.593
So we're going to figure
out that gives the time w

00:00:32.593 --> 00:00:34.091
and the pipe begins to overflow.

00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:36.157
So the pipe will begin to overflow

00:00:36.157 --> 00:00:40.116
when it crosses 50 cubic feet of water

00:00:40.116 --> 00:00:42.833
or you could say right when
you hit 50 cubic feet of water

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:45.642
then it will begin to overflow.

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:49.066
So we could figure out at
what time does the pipe have

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:53.677
50 cubic feet of water in it.

00:00:53.677 --> 00:00:58.677
And so we could just say,
well, w of this time.

00:00:58.832 --> 00:01:02.101
So I use uppercase W as my function

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:03.942
for how much water is in the pipe.

00:01:03.942 --> 00:01:07.392
So capital W of lowercase w is

00:01:07.392 --> 00:01:09.937
going to be equal to 50.

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:12.909
And so you would just solve for the w.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.378
And it said write but do
not solve an equation.

00:01:15.378 --> 00:01:17.096
Well, just to make this
a little bit clear,

00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:21.974
if uppercase W of
lowercase w is going to be

00:01:21.974 --> 00:01:26.974
30 plus the integral from zero to w.

00:01:28.012 --> 00:01:30.982
Actually, now since I don't
have t as one of my vars,

00:01:30.982 --> 00:01:34.581
I could just say R of t minus D of t, td.

00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:35.768
So let me just do that.

00:01:35.768 --> 00:01:40.320
R of t minus D of t,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.502
dt.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.893
So this is the amount of total water

00:01:44.893 --> 00:01:46.878
in the pipe at time w.

00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:49.955
Well, this is going to be equal to 50.

00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:52.614
So we have just written
an equation involving

00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:55.040
one or more integrals
that gives the time w

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.433
with the pipe will begin to overflow.

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:57.420
So if you could solve for w,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.195
that's the time that the
pipe begins to overflow.

00:02:00.195 --> 00:02:01.635
We are assuming that it doesn't just

00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:04.073
right get to 50 and then
somehow come back down

00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:06.720
that it will cross 50 at this time around.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.241
So you could test a little
bit more if you want.

00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:09.994
You could try that slightly larger w

00:02:09.994 --> 00:02:11.669
or you could see that the rate,

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.336
that you have more flowing in

00:02:14.336 --> 00:02:15.861
than flowing out of that time

00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:19.683
which this R of w is gonna
be greater than D of w

00:02:19.683 --> 00:02:21.250
so it means you're only
gonna be increasing

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.390
so you get across over right at that time.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.316
So if you want the w
though, you'd solve this.

00:02:26.316 --> 00:02:28.440
Now another option, it's okay, we know w

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.588
is going to be greater than eight.

00:02:30.588 --> 00:02:32.980
So you could say, okay,
how much water do we have

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.280
right at time equals eight?

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.579
We figure that out at the last problem.

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.108
And so you could say we,
at time equals eight,

00:02:40.108 --> 00:02:42.581
we have that much, 48.544,

00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:44.880
and this is approximation
that's pretty close.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.560
Plus the amount of water
we accumulate between time,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.740
eight and time w of R of t

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.118
minus D of t,

00:02:56.118 --> 00:02:59.427
dt is equal to 50.

00:02:59.427 --> 00:03:01.667
Either one of these would
get you to the same place.

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:05.208
So w at right, when do we
hit 50 cubic feet of water?

00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:06.740
And then if you want to test it further,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.051
you can make sure that your
rate is increasing right at that

00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:12.847
or you have a net positive
inflow of water at that point

00:03:12.847 --> 00:03:16.812
which tells you that you're
just about to start overflowing.
