00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.500
DIVYA PILLAI: Today I am proud
to present accordionist Cory

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.750
Pesaturo and even prouder to
say that I know him personally.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.170
He's sort of a habitual pioneer
as an American accordionists,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.860
the first graduate from The New
England Conservatory of music

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.790
in accordion, a four time
world championship winner

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.280
and hopefully
world record holder

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.500
in marathon accordion playing.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.560
He just came back from
Austria after having

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.620
played for over 32 hours
to break the Guinness World

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.670
record.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.740
He's won world championships
on both acoustic and electronic

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.900
accordion, and the
only person to also win

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.210
a world championship in jazz.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.590
He's got a whole host
of other activities,

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.970
including developing his
own electric accordion,

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.980
compiling hurricane
weather records,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.310
and collaborating with the
Red Bull Formula One team.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.620
He will discuss the history
of the accordion in America

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.530
and what he's doing to
reinvent the instruments.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.930
There's some really interesting
technology involved.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.340
With him that is fellow
accordionists Ljubinka Kulisic,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.740
a Serbian accordionist
and a very accomplished

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.510
international performer.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.380
They will both demonstrate their
amazing virtuosic and sometimes

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.720
improvisational playing styles.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.790
Please join me in
welcoming Corey Pesaturo.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.949
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:32.990
CORY PESATURO: All right.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.390
How is everybody
doing today at Google?

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.600
It's my first time over here.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.036
It's quite awesome.

00:01:38.036 --> 00:01:40.160
And San Francisco is my
favorite city in the world,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.140
so it just works fabulously.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.040
And I guess hello to all of
live streamers and future people

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.300
on YouTube.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.250
So does anybody play
accordion in here?

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.310
I know Debbie was saying there
are some-- yeah, OK, wow.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.340
All right.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.950
That's more than most, usually.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.114
So we have some.

00:01:56.114 --> 00:01:57.530
Usually in a crowd
of 10,000 there

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.415
might be one person
that raises their hand.

00:01:59.415 --> 00:02:02.160
So this is a pretty
good percentage.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.680
Yeah, so I've been
playing accordion

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.055
since I was about
nine years old.

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:09.229
I'm from Rhode Island, that
little tiny state of course.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.120
Started playing
accordion because my dad

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.040
played back when it was popular.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.905
And I'll go over the
history of the accordion

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:17.670
and where we're at now.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.730
But let me just play
you a couple of things,

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.188
maybe starting with something
you might expect on accordion

00:02:22.188 --> 00:02:24.500
and then go through
to stuff you would not

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.680
expect on the accordion, because
this is an electric accordion.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.302
And I'll explain the differences
between acoustic and electric.

00:02:33.302 --> 00:02:35.294
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:30.877 --> 00:05:33.460
So yes, you've heard Party Rock
Anthem on the accordion today.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.002
All is good.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.710
Pretty much anything
is possible, really,

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.960
on the accordion.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.140
So where to start
with the accordion?

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.949
There's kind of still
debate and I don't know.

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.240
It's tough trying to research
everything and figure out

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.090
when did the accordion start and
when did it get into the phase

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.229
that it is in now?

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.270
And there are many different
kinds of accordions,

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.340
which I'll also say.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.880
So around the 1820s,
1830s, accordion

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.240
began as just something
to have an organ

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.250
that you'd be able to
almost put in your pocket

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.780
and walk around with.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.510
And the idea was to have
these little reeds that you

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.790
would play and blow into.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.740
Organetto was kind
of the first one.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.560
And then they started
to look kind of like,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.960
if anybody knows a
bandoneon or concertina

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.440
they play in Argentina, they
started to look more like that.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.930
And then around 1900,
people started saying,

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.570
why don't we put a
piano on the right side?

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.520
And so the actual term of this
instrument that I'm playing

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.590
is called the piano accordion.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.372
And that has mainly become
popular in the United States.

00:06:37.372 --> 00:06:39.830
And it's kind of interesting
how every single country plays

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.160
a different accordion, and I'll
draw different ones that we do.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.340
So the guy that made the
accordion popular in the United

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.800
States was a person
named Guido Deiro.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.417
And he came to the United
States in 1908, brought

00:06:53.417 --> 00:06:54.500
the first piano accordion.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.540
And that was in
the vaudeville era

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.280
and he became a
huge star in that.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.110
And by 1920 accordion was a
fairly popular instrument.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.020
And it stayed that
way until about 1930.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.000
And the accordion
began to die off

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.590
as it had its kind of
a little bit of a rain.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.297
And kind of just
stayed in the, it

00:07:14.297 --> 00:07:16.880
wasn't unpopular it just wasn't
really a thing to do, probably

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.110
until 1948 when Dick Contino
went on the Horace Heidt

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.360
show, which in those days
was kind of like American

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.140
Idol on the radio.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.300
And he made the accordion
massively popular at that time.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.310
And that stayed
through the '50s,

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.620
until 1962 when
the Beatles landed,

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.640
and then that was a
quick, a very quick end

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.440
to the accordion.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.809
People tell me if you wanted
to be cool in 1960 or so,

00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:43.850
you played the accordion.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.850
And by 1965 you couldn't get a
date if you played accordion.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.530
So it was an incredible,
really quick drop off.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.940
But during that time,
especially in the '50s,

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.970
there were so many
accordion players

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.940
around the United States
and they were just

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.430
empires of teaching facilities.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.520
In Detroit there was
Tony Dannon's empire.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.480
You had Joan Sommers
in Kansas City.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.150
You had the AAA organization
in the east coast.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.670
And there were just thousands
of students playing accordion.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.130
We produced a lot of world
champions in the '50s

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.030
and into the '60s.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.300
But since the early '60s,
the accordion really died

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.430
and by the '80s,
I mean, you didn't

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:23.730
mention the word accordion.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.270
It was just absolute no, no.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.040
Weird Al kind of
came out and used it

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.970
as a joke a bit in, what,
probably around the '80s.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.760
But it was still
pretty much a joke.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.950
And it died to the point
where it's almost a good thing

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.700
because the younger
generation doesn't

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.470
know what the
accordion is today,

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.356
because their parents are
the ones that really didn't

00:08:48.356 --> 00:08:49.730
want to talk about
it, especially

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.851
their parents' generation.

00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:52.100
So no one mentioned accordion.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.890
So to young people it's
like, what is this thing?

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:55.921
Yeah, the accordion.

00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:57.420
It doesn't have the
negative stigma.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.290
I can say just when I was
growing up the negative stigma

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.147
was everywhere.

00:09:01.147 --> 00:09:03.230
It was, oh, accordion,
yeah, yeah, the squeezebox,

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.160
the polka.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.487
[POLKA MUSIC]

00:09:06.487 --> 00:09:08.570
And there's a lot of great
polka accordion players

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.730
but that was kind of the joke.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.160
But now I'm seeing it as,
the negative stigma is gone

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.362
and it's just becoming this,
what is this instrument?

00:09:16.362 --> 00:09:17.320
So that's where we are.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.340
But every country's
history of the accordion

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.720
is completely different.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.060
Brazil, right now,
you play accordion,

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.520
that's a very cool thing to do.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.680
Argentina, bandoneon,
very cool thing to do.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.310
France, playing accordion,
very cool thing to do.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.210
Finland as well,
all of Scandinavia.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.005
Russia is very big
on classical music.

00:09:38.005 --> 00:09:39.380
And you'll see
Ljubinka in a bit.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.130
She's from Serbia.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.660
Serbia, playing accordion,
very cool thing to do.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.970
It's country by country.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.530
In Italy, everybody thinks--

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.120
you know, and I'm
Italian, as you

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.480
can tell by the hair, nose,
and height, of course,

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.620
and that I play accordion.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.960
Everybody thinks, oh, Italian,
yeah, it's very popular there.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.140
No, it's kind of like here.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.420
You ask kids in Italy,
you play a accordion?

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.070
No, my grandfather does.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.250
So that is kind of the same.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.000
It depends on the country.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.670
So let me go over-- everybody
understands piano, yes?

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.090
So the bellows,
how do they work?

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.850
Basically an accordion, not
this because it's electric,

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:18.362
but an acoustic accordion
basically works as a harmonica.

00:10:18.362 --> 00:10:19.820
In fact in Italian,
the accordion's

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.590
called the fisarmonica.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.570
All it is is these
big harmonicas

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.910
that you can actually pull
them out and play them.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.010
And they just all
have reeds on them.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.250
And they are put here and here.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.340
And they're connected to
the air in the bellows

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.280
and they're connected
to the keys.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:39.280
And when you hit a note what
happens is, the hammer opens.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.580
And then when you pull air
through that reed plays.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.380
So that's really--
it's just a harmonica

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.560
with a lot of buttons on it,
pretty much-- many harmonicas.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.660
And the different registers
here just have different sounds.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.990
So if I just go to a straight
accordion here, and just

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.845
play a note.

00:10:56.845 --> 00:10:58.270
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:03.000
It's different reed
blocks that would

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.874
be being used to make
different sounds,

00:11:04.874 --> 00:11:06.790
because if you have four
different reed blocks

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.490
you can make a bunch of
combinations with those reeds.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.940
And it's the same on the
left hand with these.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.840
This being electric,
there are no reeds.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.967
It's all computer chips.

00:11:14.967 --> 00:11:17.050
You guys being engineers
would know more about how

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.440
this works probably than I do.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.950
It's just a lot
of computer chips.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.854
But it's the same basic idea
except here instead of me just

00:11:23.854 --> 00:11:26.020
playing my accordion note
when I go to these sounds,

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.310
[PIANO NOTES] and I have
a piano, or an organ,

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.820
[ORGAN NOTES] or a violin,
[VIOLIN NOTES] and different

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.720
things like this.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.210
So the left hand, though.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.190
Let me draw out the
left hand because it's

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.130
a bunch of buttons.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.160
This one says, as you saw,
CPes, because Cory Pesaturo,

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.180
it's kind of a
shortened name, I guess.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.550
My hip hop name, I don't know--

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.940
CPes.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.530
So how do the buttons work?

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:51.910
All right, where are
the markers over here?

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.410
Since we have some
accordion players

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.622
how many people have somewhat
of a grasp of music theory?

00:11:57.622 --> 00:11:58.800
That's a fair amount.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.045
Yikes, all right.

00:12:00.045 --> 00:12:01.780
Fair amount, this is good.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.910
I hate explaining the left
hand of the accordion,

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.430
because then people go, oh,
that's not that complicated.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.680
I like everyone to look at
it and go, how in the world

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.388
do you play that?

00:12:09.388 --> 00:12:10.630
Well, it's not too bad.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.050
So if I just draw a cross
section of one line this way

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.190
and one line this
way, then you can see.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:19.930
We'll just do C.
Everybody likes C.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.470
If I go this way, up and
down, what is happening

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:28.750
is over here you would have
G, over here you'd have D,

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.810
and this way you'd have F,
this way you'd have B flat,

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.550
and it just keeps
going on and on and on.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.820
So this is the--

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:37.702
anybody?

00:12:37.702 --> 00:12:38.410
AUDIENCE: Circle.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:38.740
CORY PESATURO: Circle.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.721
Circle of fifths,
circle of fourths.

00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:42.970
I always have called it the
line of fourths and fifths

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.460
because it's in a line,
but also musically it

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.580
does go on forever.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.380
And you can get to
D quadruple sharp

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.540
and you know, E quadruple
flat if you just keep going.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.670
And the thing is,
yes, they do repeat.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.625
So if I go down--

00:12:56.625 --> 00:12:57.650
I'll put this in there.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:03.340
If I go down to D flat here,
I do have F sharp up here.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.380
I mean, what did I say?

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.087
D-flat down here,
C-sharp over here.

00:13:06.087 --> 00:13:07.420
So there is going to be repeats.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.110
The top row is simply--

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.140
I should do this--

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.130
is just the third.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.630
So it just gives
you another option.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.475
So C is--

00:13:14.475 --> 00:13:18.779
C, E is here, and E of
course is over here as well.

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:19.570
It's the same ones.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:20.680
So they do repeat.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.320
Now, this would be B.
This would be F sharp.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.300
This would be A.
And this would be D.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.610
So it's just kind of shifted.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:33.390
Now the top two rows
are single notes.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.050
So a major scale, but you
only have the top [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.682
[SCALING NOTES]

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.320
So you just have
these to play scales.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.590
All below this
continuing in the line,

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:53.010
you have C major, C minor,
C seven, And C diminished.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:57.050
So you guys will see
if I can do this.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.785
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:57.785 --> 00:13:59.510
[NOTES]

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:05.400
So C in C major, C in C minor,
C in C seven, C in C diminished.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.600
So it's all in this line.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.730
And then if I go to G,
it's the same thing here.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:14.150
[NOTES] And if you keep
going to D, [NOTES]..

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.190
So it's pretty much,
you're just-- you're always

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.450
thinking in this line.

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.820
where am I on the
left hand of the mix?

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.960
And then you can mix and match.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.950
So if you play C major
and G major together,

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.382
[NOTES] you get a--

00:14:28.382 --> 00:14:29.840
I don't know, for
the theory people

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.794
in here-- a C major nine chord.

00:14:31.794 --> 00:14:35.010
[NOTES] So you can
mix and match chords.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.500
But this system
was devised really

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.860
to get rid of stride piano.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.940
If anybody plays stride piano,
it is incredibly difficult

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.160
to go doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, doo.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.090
So instead of doing that, this
is [NOTES] much much, much

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.570
easier is that.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.260
The problem with this is when I
play jazz and play bass lines,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.750
I only can use the top two
rows to play bass lines.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.600
So that gets a little
difficult. And this

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.280
is all within one octave.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.290
So this is why if I keep
going up the scale--

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.210
[SCALING NOTES]

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.137
--I'll just keep
circling and circling.

00:15:06.137 --> 00:15:07.720
And it's the same
with all the chords.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.712
All the chords are
within one octave.

00:15:09.712 --> 00:15:11.170
But this gives you
at least an idea

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.480
of what is going on
on the left hand.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.780
Not that complicated, right?

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.710
You know, you have
some theories.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:16.635
It's not that bad.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.560
Now this is the only problem.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.500
What I just showed you is
called the stradella system

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.590
on the left hand, which
is one of many systems

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.945
that are used in
the accordion world.

00:15:31.945 --> 00:15:33.820
There are many different
kinds of accordions.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.350
So if you have--

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.916
let me just, bellows,
OK, whatever.

00:15:39.916 --> 00:15:41.200
I'm definitely not an artist.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:49.000
If you have a keyboard and
a stradella based system

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.360
like this one, this is
played in the United States,

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:57.422
in Italy, in Brazil, in
Scotland, half of Russia,

00:15:57.422 --> 00:15:58.130
things like that.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.250
Now if you get rid
of this and you

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.710
put buttons, which is
what Ljubinka plays,

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.290
which we'll get to
her in a minute.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.460
You have buttons here.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:11.260
This is played in the other half
of Russia, is played in France,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:16.350
is played in Finland and
Sweden and these places.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:20.150
But there's many different
systems that this is.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.900
In Finland, actually,
speaking of Finland,

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.230
they have their
own button system.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.896
So they can't really-- they have
to travel with their accordion.

00:16:25.896 --> 00:16:27.684
They can't just go to
Austria and go play

00:16:27.684 --> 00:16:29.350
because it's a totally
different system.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.780
There's a B system, a C
system, different systems.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.420
On the left hand,
there is also free base

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.420
where, remember how I said the
top two rows were single notes?

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.510
Well, on a free base, all of
the buttons are single notes.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.160
There are no chords.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.400
That is played pretty
much all of Russia,

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.710
it always plays this, the
Eastern European countries

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:48.910
play a lot of this.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.410
All for classical
music, especially,

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:52.390
because you can read
piano music directly

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.490
onto the accordion with
a free bass system.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:59.410
But then the other thing is,
what if we change the bellows?

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.180
On my instrument when
I play C this way--

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.430
let me get rid of the violin--

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.540
and I come in, it's
still C, right?

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.329
C, C, it doesn't matter.

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:10.480
On a diatonic accordion,
there's buttons here.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.290
And when I play this button
out, when I come in it's

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.119
a different note.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.920
That's a diatonic accordion.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.619
That is what you will see
Mexicans play, or Irish play.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:24.490
It's funny, Scotland
plays piano accordion.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.322
Irish mostly plays
diatonic accordion.

00:17:26.322 --> 00:17:27.280
Amazing how that works.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.540
Brazil plays this accordion.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.400
Argentina plays the
bandoneon, which is

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.080
more like this with the bellow.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.020
So every country is completely
different on which accordion

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.670
they play, unlike piano.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.760
You play piano in Alaska
or you play in Antarctica,

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.130
it's a piano is a
piano, or a trumpet.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.790
This is totally different.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.060
So there's so many different
kinds of accordions.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.240
And all of us pretty
much can play one or two.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.560
I can't play "Mary Had a Little
Lamb" on Ljubinka's right side

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.439
or left side.

00:17:55.439 --> 00:17:56.980
I can't play "Mary
Had a Little Lamb"

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.104
on the diatonic instrument.

00:17:58.104 --> 00:18:00.034
They're all
completely different.

00:18:00.034 --> 00:18:01.450
But everyone thinks
oh, accordion!

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.620
You know-- not quite.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.760
So a little lesson in accordion.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.940
So now, to show a
different accordion,

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.440
let's bring Ljubinka up.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.062
All the way from Serbia,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:18:14.062 --> 00:18:18.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:23.030
She is in town because there is
actually the funnest, biggest,

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.210
and best accordion
festival that happens

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.075
in the United States
is only about an hour

00:18:28.075 --> 00:18:28.950
and a half from here.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.800
So it's in Cotati.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.022
And they have a
whole folk festival

00:18:33.022 --> 00:18:35.480
of accordions, different bands
with accordions or different

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.220
accordion players.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.440
And I've been bringing
all these friends

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.030
I know from Europe that, they
haven't been to the United

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.140
States before, that want to
come play the United States

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.526
and show different accordions
and different styles

00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:48.150
and everything.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.570
So Ljubinka's coming
in to play at Cotati.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:53.570
And also this other
girl, Tia, from Finland

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.330
is coming in to SFO today.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.290
We're going to grab
her and go to Cotati.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.482
So it's kind of a world
meet a different accordion

00:19:00.482 --> 00:19:02.690
players playing different
styles and different things

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.950
on different accordions.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.460
Actually, her accordion will
be different from yours,

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.293
different from mine.

00:19:06.293 --> 00:19:07.400
So there you go.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.570
But they all have bellows.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.720
That's all that matters.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.190
So Ljubinka, what are
you going to play?

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.190
LJUBINKA KULISIC: I'm
playing a second movement

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.810
of the Bulgarian Suite
from Vyacheslav Semoyonov,

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.690
Russian composer.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:21.640
And it's free base.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:26.174
So you can hear free base.

00:19:26.174 --> 00:19:28.664
[MUSIC - BULGARIAN SUITE, SECOND

00:19:28.664 --> 00:21:53.582

00:21:53.582 --> 00:21:55.076
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:01.052 --> 00:22:03.826
Oh, OK, I can play one more.

00:22:03.826 --> 00:22:09.580
This comes after,
third movement.

00:24:42.891 --> 00:24:44.224
CORY PESATURO: Ljubinka Kulisic!

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.185
Anybody know what
rhythm that was in?

00:24:49.185 --> 00:24:50.550
AUDIENCE: Eleven.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:51.425
CORY PESATURO: Ah-ha!

00:24:51.425 --> 00:24:51.960
All right.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.150
You've really brought some
musicians in the house.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.520
Eleven, yes!

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.466
All right.

00:24:56.466 --> 00:24:57.924
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:57.924 --> 00:24:59.580
CORY PESATURO: Oh, really?

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:03.090
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:04.620
All right, eleven, look at that.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.330
We're getting three
accordionists in here

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:06.930
and people [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.190
This is an awesome audience.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:09.660
Need to come here more often.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:12.450
So all right, now the
question, why do I

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:16.579
have a flame crazy accordion
that also has lights,

00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:17.870
which we'll get to in a second?

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.350
So my goal really
from, I don't know,

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.560
really from when
I started playing,

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.150
was that I wanted to make
the accordion cool again

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:34.680
because since 1962 or so really,
it just hasn't-- it's been

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.560
laughed and made fun
of, blah, blah, blah.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.059
And it's such an
amazing instrument.

00:25:38.059 --> 00:25:40.830
It's the only instrument you
can play as many-- really more

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.440
notes-- as a guitar or piano.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.659
But also we can
play with the sound.

00:25:46.659 --> 00:25:48.450
Once you hit a note on
the guitar or piano,

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:49.940
you're kind of
done on the volume.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.690
But on accordion, [NOTES]
you can manipulate the sound

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:55.680
constantly.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.290
It's also portable,
which is nice.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.667
So you can walk around and
play and do other things.

00:26:00.667 --> 00:26:02.250
Not the funnest to
go on a plane with.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.110
That becomes problems at times.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:04.960
It must go above.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.300
It cannot go below, obviously.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.150
But it's just an
amazing instrument.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.930
It's known around the world to
play so many different genres.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:16.320
I do literally play
techno at college parties.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.180
But then the next day
I'm playing background

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.360
Italian music for a wedding.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.200
So you can do anything with it.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.300
But in trying to make
it cool, my first goal

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.080
was to attain a
world championship

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.730
and try to get some
notoriety for it

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.640
in the United States
press and such.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.010
And every time I come
back for a championship,

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.904
I might get an article in Rhode
Island paper or something.

00:26:37.904 --> 00:26:38.820
Nothing would happens.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.410
I'd say, OK, well, you've
got to do more than this.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.080
So then I said-- and of course,
I'm playing electric accordion.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.670
I tried to do
America's Got Talent.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:45.690
They made fun of it.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.610
No, didn't work,
because it's still

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.360
cool to hate the
accordion somehow.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.327
But all right, so
how about I skin it

00:26:52.327 --> 00:26:54.660
and have the first ever skinned
accordion with some kind

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.100
of a flame thing on it.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:56.880
So I did that.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.560
As you can tell, I
play it around here

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.018
apparently more
than anywhere else,

00:27:00.018 --> 00:27:02.580
because I need to
replace some of these.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:07.080
So then I said, OK, well,
I had a crazy engineer--

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.410
as he calls himself, a
freelance mad scientist--

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.930
do some lighting
stuff, as you can see.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.890
So it's all symmetrical
lighting system

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.842
that goes with everything here.

00:27:19.842 --> 00:27:22.425
Depends on the octave where the
lights are, but no matter what

00:27:22.425 --> 00:27:24.702
I play it's always symmetrical.

00:27:24.702 --> 00:27:26.910
I should actually practice
like what things spell out

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:27.810
a word or something.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:31.740
But I don't know,
never done that.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.180
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.100
So don't just constantly
trying to do things.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.820
Then the Guinness World
record idea came up.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.040
And I do stuff with--

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.160
because I'm a huge
motorsports person.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.200
That's it's almost like, that's
not my hobby, that's my life

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.687
and this is just my hobby.

00:27:47.687 --> 00:27:49.270
And I'm from Boston,
so of course, you

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.030
know, big sports
person in general.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.991
But I said, well, why not try to
break a Guinness World record?

00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:57.240
So they set up a whole thing
and I'm playing a concert

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.012
in Austria next week that's
associated with Red Bull.

00:28:00.012 --> 00:28:01.470
So they said well,
we'll justify it

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.080
and you know market
the festival and I

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.120
went and did 32
hours and 14 minutes

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.420
and I thought my hand was going
to fall off and strangle me.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.030
It seems to be OK for now.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.590
But now I've come back, trying
to push it in the press,

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:15.321
say, yes!

00:28:15.321 --> 00:28:17.070
I have a world
championship, world record.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:20.160
Just trying to always get
notoriety on the accordion

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.290
and make this something
that kids might want

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:24.840
to be interested in to learn
how to play, instead of mommy,

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.580
I want to play guitar,
I want to play drums,

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.455
I want to play piano.

00:28:27.455 --> 00:28:28.682
I want to play accordion!

00:28:28.682 --> 00:28:30.140
Which we have some
in here, so yes,

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.910
there is some accordion love.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:35.640
But now Ljubinka playing
acoustic accordion,

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.000
those are all real
reeds you were hearing,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.980
where this is all
computerated sound.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.050
The fun part about
this, musically,

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:46.110
is that not only do I have the
pull sensitivity, of course,

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:49.800
of the bellows, but I also
have the touch sensitivity.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.290
And the best patch on here
to show the touch sensitivity

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:56.424
is the doo-wop patch, which
is my favorite I must say.

00:28:56.424 --> 00:28:58.770
[NOTES] Things like this.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.250
So yeah, there's little
people inside my accordion

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:02.110
there, thanks.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:06.151
So if I just touch it
lightly I can manipulate it

00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:06.900
like an accordion.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.441
But if I hit it harder, [NOTES],,
or if I hit it really hard,

00:29:09.441 --> 00:29:10.110
[NOTES].

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.820
So it depends on the touch.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.080
So I usually try to do a
different tune every time

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.370
I do something on this.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.694
One I've never done,
so this should be fun,

00:29:20.694 --> 00:29:22.860
but everybody loves this
tune, the Super Mario Bros.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.070
Theme.

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.890
So we can do that
on doo wop sounds.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:26.650
Why not?

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:27.547
Let's see.

00:29:27.547 --> 00:29:28.380
Never done this one.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.780
This will be interesting.

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.239
I'll play around with it though
and improvise some of it.

00:29:33.239 --> 00:29:35.235
[MUSIC - SUPER MARIO BROS THEME]

up today thought,

I'm going to hear Mario
Brothers theme doo-wops

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.647
on an electric accordion?

00:31:10.647 --> 00:31:11.230
Even I didn't.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.190
I don't know.

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.662
Never did that.

here just to go over

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.830
before we get to
different questions,

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.720
because I know
you guys are going

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.303
to have all random questions on
accordion and everything else.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:27.880
But let me do one more
different tune here--

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.540
capabilities of this.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.930
On the percussion sounds on
this particular instrument,

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.721
they are-- a lot of
people think I'm always

00:31:33.721 --> 00:31:35.770
playing with drum
tracks and things

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:37.900
like this from a computer,
which you actually can.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:43.330
I have a USB inside and I can
actually just kind of play

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.250
tunes, anything that I want.

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:48.070
It's like, I've used this
at a party for a boom box.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:51.100
My own instrument, which
is kind of interesting.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.528
You know, you do
something like this.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.620
Something I recorded before.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.840
So it's nice because
when I'm traveling

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:06.860
if the TV needs like a
bump out for something,

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.740
can you just make up some
French thing, or Italian thing,

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.034
or whatever, tango thing,
for no copyrights, you know.

00:32:12.034 --> 00:32:14.450
I can be in my hotel room and
someone can be talking to me

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:17.400
and I can still be recording and
get the USB out and send it off

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.490
and we're good to
go, which is really

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:20.660
cool to have that on board.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.630
But the drum sounds,
though, they are all

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.062
real of what's going
on over here, even when

00:32:26.062 --> 00:32:27.020
I did the techno thing.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.610
[DRUM BEATS] So it's
touch sensitive again.

If I got rid of everything,
[NOTES] just be an accordion.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:37.570
And then the wind, yeah.

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.742
[WIND BLOWING] That
depends if I hold it.

00:32:40.742 --> 00:32:41.700
It has a wind on there.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.160
There's also thunderstorms,
and you know.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.577
At sound checks, I love
doing the thunderstorm sound

00:32:46.577 --> 00:32:48.660
in a sound check because
then the people freak out

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.870
like what's going on?

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:54.030
So let's do something
from not too

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:55.710
long ago that I think
everybody knows.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:58.427
This'll be kind of fun
with the drum sounds.

00:32:58.427 --> 00:33:00.415
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:27.250
All right, so we can open up
the floor here to questions.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:30.760
We want to hand out
the other mic, I think?

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.760
DIVYA PILLAI: Just to get
started, there's one--

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.060
CORY PESATURO: Oh,
question over here!

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.726
DIVYA PILLAI: There
is one question on--

00:34:35.726 --> 00:34:37.360
so we have a dory.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.780
If you haven't seen it
yet, the GoLink for that is

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:44.139
go/accordion-dory.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:47.620
So we have one question
from that, from Denise.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.840
Congrats on breaking the
Guinness World record

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.730
in marathon accordion playing.

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:55.090
How did you train for it?

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:56.129
CORY PESATURO: Oh boy.

00:34:56.129 --> 00:34:57.670
The answer is, I
didn't train for it.

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:02.380
I just-- I have a
knack for just kind

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.605
of winging a lot of things.

00:35:04.605 --> 00:35:06.130
My most known
world championship,

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:09.910
which is an acoustic accordion,
I couldn't bring my accordion

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:10.510
on the plane.

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:12.218
Like I was saying,
it's always a problem.

00:35:12.218 --> 00:35:14.470
So I just grabbed one there
and they were like, here,

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:15.340
you just choose accordions.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.600
I was going to wear
an all white outfit

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.766
and I saw a white accordion.

00:35:17.766 --> 00:35:19.401
I was like, ah, I
got it, that one.

00:35:19.401 --> 00:35:19.900
It matches.

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.775
It has-- they went,
don't you want to try it?

00:35:21.775 --> 00:35:23.220
Yeah, no, I got to use that one.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.540
You know, and I had fun do that.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.160
But won that.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.710
The Guinness record
I said, eh, if I--

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.950
I was going to do a
17 hour practice run

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:35.482
and see how I felt
after 17 hours,

00:35:35.482 --> 00:35:37.690
write down notes and say,
OK, maybe I should do this.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:40.100
I should have my arm here,
maybe blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.560
And I said why even
use the energy?

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.380
I'm just going to use all
the energy at the event.

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:47.060
Just go there and go for it.

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.530
And that's kind of what I
did because it's all mental.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.750
Your body stops at
hour 10 or 12 and says

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.130
I can't do this anymore.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:57.340
My arm was sending all these
awful feelings and signals

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.270
to my hands to stop.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:59.609
But my mind was like, nope!

00:35:59.609 --> 00:36:00.400
Have to keep going.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.300
Must keep going.

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:01.990
It's all mental.

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:04.160
You've just got to
push through it.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.870
So, yeah, really the
answer is actually nothing.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:09.690
DIVYA PILLAI: Good answer.

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:12.130
Any questions from the audience?

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:13.090
All right.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:16.262
CORY PESATURO: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:16.262 --> 00:36:19.090
Like the end of the race, I
have the official questions.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.940
AUDIENCE: So what does an
accordion world championship

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:22.740
consist of?

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.190
Like what does that mean?

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:25.240
How do you win one?

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.089
CORY PESATURO: So they're just
like piano or cello or violin

00:36:28.089 --> 00:36:28.630
competitions.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:31.910
There's usually a panel
of about eight judges.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:33.880
Some of them have rounds.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.370
Like the one I was just saying
with the white accordion,

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:37.900
they had three different rounds.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.277
And they usually have
national champions

00:36:40.277 --> 00:36:41.860
from different parts
of the world that

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:45.550
go to one of two main
competitions that

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.530
happen every year.

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:50.650
And actually I'm trying to
get the world championships

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:54.252
to happen in the United States,
either LA or Boston, in 2020.

00:36:54.252 --> 00:36:55.960
Trying to bring that
here because it goes

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.752
to different places every year.

00:36:57.752 --> 00:36:59.460
But it's just like
any other competition.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:02.380
They have a big panel of
judges that look very serious

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.090
and you're nervous.

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:05.560
And there's
different categories.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.930
There's classical
category and then

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.900
there's more of a overall
variety kind of category.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.022
So just kind of like
any other instrument.

00:37:16.405 --> 00:37:17.780
DIVYA PILLAI: Any
more questions?

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:18.240
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:18.990
CORY PESATURO: Hi!

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.830
AUDIENCE: Amazing
playing, first of all.

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:21.210
CORY PESATURO: Thank you.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.835
AUDIENCE: I am really
impressed by what

00:37:22.835 --> 00:37:26.170
you've been doing and described
and demonstrated today.

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:28.810
You are pushing the accordion
as a solo instrument.

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:31.771
Do you also play in
ensembles and if so what

00:37:31.771 --> 00:37:34.270
do you envision as sort of the
future direction of accordion

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:36.850
as an ensemble instrument
and interactions

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:38.710
with other accordions
or other instruments?

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:41.409
CORY PESATURO: Well I mean,
I'm more known as a jazz guy

00:37:41.409 --> 00:37:42.200
than anything else.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.917
So I, of course, prefer
to play with people.

00:37:45.917 --> 00:37:47.500
And there's always
a kind of a problem

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.420
amongst accordion
players that, because we

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:54.642
can do so much on our own,
we play alone gigs of lot

00:37:54.642 --> 00:37:56.350
because people can
hire us as like almost

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:58.030
a trio with the left hand and
everything else, especially

00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.960
with this.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.500
And it becomes a problem
because you know,

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.650
obviously you're a musician,
you don't get good time

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.300
when you play alone a lot.

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.970
You need to play with other
people to have a nice set time.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:13.960
The other thing is just
musical ideas and collaborating

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:14.919
with different people--

00:38:14.919 --> 00:38:16.335
you know, the
musical interaction,

00:38:16.335 --> 00:38:18.360
especially in jazz or
Eastern European music.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.490
You want to be with people.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.970
So I love playing
with musicians.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:25.995
The problem is I get hired
so much as a soloist.

00:38:25.995 --> 00:38:26.620
But it depends.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:29.050
What I go to Austria,
that will be a trio.

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:32.710
At Cotati there'll be a mix
of things, drummer and such

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:33.320
like that.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.220
But I mean, the accordion
is currently used,

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.834
certainly all over the world,
in many different ensembles,

00:38:39.834 --> 00:38:42.250
especially in places where
it's still popular like France,

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.474
Argentina, and such.

00:38:44.474 --> 00:38:46.390
But I don't know what
the percentage would be,

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:51.030
though, of the accordions
used solo or ensemble wise

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.570
currently.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.030
It's kind of interesting.

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:54.670
I don't really know.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:58.052
But any other questions on that?

00:38:58.052 --> 00:39:00.218
AUDIENCE: I can do a follow-up
unless anybody else--

00:39:00.218 --> 00:39:02.552
CORY PESATURO: Yeah, I mean,
you could follow-up, whatever.

00:39:02.552 --> 00:39:03.030
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.155
A follow-up only in the
sense of a second question,

00:39:05.155 --> 00:39:07.630
not actually
related to that one.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.190
I'm a violinist, by the way.

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:10.870
I play a lot of
klezmer in Romanian--

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:11.828
CORY PESATURO: Klezmer!

00:39:11.828 --> 00:39:14.260
Oh, I play more klezmer
gigs than anything,

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.790
actually, because there's
another genre of music where

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:20.310
the accordion is needed,
as well as violin.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:23.550
AUDIENCE: And as a
violinist, certainly,

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:27.100
many much of the incredibly
virtuosic Romanian music

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.670
has [INAUDIBLE] over into
the classical violin as well.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.380
Has that been the
case for accordion?

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:37.840
Or how has the virtuosity
of those styles of music

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.575
influenced other areas
of accordion music?

00:39:42.575 --> 00:39:44.200
CORY PESATURO: The
accordion is kind of

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:50.100
similar to the violin in the
fact that, I think a lot of--

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.760
speaking of Romanian,
in the Balkans

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.760
it's like all the best
musicians I've ever heard

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.150
seem to be from the Balkans.

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:56.680
Like you know,
whether it's violin,

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.120
all my favorite
accordion players

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:02.150
are from, whether it is Serbia,
or Macedonia, or Romania,

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:04.570
Bulgaria especially.

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:07.360
So it's like the folk
root to the classical root

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.060
kind of thing, in how they mix.

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.140
Usually in the
accordion world it's

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.822
pretty separated, like it is
I think in the violin world.

00:40:14.822 --> 00:40:16.780
Although some people,
they train as a classical

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.905
until they're 18 or something
and then they kind of

00:40:18.905 --> 00:40:20.200
branch off into something else.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.410
A lot of violinists I play
with went through that.

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:24.987
I studied a lot
of classical stuff

00:40:24.987 --> 00:40:27.070
because as accordion
players, we don't necessarily

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:29.350
have much classical
accordion music.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:32.140
But we do a lot of transcribing.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.110
I played a lot of Tchaikovsky
and things like this

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:38.950
because it kind of fits
well just on the accordion.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:41.075
But usually it is, like
with these competitions,

00:40:41.075 --> 00:40:42.450
the people that
do the classical,

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:46.040
you don't really see them
doing folk gigs or vice versa.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.070
They're kind of in
separate worlds.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.410
But technique
wise, I don't know.

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:52.990
There is a standard, I'd
say, technique for accordion.

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:55.690
And actually, speaking of
technique, the right hand

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.630
piano, and the end button
as well, on accordion

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:01.360
is exactly the same as piano,
the claw kind of thing.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.490
It's really exactly the same.

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:08.564
It's just, it moves, so you
have to kind of move with it.

00:41:08.564 --> 00:41:11.230
So I haven't done any show where
I've had to dance or something.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:13.510
That would be-- but
you see violinists.

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.400
I mean, they make you guys do
twirls upside down and things.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.310
So it's not that bad.

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:20.810
And this side is attached.

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:22.210
We have a bass strap here.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:23.820
So this doesn't really move.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.520
But this is kind of a--
this can be a problem.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.440
And it's 25 pounds,
so not the funnest.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:28.940
But it's OK.

00:41:34.511 --> 00:41:35.636
DIVYA PILLAI: Anymore-- OK.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.640
AUDIENCE: So you said there
all these types of accordions.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.440
How did you end
up with this one?

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.794
Are there any other
types you can play?

00:41:45.794 --> 00:41:46.710
CORY PESATURO: No, no.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.209
Like I was saying,
the United States

00:41:48.209 --> 00:41:51.470
is like 99% piano accordion.

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:55.560
And in fact, if I think quickly
of the two accordionists

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.630
I know in the US that
play professionally

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:00.480
that play button accordion,
they came from other countries

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.310
to the United States.

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:04.970
It's just, it's a very
border to border situation.

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:11.810
Canada, as well, is pretty much
all piano, when I just learned.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.520
But as soon as you go to Mexico,
it's all diatonic button--

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.270
totally different.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:18.390
Portugal, as well,
is kind of the same.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:19.620
Ireland the same, like that.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.690
But it's just, yeah,
in the United States

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:24.060
it's always, always
been piano accordion.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:26.760
And no, I can't
really play anything

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.640
on any of the other accordions.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.870
It's totally, totally
a different system.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:31.770
[DRUM BEAT]

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:34.357
Whoops, sorry.

00:42:34.357 --> 00:42:35.190
Let's turn that off.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:39.720
[NOTES] OK, we're back to
accordion, real accordion.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.870
So no, no, I can't.

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:43.530
As I said before, I can't even
play "Mary Had a Little Lamb"

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:45.480
on any of the other accordions.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.814
I could kind of learn it, but
the speed I would learn it

00:42:47.814 --> 00:42:49.813
would be the same speed
like you would learn it.

00:42:49.813 --> 00:42:50.610
You know music.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:52.276
You could kind of
figure out the system.

00:42:52.276 --> 00:42:54.270
But everything else
is totally different.

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:57.850
The layout of the left
hand, completely different.

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:00.390
It's not the circle of fifths
and fourths that I showed.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:02.310
So they're all very different.

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:08.922
DIVYA PILLAI: Questions?

00:43:08.922 --> 00:43:10.380
CORY PESATURO: Any
other questions?

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:11.470
DIVYA PILLAI: I have
a question for you.

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:12.410
CORY PESATURO: Oh,
you have a question!

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:13.880
DIVYA PILLAI: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.830
Because you perform in
so many different styles,

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:19.250
I think you were
trained in, I'm assuming

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:21.724
New England Conservatory
was more classical?

00:43:21.724 --> 00:43:22.890
CORY PESATURO: No, actually.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:23.640
DIVYA PILLAI: No?

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.556
CORY PESATURO: New England
Conservatory really

00:43:25.556 --> 00:43:28.250
opened my ears up
more to more genres

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:31.332
because I played a
fair amount of French.

00:43:31.332 --> 00:43:33.040
Of course I grew up
playing Italian music

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.580
and classical music
for competitions.

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.220
That was mainly a kind of
mix of classical and Italian

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.040
and some older pop
kind of things.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:47.020
But NEC opened me up to Eastern
European music, odd meters,

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.790
also you know, Brazilian music.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:51.090
And I spent a lot of
time learning jazz.

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:52.962
It takes so long to do that.

00:43:52.962 --> 00:43:54.670
And then all these
other different genres

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:55.490
around the world.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:58.267
So no, because NEC has--

00:43:58.267 --> 00:44:00.100
what's great about New
England Conservatory,

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.830
they have classical,
jazz, like a lot

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:03.580
of different conservatories,
but they also

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.500
have contemporary improv.

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.720
And the real definition
of contemporary improv

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:12.550
is, anything that's not
classical and jazz, but also

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:14.770
classical and jazz
kind of messed with.

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:17.207
So when I went over there,
they were like well,

00:44:17.207 --> 00:44:18.790
we can't put you in
classical or jazz.

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:21.010
But we can put you
in contemporary,

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.014
which means I could play
classical music-- we

00:44:23.014 --> 00:44:25.430
did a lot of classical music--
and Eastern European music.

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:29.160
But then, you know, it's a lot
of contemporary stuff like,

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.000
[MUSIC].

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.330
Kind of this modern kind
of things and some of that.

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:37.100
Tapping on the accordion,
different things like this.

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.280
And also mixed classical
and jazz, so it was,

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:44.001
I didn't really do much with
the classical department there.

00:44:44.001 --> 00:44:45.500
So no, that was
really kind of where

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:50.270
I expanded the genres of what
I could kind of hear and play.

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:52.250
DIVYA PILLAI: I was
going to ask about,

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:54.830
I guess some how
you learned improv

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:57.617
and whether that's
normal, I guess, among--

00:44:57.617 --> 00:44:59.200
CORY PESATURO: How
did I learn improv?

00:44:59.200 --> 00:44:59.991
DIVYA PILLAI: Yeah.

00:44:59.991 --> 00:45:02.950
CORY PESATURO: I've always,
always been an improviser.

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.930
Really, I remember a
lesson probably six months

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:09.597
in where my dad had a record
of Charlie Magnante who

00:45:09.597 --> 00:45:11.830
is one of the other extremely
important accordionists

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:13.250
in American history.

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:16.226
And there was just this tune I
liked and I would listen to it.

00:45:16.226 --> 00:45:17.600
I was learning it
by ear and then

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:18.980
I went in and played
it for my teacher.

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.480
And like, what are you
doing learning music

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.500
without the sheet music?

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.480
You know, I was very
much in trouble.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.760
It really wasn't until
I found jazz I was like,

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.340
oh, you're supposed
to improvise!

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.420
I like this.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:32.630
But I've always been
a huge improviser

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:36.680
because it makes the
ability to kind of--

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.740
I mean, like what we might
do in a couple of minutes.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:42.729
I haven't played that song in I
don't know, probably who knows?

00:45:42.729 --> 00:45:44.270
Trying to remember
the chord changes.

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:46.604
But it's just an ear thing.

00:45:46.604 --> 00:45:48.020
Obviously like
with your question,

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.060
there's kind of the
different realms

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:55.160
of teaching where, when you
study for years, especially

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.110
the Russians and
Eastern Europeans,

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:59.630
that win most of the world
classical championships

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:01.880
for the past 30 years.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.770
They're practicing six
hours a day or more,

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:05.390
studying heavy duty
classical music

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:07.610
but they can't
improvise anything.

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:09.980
And then there's kind of
the other school of thought.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.532
So it's really, I mean, I see it
the exact same in violin world.

00:46:13.532 --> 00:46:14.990
It's the exact same
in piano world.

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:16.670
It's kind of the same idea.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:19.930
But I think improvisation
is so important.

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:23.060
And just, if I hear
something on the radio,

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:24.420
I'm already kind of learning it.

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:27.860
And then I can maybe go
play it at next set gig,

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.880
things like this, if I can
decode it quick enough.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:36.610
Any other questions?

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:40.350
Or it's La Danza time.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:40.950
All right.

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:43.010
Let me get that one ready.

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:46.500
AUDIENCE: So with the
different types of accordions--

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.870
this is sort of two parts--

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:52.460
how closely do different
layouts of the accordions

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:55.250
align to the underlying
theory or structures

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:57.890
of the music in the
different countries?

00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:00.130
CORY PESATURO: That
definitely does.

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:05.270
AUDIENCE: Like is it easier
to play Finnish music

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:06.875
on an accordion that--

00:47:06.875 --> 00:47:09.710
CORY PESATURO: Yeah, there
is definitely a bit of that.

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:13.340
Even like the best
example I can think of,

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:17.010
actually, is, this
is close to home.

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:20.400
If you listen to like
certain kind of Tejano music

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.990
and different genres
of Mexican music,

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:24.720
where the accordion is
very important in the band,

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.700
there's always an
accordion player,

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.760
and they play diatonic
which is the one where

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:33.480
you hit one note this
way, it's one sound,

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:36.570
and it's a different
one when you come in.

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:39.630
So it's like when they play,
if they're in the key of G

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.210
and they're playing G, you
know, they're playing this.

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:44.130
And then when they play D they
have to go out the whole time.

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:45.390
They have to keep
going out or they

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:46.514
can't play in the key of D.

00:47:46.514 --> 00:47:50.040
So there's not many keys you
can play in on a diatonic.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.350
When you listen to that
music, usually there's

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:54.080
not too many ways
and chord changes.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:55.552
They kind of stay around home.

00:47:55.552 --> 00:47:56.760
And you can do that on there.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:00.150
But there's these licks that
they play, these [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:03.660
kind of things, that no matter
how good technique I have,

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:05.964
I can't do it as clean
and nice as they do it

00:48:05.964 --> 00:48:08.130
because on the diatonic
there's a way they can do it

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:09.463
with that particular instrument.

00:48:09.463 --> 00:48:10.920
And the same thing
in Irish music.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.470
They have these
things to replicate

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:16.290
what you can do on a violin
with double stops and such.

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:19.164
And you can do that
easier on a diatonic.

00:48:19.164 --> 00:48:20.330
I can't really do that here.

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:23.700
It would never sound as clean
or as nice as a diatonic.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.980
So there is definitely
that aspect to it.

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.010
And for classical
music, they mostly

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:31.800
play what Ljubinka
plays because here, I

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.150
don't have a big hand either.

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:35.810
I can get like a knife nicely.

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:40.030
This, on a button accordion,
would be two octaves, solidly.

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:43.150
So you can do a lot more
on the button accordion.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:46.020
It took the accordion world
to figure out, the piano!

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.470
That's not a great system.

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:50.130
It's not symmetrical and
it's too-- this sucks.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:53.340
And they made a whole new system
that's much more advanced.

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.880
And it's easier to be able to do
these crazy chord, wide chords

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.730
in certain lines and such.

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:02.104
Also, to change key on a button,
if you're playing a song in C

00:49:02.104 --> 00:49:04.020
and you want to go to
D-flat you just do this.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:07.020
You just shift and
it'd be the same.

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:07.740
So that's better.

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.360
There are other things
that make it much harder

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.110
to play that system,
especially because it

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:13.590
has many more buttons to play
when you're flying around.

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:15.900
But for classical music,
that system is way better.

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:18.750
And if you go to the world
championships for classical,

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:22.445
90% plus play the button
accordion versus this one,

00:49:22.445 --> 00:49:23.820
because it's just
very, very hard

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:26.220
to be able to do these
crazier things on piano.

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:29.580
It's just not built for it,
mainly because of the distance

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:32.730
that I have here,
even though they

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:35.170
are smaller than piano
keys as you can tell.

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:36.520
They're a little bit skinnier.

00:49:39.074 --> 00:49:40.740
AUDIENCE: And then
the sort of continued

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.448
part of that, which
you sort of addressed

00:49:42.448 --> 00:49:46.080
there is, hypothetically if you
could design your own accordion

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:49.620
completely from scratch without
any engineering constraints

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:53.400
or anything, like what
would you change or keep

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.200
from this current accordion?

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.840
And especially with going
to like electric accordion,

00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.670
are there any
parameters or things

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:02.010
you wish you could control
more finely that you

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:03.180
don't have here?

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:05.940
CORY PESATURO: Well, I mean, the
main problem with accordion--

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:09.090
look wise, the thing I'm
always trying to change just

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:10.590
from a marketing
perspective, why

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:12.530
I've designed this
other accordion that I'm

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:16.860
kind of building with a
different MIT engineer,

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.010
is the look of it.

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:21.900
You know, when you play
guitar it just looks cool.

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.765
It's light, you can
fly around with it.

00:50:23.765 --> 00:50:25.320
And this, I can't do much with.

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.990
It's just this big--
someone said it

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.880
looks like an air conditioner.

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:28.500
Yeah, it kind of does.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.700
It's like this big--
this is why I've done

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:30.932
all this crazy stuff to it.

00:50:30.932 --> 00:50:32.640
So there's kind of
that marketing aspect.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.640
I can't be Jimi
Hendrix jumping around

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.267
on stage with this instrument.

00:50:38.267 --> 00:50:40.350
So the weight, yeah, the
weight and the look of it

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:41.500
is one thing.

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:44.610
The other aspect is, technical
wise, playing the bellows,

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:46.470
you know, it's weird
playing technique here

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:48.930
when you're moving around.

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:52.800
So it'd be great if the bellows
were some kind of other system.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.510
Like, if it was,
I thought I needed

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:56.820
to have just two separate
parts and maybe there

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.590
was a D beam in the middle.

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:01.650
And something to do
with the distance

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:03.390
would actually work
as the bellows,

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:04.870
versus kind of you contained.

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:08.490
So I had some different designs
of what an accordion could be.

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:13.530
Almost like two touchpads kind
of thing, something like this.

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:16.230
Obviously yeah, that system
is kind of a better piano.

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:17.070
But it depends.

00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:19.295
I love this particular
system with the left hand,

00:51:19.295 --> 00:51:20.670
the stradella
system, because you

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:22.490
can do so many things with it.

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:24.090
It's good enough
for single notes,

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:26.730
and the chords you can
do a lot with that.

00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:28.900
So I don't know.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.890
There's definitely a fair
amount I would change.

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:34.800
We all look like this
when we're 90%, of course,

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.807
because of the weight.

00:51:36.807 --> 00:51:37.890
We all have back problems.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:39.774
But I don't know.

00:51:39.774 --> 00:51:41.190
And then you throw
it on your back

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:42.810
and you go this way when you're
walking through the airport.

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:45.080
So it kind of, in the
end it evens out I guess.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.980
It's not too bad.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.270
How's that?

microtonal music on--

00:51:52.585 --> 00:51:53.793
are there adapted accordions?

00:51:53.793 --> 00:51:56.590
CORY PESATURO: No, although I
cannot believe I can't answer

00:51:56.590 --> 00:51:57.090
this.

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:59.460
I keep forgetting
to look this up.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.722
I have heard from three
different people in my life.

00:52:01.722 --> 00:52:02.680
But I've never seen it.

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.320
No one's ever been able to
[INAUDIBLE] the picture.

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:06.153
Apparently in Turkey,
where microtonal music

00:52:06.153 --> 00:52:09.870
you see a lot with the
[INAUDIBLE] and such.

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:11.070
What's the scales?

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:16.180
I can't think--
those Turkish scales.

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:16.680

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:20.820
There are accordions they
make with semi-tone notes,

and they're split up.

00:52:21.844 --> 00:52:23.510

from multiple people

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:24.140
that they exist.

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.306
I have yet to see a picture.

00:52:25.306 --> 00:52:27.100
But apparently they
do, because there's

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.670
some pretty reputable sources.

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:32.100
So not on this one, although
I can actually come in here

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:33.849
and tweak the tuning
and things like that.

00:52:33.849 --> 00:52:38.760
But I can't have certain
notes be different things.

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.920
So not this one, no.

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.370

you can somewhere.
