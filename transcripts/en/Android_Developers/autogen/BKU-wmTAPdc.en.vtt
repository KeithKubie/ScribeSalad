00:00:00.604 --> 00:00:03.900
 As software developers we spend most of our time keeping up with our integrated development environment, 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.810
 So we care about our tools. 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.980
 I am Reto Mayer. You are viewing Android Tool Time. 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.540
 This is "Android Studio" version 1.5. 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.030
 "Android Studio" version 1.5 includes other fixes for errors and improvements. 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.770
 Which includes an update to the memory analyzer. 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.930
 This new analytical feature can analyze data to find known problems 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.390
 Such as leaked activities. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.630
 To use this property, open the data window 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.790
 Find the Task Analysis window on the right. 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.764
 You can press the Play button in the Analysis window 

00:00:34.764 --> 00:00:36.180
 For analysis. 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.570
 And then move between the results. 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.670
 The following is an example of a leak activity. 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.510
 There are also many ways to check for new links. 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.009
 Here's one warning 

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.110
 If you try to bypass sources indicated in the statement. 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.730
 The rest of this looks like bug fixes. 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.410
 Hide the module selector only with one module in the Appearance Editor. 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.290
 Correct the address set to create a new module 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.440
 Using the New Module Wizard. 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.470
 Provide documentation and completion of XML attribute values. 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.354
 This can not be true. 

00:01:05.154 --> 00:01:06.284
 Beauty? 

00:01:07.614 --> 00:01:08.766
 Yeah? 

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.890
 Is this true or have I missed something? 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.110
 Looks just a set of stability improvements 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.160
 And some bug fixes. 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.330
 Are generally a set of good fixes for errors. 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.498
 Well, but as you know 

00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:20.120
 This is my first video in What's New in Android Studio series. 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.700
 I was hoping to make a big fuss. 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.830
 I understand this, but these are very important fixes for errors. 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.350
 I think so. 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.295
 What about this fund? 

00:01:33.295 --> 00:01:34.850
 Can I tell them what the fund is? 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.409
 No, we can not talk about the box. 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:37.730
 are you sure? 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.364
 It sounds very exciting. 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.150
 Look, Reto. Inevitably we can not talk about the fund 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.740
 Why is it here originally? 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.900
 We must focus on mistakes inevitably. 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.490
 Okay. 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.750
 Well, the Theme Editor has a preview 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.460
 For the appearance that will be created. 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.010
 There are a number of bug fixes in the editor area 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.670
 We were working hard to refine the code completion 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.770
 For source and statement files. 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.810
 For example, you can now use short names 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.000
 When you use the code completion for custom presentations. 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.150
 We've also noticed that Android Studio has not taken your focus 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.479
 If you switch between virtual desktops during the start and play phase. 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.390
 Download Android Studio 1.5 now for bug fixes 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.110
 Stability improvements and more. 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.930
 This is Android Studio 1.5. 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.400
 This is Android Tool Time. 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.680
 I must completely forget that I mentioned the fund. 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.110
 What I should have really mentioned. 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.220
 Stop talking about the box.
