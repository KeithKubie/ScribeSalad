00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.160
What do we mean by operating system structure? What we mean by this term is

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.870
the way the operating system software is organized

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.190
with respect to the applications that it serves

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.059
and the underlying hardware that it manages. It's

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.160
sort of like the burger between the buns.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.140
There is application at the top and technology

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.730
or hardware at the bottom and system software

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.160
of the operating system is what connects

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.320
the applications to the underlying hardware. Since

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.610
this lesson is all about operating system structure, I would like to get your

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.610
thoughts on why you may think that the structure of an operating system is

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.330
important, and from that point of view I'm going to give you a quiz again.
