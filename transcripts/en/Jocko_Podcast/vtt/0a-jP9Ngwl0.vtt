00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.070
You recently said Hackworth was a rule follower most of his career,

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.030
but in about face the book,

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.990
he always talks about how he went against his command,
his rules,

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.110
how do you play the game,
but also act like Hackworth.
Yeah.

5
00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:19.111
And so this is a classic example of the dichotomy of leadership with regard to

6
00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:22.750
obeying rules and,
and Hackworth.

7
00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:26.080
Absolutely obeyed the rules and he'll beat them to the,
to the extreme.

8
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.760
Sometimes if you remember in the book,
He,
he,

9
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.250
he worked in situations where he,

10
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.120
they were like the strictest in garrison.
So like not in combat,

11
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:42.250
just in garrison,
he would,
everything's perfect uniform.

12
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.500
If you remember when General Mooky Amo was on and we talked to,

13
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.290
we talked to him about meeting hack for the first time and you know,

14
00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:52.120
it's kind of like,
what was he like?
And he was like,
oh,

15
00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:55.690
he was high and tight haircut,
totally squared away.

16
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.410
That's following the rules to win Ti.
Mm.

17
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.580
And the other thing that he played,
he definitely played the,
played the game.
Hmm.

18
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.460
Hackworth played the game.
He developed with,
he developed relationships with,

19
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.420
with people that were senior to him,
people that were influential,

20
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.180
Sla Marshall who you went on tour with,

21
00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:17.980
if you remember through Vietnam and Sla Marshall,

22
00:01:17.981 --> 00:01:19.560
he didn't really even respect but SLA.

23
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.940
Marshall had such big influence that he said,
hey,
you know what,

24
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.770
how can it become Bros with this guy?

25
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.520
He played the game because Marshall had influence and he even took somebody

26
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.100
hits,
you know,
took a little frag for,
for,

27
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.210
for SLA Marshall [inaudible].
But at the same time,

28
00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:42.190
if it's troops weren't getting the right treatment that he needed,

29
00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:43.870
he would do what he needed to do.

30
00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:46.510
He would break rules that take care of them if he had to.

31
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.750
And at the same time he would follow the rules to a t if you remember when he

32
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:53.220
took over the battalion in Vietnam,

33
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.030
the hopeless and wanted to turn him into the hardcore,

34
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.490
he brought all their crap into the middle of the thing and said,

35
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:01.280
we're going to fly out of here.
No more radios,
no more guitars,

36
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.460
none of this other stuff and getting it out.

37
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.260
So that's like following the rules to a t,
but at the same time,

38
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.920
if he needed to like steal food for them or steaks or something to get you,

39
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.630
the key would do that stuff.
So he's constantly balancing that economy.

40
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.520
Another thing he did is he,
he took these administrative jobs that he hated

41
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.180
in order to rise through the ranks in order to become,
to get,

42
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.750
get places to develop relationships.
So we still,
we could have more influence.

43
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.080
He was assigned to the Pentagon.
He,
he,
in the book,

44
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:37.800
he talks about the Pentagon being working in the Pentagon being a claustrophobic

45
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:41.340
hole no more than 20 by 20 feet with 15 other people in it.

46
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.150
And he talks about,
he said,
you did say your paper,

47
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:50.151
your Ian inbox would be filled when you showed up and you immediately,

48
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:53.160
the phone would be ringing.
You'd be talking to people all over the world via,

49
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:56.340
if all the people in Vietnam,
they're calling you at their their time zone.

50
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.860
And so he didn't like this,

51
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.800
but guess what got the highest possible evaluations when he left.
Why?

52
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:07.690
Because he played the game
and he built these relationships with,

53
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.860
with all these kernels and all these generals and all these people that had

54
00:03:10.861 --> 00:03:11.740
influenced his Glover,

55
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:15.310
Johns and Pearson and Co countless others by doing what he needed to do.

56
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.610
And then when he needed to,
he broke,

57
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.810
he broke the rules and sometimes he went a little too far with breaking the

58
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:27.610
rules.
And
when he,

59
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:29.440
when he got out,

60
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.890
when they kind of drove him out after he did the big interview where he said,

61
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:33.880
hey,
we're not gonna win.

62
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.210
They went and drilled down into his camps and looked at the things that he had

63
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:38.290
going on there,
said,
oh,
you're ugly.

64
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:40.000
You're allowing this to happen and you're allowing this to happen.

65
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:45.001
So he left himself a little vulnerable by breaking the rules a little bit too

66
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:45.700
much.

67
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.290
So the a rule to learn from that as I don't do things that people can hold over

68
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:51.124
you.
And for me,

69
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.810
the things that people can hold over for you are things where you can't stand up

70
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.730
and say,
yes,
that's what I did.
Yes,
that's what I did.
Hey,

71
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.320
my guys didn't,
hadn't had a good meal in four weeks.

72
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.380
They've been in the field for three of those weeks.

73
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.610
And when they came out,
guess what?
I,

74
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.870
I figured out a way to get some steak and I took it from the rear and I had it

75
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:21.580
flown up using mill using our helicopters.
And I had,
yep,
that's what I did.

76
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:24.340
And if you want to,
you want to drop the hammer on me for that.
Got It.

77
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.250
Now if you do that,
that's cool.

78
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.370
But there's some things where you break the rules where maybe you wouldn't be

79
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.990
able to stand up tall and proud and say,
this is what I did in his why I did it.

80
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.790
So you want to be careful that you don't do things that will allow people to

81
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:43.660
hold things over your head.
And for me,

82
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:47.290
things that are things like that are things that you can't stand up with your

83
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:49.670
chest out and say,
this is what I did and this is why I do.

84
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.250
I know it wasn't within the regulations.
This is what I did.
This is why I do it.

85
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:58.150
And if I get fired because of that.
Understood.
Check.

86
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.150
Now here's where you get a little,
here's where we can,

87
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.620
we can
question hack for sure.

88
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.840
Let me ask you this.

89
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.830
If hack would have cause.
Okay,
so he didn't play the game at the end.

90
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:20.230
He didn't play the game.
He went on an interview and said,
hey,

91
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:22.090
we're not going to win the war.
Not the way we're fighting.

92
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:25.540
We're not going to win the war.
Within a few weeks,
he was driven out of the army.

93
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.040
He didn't play the game at that moment.
Right.
So let me ask you this.

94
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.580
If he would have played the game just a little bit,
just said,
look,

95
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:38.650
we need to change our strategy if we're,
you know what I mean?

96
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:42.520
If he would've just j and then he would have stayed in and then he would have

97
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.490
perhaps gotten a promotion and got perhaps gotten to a position where he

98
00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:47.920
actually had influence over the way the war was being fought.

99
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.200
If he had done that,

100
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.190
would he have been better off?

101
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.190
Would he have been able to better help the situation?

102
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.290
Because I don't know.
Once they drove him out,
it's not like that interview.
Well,

103
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:05.090
I don't know,
we'd have to check the check,

104
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:08.390
the historical sort of results of that interview.

105
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.450
It certainly started to sway public opinion and maybe that,
you know,

106
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:12.650
maybe in his mind,
hey,

107
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.490
I need to tell everyone what's going on so we can get out of here.
Right.

108
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.290
So maybe,
maybe that was the intention.
Maybe that was the result.

109
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:24.290
Maybe that helped shutdown the war eventually,

110
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.600
but maybe if he would have played,
continue to play the game,

111
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.880
he could have gotten to a position where he had more even more influence and

112
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:37.040
could have changed the way the war is being fought.
I don't know.

113
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.860
I'm sure we could have a long debate about that.

114
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.440
But that's as a leader,

115
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.560
something that you are going to have to weigh out all the time.

116
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.270
And there situations where,
uh,
and actually breaking news today,

117
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.660
General Maddis just put in his resignation for being secretary of defense.

118
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.200
So is that's a,
I'm,

119
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.850
we're going to have to talk about that when I get a little more information on,

120
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.920
is that him saying,
look,
I,

121
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.130
it's going to be better for me to make this statement by leaving or would he

122
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:17.870
have been better off staying there where he can at least still have a massive

123
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:22.250
amount of influence because he's the secretary of defense will have to drill

124
00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:26.090
down on that one.
That's a,
hmm,
that's a good question.

125
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.350
Both those are good questions.

126
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:30.710
And the bottom line is if you haven't read about face,

127
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.030
read it and learn from a guy named Colonel David Hackworth.

128
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.960
Next question.
Next question.

129
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.870
So the answer to that question was sort of another question,

130
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.350
kind of a question you got asked herself.
Yes.

131
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:50.150
And that's a question and I've talked about this where if I tell you echo,

132
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:52.520
hey echo,
I want you to do this mission.
I want you to do it this way.

133
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:55.190
Take your platoon and go do it.
And you disagree with what I'm telling you.

134
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.390
And you just say,
hey boss,
I don't want to do it that way.
And I said,
hey,

135
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.150
you shut up and do what I told you to do,
and you go,
you know what,

136
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.580
you can fire me when I'm not doing it.
I go,
okay,
fine,

137
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:07.520
you're fired and I get knucklehead over here who's a yes man.

138
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:09.740
It comes in and I tell him to go to the mission the way I told him to do it and

139
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:10.970
he goes and doesn't get to everyone killed.

140
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.970
Would it have been better off if you said,
okay boss,
I get it.
I,

141
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.220
I'll do it your way.
Here's some things I'd really like to not do,
and you go,
no.

142
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:21.530
I said,
no,
shut up.
And then you take your guys,

143
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:23.300
you mitigate everything that you can.
Actually,

144
00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:27.740
there's an example of this in band of brothers where major winners is being
told,

145
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:27.921
Hey,

146
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:32.921
send a reconnaissance element across the river again tonight and he doesn't want

147
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:35.720
to do it.
The the war's almost over.

148
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.900
They had taken some casualties I think the night before when they did the same

149
00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:41.900
type of operation and he just says,
got it boss.

150
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.450
And then the guys go and they sit in a,
they pretend to go out,

151
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:50.480
but they really just sit in the basement of a building on their side of the

152
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:53.570
river.
And then later on they said,
Yep,
we went,
we came back,

153
00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:56.970
we didn't find anything.
Okay,
cool.
There's a perfect example.

154
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.560
Imagine if major winners,
Dick winters was like,
we're not doing it.

155
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.020
And now you're getting an ego contest with the colonel who was like,

156
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.750
Oh yes you are.
No,
we're not.
Okay,
fine,
you're fired.

157
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.440
Let me get knucklehead over here.
Who's gonna do what I told them to do?

158
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.580
Who is it total?
Yes,
man.
And now we take that risk and guys get killed.
So,

159
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:18.990
so who is it like there's a,
there's Dick winters played the game.

160
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.040
He played the game so he could still have that influence and power and,

161
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.870
and still protect his guys.
Yeah.
Can get complex.
Yeah.

162
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.920
It's very,
that's why leadership is hard.
Yes.
It's,

163
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.450
it's weird though because when you say it's complex,

164
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:36.930
when you say leadership is hard at the same time,
like you,

165
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.220
if you're a principled human being and you have principles and you know what's

166
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:43.380
right and you're doing the right thing for the right reason,

167
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.540
that decisions are actually usually a little easier,
clearer,
clearer.
Yeah.

168
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:50.340
They might not be easy,
but they're clearer.
Like,

169
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:53.660
I know what I'm supposed to do here.
I got it.
I,
I'm,
I'm,

170
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.240
I'm gonna figure this one out.
And w this,

171
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.950
this I think applies to two most scenario where

172
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.180
<v 2>like if you think of the big picture where if you're like,
hey,</v>

173
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.350
I'm going to consider myself after everything's going to be said and done,

174
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.840
you know,
it kind of goes along with what you said.
Like,
oh,

175
00:10:13.841 --> 00:10:18.610
can you stand up the stand that the prompt you,
if you consider,
okay,
look back,

176
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.640
you're gonna cause there's gonna come a point where you're going to look back on

177
00:10:21.641 --> 00:10:24.880
this and you're going to feel the way you're going to feel right now.

178
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.780
But later on,
how are you going to feel about like how you handled it,
you know,

179
00:10:28.781 --> 00:10:30.640
what decision you made in how you made it.

180
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.990
<v 0>I tell kids too,
would you,
if you're,
if you're at a party,
yeah.</v>

181
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.780
Or you're wherever and something's going on,

182
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.980
would you be proud to stand up and be,
hey,
here's the situation and I,

183
00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:45.100
this is what I did and this is why I did it.
If you can't,

184
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.840
maybe you should really reconsider what your actions are going to be.
All right.

185
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:49.311
<v 2>No Man.</v>

186
00:10:49.311 --> 00:10:53.690
It's because a lot of the times shoots where she has a kid as an adult to a lot

187
00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:57.170
of the time it's like they're literally the opposite decision you like.

188
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.110
Especially if it's one of those like go along with the crowd kind of scenarios

189
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.930
where it's like,
oh yeah,
it's easy to go along there and when your kid,

190
00:11:02.931 --> 00:11:04.940
especially when it involves drinking and stuff,
sometimes there's,

191
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.820
there's really no consequence.
You know,
whatever.
You did something dumb.

192
00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:09.830
No one gets hurt or dies or nothing like that.

193
00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:11.090
But every once in a while there is,

194
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.680
but so it's like it makes it harder because you don't like when you go do

195
00:11:15.681 --> 00:11:18.260
something,
I don't know dumb,
I don't know,
a good jump off a bridge,
I don't know,

196
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.250
something drink and drive or whatever and no one dies or no one,

197
00:11:22.251 --> 00:11:26.870
nothing big happens.
It sort of reinforces that maybe it might be okay,
you know,

198
00:11:26.871 --> 00:11:29.950
you may be be able to slide with this behavior a little bit,
you know?
Yeah.

199
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.170
But at the end of the day,
you know?
Yeah.

200
00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:36.470
If you can clearly see that big picture where in the future you're going to be

201
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:38.120
looking back on how you handled it.
Yeah.

202
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.890
<v 0>Here's another thing,
same concept I used to tell,</v>

203
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.920
I told my guys was you just might as well act like CNN is recording what you're

204
00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:50.970
doing and it's good seeing them.
Right?
So if you want to act like an idiot,

205
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.571
guess what?

206
00:11:51.571 --> 00:11:54.010
It's going to be on CNN because someone's got a somewhere around there,

207
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.150
and you might as well be saying that today as a kid,
as a teenager,

208
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.900
you might as well be saying,
Yep,
this is,
this is the next viral video.

209
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:06.370
This is my 15 minutes of fame is going to be me doing whatever I'm doing right

210
00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:11.010
here.
So you gotta watch out for that.
Learn from hack.
