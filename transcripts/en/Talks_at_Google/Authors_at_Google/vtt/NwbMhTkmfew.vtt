SHANE GREENSTEIN: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:12.400
Look, we're small enough that
we can have a conversation.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.700
I do have a presentation,
but you can also

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.860
interrupt me if you want.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.940
It's really quite OK.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.610
I wrote this book, OK?

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.210
Took a lot of years.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.960
And I hope to share a
little bit with you.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.540
I can't share the whole thing
with you now, but perhaps

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.940
get you to motivate
a little bit.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.240
And I really appreciate
you taking the time.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.000
So let me just say what
the book's aspirations were

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.050
and then give you
some flavor for it.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.710
The big question is why
did the commercialization

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.700
of the internet have such
a large economic impact?

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.720
That's a big question.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.700
It's the big question
in this area.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.620
What the book does, it
accomplishes three things.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.187
It puts everything
into one place

00:00:57.187 --> 00:00:59.770
I like to say there's nothing
in this book that wasn't already

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.690
known by somebody.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.250
It just had never
been all together.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.830
Second, it focuses on innovation
and commercialisation.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.720
There's lots of very good
writing on invention,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.030
a lot less on commercialization.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.214
And then third, it
offers a big picture,

00:01:17.214 --> 00:01:19.130
this phrase "innovation
from the edges," which

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.590
we can get to if you want.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.554
You might reasonably
ask, who cares?

00:01:24.554 --> 00:01:26.220
And Jonathan gave the
answer, because it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.480
changed everyday life.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.330
If you have children
and you talk to them,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.990
I don't know if you've had
this experience of showing them

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.330
"Leave It to Beaver on TV"
and then you say, look, look,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.550
there's no internet there.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.870
And it really did change life.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.220
It's changed it as we know it.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.095
It changed business
as we know it.

00:01:42.095 --> 00:01:44.720
It's changed an enormous number
of industries, how they behave.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.060
It changed the identities of
the leaders in many industries.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.830
It's the kind of
thing that it was

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.660
responsible for a
boom in investment

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.990
for about five years in the US.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.450
These are sort of things you
don't see happening together

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.330
very often in the 200-year
history of capitalism,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.142
if I can make an overstatement.

00:02:05.142 --> 00:02:07.350
It's the sort of thing you
only see with electricity,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.490
automobiles, the big things.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.210
Indoor plumbing.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.650
I put a list there.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.909
Television, telephones.

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.450
There aren't many
examples like this,

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.940
and so that, in and of
itself it's of interest.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.590
But I thought it's
also interesting just

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.090
to understand what
happened and why,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.202
and why we had a big impact.

00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:27.410
You can also see some of
the symptoms in other things

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.800
like all the
households that were

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.470
online-- you had half
the households online

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.900
by the beginning of 2001,
which is extraordinarily fast,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.100
and the number of businesses
online 90% of US businesses

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.300
were online by 2001, which
is also extraordinarily fast.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.690
The other place to
start is to start

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.430
with misleading metaphors.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.980
The other reason to write this
book-- many people, when they

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.430
look at the internet,
want to look

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.720
for an Edison or a
Manhattan Project,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.820
look for something that
the government did,

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.430
as if the US government
orchestrated this, or somebody

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.430
invented the whole thing.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.960
And that's just wrong.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.540
That's actually a very
misleading metaphor.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.410
There are some very,
very smart people

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.326
who were involved in
inventing the internet.

00:03:15.326 --> 00:03:16.700
But if you want
to understand why

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.480
it had the economic
impact it had,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.540
that's not the place to start.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.590
That's the other reason
to write a book like this.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.817
So I'm going to focus
on commercialization.

00:03:25.817 --> 00:03:27.775
This is the best picture
I could find of tubes.

00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:37.040
And commercialization,
in particular,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.490
is taking technology
and finding value in it.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.740
And that's where the
focus of the book is.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.367
That's typically not
something people write about,

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:48.200
although you're all
living it at the moment.

00:03:50.601 --> 00:03:52.350
The reason you want
to focus on innovation

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.310
and commercialization,
it is a much better focus

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.300
for understanding
creative destruction

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.790
and the kinds of
processes we saw

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.276
in the latter part of the 90s.

00:04:01.276 --> 00:04:03.150
And it's also a much
better way to understand

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.300
why some government policies
succeeded and others failed.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.990
So the big question that shows
up in the middle of the book

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.341
is, how do major
technologies deploy?

00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:14.090
And what are the
processes that we observe

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.740
and what are the
patterns we observe?

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.740
And by the way, these are
very durable patterns,

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.480
the kinds of commercial
patterns you find, again,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.420
over 100 years, the sort of
things you see in electricity,

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.550
major agricultural inventions,
telephones, and so on.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.330
So if you start
from that question

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.170
and you look at what happened
in the middle of the 1990s,

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.590
you actually look at computing
as in sort of its 2.0 phase.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.330
We're presently, by the way, in
about a 3.0 phase of big data.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.240
Actually, you're at the
center of the present phase.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.530
I'd say historically, in about
the mid-90s, we were at 2.0.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.530
1.0 was pushing out the
processors into the frontier

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.810
and finding value in that.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.110
And the typical uses were
just the first times anybody'd

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.750
ever done databases
for airlines, hotel

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.630
reservations, simple logistics.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.020
And 2.0, a lot of people
knew that it was coming,

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.540
was to do
internetworking, that is,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.850
to connect computers
over large geographies

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.120
and do a lot of
automated processes.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.160
And a lot of prototypes had
been built. So the value

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.460
was identified in advance.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.820
What wasn't understood
was what form it would

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.010
take in commercial markets.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.760
That was where a lot
of the mystery was.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.020
In this case, what happened
is a very good identification

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.310
of processes you find in
lots of major technologies

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.400
when they diffuse.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.200
And I would call them the
two conundrums in order

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.740
to just identify for a general
audience what a lot of research

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.370
sees over and over again.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.960
So the two conundrums
are, I call

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.410
them the circular conundrum
and the adaptation conundrum.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.240
So when major
technologies diffuse,

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.100
the big problem they
face is you have

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.170
to coordinate multiple
suppliers all simultaneously

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.970
around the same effort.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.509
And typically those suppliers
are competing with one another

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.300
or they're not even
talking to one another.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.010
And so getting
them to coordinate

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.700
can be very challenging.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.660
The second conundrum,
adaptation conundrum,

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.270
is when you have major
technologies diffusing,

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.020
typically they
have to be adapted

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.650
into a variety of circumstances
in order to be valuable,

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.310
and that's actually where most
of the investment takes place.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.800
And nobody wants to
make that investment

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.091
unless they're sure the darn
thing is going to pay off.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.980
And so then
everybody holds back.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.830
So you typically get
these two conundrums

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.560
holding back major
technologies from deploying.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.340
And the question
that emerges if you

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.450
look at any major
technology is, how do you

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.600
resolve these two problems?

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.550
So I'll just do both
of these in this case.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.901
And I actually think it
helps people understand

00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:42.150
what we're going through
today in a couple other major

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.890
technologies.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.390
OK?

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.110
That was the plan.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.559
So the circular
conundrum is often

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:48.850
called the chicken-egg problem.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.600
If you've not heard
this, that's a joke.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.450
I'm trying, all right?

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.860
So the theory is, you have
to coordinate multiple firms.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.290
So how do you do that?

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.160
The classic chicken-egg
problem has the characteristic

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.730
that multiple firms need to get
their stuff to work together

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.750
in order to create value.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.360
But all of them hold back, and
so they all sit on the fence,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.870
and so you get
long, long delays.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.930
Typically what you need
is either a focal point,

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.460
a mandate, a platform
that coordinates,

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.570
a standard that's voluntary
that all can participate in.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.010
You need a mechanism
like that to generate

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.720
an overcoming the
circular conundrum.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.380
I put a picture of
Google Maps up here

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.280
because, in fact, that is
the function it serves.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.030
Just to give you an
example, this is still

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.550
something we see today.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.580
So what happened
historically in '95?

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.570
Well, a metaphor that's often
used is that what we got

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.170
was a gold rush as the catalyst.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.470
That metaphor is
a bit misleading,

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.780
but there's a grain
of truth to it.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.649
And so I think walking
through the story actually

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:55.190
really helps.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:00.040
Any of you ever been to the
place for the 1848 gold rush?

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.750
Anybody?

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.250
OK.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.390
So just to give you a
feel for what it is,

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.750
that's a picture
of Sutter's Mill

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.320
to give you an idea of what
gold rush economics is about.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.090
Gold rush economics is actually
an information problem.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.960
So what happened in 1848
is a good illustration.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.460
If you look at the
Sierra Mountains,

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.230
they come up at an angle.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.400
They have the substrates
underneath the surface,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.930
and then the glacier cut
off a whole bunch of rock

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.300
and exposed one seam of gold.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.380
Most of the seams of gold
that sit in the Sierras

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.226
are not covered by rivers.

00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:32.309
But they are covered by
rivers in one place, which

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.600
is the South Fork of the
American River, which

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.190
Sutter built his mill on.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.440
And so what the
river does is, it

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.419
took off a little bit of
gold and put it in the water.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.260
But nobody had ever gotten up
that high into the Sierras.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.110
Once Sutter put his mill
that high into the Sierras,

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.205
the gold dust, which doesn't
travel very far, became found.

00:08:53.205 --> 00:08:55.880
And what that did
is, very quickly

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.620
information about that
discovery went out,

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.050
and then we had a standard
economic behavior,

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.660
which is it was thought
that getting to that gold

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.250
quickly was going
to get high returns.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.660
So you have the
information goes out.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.290
Until then nothing is known.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.230
Then the information
spreads, and then there's

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.920
a behavioral reason for
everyone to rush in.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.510
That's a gold rush.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.809
So the question is, did
we have a gold rush here?

00:09:20.809 --> 00:09:22.350
Was there something
unknown that then

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.160
became known and then
generated a bunch

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.190
of ideas that wasn't known?

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.150
And then what were the
behavioral reasons to rush in?

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.804
That's the sort of questions
you ask about the situation.

00:09:34.804 --> 00:09:36.220
So on the one hand,
if I was being

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.520
very pedantic I'd tell you
this wasn't a gold rush.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.400
There were plenty of firms who
were investing prior to 1995.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.750
And so you couldn't
argue, necessarily, there

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.460
was something that was unknown.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.380
On the other hand, if you're
being a little more charitable

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.250
and you look at
historically what happened,

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.520
the coordinating mechanism
is pretty obvious.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.480
It was Netscape's founding.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.330
And it wasn't Netscape's
founding per se.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:04.080
It was the demonstration
of a commercial browser

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.612
as a commercial prototype.

00:10:05.612 --> 00:10:06.820
It was more than a prototype.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.220
It was actually for sale.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.870
And that was in
February of 1995.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.670
And essentially
what happened is,

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.630
many participants in industry,
in the computing industry,

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.100
at the same time saw the
same commercial prototype

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.050
within several months
of one another.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.840
So you got the
equivalent of a gold rush

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.320
because they were all informed
at roughly the same time,

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.361
and then they all make
their investment decisions

00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:29.720
at roughly the same time.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.160
That's actually
what happens here.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.130
We could talk about Microsoft
in a little bit if you want to.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.950
Microsoft has a slightly
different history

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.770
at this moment.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:47.070
And Google might take a lesson
from that going forward.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.020
We'll go to that
in a little bit.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.050
The other thing that happened
at the time, absolutely the one

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.070
thing about this history that's
essentially very interesting

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.070
is that the governance
of the situation

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.201
was unique relative to anything
that had come before it.

00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:04.950
Again, I think anybody
in computer science

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.550
now takes this for granted, but
it was quite novel at the time.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.820
There was a governance structure
both in the IETF-- sorry,

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.930
in the Internet
Engineering Task Force--

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.820
and in the World Wide
Web Consortium that

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.830
had two characteristics that
had not previously ever shown up

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.000
in a major platform.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.220
The two characteristics
were, anybody

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.630
could come and gain information
about the technology.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.230
And second, there
were no what a lawyer

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.380
would call restricted rights.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.240
There were no reach
through rights.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.640
The organizations giving
out the information

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.147
did not tell you
what to do with it.

00:11:43.147 --> 00:11:43.980
So those two things.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.430
Anyone could come
in, and there was

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.804
no constraint on what could
be done with the information.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:55.520
The internet platform
had no restraint

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.190
on what was done
with the information.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.910
And that was just a
new characteristic.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.590
Any firm who had ever done
a major platform until that

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.350
had always restricted
information flow in and out,

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.040
and use afterwards.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.310
And what that did
is it generated

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.661
what I think most
people in computing

00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:15.910
take for granted, which is
you get lots of specialists

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.287
within platforms.

00:12:17.287 --> 00:12:19.370
So once you have a
well-designed modular platform,

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.510
you can get a
specialist who takes

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:21.750
for granted the
rest of the platform

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.040
and then does a commercial
product that's offered.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.380
In this era, this
is the first time

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.020
we ever saw a major growth
across the entire economy

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.910
in a whole bunch of
specialists taking

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.340
advantage of the platform.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:37.700
I like to use this example from
Hotmail since it was so simple.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.190
Hotmail, the first
web-based email, and it

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.110
had viral marketing.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.960
It had the little
footer that said,

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.040
get your new email at Hotmail.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.950
And the people who
programmed this

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.000
didn't have to do an
enormous amount of work.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.730
They could take for granted
the rest of the network

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:55.480
was going to work.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.060
TCP/IP was going to
work, the World Wide Web

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.277
was going to work, and everybody
else was going to be just fine.

00:13:01.277 --> 00:13:02.860
And if they got a
wrong email address,

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.817
it wasn't going to
bring down the network.

00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:06.400
They could take for
granted they could

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.010
do something very
narrow and specialized,

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.090
and take for granted
everything else.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.920
And this is a great
example of what

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.700
a modular platform with
unrestricted information

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.800
can do, and did do in this case.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.410
So this was the other
source of the gold rush.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.760
So that's the
circular conundrum.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.180
Ready for the
adaptation conundrum?

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.630
The adaptation conundrum.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.010
I put up a picture
here of-- I don't

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.050
know if anyone knows this one.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.550
It looks obscure, but it's fun.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.240
Any Midwesterners in the room?

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:43.930
This is corn.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.676
Particularly, this is
taken from hybrid corn.

00:13:50.676 --> 00:13:53.560
I'll explain the
association in a minute.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.090
Again, here's the theory.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.680
The theory is when you get a
new major technology deploying,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.650
it has to be adapted in
multiple circumstances.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.230
That's something, again, we've
seen multiple times any time

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.020
major technology shows up.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.030
What happened here, same thing.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.120
You would expect the internet
not to be used right away,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.050
but that it would need
a lot of co-investment

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.170
in a bunch of locations
and a bunch of businesses

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.680
to turn it into
something valuable.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:21.440
And then the open question
is, how does that co-invention

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.810
organize itself?

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:27.920
There's no natural one
answer to that question

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.380
in any major technology.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.339
And what happened
here-- I sort of already

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:34.880
gave you the answers--
we got a bunch

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.320
of innovative specialists,
unlike what we had seen

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.510
historically in some
major technology pushes,

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.770
where one firm had
dominated the technology,

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.190
say, for example as in
telephony, or in automobiles,

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.600
the Ford Motor
Company dominated it.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.020
Here we had enormous numbers
of innovative specialists each

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.230
doing their own thing.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.680
And that ended up
getting the investment

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.115
in adaptation specialized
across multiple players.

00:15:05.115 --> 00:15:07.240
And it was also done very
quickly as a consequence.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.490
It meant all these people
and could act independently.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.790
So to give you an example,
why do specialists

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.100
do adaptation really well?

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.610
This is of my favorite
stories from this era.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.352
Did anybody ever
use this product?

00:15:22.352 --> 00:15:24.310
Any of you old enough to
remember this product?

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:25.700
Internet in a box.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.990
It's totally, you know, cute.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.890
So what they did--
this is a 1994 product.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.610
So what they did is they
took basically a browser.

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:34.610
It was a Mosaic browser.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.170
It wasn't even a
Netscape browser.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:40.130
They put it on a disk,
they stuck it in a box

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:44.260
to make it look like
packaged software,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.160
because that was the
motif of the time.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.300
You would go to,
you remember Egghead

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.110
or one of these retail
outlets, and then

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.592
you would buy packaged software.

00:15:51.592 --> 00:15:53.050
And then people
went and bought it,

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:57.170
and then they would put
the internet in their PC.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.500
I think it's sort of cute.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.530
And you go, really?

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.540
Come on.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.520
But this worked.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.670
This was extremely popular.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:09.370
And the point is that
innovative specialists all

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.160
find different little
niche ways of adapting

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.030
the technology to the
sub-market that they perceive.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.230
So they perceived
this sub-market

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.060
for a bunch of new users that
nobody else had perceived.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.220
They got a huge
amount of attention.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.530
And so they were a hit, and
they eventually ended up

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.260
selling to someone else.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.392
The key to an example like
this is the specialist

00:16:31.392 --> 00:16:33.600
is trying to learn something
you don't otherwise see,

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.970
you can't learn in a lab.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.480
They're typically trying
to understand something

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.750
about the mix between
demand and costs

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.770
that's not otherwise learnable
through a simple experiment

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.450
inside of a laboratory.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.690
Here's another
example from the time.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:48.190
ISPs.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.450
Do you remember dial-up ISPs?

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:54.610
Why did the US get the internet
earlier than any other country?

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.790
This is the answer.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.510
Because we had the
fastest deployment

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.400
of the dial-up network anywhere
in the developed world.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.810
And that arose, again, because
these dial-up companies

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:11.260
were specialists in all
these different locations.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.890
And many of them had previously
been bulletin board systems.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.974
And so you found them
all over the place,

00:17:17.974 --> 00:17:19.890
and then becoming an
internet service provider

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.339
was a very easy
thing for them to do.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.640
And so then this is my
favorite quote of the book.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.369
Let's see if I can--
yeah, I can do this.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.200
"A good predictor of
not finding an ISP

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.860
is the presence of a lot
of hybrid corn seed,"

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:38.120
which comes from Zvi Grill, used
to be a professor at Harvard

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.180
who studied hybrid corn.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:45.080
And this is his
1957 dissertation,

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.580
one of the more famous studies
of major technology deployment.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.940
And he observed that ISPs
looked an awful lot like what

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.880
he had studied years ago.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.530
You might ask a slightly
deeper question,

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.700
which is where did all
these bulletin board systems

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.810
come from?

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.940
Where did all the
specialists come from?

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.150
It's one of the
characteristics of the US.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:08.930
It's not unique to
the United States

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.150
to have large communities of
what are known as wild ducks.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.025
Do you use that phrase
inside Google as well?

00:18:16.025 --> 00:18:20.142
This is a perhaps
archaic phrase now,

00:18:20.142 --> 00:18:22.340
a phrase about computing
about wild ducks,

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.930
that people who look at
things in a different way

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.900
or have a different
perception of what

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.770
the innovative value is.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.249
The United States
is not entirely

00:18:31.249 --> 00:18:33.040
unique in having
communities of wild ducks,

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.140
but had a fairly large
community even at this time.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.500
And there were a
bunch of regulations

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:44.420
to protect them and mandate
that telephone companies should

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.170
work with them.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.870
And then there was also the
First Amendment turned out

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.450
to also support them, because
many bulletin board systems

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.440
were doing some
unsavory activities.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.210
We'll just leave it there.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:01.030
So I'll finish up
here pretty quick.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.560
One other place that's
interesting to find adaptation

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.690
is in business use.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.840
There were two things going in
business that often are really

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.710
under appreciated.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.250
One was on the browser side,
which looked a lot like home.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.660
The other was on enhancement
of business services

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.250
to support electronic commerce.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.250
That was really expensive,
that kind of investment.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.954
As it turned out,
after the fact--

00:19:21.954 --> 00:19:23.370
we shouldn't be
surprised by this,

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.440
but many people at the
time were surprised

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:31.140
after the fact-- there was
a large incentive by users

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.730
to retrofit existing processes
with something that saved

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.420
the capital they already had.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.910
Users did not want to go
into a green field situation,

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:43.460
typically.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.450
They typically wanted
to preserve a lot

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.240
of the things they already had.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.010
And as a consequence,
many of the dot coms

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:55.840
who came into these
businesses failed precisely

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.120
because they didn't respect
their end customer wanting

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.600
to preserve what
they were doing.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.770
And if you look in
retrospect, the reason IBM

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.930
succeeded in this
era was precisely

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.860
because they
respected the existing

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.840
processes of their client base.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.375
That's just one
of the big lessons

00:20:17.375 --> 00:20:19.000
you have to walk away
with from looking

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.870
at this era, for
what it's worth.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.430
We could talk about
the boom if you like.

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.710
There was a boom.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.109
The boom had a gold rush.

00:20:30.109 --> 00:20:31.400
It was caused by the gold rush.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.290
There was a second
thing going on,

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.190
and that was a
network effect where

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:40.720
investment by firms in processes
made browsing more valuable.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.310
That made more firms go online
with electronic commerce, which

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.187
then induced more browsing
adoption, and so on, and more

00:20:48.187 --> 00:20:49.270
investment in the network.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.840
And so you had these
interplays which

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.830
made it more valuable for each
player to do more investment.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.500
That was the second thing going
on, and that caused the boom

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.410
in the '90-2000 era.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:04.570
And then, as an economy, we
overshot, without question.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:10.520
So that's, in a nutshell,
chapters nine, 10, 11 and 12.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.970
Just explained how that
overshooting happened.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.870
So I'm doing the whole
thing quickly just

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.040
because it's more fun.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.460
Let me end with two things.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.140
Renewal.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:26.120
So after the overshooting
there were two forms of renewal

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.370
that I talk about in the book.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.970
One of them is Wi-Fi.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.070
And where did Wi-Fi come from?

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:40.470
Wi-Fi is a wonderful example
because the spectrum was

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:48.120
allocated initially for things
that the engineers in the FCC

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.310
regarded as garbage, and many
engineers regarded as garbage.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.920
So baby monitors,
mobile handsets.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.480
You remember these kinds
of things inside your home?

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.780
Garage door openers.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:05.090
And the trick, the
thing that happened

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.660
was, the unlicensed spectrum
allowed equipment firms

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.740
to embed the use
of that spectrum

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:16.890
inside of their wireless
antennas and their wireless

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.430
servers.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.860
And users found
that very valuable.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.720
And so the spectrum
ended up migrating

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.764
from garage door openers.

00:22:25.764 --> 00:22:27.680
You still find it in
some garage door openers,

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.496
but it ended up migrating
mostly into the area of Wi-Fi.

00:22:31.496 --> 00:22:33.120
And so the unlicensed
spectrum ended up

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.270
being the vehicle
for movement of value

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.920
from a low value use
to a high value use.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.820
And that's a pretty
interesting piece of renewal.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.040
And then I had to do this
example in this room,

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.380
just because it's well-known.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:52.980
The book also has a chapter
on internet advertising

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.820
and Google's approach to
renewing that market, which

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:00.180
was on its way down at the
time that Google starts

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:09.070
to figure out how to do an ad
auction for keywords, which

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.040
renews the market for
advertising at the time.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.960
And I suspect this
story is known in here,

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.120
so I won't go over.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.280
It's just I had to bring it
up because it's in the book.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.570
Want to do big lessons,
or are we good?

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:21.090
Big lessons?

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.340
OK, big lessons.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.931
That's my favorite big picture.

00:23:25.931 --> 00:23:26.430
Sorry.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.490
That's also a bad joke.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.390
OK, what movie?

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.890
Yeah.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.920
Ferris Bueller.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.320
So the big picture.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:44.150
Innovation from the edges
is the major framing.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:48.340
That's about outsiders bringing
new perception and new assets

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:53.880
to bear on an opportunity that
insiders were not investing in.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.400
The big lesson from
this experience

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.150
is the way outsiders
explored, particularly

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:03.170
outsiders who were specialists,
and innovative specialists

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.880
explored sub-pieces.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.650
And that unlocked the circular
conundrum and the adaptation

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:09.990
conundrum.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:13.620
That's the big insight
of this experience.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.870
The book spends a lot of time
filling in the gaps about

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:21.124
why that happened and why.

00:24:21.124 --> 00:24:23.290
It has a lot of consequence
for thinking about, say,

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:26.360
for example, a company
like this who supports

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.140
a lot of innovative specialists
as a major platform,

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.950
and how would you think about
taking activity to support?

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:38.470
And then start new
platforms to support

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:39.780
new innovative specialists.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.520
So in this instance,
what we observed

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.520
was this interplay between
all the specialists

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.990
who raised the value
of the investment

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.890
by all of the others.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.460
And the other big lesson,
in comparison, why did you

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.154
have this done in this way?

00:24:57.154 --> 00:24:58.570
Why did the network
grow this way,

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.040
and why didn't it grow
from a telephone company?

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.950
There were lots of
opportunities for publicly

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:08.520
supported telephone companies
to grow a data network.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.580
And why didn't it
happen that way?

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.110
And the answer is that
innovative specialists

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:16.550
perceived things that
otherwise would not

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:20.580
rise to the top of priorities
inside of a large firm.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.780
You get multiple points
of view supported

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.280
in this kind of market structure
that you wouldn't otherwise

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.200
get in a single firm.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.410
And as a consequence,
you get more variety

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:34.710
than you would otherwise
get in a single firm.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:38.510
But if you were going to read
this book with the present

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:42.820
in mind, I would
start by saying you

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.880
would expect to see these two
conundrums arising repeatedly.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.420
They still do.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.480
For example, if you look
at big data 3.0-- as I say,

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.860
it looks to me like we're
in 3.0 of big data-- we've

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.350
been in big data for a
long time as an industry.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:00.280
But the present era
of big data, you

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.840
would expect to see circular
conundrum issues showing up,

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.150
which you do.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.770
And you see major firms
trying to take positions

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.717
as coordinators.

00:26:10.717 --> 00:26:12.050
I think you're in that business.

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:12.960
So is Amazon.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.450
So is Microsoft.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:21.320
You see institutions that help
coordinate large data as well.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.722
Again, we tend to have a lot
of open systems doing that.

00:26:24.722 --> 00:26:26.180
You see government
mandates, again,

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.550
trying to take positions to
unlock circular conundrums,

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.050
particularly in the
Health Care Act.

00:26:32.069 --> 00:26:34.360
There was actually lots of
subsidies in the Health Care

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:39.590
Act to get hospitals
all to do computing

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:41.580
inside their organizations
so that then they

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.270
would all use the same field
so they could exchange data.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:50.240
That's a very standard way to
overcome a circular conundrum.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.240
Then on adaptation, you would
also expect to see that.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.240
You see that again.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.781
I mean, I could run
through it again,

00:26:56.781 --> 00:26:58.870
but you see that in the
present environment.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:02.000
My own forecast on say, for
example, the big data changes

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.390
today, is that adaptation
is actually much easier

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.050
than we saw 20
years ago, partially

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:11.010
because you don't really have
to involve households very much.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:13.510
Most of investments being
done in the infrastructure

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:16.135
are behind the scenes, and it's
being done by major businesses.

00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:20.200
And so largely those investments
are done for private reasons

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.750
and don't need to be
coordinated very heavily

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.510
with a lot of other firms.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.310
There's some standardisation
issues, of course,

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:34.560
and some big government privacy
issues that are difficult.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.910
It's a challenging problem,
but it's easier than the one

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:40.550
we just observed in this book.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:41.879
Thanks.

00:27:41.879 --> 00:27:44.476
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:44.476 --> 00:27:45.850
I'm happy to have
a conversation.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.759
It's small enough in here.

00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:50.550
AUDIENCE: Could you
give a specific example

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.285
of a circular conundrum
that you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:53.285 --> 00:27:55.660
SHANE GREENSTEIN: Oh, certainly
on the smartphone market.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:28:00.720
I mean, yeah, though we're
over that one at this point.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.610
In smart phones 10 years ago,
we were still-- think about it,

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:09.030
before the iPhone
we were still facing

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.680
the same old circular conundrum.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.130
Nokia and Microsoft had both
done a lot of investments

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.840
to try to overcome that.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.680
And then the iPhone ended
up being the catalyst

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.670
to start things, and
Android was close enough

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.650
behind, and with a
governance structure that

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.960
was very friendly to
programmers and app developers

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.990
that it also managed
to develop a network.

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:38.350
That's what you have in mind?

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:38.934
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
well, how about one

00:28:38.934 --> 00:28:40.311
that hasn't been resolved yet?

00:28:40.311 --> 00:28:42.310
SHANE GREENSTEIN: Oh,
that hasn't been resolved.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:45.500
Certainly internet of
things has got that in it,

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.410
because of a bunch of the
standards about security,

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.840
for example, and how things
should work with each other

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.500
when they come across
from different firms.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.850
AUDIENCE: Do you see the
emerging television standards,

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:02.980
now that everything is going
on the internet, essentially?

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.920
There are already beginning
to be interoperability

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.463
issues between smart TVs
and Roku and so forth.

00:29:10.463 --> 00:29:13.950
And in fact, I was just on the
other side of the building,

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:18.520
and people were talking about
the possibility of testing

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.790
applications on things that have
new models out every season.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:25.940
SHANE GREENSTEIN: Yeah, just
in the streaming video side,

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.710
even in the consumer
side, there's

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:33.890
still some serious issues.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:37.940
You know, there's actually
some public policy there also

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.520
in getting the coordination
between the-- I

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.590
almost hesitate to get into
the weeds on this-- on edge

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:51.040
providers, if you will,
and broadband providers,

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.330
and what's appropriate behavior
at handoff points and gateways

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:59.130
between network providers.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:00.980
If you look, for example,
at the issues that

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:06.960
arose when Netflix was not
working too well in January

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:12.630
of 2014, to use a
very simple example,

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:16.610
that was from not
having an understanding

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:21.870
about how to coordinate data
handoff between, at that point,

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.320
either a backbone provider
who was carrying a lot of data

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.790
and passing it into
a broadband network,

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:32.080
or from a CDN into
a broadband network.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.550
And there was a disagreement
about the proper way

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:39.770
to do that, or what both
parties wanted to do.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:43.100
That's a pretty nasty
circular conundrum effect,

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.459
if one keeps arising, especially
if everything goes online,

00:30:46.459 --> 00:30:47.500
as we're all forecasting.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.800
That's another one.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.530
Is that helpful?

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:54.155
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:54.155 --> 00:30:56.908
Well, I mean, are
there any broad trends

00:30:56.908 --> 00:31:00.470
that you can use to predict
how, say, internet of things--

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.320
SHANE GREENSTEIN: I mean, cars,
which your firm is involved in,

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.560
is a pretty good one as well.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.270
We can all see that one coming.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:10.790
There's more than just-- I mean,
the cars already work, right?

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:11.290
Yeah.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:12.040
They already work.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.990
So the prototypes--
we're in a situation

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:17.080
now where the
prototypes all work.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.590
We can all forecast
there's going to be a scale

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.656
decline in cost pretty soon.

00:31:24.274 --> 00:31:26.230
And there's an enormous
amount of coordination

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:34.530
that needs to take place
between road building, insurance

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:44.050
companies, legal standards
for accidents, and liability.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:46.055
AUDIENCE: But in
this case, it doesn't

00:31:46.055 --> 00:31:47.930
seem like firms are
waiting to invest, right?

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:50.744
There's already lots of
companies investing in that.

00:31:50.744 --> 00:31:51.660
SHANE GREENSTEIN: Yes.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.610
There is already a
lot of investment.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:59.132
AUDIENCE: Is it that there isn't
a clear direction, so there's--

00:31:59.132 --> 00:32:00.090
SHANE GREENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:02.620
So the danger at the moment
in that area is we're

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.380
going to get
Balkanized standards.

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:11.330
So we'll get two or three
different ways of doing things.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.580
In fact, it almost seems
inevitable Europe will go one

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.330
way and the US will go another.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:19.600
That just almost seems
inevitable on this one.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.020
Even worse is California
goes one way and the rest

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.206
of the country goes another.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:30.117
That seems possible also,
particular with cars,

00:32:30.117 --> 00:32:32.450
because, California has always
gone its own way on, say,

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.840
for example pollution controls.

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:40.050
AUDIENCE: So in this
case, so for cars,

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:41.550
government
regulations are what's

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.835
going to ultimately determine--

00:32:43.835 --> 00:32:46.126
SHANE GREENSTEIN: It's going
to be a major determinant.

00:32:46.126 --> 00:32:47.542
AUDIENCE: Is that
always the case?

00:32:47.542 --> 00:32:51.550
Like for Internet of Things,
is there another way it go?

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.470
Can you predict how the
net will be resolved?

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:55.261
SHANE GREENSTEIN: No,
it's hard to predict.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.474
I never like to predict.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.140
I would be a little cautious.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:10.190
In this example, 20 years
ago, government regulation

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:13.800
had two roles, and so
we should be careful.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.980
Sometimes it's very
interventionist

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.640
because competition
policy intervenes

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.480
very directly when you
have a monopoly provision.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:25.190
That's still going to
happen in this country.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:28.590
There's a longstanding
dislike for monopoly provision

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:29.580
in the United States.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.800
That's not going to go away.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.200
Monopoly provision is
going to happen somewhere

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.630
in transportation because there
always are, it always does.

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:43.980
And you can forecast there will
be government intervention very

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:48.280
directly in the places where
monopoly provision of transport

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:53.120
services allows somebody to
jack up prices or dictate terms,

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.482
and government regulation
will intervene.

00:33:55.482 --> 00:33:57.940
Just know that, because that
there's a long history of that

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.130
here.

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:02.850
Having said that, one of
the interesting things

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.770
about watching the
internet experience is,

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:10.159
government policy was
not orchestrating.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:12.699
It was often stepping back.

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:17.040
It was very deliberately
stepping back and letting firms

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.387
invest as discretion dictated.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:28.980
And you see a lot of that in
the history here of particularly

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:35.139
federal forbearance is
the word the lawyers use,

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:38.850
a deliberate stepping back
from making decisions.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.350
So it would enable
private industry

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:44.750
to choose what it wanted
to do without orchestrating

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:45.846
the whole thing.

00:34:45.846 --> 00:34:47.429
And it was very
selective intervention

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:51.590
in things like establishing
the Internet Engineering Task

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:54.610
Force, or in privatizing
the backbone.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:56.980
But it was very selective.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.680
I would say it was always wise.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.690
I mean, the domain name system
wasn't done particularly well,

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:02.220
for example.

00:35:06.595 --> 00:35:07.970
So there's something
equivalent's

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:09.010
got to happen in cars.

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:11.160
There's got to be a set
of standards, for example,

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.170
on how information is
going to be interchanged

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:17.840
between the various
parties, particularly

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.729
between the people who watch
roads and individual cars.

00:35:22.729 --> 00:35:24.270
Some of the things--
I mean, you guys

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:25.899
would actually know
better, I suspect.

00:35:25.899 --> 00:35:28.190
But if you've watched some
of the prototypes I've seen,

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.040
you get that you get
real time communication

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:35.130
between the vehicle and
some other public source

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:35.850
of information.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:37.580
And then that
requires something.

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:44.110
AUDIENCE: Your colleague
Professor Christianson

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:49.508
argues [INAUDIBLE] and
how companies basically

00:35:49.508 --> 00:35:53.372
get stuck at [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:53.372 --> 00:35:55.787
You were saying
that specialists are

00:35:55.787 --> 00:35:59.490
need to resolve that dilemma.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:03.030
SHANE GREENSTEIN: Can help
resolve that dilemma, yes.

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:07.455
AUDIENCE: How do you see
companies or leading businesses

00:36:07.455 --> 00:36:13.155
such as Google avoid that
dilemma of having specialists

00:36:13.155 --> 00:36:14.110
inside?

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.110
SHANE GREENSTEIN: I was
ready for this question.

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.530
I brought a slide.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.580
So can I do the history first?

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:23.776
If I had to take a history.

00:36:23.776 --> 00:36:26.150
OK, I have an Al Gore slide,
too, in case you're curious.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:31.420
OK.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:36.170
So if I was going to take--
I know people at Google

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:39.320
might resist being compared
to Microsoft 20 years ago.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.850
But work with it for a minute.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:45.370
Microsoft was
approximately 20 years old

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:48.090
when these events occurred.

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:51.130
Not saying-- Google's
not exactly 20 years old,

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:52.740
but it's pretty close.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.150
There was some very
strong personalities

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:00.500
at the heart of that
firm at the time.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.610
I'm not saying that's
particularly true here.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:07.550
But there's a very large firm.

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:13.350
What happened to Microsoft
in this situation,

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:15.810
the details are well known.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.730
Gates had lots of
personal authority.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:23.470
And he had misunderstood the
potential for the internet.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:27.580
And there was a
skunkworks inside

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:31.800
of the company that had
done a lot of advanced work.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.700
And then I put a
picture of Ben Slivka

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.610
up here because he's actually
the guy who wrote the memo that

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.380
grabbed Gates' attention.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.700
And they grabbed
his attention late.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.190
So that that's a
historical fact.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:50.590
He came to understand what
was about to happen later

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:53.410
than many other in industry.

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:56.080
If you look at that example
and step back from it and say,

00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:01.730
what's the lesson, which is
the essence of your question,

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:06.460
I would sort of be both
empathetic and critical

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:07.810
at the same time.

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:09.910
If you look at
Microsoft at the time,

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:18.730
they were very good at what you
would think of as a big push,

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:24.660
deploying products that took
several thousand people,

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:30.470
organized over multiple years,
towards a very big goal.

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:33.850
They were extraordinarily
good at that.

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:35.990
And you know,
specialists actually

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:38.830
can't do that very
well typically.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:42.840
So it was a valuable
thing for them to do.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:47.300
The best example we have
at the time was Windows 95

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.403
actually fits this.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:54.390
What were they
very poor at doing?

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:56.751
And I would guess the same
would be true here as well.

00:38:56.751 --> 00:38:58.500
There are sort of two
things they were not

00:38:58.500 --> 00:38:59.870
very good at doing.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.280
And it's just inherently true.

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.870
Every large firm
is poor doing this.

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:05.450
They weren't very
good at planning.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.200
They were extraordinarily
good at planning relative

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.825
to their rivals, but
they still weren't

00:39:08.825 --> 00:39:11.520
very good at seeing the
future, because everybody's

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.850
poor at doing that.

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:17.660
And second, they resisted
cannibalizing their own product

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.680
lines.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.840
And lots of reasons why.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:25.880
We could go into those reasons,
but lots of reasons why.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.290
And it led them in the
direction that you're hinting,

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:34.950
to resist understanding
businesses that

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.130
were inconsistent with
their present business.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.610
That was the actual
thing that happened here.

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:44.040
If you look at the mistake
Gates made at the time,

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.930
it was, he didn't want to
cannibalize Windows 95.

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:51.440
And he understood its value
in a very particular way

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.010
and resisted another
understanding that

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:56.640
was inconsistent with that.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.250
And the result of that
was it slowed them

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.980
down a tremendous amount.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:06.400
And even for a long time after
Gates' change of direction,

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:06.935
he resisted.

00:40:06.935 --> 00:40:10.040
He actually did
resist investments

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.540
to take advantage of what the
commercial internet would have

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.890
allowed his firm to do, because
he just resisted cannibalizing

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.930
his own investments.

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:20.260
That, I think, is
the big danger.

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.730
It's a big danger
in a firm like this.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:25.090
There's just natural reasons
why existing firms hang

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:31.750
on to existing product
markets, existing revenue

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:37.170
sources, and
existing perceptions

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:41.460
about where the source
of value comes from.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.410
Yeah, that's the issue.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:46.070
And then the hard
part-- the hard part

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.420
is getting the timing right.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:49.850
Gates was late.

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:53.620
That was a preventable
error in his case.

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.720
I think, in practice, I actually
want to be more forgiving.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.930
It's actually very hard to
get timing right in general.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.785
But that's the
lesson of this case.

00:41:05.785 --> 00:41:06.910
You want the Al Gore slide?

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:07.230
OK.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:07.729
Sure.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.320
Everybody always asks.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.390
Nobody's asked yet.

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:18.360
But I'm always prepared for this
because everyone always asks.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.760
What did Al Gore invent
and when did he invent it?

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.550
The book-- actually,
I felt an obligation

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:28.960
to figure out what
actually happened here.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.160
This is the actual quote
that started it all.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:38.626
This is a Wolf Blitzer
interview in 1999.

00:41:38.626 --> 00:41:40.000
You can read it
as well as I can,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.140
but it's "I will be offering my
vision when my campaign begins,

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.187
and it will be
comprehensive and sweeping.

00:41:46.187 --> 00:41:48.020
And I hope that it will
be compelling enough

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.380
to draw people toward it.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.450
I feel that it will be, but it
will emerge from my dialogue

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:53.669
with the American people.

00:41:53.669 --> 00:41:55.460
I've traveled to every
part of this country

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.570
during the last six years.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:58.560
During my service in the
United States Congress

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.470
I took the initiative in
creating the internet.

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:03.660
I took the initiative
in moving forward

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.990
a whole range of initiatives,"
et cetera, et cetera.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:08.560
That's what did it.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.420
So after that
interview, the next day,

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.970
there was a bunch of opposition
research, most famous

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:18.580
of which came from Trent Lott.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.250
"If Al Gore invented
the internet,

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.340
I invented the paper clip."

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.464
Dan Quayle was my
favorite quote from here.

00:42:26.464 --> 00:42:27.880
"If Al Gore invented
the internet,

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:32.290
then I invented
the spell checker."

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:35.530
And that's how the meme started.

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:40.590
And then this meme got started
on late night television.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:44.250
Top 10 things Al Gore invented.

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:48.980
And it just gained
its own momentum.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.410
And the ridicule is
quite funny, because it's

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:58.420
obvious no one individual could
have invented the internet,

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.390
nor could one policymaker
orchestrate the entire thing.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:05.054
That's sort of
inherently ridiculous.

00:43:05.054 --> 00:43:06.220
And that's why it was funny.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:10.360
It was also made for good
political campaign, opposition

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:10.860
campaign.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.960
But that's its source.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.680
And the interesting
thing, actually,

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.940
watching this in
retrospect-- try

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:21.190
to explain this to your kids,
to someone who wasn't there.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:25.640
How did this survive
for so long as a meme?

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.370
And that's the part that's
actually hard to explain.

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:33.680
And it was just
very good politics.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:38.180
And this politician lost
control of the conversation.

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:40.090
That's where it comes from.

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:42.980
It's a great joke, though.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:46.750
AUDIENCE: But he did push
through legislation that--

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:48.550
SHANE GREENSTEIN: Yes.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:51.120
So his actual
legislative history,

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:55.120
if you want that-- his
actual legislative history is

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.570
two things.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:58.440
It's two pieces of legislation.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.080
It's primarily, though, with
funding the National Science

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:07.360
Foundation network, particularly
the latter bill that

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.670
upgraded the backbone for
the internet and funded

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:14.140
supercomputer centers,
which were attached to it.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.810
And then one of those
supercomputer centers

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:21.320
was the source of
Mosaic, the browser that

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:26.030
generated the
prototype browser that

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:28.460
was the catalyst for
the commercial browser.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.620
And that backbone was the
backbone that was privatized,

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:38.820
that generated
the other movement

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.273
towards commercial internet.

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.790
So yeah, he deserves
credit for that.

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:46.651
That's a real thing.

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:52.531
How's that?

00:44:52.531 --> 00:44:53.030
Cool.

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:54.240
Well, thank you very much.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.790
[APPLAUSE]
