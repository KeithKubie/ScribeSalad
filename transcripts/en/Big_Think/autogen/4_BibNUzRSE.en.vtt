yeah so I mean really include question

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519
yeah so I mean really include question
 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.759
yeah so I mean really include question
is I mean how do you how do you expand

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769
is I mean how do you how do you expand
 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.680
is I mean how do you how do you expand
how do you in the very least change your

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690
how do you in the very least change your
 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.600
how do you in the very least change your
space of possibility and one way of

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610
space of possibility and one way of
 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.779
space of possibility and one way of
changing of course is to expand it and

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789
changing of course is to expand it and
 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.090
changing of course is to expand it and
especially if doing so requires you to

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
especially if doing so requires you to
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.380
especially if doing so requires you to
step into uncertainty because if

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
step into uncertainty because if
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.359
step into uncertainty because if
everything is really nice inside your

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
everything is really nice inside your

little village when during evolution

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600

what a stupid idea to see what's on the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
what a stupid idea to see what's on the
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.880
what a stupid idea to see what's on the
other side of the hill because now

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
other side of the hill because now
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.109
other side of the hill because now
you've just increased the possibility of

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119
you've just increased the possibility of
 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.820
you've just increased the possibility of
dying because dying is actually really

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830
dying because dying is actually really
 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.170
dying because dying is actually really
easy right

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
easy right
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.270
easy right
so in fact we even have a safety bias

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280
so in fact we even have a safety bias
 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.340

that our assumptions of gears towards
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.869
that our assumptions of gears towards
safety because again it's easy to die so

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
safety because again it's easy to die so
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.330
safety because again it's easy to die so
what are other tricks are there ways or

their principles that enable people to
 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.630
their principles that enable people to
step into a certainty and the answer is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640
step into a certainty and the answer is
 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.729
step into a certainty and the answer is
yes because it's such an important point

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739
yes because it's such an important point
 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.819
yes because it's such an important point
it's such an important space to be that

it's such an important space to be that

evolution also gave us a solution to

that so if you think what is the one

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840

almost everything we do in the world we

you think and what's more science have
an intention now if you see think about

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
an intention now if you see think about

which means that science is a like play

but it's play with intention and if you
 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.280
but it's play with intention and if you
add rules to play you have a game which

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
add rules to play you have a game which

right and what's true for science it

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720
right and what's true for science it
 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.179
right and what's true for science it
actually transcends science because

play with intention so this concept of

because these are different
