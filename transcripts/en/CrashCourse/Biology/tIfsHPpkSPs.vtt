00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.290
You and I both know people or
dogs that we don't consider

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.320
particularly sophisticated.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.650
We sometimes refer to them as
"simple" or "Real Housewives."

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.419
But when it comes to
truly simple animals,

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.079
we shouldn't underestimate them.

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.619
Because the animal phyla that we
describe as being the least

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.310
complex actually offer us a vivid
way of understanding how animals

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.230
are structured, and
also how they evolved.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.230
Simple doesn't always mean dumb.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.530
Unlike those dullards that
we've all met in our lives,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.949
animals aren't considered simple
because they apparently take things

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.309
for "granite" or they think
that reality TV is...reality.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.899
Their simplicity has to do
with their tissue complexity.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.719
As you know, almost all animals'
cells are organized into tissues

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.690
that perform specialized functions.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.609
The more different kinds of
specialized cells an animal has,

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.539
the more complex it is,
and this complexity is determined

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:02.780
in the embryonic phase.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.200
As embryos, most animals either
form two layers of early tissue,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.100
called germ layers,
or they form three.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.750
By exploring the very simplest
phyla, from animals with no

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.220
layers at all, aka sponges, to the
most basic of three-layer animals,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.640
like mollusks you can see how a
not-totally-amazing-sounding change

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.979
in tissue results in truly
fundamental and amazing changes.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.240
So the places in the animal family
tree where these transitions

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.670
take place, from no
layers to two layers,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.640
and from two layers to three,
are some of the most important

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.170
benchmarks in animal evolution.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.270
Let's start with the
very simplest of animals,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.950
in the phylum Porifera:
the sponges!

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.340
They diverged from protists
probably 600 million years ago and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.340
not a whole lot has changed
for them since then.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.700
If you've been paying attention,
you've noticed by now that almost

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.840
nothing that applies to other
animals applies to sponges.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.119
That's because they're
so freaking simple.

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.479
They can't move; they just hang
out and filter water for food

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.950
like bacteria, while some host
photosynthesizing microbes

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.130
and mooch off them.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.899
More important, sponge
embryos don't have any layers,

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.530
they just have cells.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.649
This means that sponges don't have
specialized tissues or organs.

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.720
And their cells can
take different forms.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.310
Some have flagella to
force water into the sponge;

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.250
some are more amoeba-like
and wander around

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.250
distributing nutrients.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.000
But these cells can transform
into whatever type of cell

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
the sponge needs.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.270
For this reason, some scientists
argue that sponges aren't even

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.270
animals at all, they're actually
colonies of cells that depend on

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.070
each other to function.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.270
But for our purposes, mainly
because they're multicellular,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.890
eukaryotic organisms that
can't make their own food,

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.470
they still count.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.220
And they've managed to
diversify into nearly

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.250
10,000 different species,
so good for them.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.980
Things get more interesting with
Cnidaria, which include jellies,

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.330
sea anemones, corals, and hydras.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.780
They got a couple of sweet evolutionary breaks
that made them animals that you do NOT want

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.380
to mess with.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.390
The first and most important
break is that they develop

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.740
two germ layers.
You'll remember these layers

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.260
are called the endoderm,
or the "inside" -derm,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.450
and the ectoderm,
the "outside" -derm,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.320
and they form a tube that
allows an animal to ingest,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.480
digest and get rid of stuff.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.190
This makes Cnidaria among the
oldest living descendants of the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.920
world's first diploblast,
which is the common ancestor

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.860
of all "true animals."

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.340
But still, jellies and anemones
and other cnidarians have only

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.790
one hole that serves
as both mouth and anus,

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.250
and they don't have any organs.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.830
So, still pretty simple.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.360
Their second evolutionary
break is in their ectoderm,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.470
which contains stinging
cells called cnidocysts.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.070
Think Portuguese Man o' War,
I once stepped on a dead one,

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.590
it was dead, LONG dead,
and I wanted someone to

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.460
cut my foot off it hurt so much.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.100
So now we've got two-layer
animals swimming around,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.220
able to move and eat and
poop and defend themselves.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.400
The animal kingdom is just one
evolutionary breakthrough away

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.340
from a huge, like,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.680
explosion!

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.360
And we can see the evidence of this
breakthrough in Platyhelminthes,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.390
the phylum of soft, unsegmented
worms that includes flatworms,

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.270
planaria, tapeworms, and flukes.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.510
Not super-handsome, but
these guys are a big deal,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.880
because they're the oldest existing
phylum that is triploblastic,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.070
or has three germ layers.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.660
So in addition to an
endoderm and ectoderm,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.160
their embryos form a mesoderm.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.780
I know it sounds like just
another piece of toast and turkey

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.930
on a club sandwich, but this
development changes everything.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.980
Platyhelminthes are
themselves pretty simple,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.760
but a couple of
phyla up the ranks,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.410
this new layer allows animals
to form true organ systems:

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.520
the ectoderm forming the brain,
nervous system and skin;

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.220
the mesoderm forming muscles,
bones, cartilage, the heart,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.590
blood and other very useful stuff;

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.870
and the endoderm forming the
digestive and respiratory systems.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.650
And this kind of complexity
is only possible because of

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.540
one of the mesoderm's
key features, the coelom,

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.840
a fluid-filled cavity that stores
and protects the major organs.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.690
It allows the internal organs to
move independent of the body wall,

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.040
and the fluid can provide
some shock resistance.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.600
Coeloms are where all the
action happens when it comes

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.280
to organ systems, but not
all triploblasts have them.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.850
From here on, we can assess
the complexity of an animal

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.730
by whether it has a coelom or not,
and if so, how complete it is.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.660
For instance, because they're
the simplest of the triploblasts,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.790
Platyhelminthes have their
mouths and buttholes on

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.630
opposite ends of their bodies,
which is awesome for them!

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.480
But they're acoelomates,
they don't have a coelom,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.980
which tells us
they're still on the

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.430
shallow end of the
pool, complexity-wise.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.820
To give you an idea of
how simple, you can cut

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.130
a Platyhelminthes in
half, and both of the

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.010
pieces will happily continue
on with their wormy business.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.910
That, my friends, is simplicity.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.610
Now, you probably haven't
forgotten that I mentioned

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.820
an explosion a minute ago.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.680
Well, I'm not going
to taunt you with

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.840
talk of explosions
without giving you one.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.620
[BIOLO-GRAPHY]

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.310
The Cambrian Explosion!

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.530
Not long after germ layers became
a thing, say 535 million years ago,

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.360
life on earth was undergoing
some pretty terrific

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.090
and rapid innovations.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.630
Over about 10 or 12
million years, about half

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.580
of the animal phyla that
exist today started to appear.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.810
It remains the most biologically
productive period in history.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.320
Think of the most exciting,
vibrant, creative,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.460
dangerous experience and then
invite all of Kingdom Animalia

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.190
to the party.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.120
Like Burning Man, ComicCon,
and Coachella all at once.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.300
This is when animals
started to look and behave

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.620
as we know them today.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.610
Before the Cambrian,
most of the big animals

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.810
were slow and soft-bodied
and ate algae or scavenged.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.750
But this explosion of
diversity brought all kinds

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.550
of new adaptations,
including predatory ones,

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.310
like claws, and defensive ones
like spikes and armored plates.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.590
Shells and mineral skeletons
made their first appearances.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.320
In fact, the adaptations were
so many and so abrupt that

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.240
in the 1800s the abundance
of fossils from this period

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.389
was used to argue
against evolution.

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:43.930
Scientists offer a lot
of different theories about

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.090
what caused this explosion.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.760
It was probably a combination
of a few of these things.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.240
For one, oxygen levels became
very high in Cambrian seas,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.300
which allowed for larger
bodies and higher metabolisms.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.400
It's also thought that
ocean chemistry changed,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.550
with more minerals becoming
available for the production

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.280
of shells and skeletons.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.430
And of course, with more
diversity comes more competition

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.930
and predation, which
drove selective pressures

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.850
on animals to become
either better at hunting

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:08.940
or better at defending themselves.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.360
It's pretty near the top of
my list of places I want to go

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.590
once I put the finishing
touches on my time machine.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.419
But for now, we still have
many modern animal phyla

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:19.430
to remind us of this
time of crazy awesomeness.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.910
So flukes are cool and
all, but things start to get

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.760
more complex with another
phylum of mostly nasty parasites,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.710
Nematoda, unsegmented roundworms.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.669
These guys are pseudocoelomates,
meaning they have

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:34.450
an incomplete body cavity.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.360
Unlike a true coelomate,
whose body cavity is

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.900
contained within the mesoderm,

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.610
pseudocoelomates
sort of improvise one

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:40.970
between the mesoderm
and the endoderm.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.110
The vast majority of
nematodes live in soil,

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.560
where they eat bacteria or
fungus or parasitize plant roots.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.430
But humans host at least
50 nematode species,

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.570
including hookworms, which burrow
into our intestines and treat us

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:53.870
like some kind of food court.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.620
But most nematodes
are very very small:

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.210
a single teaspoon of forest soil
can have several hundred in it!

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.590
Rotifera, meanwhile, are
tiny filter-feeding animals

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.169
that live mostly in fresh or
salt water, though some of them

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:05.270
can live in damp soil.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.919
They're also pseudocoelomates
like nematodes, and although

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:10.230
they are way smaller
than most flatworms,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.370
a big honkin' rotifer is
like 2 millimeters long,

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.970
they're anatomically more
complex, as they have a stomach,

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.940
jaws and a little tiny anus.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.090
My favorite fun fact about
Rotifera is that many

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:24.930
of its species are known
to exist entirely of females,

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.030
and they reproduce through
unfertilized eggs.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.250
Fossils of rotifers have been
found as old as 35 million years,

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.460
and in many cases, there's
not a dude to be found.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.190
You go girls!

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.240
Okay, so now for the big
dogs: the phylum Mollusca.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.039
Molluscs might be kind of
simple, but they're amazing

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.479
and some of them
are incredibly smart.

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:45.900
They take four
different basic forms:

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.770
chitons, snails, bivalves,
and octopi and squid.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.130
Now, I realize it can be
hard to see how an oyster

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.490
and an octopus might be
related, but molluscs have

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.640
some important similarities:

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.200
They all have a visceral
mass, which is a true coelom

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.190
a body cavity completely
within the mesoderm that

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.550
contains most of
the internal organs.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.820
They also have a big, muscular
foot which takes different

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.040
forms in each class of mollusc.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.630
They have a mantle, which
in some molluscs makes

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.800
a shell and in others
just covers the visceral mass,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.380
And finally, all molluscs
except bivalves have a radula,

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.020
or a rasping organ on their mouths
that they use to scrape up food.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.980
So, chitons, are these
headless marine animals,

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.940
covered with a plated shell
on one side, and they use

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.510
their foot to move around
on rocks, scraping off algae

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.560
with their radula.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.450
You know about bivalves.
They have shells that are

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.520
divided into two hinged
halves, like clams and scallops.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.360
They're filter feeders, so
they trap particles of food

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.270
in the mucus that
covers their gills.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.240
Snails and slugs are gastropods.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.790
One thing that sets them
apart is a process called torsion,

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.010
in which the visceral mass
twists to the side during

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.570
embryonic development, so
that by the end of it,

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.700
its anus is basically
right above it's head.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.370
Most gastropods also have
a single, spiraled shell

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:03.920
and most use their radula to
graze on algae and plants.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.480
And last, but certainly not
least, we have the cephalopods,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.700
which are the kings of the
Molluscs, as far as I'm concerned.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.830
Cephalopods include octopi
and squid, and they are obviously

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.830
a lot different from
other molluscs.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.640
For starters, they have tentacles
that they use to grab their prey,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.670
which they then bite
with their beaks

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.300
and immobilize with
poisonous saliva.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.310
And the foot of a
cephalopod has been modified

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.850
into a really powerful
muscle that shoots out water

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.850
to help it move and
steer through the water.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.310
But probably the coolest
thing about cephalopods

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.270
is how smart they are.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.230
While a typical mollusk
might have 20,000 neurons,

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.130
an octopus has
half a billion neurons.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.680
If you just do a YouTube
search for octopus,

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.390
you'll find all kinds of
videos of them opening jars

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.140
and stealing peoples'
video cameras.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.700
They're like freaking
ocean ninjas.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.570
Cephalopods got skillz.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.110
So remember, simple doesn't
equal dumb, there's a lot

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.690
to learn from our
less-developed cousins.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.200
Next time we'll talk about
even more complex animals

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.960
and what we have
to learn from them.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.490
Until then:

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.339
Thank you for watching
Crash Course Biology,

00:11:00.339 --> 00:11:02.399
If you want to review anything
that we discussed in this video

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:05.070
we've put a table of contents
over on one of my sides,

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.600
I can never remember
which one it is.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.790
I think it's THAT side,

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:08.690
yeah THAT side?

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.890
I'm getting a nod.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.420
