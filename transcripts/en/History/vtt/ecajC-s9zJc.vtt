00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:05.238
NARRATOR: In the rugged
peaks of Northern Alaska,

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:08.007
Marty Meierotto is
beating back mother nature

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.276
to reclaim a decades-old
trap line that's

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.946
been neglected for years.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:16.750
But with night coming on fast,
he's hit a road block of brush.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.855
This is a lot worse
patch than I thought.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.457
I thought I'd be
through this quick.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:27.193
NARRATOR: He's been working to
clear it for more than an hour

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.628
in temperatures of 20 below.

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:29.963
[saw buzzing]

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.197
Take off this jacket.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.367
I just do not want
to start sweating.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.669
NARRATOR: Sweating
in subzero conditions

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:39.706
can lead to hypothermia
in a matter of minutes.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.307
But he can't slow down.

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:44.377
He's got three more miles
to clear to reach shelter

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.780
or be left out in the cold.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.114
[saw buzzing]

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:53.153
Ha, my chain flew off.

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:54.487
[breathes heavily]

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:55.655
Damn it!

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.457
NARRATOR: Extreme
cold wreaks havoc

00:00:57.457 --> 00:01:00.126
on machinery, as
the blade contracts,

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:04.497
and the chain
expands from overuse.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:08.201
Have to get it really tight--

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:11.838
pretty much brand new chain.

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:14.340
They're all eating time.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.345
Daylights, it matters right
now for this kind of weather.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.213
I can't see.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.381
I can't cut.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.749
I'm not going to
cut in the dark.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.551
Good way to get hurt.

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:26.486
There we go.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:27.454
All right.

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:30.356
[saw buzzing]

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.725
Taking a lot longer
than what I had hoped.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:36.262
But I just got to
keep pushing on.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:39.599
[saw buzzing]

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.309
Ah.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.045
I just broke the chain.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.513
And I don't have another one.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:55.582
I blew it.
We are done.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:58.985
[suspenseful music]

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.965
NARRATOR: In Alaska, with his
chainsaw out of commission

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.801
and night coming on
fast, Marty works

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.703
to clear the wall of
brush with the only set

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.671
of tools he has left--

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:19.806
his hands.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.108
But I want to at
least get through today.

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.146
OK.

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:29.516
See the opening up there.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:32.352
[breathes heavily]

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.988
All right, want to keep going.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.856
[blows air]

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:40.660
A lot of this stuff,
I can drive over.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.661
All right, we're off.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.797
[motor noise]

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.435
I'll just keep pushing
on and hopefully

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:52.939
not run into too much more.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.075
If I'm lucky, so I make it
to the cabin before dark.

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:59.479
[motor noise]

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:11.624
NARRATOR: Three miles ahead,
Marty finally reaches the cabin

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:13.660
he hasn't laid eyes on
since he last trapped

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.563
this area four years ago.

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:19.899
Well, it's still standing.

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.702
Man.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.003
Bears chewed there.

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:36.549
Ah, the place is trashed.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.988
NARRATOR: While Marty was
away, the critters took over.

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:45.758
MARTY MEIEROTTO: Dang squirrels.

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:48.094
They ate my sleeping bag up.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:50.730
There's nothing in it.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.333
Look at the sleeping pad--

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:58.171
ate right through one,
two, three of them.

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:00.974
Shht.

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:06.212
Yeah, the neighbors weren't
kind to my shoes either.

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:09.649
Ha, ha, ha-- they
couldn't get those--

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:13.252
the turds-- get those good.

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:14.621
You know, the cabin's trashed.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:15.488
But I'm cleaning it up.

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:16.422
So I'm OK.

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:17.590
I'm safe.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.962
It will make a place to
sleep if nothing else.

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:24.297
It's livable.

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:25.865
I'll be able to spend the night.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:28.601
That's something.

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:33.373
Now, I just need to concentrate
on getting my line back.

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:35.908
I got to start catching fur.
