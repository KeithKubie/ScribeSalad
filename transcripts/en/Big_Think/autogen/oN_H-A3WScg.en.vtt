a few decades ago we actually saw

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:07.860
a few decades ago we actually saw
 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.710
a few decades ago we actually saw
explosions in the sky somewhere out in

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:10.720
explosions in the sky somewhere out in
 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.509
explosions in the sky somewhere out in
space that we really didn't understand

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519
space that we really didn't understand
 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:12.990
space that we really didn't understand
at all

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000
at all
 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.509
at all
they gave intense bursts of something

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519
they gave intense bursts of something
 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.759
they gave intense bursts of something
called gamma rays and gamma rays are the

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:17.769
called gamma rays and gamma rays are the
 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.409
called gamma rays and gamma rays are the
highest energy kind of light that is

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:19.419
highest energy kind of light that is
 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.390
highest energy kind of light that is
possible now you've probably heard of

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400
possible now you've probably heard of
 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.040
possible now you've probably heard of
you know ultraviolet rays from the Sun

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050
you know ultraviolet rays from the Sun
 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.720
you know ultraviolet rays from the Sun
they give you sunburn and then there are

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730
they give you sunburn and then there are
 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.880
they give you sunburn and then there are
things like x-rays gamma rays are even

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890
things like x-rays gamma rays are even
 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.309
things like x-rays gamma rays are even
more more energetic and more dangerous

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:29.319
more more energetic and more dangerous
 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:32.010
more more energetic and more dangerous
to us than that but gamma rays are only

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020
to us than that but gamma rays are only
 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.750
to us than that but gamma rays are only
created in the universe by things that

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760
created in the universe by things that
 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.460
created in the universe by things that
are naturally in the billions of degrees

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470
are naturally in the billions of degrees
 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.950
are naturally in the billions of degrees
and we saw these little gamma-ray pops

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960
and we saw these little gamma-ray pops
 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.590
and we saw these little gamma-ray pops
going off in space and at first we

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600
going off in space and at first we
 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.090
going off in space and at first we
wondered well are they are they nearby

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100
wondered well are they are they nearby
 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.380
wondered well are they are they nearby
you know could they be in our own galaxy

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390
you know could they be in our own galaxy
 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.270
you know could they be in our own galaxy
or are they very far away we really

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280
or are they very far away we really
 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.140
or are they very far away we really
didn't know and a few decades ago we

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150
didn't know and a few decades ago we
 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.000
didn't know and a few decades ago we
actually realized that these gamma-ray

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010
actually realized that these gamma-ray
 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.250
actually realized that these gamma-ray
bursts were coming from very very

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260
bursts were coming from very very
 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.560
bursts were coming from very very
distant galaxies galaxies that in most

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570
distant galaxies galaxies that in most
 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.480
distant galaxies galaxies that in most
cases were billions of light years away

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490
cases were billions of light years away
 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.730
cases were billions of light years away
and a light near is about six trillion

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740
and a light near is about six trillion
 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.560
and a light near is about six trillion
miles the distance that light travels in

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570
miles the distance that light travels in
 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.960
miles the distance that light travels in
one year so billions of light-years away

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970
one year so billions of light-years away
 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.450
one year so billions of light-years away
and so something was creating a lot of

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460
and so something was creating a lot of
 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.919
and so something was creating a lot of
gamma rays because they were bright

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:07.929
gamma rays because they were bright
 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:09.739
gamma rays because they were bright
enough to measure from that distance and

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:09.749
enough to measure from that distance and
 

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:12.149
enough to measure from that distance and
incredibly some of these explosions were

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159
incredibly some of these explosions were
 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.190
incredibly some of these explosions were
so intense there was one I believe it

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200
so intense there was one I believe it
 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.800
so intense there was one I believe it
was in 2007 but NASA observed there was

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810
was in 2007 but NASA observed there was
 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.569
was in 2007 but NASA observed there was
a little flash of visible light that

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579
a little flash of visible light that
 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.219
a little flash of visible light that
came with the gamma rays and it was

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229
came with the gamma rays and it was
 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.109
came with the gamma rays and it was
actually visible with the naked eye for

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119
actually visible with the naked eye for
 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.669
actually visible with the naked eye for
a couple of minutes if you were actually

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679
a couple of minutes if you were actually
 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.139
a couple of minutes if you were actually
in the southern hemisphere on that night

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149
in the southern hemisphere on that night
 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.849
in the southern hemisphere on that night
you would have seen a little star turn

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859
you would have seen a little star turn
 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:28.319
you would have seen a little star turn
on and off for a couple of minutes that

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329
on and off for a couple of minutes that
 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.870
on and off for a couple of minutes that
would have been gone and that explosion

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880
would have been gone and that explosion
 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.099
would have been gone and that explosion
happened about seven billion light-years

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109
happened about seven billion light-years
 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.819
happened about seven billion light-years
away something blew up seven billion

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829
away something blew up seven billion
 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:40.859
away something blew up seven billion
years ago on almost the other side of

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869
years ago on almost the other side of
 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.809
years ago on almost the other side of
the observable universe and it was

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819
the observable universe and it was
 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:43.949
the observable universe and it was
bright enough to see with the unaided

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959
bright enough to see with the unaided
 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.510
bright enough to see with the unaided
eye we had discovered something

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
eye we had discovered something
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.760
eye we had discovered something
unbelievable what could possibly be that

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770
unbelievable what could possibly be that
 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.769
unbelievable what could possibly be that
bright what could possibly be that

00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:52.779
bright what could possibly be that
 

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.800
bright what could possibly be that
violent that little explosion for a few

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810
violent that little explosion for a few
 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.330
violent that little explosion for a few
minutes out shown the rest of the

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340
minutes out shown the rest of the
 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.769
minutes out shown the rest of the
observable universe just one thing so we

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:01.779
observable universe just one thing so we
 

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:03.599
observable universe just one thing so we
really didn't know what could possibly

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609
really didn't know what could possibly
 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.359
really didn't know what could possibly
create that much energy and the the

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369
create that much energy and the the
 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.949
create that much energy and the the
theoretical physicist got to work and

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959
theoretical physicist got to work and
 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.389
theoretical physicist got to work and
they started just kind of guessing I

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399
they started just kind of guessing I
 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.310
they started just kind of guessing I
mean I mean what what could explode that

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320
mean I mean what what could explode that
 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.920
mean I mean what what could explode that
could make that much energy and it turns

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930
could make that much energy and it turns
 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.420
could make that much energy and it turns
out that if you have these these things

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430
out that if you have these these things
 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.140
out that if you have these these things
called neutron

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150
called neutron
 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.119
called neutron
stars neutron stars with the leftover

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129
stars neutron stars with the leftover
 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.220

compressed cores of dead stars

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230
compressed cores of dead stars
 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.530
compressed cores of dead stars
they are amazing monsters they're about

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540
they are amazing monsters they're about
 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.080
they are amazing monsters they're about
10 miles across and they have a density

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090
10 miles across and they have a density
 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.390
10 miles across and they have a density
that if you had about a teaspoon full of

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400
that if you had about a teaspoon full of
 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.309
that if you had about a teaspoon full of
the material that that would be about as

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319
the material that that would be about as
 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.839
the material that that would be about as
much as the mass as Mount Everest

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849
much as the mass as Mount Everest
 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.940
much as the mass as Mount Everest
crushed into a teaspoonful they're

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950
crushed into a teaspoonful they're
 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.309
crushed into a teaspoonful they're
amazing things and we observe hundreds

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319
amazing things and we observe hundreds
 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.869
amazing things and we observe hundreds
of thousands of these things in space

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879
of thousands of these things in space
 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.869
of thousands of these things in space
and so people sort of theorized that if

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879
and so people sort of theorized that if
 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.670
and so people sort of theorized that if
two of these things spiral together and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680
two of these things spiral together and
 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.229
two of these things spiral together and
collided you would actually be able to

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239
collided you would actually be able to
 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.110
collided you would actually be able to
get that much energy out it seemed

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120
get that much energy out it seemed
 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.970
get that much energy out it seemed
unlikely but you know maybe that does

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980
unlikely but you know maybe that does
 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.589
unlikely but you know maybe that does
happen sometime in the universe the two

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599
happen sometime in the universe the two
 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.750
happen sometime in the universe the two
of these things collide now Einstein

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760
of these things collide now Einstein
 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.509
of these things collide now Einstein
came up with this wonderful idea that

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519
came up with this wonderful idea that
 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.460
came up with this wonderful idea that
space and time is almost kind of like a

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470
space and time is almost kind of like a
 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.319
space and time is almost kind of like a
fabric that connects everything in the

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329
fabric that connects everything in the
 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.050
fabric that connects everything in the
universe and what gravity is is gravity

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060
universe and what gravity is is gravity
 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.940
universe and what gravity is is gravity
is kind of a pulling and stretching on

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950
is kind of a pulling and stretching on
 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.610
is kind of a pulling and stretching on
that fabric and if you have two really

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620
that fabric and if you have two really
 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.920
that fabric and if you have two really
massive things moving around each other

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930
massive things moving around each other
 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.289
massive things moving around each other
very fast before they collide say to two

neutron stars spiraling spiraling in

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239
neutron stars spiraling spiraling in
 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.660
neutron stars spiraling spiraling in
they should actually make ripples in

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670
they should actually make ripples in
 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.479
they should actually make ripples in
this fabric so as they spiral closer and

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489
this fabric so as they spiral closer and
 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.099
this fabric so as they spiral closer and
closer together they actually make

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109
closer together they actually make
 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.569
closer together they actually make
ripples that actually go out through

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579
ripples that actually go out through
 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:22.979
ripples that actually go out through
space at the speed of light and these

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989

are called gravitational waves and they

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629
are called gravitational waves and they
 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.780
are called gravitational waves and they
are very very hard to find I mean lucky

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790
are very very hard to find I mean lucky
 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.930
are very very hard to find I mean lucky
for us mass is moving around only create

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940
for us mass is moving around only create
 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.599
for us mass is moving around only create
tiny little distortions in space and

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609
tiny little distortions in space and
 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.960
tiny little distortions in space and
time the fabric of space and time itself

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970
time the fabric of space and time itself
 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.970
time the fabric of space and time itself
so what happened is if we actually

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980
so what happened is if we actually
 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.409
so what happened is if we actually
started building instruments that were

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419
started building instruments that were
 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.300
started building instruments that were
sensitive enough sensitive enough to

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310
sensitive enough sensitive enough to
 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.000
sensitive enough sensitive enough to
detect this tiny little wobble in space

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010
detect this tiny little wobble in space
 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.050
detect this tiny little wobble in space
and time itself

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060
and time itself
 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.180
and time itself
and to give you an idea about how hard

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190
and to give you an idea about how hard
 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.339
and to give you an idea about how hard
this is to detect we used an instrument

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349
this is to detect we used an instrument
 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.860
this is to detect we used an instrument
called LIGO the laser interferometric

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870
called LIGO the laser interferometric
 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.259
called LIGO the laser interferometric
gravitational wave observatory and LIGO

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269
gravitational wave observatory and LIGO
 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.780
gravitational wave observatory and LIGO
has two lasers and the lasers are about

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790
has two lasers and the lasers are about
 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.369
has two lasers and the lasers are about
two miles long and they actually at a

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379
two miles long and they actually at a
 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.009
two miles long and they actually at a
right angle so two mile long lasers

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019
right angle so two mile long lasers
 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.319
right angle so two mile long lasers
added sort of a corner shape and the

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329
added sort of a corner shape and the
 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.300
added sort of a corner shape and the
idea was that if one of these ripples in

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310
idea was that if one of these ripples in
 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.789
idea was that if one of these ripples in
space and time comes through one of the

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799
space and time comes through one of the
 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.979
space and time comes through one of the
sides of the laser in this corner

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989
sides of the laser in this corner
 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.449
sides of the laser in this corner
construction would actually be warped a

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459
construction would actually be warped a
 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.979
construction would actually be warped a
little more than the other and you'd

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989
little more than the other and you'd
 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.599
little more than the other and you'd
actually see that space and time itself

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609
actually see that space and time itself
 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.729
actually see that space and time itself
were changing a little more in one

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739
were changing a little more in one
 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.229
were changing a little more in one
direction as this ripple came through
