00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.675
There is sort of a golden rule
when it comes to founding,

00:00:04.675 --> 00:00:08.260
co-founding, partner founding companies.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.390
One, obviously is easy because all
decisions rest with one person.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.630
Two, is good and
powerful because it's a conversation.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.740
Three, is probably the limit.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.170
I don't know that I would ever get
involved in a business where there was

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.110
more than three top partners
who are making decisions.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.770
The reason for that is,
three people form a very strong axis.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.650
You have lots of strengths
on the table and

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.920
all the weaknesses
typically are covered.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.960
And you won't ever have
one person dominating,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.530
if you do then it's actually a sole
proprietor with two lackeys.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.019
So we won't get into that but
a three co-founder business I found,

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.408
in my experience to be very strong.

00:00:49.408 --> 00:00:53.010
One of the businesses I was part of,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.830
I was one of three co-founders and
we were very powerful in what were doing

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.860
because we each brought a different
skill set to the table, and a different

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.819
temperament given changing environments
and scenarios that were playing out.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:09.100
So, as those things played
out we each stepped up

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.740
in the given situation with
our skills and overcame them.
