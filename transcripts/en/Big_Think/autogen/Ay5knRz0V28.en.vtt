progress breeds the expectation of

progress breeds the expectation of
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.480
progress breeds the expectation of
further progress and it depends on the

between fundamental breakthroughs and

refinements of breakthroughs if you like

so if we look at powered flight for

so if we look at powered flight for

example it took us an awful long time to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
example it took us an awful long time to
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.630
example it took us an awful long time to
work out how to get bits of heavier than

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640

air stuff off the ground but once we've

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710
air stuff off the ground but once we've
 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.770
air stuff off the ground but once we've
done is we were able to refine that

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
done is we were able to refine that
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.110

rather rapidly you know it was a 24

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
rather rapidly you know it was a 24

years from the Wright brothers until

Lindbergh got across the Atlantic which

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239
Lindbergh got across the Atlantic which
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.040
Lindbergh got across the Atlantic which
the Wright brothers couldn't have

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
the Wright brothers couldn't have
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.780

progressions and we can see this in

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989
progressions and we can see this in
 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.810
progressions and we can see this in
computers we can see it in the combating

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820
computers we can see it in the combating
 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.750

of infectious diseases you name it so it

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
of infectious diseases you name it so it

seems to me that that was because there

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
seems to me that that was because there
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.279

was no credibility barrier people tried

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289
was no credibility barrier people tried
 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.869
was no credibility barrier people tried
because they knew that they could make a

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879
because they knew that they could make a
 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.850
because they knew that they could make a
small advance and they they just did it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860
small advance and they they just did it
 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.490
small advance and they they just did it
it's big advances that it tricky but

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
it's big advances that it tricky but
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.740
it's big advances that it tricky but
then that also works across fields if

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
then that also works across fields if
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.299
then that also works across fields if
you've made big advances in one field

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309
you've made big advances in one field
 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.039
you've made big advances in one field
you can make maybe make it another feel

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
you can make maybe make it another feel
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.299
you can make maybe make it another feel
that's what I was saying about raising

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309
that's what I was saying about raising
 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.399
that's what I was saying about raising
sites so I feel it's a psychological

thing but it's not an intractable in a
