00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
You can use these problems to go through the three steps of proving NP completeness.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.130
Stating your problem as a decision problem and then show that it is in NP,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.470
and finally, use one of these problems here or some other problem

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.850
that you know to be NP complete for a reduction.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.230
To find additional NP complete problems, you can either go to the list in Wikipedia that I showed you

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.700
or you can see if your local university has a book on NP completeness.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.670
One of the most famous ones is this one here called by most simply the Garey &amp; Johnson,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.540
but there are also other books that will give you a number of NP complete problems

00:00:36.540 --> 99:59:59.000
that you can use as a basis for a reduction.
