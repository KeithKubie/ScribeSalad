00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:02.547
- [Voiceover] So, we have a
fifth-degree polynomial here,

00:00:02.547 --> 00:00:04.869
p of x, and we're asked
to do several things.

00:00:04.869 --> 00:00:07.330
First, find the real roots.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.466
And let's sort of remind
ourselves what roots are.

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.365
So root is the same thing as a zero,

00:00:12.365 --> 00:00:15.749
and they're the x-values
that make the polynomial

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.415
equal to zero.

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:19.679
So the real roots are the x-values

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.793
where p of x is equal to zero.

00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:24.976
So, the x-values that satisfy this

00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:27.785
are going to be the roots, or the zeros,

00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:29.015
and we want the real ones.

00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:31.325
As you'll learn in the future,
there's also going to be

00:00:31.325 --> 00:00:34.240
imaginary roots, or
zeros, or there might be.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.014
Then we want to think
about how many times,

00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:39.881
how many times we intercept the x-axis.

00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:43.319
Well as we'll see, however
many real roots we have

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:46.767
that's how many times we
are going to intercept...

00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:48.802
However many unique real roots we have,

00:00:48.802 --> 00:00:50.195
that's however many times we're going to

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:51.475
intercept the x-axis.

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:53.063
How do I know that?

00:00:53.063 --> 00:00:54.578
Well, let's just think about

00:00:54.578 --> 00:00:57.103
an arbitrary polynomial here.

00:00:57.103 --> 00:00:59.436
So those are my axes.

00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:03.813
This is the x-axis, that's my y-axis.

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:07.458
And let me just graph an
arbitrary polynomial here.

00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:09.257
So, let's say it looks like that.

00:01:09.257 --> 00:01:11.370
Well, what's going on right over here.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.155
At this x-value, we see, based
on the graph of the function,

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:17.894
that p of x is going to be equal to zero.

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:19.369
So that's going to be a root.

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.157
This is also going to be a root,

00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:23.785
because at this x-value, the
function is equal to zero.

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:25.777
At this x-value the
function's equal to zero.

00:01:25.777 --> 00:01:27.750
At this x-value the
function is equal zero.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.815
If we're on the x-axis
then the y-value is zero.

00:01:30.815 --> 00:01:32.615
So the function is going
to be equal to zero.

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:35.587
This is a graph of y is equal,

00:01:35.587 --> 00:01:36.829
y is equal to p of x.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.081
Not necessarily this p of x,

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:40.593
but I'm just drawing
some arbitrary p of x.

00:01:40.593 --> 00:01:42.671
So there's some x-value
that makes the function

00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:43.936
equal to zero.

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:45.016
Well, that's going to be a point

00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:47.477
at which we are intercepting the x-axis.

00:01:47.477 --> 00:01:48.336
So we want to know how many times

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:49.810
we are intercepting the x-axis.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.273
As we'll see, it's
gonna be the same number

00:01:51.273 --> 00:01:54.593
of real roots, or the same
number of real zeros we have.

00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:56.502
And then they want us to
figure out the smallest

00:01:56.502 --> 00:01:59.928
of those x-intercepts,
and we'll figure it out

00:01:59.928 --> 00:02:03.729
for this particular polynomial.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.272
So, let me give myself
a little bit more space.

00:02:06.272 --> 00:02:07.549
So, let's get to it.

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.239
So we really want to solve
p of x is equal to zero.

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.723
So we really want to set,
that right over there,

00:02:14.723 --> 00:02:18.027
equal to zero, and solve this.

00:02:18.027 --> 00:02:20.969
So we want to solve this equation.

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.640
The x-values that make this equal to zero,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.627
if I input them into the function

00:02:23.627 --> 00:02:25.949
I'm gonna get the function equaling zero.

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:26.889
All right.

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:28.433
So the first thing that
might jump out at you

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:31.243
is that all of these
terms are divisible by x.

00:02:31.243 --> 00:02:33.623
So I like to factor that
out from the get-go.

00:02:33.623 --> 00:02:37.010
So, we can rewrite this as x times

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.051
x to the fourth power

00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:43.189
plus nine x-squared

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.731
minus two x-squared

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:48.691
minus 18 is equal to zero.

00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:49.527
Now there's something else

00:02:49.527 --> 00:02:51.106
that might have jumped out at you.

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:52.406
It actually just jumped out of me

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:53.289
as I was writing this down is

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.924
that we have two third-degree terms.

00:02:55.924 --> 00:02:57.027
After we've factored out an x,

00:02:57.027 --> 00:02:58.861
we have two second-degree terms.

00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:01.426
Now, it might be tempting to
just add these two together,

00:03:01.426 --> 00:03:03.518
and actually that it would be
a completely legitimate way

00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:07.219
of trying to factor this so
that we can solve this equation.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.588
But instead of doing it that way,

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:10.625
we might take this as a clue

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:13.790
that maybe we can factor by grouping.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.926
Remember, factor by grouping, you split up

00:03:15.926 --> 00:03:18.352
that middle degree term
and see if you can reverse

00:03:18.352 --> 00:03:20.326
the distributive property twice.

00:03:20.326 --> 00:03:21.847
So, let's see if we can do that.

00:03:21.847 --> 00:03:25.100
Can we group together
these first two terms

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.930
and factor something interesting out?

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.529
And group together these second two terms

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:32.806
and factor something interesting out?

00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:34.605
And then maybe we can factor
something out after that.

00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:35.986
What am I talking about?

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:40.050
Well, this is going to be
the same thing as x times...

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.708
Well, this one, actually let
me write a big parenthesis,

00:03:42.708 --> 00:03:46.829
here, this one right over
here is the same thing as...

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.710
I can factor out an x-squared.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.426
So, it's gonna be x-squared plus...

00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:54.356
Sorry.

00:03:54.356 --> 00:03:56.569
It's gonna be x-squared, if
I factor out an x-squared,

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.231
I'm gonna get an x-squared plus nine.

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:03.268
And then over here, if I factor out

00:04:03.268 --> 00:04:05.740
a, let's see, negative two.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.901
I don't want to...

00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:09.308
If I factor out a, yep, negative two,

00:04:09.308 --> 00:04:12.753
I'm gonna get, so minus two times...

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:16.966
I'm gonna get an x-squared
plus nine, again.

00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:18.464
Now this is interesting,
because this is telling us

00:04:18.464 --> 00:04:23.084
maybe we can factor out
an x-squared plus nine.

00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:26.950
So, let me factor out
an x-squared plus nine

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.966
from each of these terms,
and I'm going to get,

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:32.487
I am going to get x...

00:04:32.487 --> 00:04:34.798
I'll leave these big green
parentheses here for now,

00:04:34.798 --> 00:04:37.108
If we factor out an x-squared plus nine,

00:04:37.108 --> 00:04:41.559
it's going to be x-squared plus nine

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.746
times x-squared,

00:04:47.126 --> 00:04:49.551
x-squared minus two.

00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:52.490
X-squared minus two,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.729
and I gave myself a
little bit too much space.

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.934
So, let me delete that.

00:04:57.934 --> 00:05:01.150
So let me delete that right over there

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.679
and then close the parentheses.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:08.846
Then close the parentheses.

00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:11.900
Actually, I can even get rid
of those green parentheses now,

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.464
if I want to, optimally, make
this a little bit simpler.

00:05:15.464 --> 00:05:17.167
So far we've been able to factor it as

00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:19.605
x times x-squared plus nine
times x-squared minus two.

00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:20.975
And the whole point
that I'm factoring this

00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:23.111
is if I can find the product of a bunch

00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:24.435
of expressions equaling zero,

00:05:24.435 --> 00:05:26.524
then I can say, "Well, the
product of those expressions

00:05:26.524 --> 00:05:28.370
"are going to be zero if one
or more of those expressions

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.005
"are equal to zero",
and I can solve for x.

00:05:31.005 --> 00:05:31.934
Well, let's see.

00:05:31.934 --> 00:05:33.547
This one's completely factored.

00:05:33.547 --> 00:05:35.510
This one is completely
factored if we're thinking

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.866
about real roots.

00:05:37.866 --> 00:05:40.153
This one, you can view it
as a difference of squares

00:05:40.153 --> 00:05:43.949
if you view two as a
square root of two-squared.

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.573
So, we can rewrite this as,

00:05:46.573 --> 00:05:48.256
and of course all of
this is equal to zero.

00:05:48.256 --> 00:05:50.926
Let me just write equals.

00:05:50.926 --> 00:05:54.552
So we could write this as equal to x times

00:05:55.078 --> 00:05:57.381
times x-squared

00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:00.361
plus nine times...

00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:02.849
Let's see, I can factor this business

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.074
into x plus the square root of two

00:06:07.074 --> 00:06:09.303
times x minus the square root of two.

00:06:09.303 --> 00:06:11.454
I'm just recognizing this
as a difference of squares.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.582
And, once again, we just
want to solve this whole,

00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:16.373
all of this business, equaling zero.

00:06:16.373 --> 00:06:18.405
All of this equaling zero.

00:06:18.405 --> 00:06:19.531
So how can this equal to zero?

00:06:19.531 --> 00:06:21.028
Well any one of these expressions,

00:06:21.028 --> 00:06:23.571
if I take the product, and if
any one of them equals zero

00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:24.825
then I'm gonna get zero.

00:06:24.825 --> 00:06:27.188
So, x could be equal to zero.

00:06:28.168 --> 00:06:29.271
X could be equal to zero,

00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:31.210
and that actually gives us a root.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.531
When x is equal to zero, this
polynomial is equal to zero,

00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:35.667
and that's pretty easy to verify.

00:06:35.667 --> 00:06:38.550
Let's see, can x-squared
plus nine equal zero?

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.122
X-squared plus nine equal zero.

00:06:42.122 --> 00:06:43.585
Well, if you subtract
nine from both sides,

00:06:43.585 --> 00:06:45.407
you get x-squared is
equal to negative nine.

00:06:45.407 --> 00:06:48.066
And that's why I said, there's
no real solution to this.

00:06:48.066 --> 00:06:50.078
So, no real, let me write that,

00:06:50.078 --> 00:06:53.458
no real solution.

00:06:54.168 --> 00:06:57.925
There are some imaginary
solutions, but no real solutions.

00:06:57.925 --> 00:07:02.106
Now, can x plus the square
root of two equal zero?

00:07:02.106 --> 00:07:05.166
X plus the square root of two equal zero.

00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:07.348
Sure, if we subtract square
root of two from both sides,

00:07:07.348 --> 00:07:10.924
you get x is equal to the
negative square root of two.

00:07:10.924 --> 00:07:14.917
And can x minus the square
root of two equal zero?

00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:17.170
Sure, you add square root
of two to both sides,

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.128
you get x is equal to
the square root of two.

00:07:21.128 --> 00:07:22.092
So, there we have it.

00:07:22.092 --> 00:07:24.448
We have figured out our zeros.

00:07:24.448 --> 00:07:26.027
X could be equal to zero.

00:07:26.027 --> 00:07:28.047
P of zero is zero.

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:31.008
P of negative square root of two is zero,

00:07:31.008 --> 00:07:33.503
and p of square root of
two is equal to zero.

00:07:33.503 --> 00:07:35.221
So, those are our zeros.

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:38.368
Their zeros are at zero,
negative squares of two,

00:07:38.368 --> 00:07:40.504
and positive squares of two.

00:07:40.504 --> 00:07:42.431
And so those are going
to be the three times

00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:44.904
that we intercept the x-axis.

00:07:44.904 --> 00:07:47.005
And what is the smallest
of those intercepts?

00:07:47.005 --> 00:07:48.421
Well, the smallest number here

00:07:48.421 --> 00:07:50.429
is negative square root,

00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:53.149
negative square root of two.

00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:54.771
And you could tackle it the other way.

00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:58.081
You could take this part right over...

00:07:58.081 --> 00:07:58.738
Which part?

00:07:58.738 --> 00:07:59.920
Yeah, this part right over here

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.062
and you could add those two middle terms,

00:08:02.062 --> 00:08:05.126
and then factor in a non-grouping way,

00:08:05.126 --> 00:08:07.170
and I encourage you to do that.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.864
But just to see that this makes sense

00:08:08.864 --> 00:08:11.453
that zeros really are the x-intercepts.

00:08:11.453 --> 00:08:16.313
I went to Wolfram|Alpha and
I graphed this polynomial

00:08:16.313 --> 00:08:19.357
and this is what I got.

00:08:19.357 --> 00:08:23.481
So, this is what I got, right over here.

00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:25.591
If you see a fifth-degree polynomial,

00:08:25.591 --> 00:08:29.120
say, it'll have as many
as five real zeros.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.316
But, if it has some imaginary zeros,

00:08:30.316 --> 00:08:32.197
it won't have five real zeros.

00:08:32.197 --> 00:08:34.194
Instead, this one has three.

00:08:34.194 --> 00:08:35.854
And that's because the imaginary zeros,

00:08:35.854 --> 00:08:37.549
which we'll talk more about in the future,

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.638
they come in these conjugate pairs.

00:08:39.638 --> 00:08:42.192
So, if you don't have five real roots,

00:08:42.192 --> 00:08:44.366
the next possibility is
that you're going to have

00:08:44.366 --> 00:08:45.234
three real roots.

00:08:45.234 --> 00:08:46.557
And, if you don't have three real roots,

00:08:46.557 --> 00:08:48.811
the next possibility is you're
gonna have one real root.

00:08:48.811 --> 00:08:50.818
So, that's an interesting
thing to think about.

00:08:50.818 --> 00:08:54.978
And so, here you see,
your three real roots.

00:08:55.438 --> 00:08:57.412
You see your three real roots

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:59.791
which correspond to the x-values

00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:02.589
at which the function is equal to zero,

00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:07.431
which is where we have our x-intercepts.
