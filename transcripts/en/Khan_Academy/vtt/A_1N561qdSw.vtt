00:00:00.896 --> 00:00:02.905
- [Voiceover] In the last
video on step response,

00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:04.911
we set up the differential equation

00:00:04.911 --> 00:00:07.711
that describes our
circuit, and we found that

00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:09.460
it was a non-homogeneous equation,

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.737
and now we're gonna follow through

00:00:10.737 --> 00:00:13.281
on the strategy of solving it with a

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:16.614
forced response plus a natural response.

00:00:17.502 --> 00:00:19.500
So here's two copies of our circuit,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.430
and we're gonna, on the top one here,

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.358
we're gonna solve for
the natural response,

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.519
and on the bottom one, we'll use that one

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.519
for the forced response.

00:00:31.286 --> 00:00:33.406
Alright, let's go to work on the natural.

00:00:33.406 --> 00:00:35.376
Now, to do a natural response,

00:00:35.376 --> 00:00:38.802
what we do is we set
the initial conditions

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:41.498
to whatever they were
for the original circuit,

00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:43.525
so that involves some q

00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:47.325
and a v zero, a v naught on the capacitor.

00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:49.915
So let's just draw in
quick, let's draw in our q.

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:54.239
There's some q here, that'll
be a plus or minus v naught

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.771
on the capacitor.

00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:59.050
Now the other thing we
do, is for the inputs,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.802
we set the inputs to zero
to do the natural response.

00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:04.821
And how you do that,

00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:06.850
our input here is a voltage source,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.595
and we're gonna suppress
the voltage source,

00:01:08.595 --> 00:01:10.833
that's how we do it with super position.

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:12.356
When you suppress a voltage source,

00:01:12.356 --> 00:01:14.516
what you do is you set
the voltage to zero.

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:17.240
And that means that's the same as creating

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.780
a short circuit for this.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.686
So, for the natural response

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:22.886
we're gonna take out

00:01:22.886 --> 00:01:24.569
our voltage source

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.486
and replace it with a
short circuit, like this.

00:01:31.034 --> 00:01:33.940
So, this circuit now is identical

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.155
to the circuit that we used
for the natural response.

00:01:37.155 --> 00:01:39.383
So, if you haven't seen that video

00:01:39.383 --> 00:01:41.521
on how to solve for the natural response,

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:44.097
this would be a good
time to go look at that.

00:01:44.097 --> 00:01:45.528
What I'm gonna do now is just write down

00:01:45.528 --> 00:01:49.061
the answer from that, this
will be plus or minus,

00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:51.228
we'll call this v natural,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.188
and that equals

00:01:55.188 --> 00:01:56.355
some k natural

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.733
times e to the minus t

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:01.627
over

00:02:01.627 --> 00:02:02.460
r c.

00:02:04.183 --> 00:02:07.793
This is the natural
response of an r c circuit,

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:12.020
so I'll put a square around
that so we can remember it.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.833
And I've left the constant in here,

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:18.677
and we'll work out what this
constant is a little bit later.

00:02:18.677 --> 00:02:20.190
Okay, so now let's move on

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.672
and do the forced
response for this circuit.

00:02:22.672 --> 00:02:24.681
And for the forced response,

00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:28.848
we remember the initial
conditions are set to zero.

00:02:30.507 --> 00:02:33.474
So that means that q equals zero here,

00:02:33.474 --> 00:02:35.285
and that means that

00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:36.118
initial v

00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:38.112
is zero.

00:02:38.112 --> 00:02:40.112
I'll just write in zero.

00:02:42.817 --> 00:02:44.268
So that's what it means to set

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:46.196
the initial conditions to zero.

00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:47.363
And the inputs

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.929
are equal to,

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:52.220
we use to inputs this time,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.387
the input is equal to v s.

00:02:55.498 --> 00:02:58.433
And in particular, the
input is equal to v s,

00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:00.512
we're gonna solve the forced response

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:03.755
after time is equal to
zero, so that means that

00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:04.755
the input is

00:03:05.613 --> 00:03:06.793
v s,

00:03:06.793 --> 00:03:07.793
capital v s.

00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:11.220
And as a reminder, what
we're trying to solve here

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.459
is the differential equation
from the previous screen,

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.967
and that is

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:17.824
c

00:03:17.824 --> 00:03:18.657
times d v

00:03:19.801 --> 00:03:20.634
d t,

00:03:21.471 --> 00:03:23.638
I'll put a forced in here,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.823
plus one over r,

00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:28.855
times v forced

00:03:29.797 --> 00:03:31.214
equals one over r

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.573
times v

00:03:33.573 --> 00:03:35.197
s,

00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:37.024
and I can plug in capital v s here

00:03:37.024 --> 00:03:38.109
because we're trying to solve this

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.101
for this initial condition.

00:03:41.101 --> 00:03:43.448
So this is our differential equation

00:03:43.448 --> 00:03:45.228
for the forced response,

00:03:45.228 --> 00:03:47.354
and we're gonna take a strategy here

00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:49.395
that's like we did with
the natural response,

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:52.660
is we're gonna guess at an answer for v f,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.230
and then plug it into this
differential equation,

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.692
this non-homogeneous
differential equation,

00:03:57.692 --> 00:04:00.497
and we're gonna see if it works.

00:04:00.497 --> 00:04:02.734
And a good guess here
is to guess something

00:04:02.734 --> 00:04:04.901
that looks like the input.

00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:08.337
So a good guess is gonna be some function

00:04:08.337 --> 00:04:10.004
that looks like v s.

00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:13.813
And v s looks like what?

00:04:13.813 --> 00:04:17.040
V s looks like, over here,
v s looks like a constant.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.601
So we're gonna make a guess here that

00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:23.351
the forced response
looks like some constant,

00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:26.104
we'll call that k f.

00:04:27.985 --> 00:04:31.056
The way we test our guess is
to plug it back into here.

00:04:31.056 --> 00:04:33.859
Plug it back into the
differential equation.

00:04:33.859 --> 00:04:35.595
So I'm gonna do that, alright so we get

00:04:35.595 --> 00:04:36.428
c times

00:04:38.574 --> 00:04:41.117
the derivative of k f,

00:04:41.117 --> 00:04:42.867
with respect to time,

00:04:43.953 --> 00:04:45.286
plus one over r,

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:47.986
k sub f,

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.321
equals

00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:51.154
one over r

00:04:52.365 --> 00:04:53.198
times v s.

00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:59.798
Alright, now here's the interesting
thing that happens next.

00:05:01.081 --> 00:05:04.401
What's the derivative of a
constant with respect to time?

00:05:04.401 --> 00:05:05.234
That's

00:05:07.898 --> 00:05:08.951
That goes to zero.

00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:11.821
So this first leading term here
of our differential equation

00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:12.904
goes to zero,

00:05:14.116 --> 00:05:15.538
and now I'm left with

00:05:15.538 --> 00:05:17.205
k f times one over r

00:05:18.144 --> 00:05:21.105
equals v s times one over r.

00:05:21.105 --> 00:05:24.224
So that makes k f equal to v s.

00:05:24.224 --> 00:05:26.104
So I'll tuck this in here,

00:05:26.104 --> 00:05:27.771
our forced response,

00:05:28.998 --> 00:05:30.079
v f

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:30.912
equals

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:32.782
v s.

00:05:39.108 --> 00:05:40.525
So now I have our

00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:44.309
natural response right here,

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:46.310
and in this square we
have our forced response,

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.893
the forced response is
just a constant v s.

00:05:53.294 --> 00:05:56.015
So now we're ready to come
up with our total response,

00:05:56.015 --> 00:05:58.688
and we'll call that v capital t,

00:05:58.688 --> 00:06:02.701
the total response is equal
to the natural response

00:06:02.701 --> 00:06:03.534
plus

00:06:04.803 --> 00:06:06.332
the forced response.

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:10.260
So now we're using our
principal of super position.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.093
Okay, v t

00:06:12.157 --> 00:06:13.310
equals

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.143
k

00:06:15.052 --> 00:06:16.438
some constant times e

00:06:16.438 --> 00:06:18.012
to the minus t

00:06:18.012 --> 00:06:18.845
over r c.

00:06:19.696 --> 00:06:22.241
And let's add the forced response,

00:06:22.241 --> 00:06:24.195
and the forced response is right here,

00:06:24.195 --> 00:06:25.028
it's v s,

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:28.775
and we're getting close,

00:06:28.775 --> 00:06:32.541
the only thing we have left is
to figure out this value now,

00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:34.535
we have to figure out the gain factor

00:06:34.535 --> 00:06:38.286
in front of the exponential
term of the natural response.

00:06:38.286 --> 00:06:39.806
Now the way we go after that,

00:06:39.806 --> 00:06:42.200
is we would know this
if we knew what v s is,

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.054
and we do, it's called v s.

00:06:44.054 --> 00:06:46.387
If we knew v t at some time,

00:06:47.596 --> 00:06:49.243
we could plug in two values here.

00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:51.245
We could plug in a v t and a t,

00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:55.185
and one of the most
convenient times to know this,

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:57.352
if we set t equal to zero,

00:06:59.867 --> 00:07:04.314
and we know that the total
at time equals zero is what?

00:07:04.314 --> 00:07:06.684
It's basically, let me roll
it up here a little bit,

00:07:06.684 --> 00:07:09.555
let's go backwards a little bit.

00:07:09.555 --> 00:07:11.572
Let me go back here and
use this diagram again,

00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:13.830
this was the forced response,

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.184
so we're not gonna use that right now.

00:07:16.184 --> 00:07:19.079
We're gonna use, this
is now the total circuit

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:21.731
all assembled together,
and we have to figure out

00:07:21.731 --> 00:07:23.879
what is the actual initial charge on here,

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:27.055
and if we recall, the
initial charge on here

00:07:27.055 --> 00:07:28.066
was v

00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:29.211
naught,

00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:31.894
it was this value here,

00:07:31.894 --> 00:07:33.809
just before time equals zero,

00:07:33.809 --> 00:07:36.573
this was the value of the
voltage on that capacitor.

00:07:36.573 --> 00:07:40.466
So I can fill that in here, v naught.

00:07:40.466 --> 00:07:43.635
Alright, let's go back
to our total solution

00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:45.108
and plug in these two values,

00:07:45.108 --> 00:07:47.988
time is zero and v t equals v naught.

00:07:47.988 --> 00:07:49.488
So that looks like

00:07:50.572 --> 00:07:52.147
v naught

00:07:52.147 --> 00:07:52.980
equals

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.840
natural constant times e to the minus zero

00:08:00.091 --> 00:08:00.924
over r c

00:08:02.103 --> 00:08:02.936
plus v s.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.224
And let's solve for k n

00:08:07.224 --> 00:08:08.057
k n

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:10.564
equals,

00:08:10.564 --> 00:08:12.731
this term is e to the zero

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:14.451
is one,

00:08:15.448 --> 00:08:17.389
so this term goes to one,

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:20.139
that says that it's k n plus v s,

00:08:21.514 --> 00:08:22.728
is this side,

00:08:22.728 --> 00:08:25.029
and I can write down here

00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.862
v naught

00:08:27.395 --> 00:08:28.660
minus

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.493
v s.

00:08:30.852 --> 00:08:33.578
So now I've solved for k,

00:08:33.578 --> 00:08:35.073
and we can finish our total response,

00:08:35.073 --> 00:08:38.997
we can say the total
response is v t equals

00:08:38.997 --> 00:08:40.646
k sub n,

00:08:40.646 --> 00:08:42.979
which is v naught minus v s,

00:08:45.285 --> 00:08:47.340
e to the minus t

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.173
over r c

00:08:50.262 --> 00:08:51.095
and

00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:51.928
plus v s.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.120
And that is the total response

00:09:02.457 --> 00:09:03.935
of our circuit,

00:09:03.935 --> 00:09:05.120
and we saw that in two steps,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.047
first we did the natural
and then we did the forced

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:12.219
and we added them together and
worked out the last constant,

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:16.386
whatever the constant was,
and there's our answer.

00:09:17.899 --> 00:09:20.698
So in the next video we'll
do an explicit example

00:09:20.698 --> 00:09:23.142
with values for r and c in the step

00:09:23.142 --> 00:09:26.470
and we'll see what it actually looks like.
