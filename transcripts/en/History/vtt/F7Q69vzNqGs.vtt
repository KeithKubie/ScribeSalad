00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.830
DANNY: An old Mercedes
there to the right.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.120
You know I love those.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.500
I got one-- don't
need another one.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.960
RYAN: Corvair wagon.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.170
DANNY: We are not
doing a Corvair wagon.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.040
I don't care.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.290
RYAN: What's this on the left?

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.120
Chevy--

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.330
DANNY: '53, '54?

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.830
RYAN: Yeah.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.380
DANNY: You got to take
four inches off the front,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.170
and six inches off the back.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.250
RYAN: Yeah, that is
gonna be a lot of money.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.210
DANNY: Right.
- OK.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.830
Dude, I'm sorry.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.000
It's a Checker.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.750
RYAN: Get out of here.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.920
DANNY: It's a wagon.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.080
RYAN: It's a limo!
DANNY: It's a--

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.210
[laughs]

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.080
I'm not buying this.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.420
I just have to know
the story on this one.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.250
I just-- I can't resist.
I just gotta know.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.080
NANCY: Hello?
- Hey, how you doing?

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.750
We're car guys.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.170
We caught a glimpse of this
very interesting vehicle

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.670
as we were driving
by and just wanted

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.250
to get the story on that thing.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.620
NANCY: Actually, my husband
should be home in, like,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.040
hopefully any minute now.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.380
DANNY: Oh, OK.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.960
NANCY: Oh, there's my husband.
I'm Nancy.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.880
DANNY: Welcome home!

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.960
- I'm Ryan.
- Ryan?

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.960
Nice to meet you.
- I'm Danny.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.790
Danny, nice to meet you.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.580
- You are?
- Phil.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.080
Phil.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.120
I hope you don't mind us
bugging you for a minute.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.710
But we were driving by, and
we gotta know the story.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.080
Do you have a few minutes?
Do you mind?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.580
PHIL: Absolutely.
DANNY: It's cool, man.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.460
The iconic Checker
taxi cabs could

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.460
be seen rolling
American city streets

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.290
for much of the 20th century.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.750
The company was founded in
1921 when Morris Markin, who

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.960
had been running cabs in an
auto body shop in Chicago,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.960
loaned $15,000 to a friend with
a car manufacturing business.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.790
Markin eventually absorbed
his friend's company,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.500
and Checker Cab
Manufacturing was born.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.000
While for much of their
history this Kalamazoo based

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.460
manufacturer produced only
commercial taxis and airport

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.330
shuttles like this
one, in the late 1950s,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.580
they introduced two
passenger cars--

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.170
the Superba and the
Marathon-- both of which

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.830
continued production
up until the company

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.420
stopped all production in 1982.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.330
First off, what year is it?
PHIL: '69.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.500
OK.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.250
And it is a Checker?
- Absolutely.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.170
And why, and when, and what
did they do all of this to it?

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.000
Well, my dad was Air Force.
DANNY: Military man?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.500
PHIL: Yes.
So we traveled a lot.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.920
DANNY: Well, God bless
him for his service.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.920
So we travelled
cross country, had

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.670
six children in
the family, so he

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.790
needed a car to hold them all.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.290
- Your dad bought this--
- Yeah.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.880
--brand new?

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.210
Flew to Kalamazoo, drove
it off the assembly line.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.880
- No way.
- So this was the family ride?

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.210
So this was the
private, family car?

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.500
PHIL: Absolutely.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.120
When was the last
time this car ran?

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.330
The last on the road
was probably 30 years ago.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.710
DANNY: 30 years she's
been sitting there?

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.460
PHIL: Yeah.
DANNY: Wow.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.880
My understanding is
everything was stock

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.460
except the fact that
he put the brakes

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.120
from the [inaudible] on it.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.460
DANNY: Do you mind if
I just take a peek?

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.170
PHIL: No, not at all.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.790
Did you see how big the back
door is from the front door?

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.120
The front door is
still kind of small,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.880
and all the back
doors-- oh, wow.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.290
PHIL: We used to--
when we travelled,

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.120
we'd sit on the floor
and color on the seat.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.120
RYAN: Look how
much room there is.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.290
It's huge.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.500
PHIL: And when we
did field trips

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.790
when I was in,
like, second grade,

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.380
they'd say, how many
kids can you take?

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.380
My mom would send a note,
yeah, we can take, like, 18.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.040
[laughs]

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.210
DANNY: Is there an
engine in there?

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.420
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.250
Can we take a peek?
PHIL: Please.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.880
Yeah.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.330
Wow.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
RYAN: Plain Jane 351.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.540
Oh, it's a Target Master.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.540
It's a replace--
it's a replacement.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.250
Yeah.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.210
Yeah.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.170
I would be curious as
to what-- what would

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.540
it take to buy this car?

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.830
I am-- I'm just curious.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.670
Five to eight years
ago, maybe, I was

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.420
talking to a guy in California.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.170
And he said, probably, he could
find a buyer for about $5,000

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.580
as it is.
DANNY: As is?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.580
Yeah.
- As it is.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.420
DANNY: Gotcha.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.830
This thing is cool.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.580
This thing is cool.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.250
You rock.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.420
Appreciate it.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.830
We'll talk to you
again, I'm sure.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.710
All right, take care.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.710
DANNY: You rock, bro.
