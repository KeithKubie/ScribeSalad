00:00:02.102 --> 00:00:04.605
I EXPLAINED TO BRUCE THAT
WE NEEDED TO CONVINCE CUSTOMERS

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:07.040
THEY SOMEHOW CONTRACTED
A DISEASE THEY'RE LIKELY

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:08.408
TO DIE FROM.

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:11.044
BRUCE RELUCTANTLY AGREED
TO LET ME TRY IT OUT FOR A DAY.

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:13.981
AND AFTER A WEEK OF PREPARATION,
MY ACTORS WERE READY.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.550
IT WAS TIME FOR PEOPLE TO ENTER
THE WORLD'S SCARIEST

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.285
HAUNTED HOUSE.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.320
WELL, THANKS FOR COMING
TO THE REIGN OF TERROR.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:21.922
- OH, WE'RE EXCITED, MAN.
- YOU'RE EXCITED?

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.056
- YEAH, MAN.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.591
- I HAVE TO WARN YOU
BEFORE YOU GO IN.

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:25.726
- OH, DANG.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.128
- THIS HAUNTED HOUSE
IS EXTREMELY SCARY.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.630
- I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.
- ARE YOU SURE?

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:30.764
- YEAH.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:31.765
- ALL RIGHT, WELCOME
TO THE REIGN OF TERROR.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:34.067
- YOU FIRST.

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.669
[air hissing]
[shrieks]

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:36.670
- OOH...

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.706
- MOMMY.
- HELLS....

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.941
- YOU'RE MY MOMMY.
- [screams]

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.242
[both laugh]

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:44.411
[chainsaw buzzing]
- [screams]

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:45.579
- [growls]
- AAH!

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:46.813
- [roars]

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:48.182
- [evil laugh]

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:49.416
- [laughs]

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.552
- SORRY, ONE SEC.
WHAT? WHO?

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:53.353
WHO? HER?
- YEAH.

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:54.721
- SORRY, CAN YOU
COME WITH ME FOR A SEC?

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.356
SORRY, GUYS.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.559
WERE YOU GUYS SCARED IN THERE?
- YEAH.

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:00.494
- SO SORRY, DID SHE
TOUCH YOU BY ANY CHANCE?

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:01.695
OR WAS THERE A--

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.064
- UM, I THINK SHE PROBABLY
TOUCHED MY NECK.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.065
- MOMMY!
- [screams]

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.134
[slow-motion laughter]

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:08.435
- LIKE, I USUALLY
WEAR MY GLASSES

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:09.770
AND THIS TIME I DIDN'T,
AND I OVERSHOT THE GRAB

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.405
AND I WAS SUPPOSED
TO NOT TOUCH YOU.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:12.472
- WAIT, SORRY, JUST--
- SORRY.

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:13.473
- CAN YOU GUYS
WAIT IN HERE ONE SEC?

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:14.975
- YEAH.
- SORRY, ONE SECOND.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.643
- WHAT IS IT CALLED?
- IT'S CALLED KLEIN'S DISEASE.

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:17.878
AND IT'S AN IMMUNITY--
- KLEIN DISEASE?

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.279
- KLEIN'S DISEASE.
- SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:22.115
- SHE HAS AN AUTO-IMMUNE THING.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.550
SHE WORRIED WHEN
SHE TOUCHED YOU,

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:24.551
SHE TRANSMITTED
SOMETHING TO YOU.

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:25.752
- MM-HM.

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:26.887
- SO DON'T GET FREAKED OUT
OR ANYTHING,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.088
BUT I CALLED AN AMBULANCE.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.389
PARAMEDICS ARE JUST
COMING TO MAKE SURE.

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:31.325
THEY'LL LOOK AT YOU,
IT'S JUST PRECAUTIONARY.

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:32.960
SO JUST HOLD TIGHT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.261
- NO PROBLEM.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.996
- I HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD TIME
IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.599
SORRY ABOUT THIS.
- IT'S ALL GOOD.

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:01.421
- HEY, GUYS.
- HEY.

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:02.756
- UH, JUST IN HERE.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.191
- DO YOU HAVE ANY CUTS
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:06.894
- I DON'T THINK SO.
I DON'T LOOK BACK THERE A LOT.

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:08.095
[laughter]

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.963
- OKAY, DO YOU MIND
IF I JUST--

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:12.633
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY
GET HER CHECKED OUT, IF THAT'S--

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.635
- YEAH.
- "CHECKED OUT" IN WHAT WAY?

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:16.637
- LIKE, AT A HOSPITAL
WITH A DOCTOR FOR SURE,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.439
FOR KLEIN'S.

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.175
[sirens wailing]

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:23.510
- TO MY KNOWLEDGE, IT'S
A DISEASE THAT'S PRETTY SERIOUS.

00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:25.712
BASICALLY, IF YOU'VE GOT A CUT,
AND YOU'RE TOUCHED,

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:28.448
AND YOU HAVE ANY SORT
OF OPEN WOUND OR ANYTHING THAT,

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:30.784
YOU KNOW, TOUCHED AN ORIFICE--
YOUR EYE, YOUR MOUTH,

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.286
OR ANYTHING THAT'S OPEN
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.420
- JEEZ.
- YEAH.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:34.621
IT CAN BE CONTRACTED, SO--

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:36.890
- IS THIS, LIKE, AIDS?
IS IT, LIKE--WORSE?

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:39.092 line:0%
 
- WELL, IT IS AN IMMUNE
DEFICIENCY DISEASE.

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.368 line:0%
 
- [sighs]

00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:49.403 line:0%
 
- YEAH?

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:55.175 line:0%
 
OKAY.
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

00:03:05.853 --> 00:03:07.321
- HOW ARE WE DOING?
