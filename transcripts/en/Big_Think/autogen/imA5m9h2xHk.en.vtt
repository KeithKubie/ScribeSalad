now the first is what we call
 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.700
now the first is what we call

it means is I can now for example if you
have cancer I can take a piece of your

cancer and sequence the DNA and look at

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
cancer and sequence the DNA and look at
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.850
cancer and sequence the DNA and look at
what genes are turned on and what genes

what genes are turned on and what genes
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.460
what genes are turned on and what genes
are turned off and hopefully develop a
