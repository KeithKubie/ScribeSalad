(applause and cheering)

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:06.172
Hi. It is 29 minutes
until midnight

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:08.408
when the day resets
and we announce a winner.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.610
But we're all winners here.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.345
I am Chris Hardwick.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.213
So 2016 has been described
by meteorologists

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:17.784
as a "Class 5 (bleep) show,"
so want

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:19.385
to take a break
from the bad news of the world,

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:22.688
courtesy of the adorable news
of the World Wide Web?

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.123
Well, let's do it.

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:26.793
Because honestly, you guys,
uh, we have been...

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:30.430
we have been neck deep
in crap news this entire year,

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:35.268
between terrorism and Zika
and the election virus and

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:39.072
losing people,
pop culture icons that we love!

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.874
(applause and cheering)
-What the (bleep), 2016?!

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:43.176
What the serious (bleep)?!

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:46.746
So, 2016 has definitely been
the year of no chill.

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:50.516
So we decided that we were gonna
give you a mental break

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.051
from all that stuff tonight.

00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:53.820
That is this entire show

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.855
is just an escape pod
for you emotionally.

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:57.590
Let's start with my sweater.

00:00:57.623 --> 00:00:59.959
I feel better surrounded by
fuzzy wuzzy bears, all right?

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:02.462
-(applause and cheering)
-It covers up by boo-boos.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.397
I feel better!

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.399
I feel better
when I get stressed out

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.000
and I go,
"What am I gonna do?"

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:11.037
And then Alf shows up and goes,
"No problem, Chris."

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.638
-(applause and cheering)
-"No problem!”

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.474
-Yeah.
-HARDWICK: So...

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.643
tonight, everything we're doing
is cuter than a bug's ear,

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:19.979
and a bug's ear
is pretty (bleep) cute.

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:21.848
Welcome to
<i> I Can Haz Midnight.</i>

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:23.850
-Here we are.
-Yeah.

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:26.385
Or<i> Cat Midnight</i> if you want.

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:28.588
(applause and cheering)

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.389
All right.

00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:32.859
One of the biggest stories
of the election was WikiLeaks,

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:35.394
the hacking organization led
by Julian Assange,

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:37.930
aka Men's rights Sephiroth,

00:01:37.963 --> 00:01:40.366
who is possibly aided by Russia

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.602
and whose revelations
may have swung the election.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:45.204
But who gives a (bleep)
about any of that anymore?!

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:47.874
His cat wears a tie! That's what
I care about. Look at that.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:51.410
-Oh.
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:52.846
Oh, my God!

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.782
He's stuck
in that embassy all these years.

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:59.018
That's probably his best friend
and probable lover.

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:02.121
-We don't know. Could be.
-(audience groaning)

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:03.789
Who would you rather (bleep)--
a human or a cat?

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:05.992
-"It's a tie." Uh...
-Aah!

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.727
-Re...
-(applause and cheering)

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.595
I know.

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:11.264
Ooh, he's so...

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:15.201
Ha! I kill me!

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:17.370
Comedians, Julian Assange

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:18.938
has spilled a lot
of government secrets.

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:21.641
-What's a secret he might learn
from his cat? -(cat meowing)

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.409
-Randy?
-(laughter) -HARDWICK: Oh.

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:25.811
-Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.
-Very nice.

00:02:25.844 --> 00:02:28.014
Forgot to mention-- we changed
the buzzers today, so...

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:29.582
Uh, Randy.

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:31.217
Uh, Garfield doesn't
hate Mondays.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.919
He hates Mormons.
It was a typo.

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.720
-HARDWICK: Okay, points.
-(laughter and groaning)

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:36.956

Uh, three dogs died
in Bone-ghazi.

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:43.663
-HARDWICK: All right. Points.

HARDWICK:
Flula.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.535
Cat ladies aren't
actually lonely.

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:52.071
They are secretly super hot
intercourse machines.

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:53.773
-(laughter)
-Yeah.

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.841

No, not a dog.
I'm sorry.

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:03.816
...a puppy that is threatening

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.118
to kill bystanders
with cuteness.

00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:07.720

From a woman in the audience
who had never seen

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:35.888
a cat in baby form before.

00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:38.123
They're called kittens.
That's what we call them, ma'am.

00:07:38.156 --> 00:07:39.825
Uh, and since
we're fully committed

00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:41.861

as cute as possible,

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:43.929
