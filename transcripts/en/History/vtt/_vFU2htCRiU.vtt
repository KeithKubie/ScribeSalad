00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:04.629
- You've noticed on your

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:06.131
That's because
you'll be choosing

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:08.425
between round bar
and metal grates

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.218
sourced from this quarry.

00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:11.761
There's plenty of it out there.

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.597
You'll have to choose
which is the better option.

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:16.516
And as if that
wasn't hard enough,

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.059
today you'll be using these.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.523
Gentlemen, you will have
four hours in this round.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.900
There will be no design period.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.193
Good luck, bladesmiths.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:30.155
Your four hours starts now.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.865
I'm grabbing the
large piece of steel,

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.451
because the other piece of steel
looked too skinny and small.

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.953
I didn't want to
have to forge well.

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:38.329
Thank you.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:39.873
See, that's the
beauty of this--

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.666
even though you're in
competition with each other,

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.168
the sportsmanship,
the camaraderie

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:45.128
that you have as bladesmiths.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.838
It's beautiful to
see that Brandon

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:50.341
is getting some of that round
bar for Christoph and Wade.

00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:52.093
Forge is over there.

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:54.262
I'm going to make a drop point
hunter because I believe it's

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:55.472
a good design for chopping.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:57.348
It has a lot of meat
behind the edge.

00:00:57.348 --> 00:01:00.769
What inspires me when I'm
making blades is my imagination.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.355
I enjoy reading and
sci-fi-type movies,

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:06.983
and you can make those
instruments and use them.

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:08.693
Brendon is really
having a hard time

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:10.195
getting his fire started.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.989
Oh my God.

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:14.741
You'll get it.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:18.203
Son of a [bleep]

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:20.413
It's already 20 minutes
into this competition

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.916
and one of our bladesmiths
doesn't have a fire,

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.169
and that is a huge problem.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.712
I look around,
every other competitor

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:29.464
I started the hammer work.

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:31.341
If I can't get
this fire going, I

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.927
believe even my youngest boy's
going to give me hell about it.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.387
I can't believe this.

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:38.723
It would be nice to
see him kind of pile

00:01:38.723 --> 00:01:40.600
a little bit more coal
on there, just make

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.602
a little vent hole for itself.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.021
That hot flame is moving
out through one section

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:46.523
heating that core.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:49.692
My main goal
today is not to cry.

00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:54.572
[bleep]

00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:57.617
Bust that paper up a
little bit if you can.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.619
It's wound up tight.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.870
Look at this.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.455
Wade is actually
taking time off to help

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.165
Brandon get his fire started.

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:05.208
Teamwork works.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:06.626
Look at that.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:10.296
Bladesmiths, 90
minutes has elapsed.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.632
Brandon coming along great.

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.384
Started a little bit
behind everybody else.

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:17.428
Finally starting to get down to
that tang and hammer on that.

00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:19.472
My fire is doing
really well now.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:22.308
So I figure I'll go ahead
and power through, catch up

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.184
because I lost a lot of time.

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.605
Oh.

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:30.108
I just burnt my blade in half.

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:31.860
I'm going to
[bleep]-ing-ing lose it.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.236
I just want to
kick the fire over

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:34.529
and just [bleep]-ing leave.

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.489
Out here with the
lighting like it

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.908
is, is it more
difficult to judge

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:40.618
the temperature of your steel?

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:41.911
Absolutely.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.371
As the sun comes out
and it goes away,

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:46.040
everything is dependent
on the lighting.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.792
I'm an extremely
competitive person.

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:49.669
I do not like to lose.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:53.590
I'm getting new steel
and starting over.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.216
I started my new blade,
and the first thing

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:57.760
is running through my mind
is not overheating it.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.137
I'm not going to cry.

00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:00.471
I don't care what happened.

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:02.015
I don't care how many
times I messed up.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.808
I'm not going to burn
my blade again because I

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:05.476
have to turn something in.

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:06.895
I can't just quit.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.688
One of my concerns
here is he's been

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.690
hammering that when it's cold.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.442
If he keeps hammering
on cold steel like that,

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.110
he could develop cracks.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.864
Bladesmiths, you
only have 60 minutes.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.283
Don't worry about that clock.

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:23.036
There's an hour left, and
I'm trying to catch up.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.871
Matt's got a blade forged out.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.040
Wade's blade is looking
pretty nice as well.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.208
I believe I can get it done,
but it definitely won't be

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:30.251
the blade that I planned to do.

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:42.263
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:44.182
Bladesmiths, drop your tools.

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:45.975
This forging round is over.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.188
My blades a chopper.

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:51.147
It's gonna chop.

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:52.690
It is gonna break?

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.442
Maybe.

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:57.153
Bladesmiths,
welcome to the forge.

00:03:57.153 --> 00:04:00.323
You cold forged signature
blades in your signature style.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.699
Now it's time for
the judges to take

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.493
a closer look at your work.

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:04.827
Brandon, you're up.

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:08.039
Please present your
work to the judges.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.584
Brandon, a bit of a
rough shape as it sits.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:14.253
There's a lot of cracking.

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:15.797
I like the drop that
you have over here.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.882
It feels like a good
slashing weapon.

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:19.968
But overall, thank
you for persevering

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:23.221
through that heat and that sun.
Good job.

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.222
Thank you.
