&gt;&gt;Marisa: We are very excited today to welcome
Christy Turlington here. We're gonna get to

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.900
see a little bit of the new film that's debuting
this spring as well as get some questions

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.700
time for Christy. And I have a little, a little
bio here that's been prepared for her so I'll

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.439
just go ahead and read that.

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.970
With more than 25 years at the forefront of
the fashion industry, having graced every

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.899
magazine from the cover of Vogue to Time,
Christy Turlington has established a diverse

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:33.580
career as a model, writer, entrepreneur, spokesperson,
advocate, and now a film maker. Philanthropy

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.960
and service has been a long part of Christy's
personal and professional mission to make

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.341
a lasting impact on the world.

00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:44.770
In 2005 she began working with the international
humanitarian organization CARE and has since

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.310
become their advocate for maternal health.
She has also been an ambassador for RED since

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.510
their launch in 2006. Her work on behalf of
CARE and RED inspired her to pursue a master's

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.320
in public health at Columbia University Mailman's
School where she's currently enrolled.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.710
In 2008, Christy began work on a documentary
film profiling the status of maternal health

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.500
worldwide. In her gripping directorial debut
Christy shares the following, the powerful

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.970
stories of an at risk pregnant woman in four
different parts of the world including a remote

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.490
Maasai tribe in Tanzania, a slum in Bangladesh,
a post abortion care ward in Guatemala, and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.659
a prenatal clinic in the United States. "No
Woman, No Cry" made its world premier at the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.990
2010 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City
with U.S. television broadcasts premiering

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.460
on May 7, 2011 on the new Oprah Winfrey Network.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.560
Concurrent with the debut of her documentary,
Christy launched Every Mother Counts an advocacy

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.590
and mobilization campaign to increase educational
support for maternal and child health.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.560
Today Christy joins us to talk about her documentary.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.479
I wanna welcome Christy to tell us a little
bit about the film to start.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.479
[applause]

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.140
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: Thank you Marissa.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.840
I'm thrilled to be here today to share this
film it's really been a labor of love and

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.550
a very passionate issue for me for the last
three years, but actually for the last seven

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.349
and a half years because you'll see at the
beginning of the film that it's an incredibly

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.650
personal story as well. This is just the first
part of it, it's just through Tanzania, but

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.299
I do encourage you to see the film when it
comes out on the 7th of May and I hope you

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.700
enjoy it. I look forward to talking afterwards.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.700
Thank you.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.090
&gt;&gt;Marisa: It's beautifully told. So I guess
I'd like to understand a little bit about

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.010
how did you decide to make the movie?

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.450
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: Well I had that experience
at the beginning with Grace and I learned

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.360
about the statistics, the global statistics
around maternal mortality, but it was really

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.079
actually a couple years later, when I was
pregnant with my second child, that I started

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.779
to do a little bit of traveling with the humanitarian
aid organization, CARE.

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:58.370
And one of the first places we visited was
to El Salvador which is where my mom is from

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.930
and I think I was about six and half, seven
months pregnant. We visited a small community

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.250
in a rural area where it was a water project
and because they were providing some water

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.790
and some access to water for women who mostly
do the water collection, they were using this

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.760
opportunity to also educate, give some prenatal
and postnatal care to some women in the area.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.180
And a lot of the women were in the same state
of their pregnancies as I was or had just

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.579
had babies and I think that was the moment
where I sort of thought, "Oh if I lived here

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.949
and I had had my complication, I would be
dead." No doubt about it. There was no running

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:37.469
water, there was no electricity, there were
no paved roads, I hadn't seen an ambulance

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.939
or a hospital facility for miles getting out
to that area. And that's when I had the moment

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.370
of like this is something that I think I can
contribute to.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.079
And then about a year later I traveled again
to Peru or to Peru to an indigenous population

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.299
in the highlands. And I saw a success story
also with CARE in a partnership between CARE,

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.029
Columbia University, and the local government
where they were able to reduce maternal deaths

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:07.419
in half in less than five years. And I think
seeing how they were able to do that and how

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.549
low cost so many of the solutions were, that's
what sort of floored me and I thought, "This

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.839
is doable. These are hundreds of thousands
of lives, but 90 percent of them are preventable.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.519
Why aren't we doing a better job? What can
be done?"

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.040
And I'm not a filmmaker by training, but my
husband's a filmmaker and a lot of our friends

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.120
are filmmakers and I thought, "This is a story
that needs, these are stories that need to

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.840
be told," and so I set out to make a movie
and to pull any resource that I had together

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.011
to be able to make this to connect people
like yourselves to the issue.

00:04:37.011 --> 00:04:41.540
&gt;&gt;Marisa: And how did you find the women and
how did you choose the locations? I'm guessing

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.780
that probably out of the four that are in
the movie, but there probably were many more

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.830
that you interacted with over that time.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.080
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: There were. There are
countless women's stories we've collected.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.870
Well I wanted to show that it was a global
tragedy. So it was very important to me that

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.030
we look at obviously where the highest burdens
are which is in sub-Saharan Africa and I chose

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.810
Tanzania for a few reasons: one, in that there's
political will there. The President of Tanzania

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.040
has been very vocal and he's taken a real
leadership role with regards to MDG 4 &amp; 5

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.640
which are around infant mortality and maternal
mortality. And so that is a big thing I wanted

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.410
to find countries that were sort of primed
for success. It's also one of the first countries

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.760
I traveled to in Africa 21 years ago and so
I have friends there, I feel comfortable there

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.990
and familiar there. So we chose it for that
reason and then we picked Northern Tanzania

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.140
where the roads are better thinking that if
we got to see that referral process from clinic

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.570
to hospital that we could do it often times
if we needed to.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.280
But as you could see with Janet, even though
she didn't live so, so far away, I mean it's

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.670
still miles away from a road and miles away
from the hospital that she had to go to.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.410
In Guatemala, we ended up -- through Planned
Parenthood, we found an obstetrician who was

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.240
just so remarkable that we actually picked
the country because of her. I wanted to look

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.290
at a country that had a high indigenous population
because those women that are the most disenfranchised

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.290
in a society. And so we picked it because
it was surrounded by very, very conservative

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.520
countries and yet it was this little country
where it had this one woman, she's like the

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.340
sole Planned Parenthood provider in that country,
and she was also eight months pregnant herself.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.570
So she was just incredible.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.260
We picked Bangladesh. It's where the second
highest burden is after Sub-Saharan Africa

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.200
which is in Southeast Asia. There are a lot
of incredible things happening in Bangladesh.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.180
It's a small country and they have sort of
family planning somewhat under control. A

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.710
lot of women have controlled the amount of
children that they have. However, they don't

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.650
have their babies in facilities. And I think
90 percent of them choose to have a child

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.990
at home -- which is fine if you have a clean
home and you have access to water and health

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.930
care workers, but they often do it totally
by themselves. So we wanted to examine what

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.430
were the cultural barriers and some of the
social norms that were preventing them from

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.330
seeking care if it was in fact offered.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.840
And then the last being the U.S. I just thought
it was so important -- I live in the U.S.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.139
I had my children in the U.S. I think it's
important because the audiences that I geared

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:12.720
this film for live here that we bring it close
to home. And, of course, as we were making

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.030
the movie we were going through this huge
process in the States about health care reform

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.389
and still are, so it seemed really important
to tie that piece into it and to weave it

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:21.389
through.

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.560
And for all of the countries that I've shown
this film in, they're all the most shocked

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:32.050
actually about the U.S. In the UK, they just
couldn't believe that so many women are not

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.350
provided for particularly as pregnant people.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.350
&gt;&gt;Marisa: I think one of the interesting scenes
in there and I imagine it happened several

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:44.590
times over making the movie was when they
asked you for help. And I wondered if you

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.120
had sort of guidance in terms of how did you
handle that, when did you intervene, when

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.889
did you not intervene. I think it must have
been really, you would definitely wanna help

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.840
but at sometimes then you're also changing
the story that you're observing and --

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.840
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: Exactly.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.840
&gt;&gt;female #1: it's a difficult balance.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.580
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: It was a difficult balance.
I mean we went in thinking we are gonna be

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.500
around some scenarios which will be, they'll
be precarious and they'll be dangerous and

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:10.460
we will help people get to the care that they
need, but we did really wanna understand what

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:16.240
would happen if we weren't here. And so while
we were dealing with it, I mean we were also

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.370
filming several stories at the same time so
at the same time as Janet Lightness had come

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.900
in, the 16 year old at the end, and we were
filming her story very carefully too. So it

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:30.130
was really hard to kind of know what was gonna
happen to anyone and they both ended up having

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.120
to go-go to get care at the hospital.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:39.409
But it was very challenging to know like what's
the moment. So we had some of our crew which

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:44.300
was quite small starting to work on providing
transportation, going to go negotiate with

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:49.740
the driver down the road to make sure that
we could get transportation for her even if

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.029
we didn't go with her and we ended up just
deciding, "You know what we're just gonna

00:08:52.029 --> 00:08:57.779
go with her. We're just gonna see what happens."
And thank goodness we were because obviously

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:02.759
everyday there's not a van full of Mazungu
as we're called [laughs] around to help.

00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:09.389
&gt;&gt;Marisa: And this is your first turn as a
filmmaker. So what were some of the biggest

00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:10.389
surprises and challenges?

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:14.510
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: It was such an extraordinary
experience and my producer is a friend, a

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:20.070
friend who's a mom in my neighborhood in New
York and she's been a part of a lot of productions

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.790
for documentaries and she pulled together
a team for me that were incredible, so I was

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:29.120
really learning all the time. But we were
a team of women and we worked with a local

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.040
producer in each of the countries so that
we would have somebody to speak the local

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.490
dialect and also they were filmmakers in their
own right so we tried to provide some work

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.830
opportunity as well for filmmakers in each
of the countries.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:46.509
But I just love, I love to travel and I love
to be a part of really embedded into a part

00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:50.350
of the world that we are and in all of my
travels through my career and just aside of

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:56.230
my career, I haven't really been able to sort
of indulge that part of like really being

00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:00.930
for two weeks at a time with a community of
people and being let into their lives in some

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.740
of the most intimate moments that women will
ever have.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.990
So the fact that women allowed us in at that
time and again we would introduce ourselves,

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:14.619
explain what we were trying to do, always
get permission, and treat women with dignity

00:10:14.619 --> 00:10:20.260
and respect at all times. But women started
to seek us out. It was some, I mean Janet

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.519
was one of those people I think she just saw
this is an opportunity, "I think these people

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:28.740
can help me." So she kind of as much as we
found her, she also sought us out and that

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.619
happened in each of the countries in some
way.

00:10:31.619 --> 00:10:34.670
&gt;&gt;Marisa: And do you think that you'll do
more film making in the future? Are there

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.069
other films that you'd like to make?

00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:40.509
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: I think I will actually.
I hadn't set out to -- this story really,

00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:44.720
this issue really inspired me. But in editing
the film, there were countless stories I mean

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.879
we could have told so many stories because
you know maternal mortality is I think the

00:10:48.879 --> 00:10:57.079
red flag to a very large maternal health issue
which really boils down to equity. And so

00:10:57.079 --> 00:11:00.709
numerous times, it was really like this could
be a movie about religion and reproductive

00:11:00.709 --> 00:11:05.209
health, this could be a movie about just rights
and the lack of knowledge of human rights.

00:11:05.209 --> 00:11:09.630
There were so many different pieces to it
and so there are so many stories still to

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:13.720
be told and I think I will go and do them.
I just have to see this one through and I'm

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:18.059
committed at least through 2015 [laughs] with
my advocacy strategy so.

00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:21.959
&gt;&gt;Marisa: So tell us a little bit about the
advocacy strategy. What do you expect to come

00:11:21.959 --> 00:11:25.809
out of this? What would you like to see happen?
How can all of us help support the cause?

00:11:25.809 --> 00:11:30.949
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: Well I, as I was editing
the movie also I mean you create like a social

00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:35.149
issue documentary to try to create real change
and I think the film is an amazing opportunity

00:11:35.149 --> 00:11:39.970
to be able to show stories about women in
their own language and their own voices like

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:45.610
what-what their lives are like. However, at
the end of a movie that moves you and hopefully

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:49.129
inspires you in some way, you do wanna know,
"What can I do."

00:11:49.129 --> 00:11:57.079
So "Every Mother Counts" is a way to create
some actionable opportunities for people to

00:11:57.079 --> 00:12:01.019
be able to engage on a number of different
levels. I mean there are policy pieces of

00:12:01.019 --> 00:12:04.689
this that are clearly important because policy
in the U.S. reflects the policy [chuckles]

00:12:04.689 --> 00:12:10.279
around the world particularly with reproductive
rights and contraception and family planning

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:13.499
and those types of things.

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:17.660
But also, you know, just ways to feel like
you've contributed in a meaningful way. And

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:23.449
I feel that this is an issue that really touches
everybody: men, women, families. Because we've

00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:29.339
all come into the world through this process.
It's truly a universal issue. If we haven't

00:12:29.339 --> 00:12:34.839
had children ourselves, our partners, our
friends, our sisters, our friends have gone

00:12:34.839 --> 00:12:39.449
through this process and I think we all know
somebody who had some slight complication,

00:12:39.449 --> 00:12:45.600
some fearful moment in their pregnancy that
I think we can identify with women like the

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.660
ones that are presented in the film and like
the "what if", "what if I'd been there or

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.379
there?" The randomness of it all.

00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:55.939
So I feel that it's something that each of
us can do something. Each of us had our own

00:12:55.939 --> 00:13:02.529
set of resources that we can think of a way
to do something but sharing the stories, inviting

00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:07.610
people to see the film, to know about the
issue. Our website -- everymothercounts.org

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.959
-- is set up to learn more and go to the next
level. We've created some education modules

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:17.639
that are free and downloadable from our site
and we're trying to have our site be a way,

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:22.730
a resource really to lead you to the things,
the innovations that are in this area. I mean

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:29.459
there's some amazing high tech, low tech solutions
to this issue, and trying to invite and identify

00:13:29.459 --> 00:13:33.571
the ones that we think are the most exciting
and the most useful right now.

00:13:33.571 --> 00:13:41.300
But we would love [chuckles] any ideas you
have. I think you all in your specific area

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.679
of expertise and interests would have so much
to contribute that I have no knowledge or

00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:50.940
skills [laughs]. So I would love, I would
love help and partnership in any way.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:56.230
&gt;&gt;Marisa: So changing gears from the film
a little bit, I think that all of us are very

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.639
interested 'cause you've had one of the most
multifaceted careers of anyone certainly I've

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:04.899
ever met, and I wanted to explore a little
bit about each of those and so I thought maybe

00:14:04.899 --> 00:14:08.319
we could start with your modeling days. A
little bit about what they were like, how

00:14:08.319 --> 00:14:11.829
you got into the business in the first place.
I think it's interesting for people to hear

00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:14.429
about all the different career shifts and
experiences you've had.

00:14:14.429 --> 00:14:18.760
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: Sure. Well I grew up
in the East Bay actually. I was born in Walnut

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.589
Creek and I grew up in Danville and I grew
up riding horses. My sisters and I we all

00:14:22.589 --> 00:14:27.199
rode and competed in horseback riding. And
my parents worked for Pan Am and they were

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:30.210
big travelers and so we grew up sort of traveling
a lot around the world.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:34.850
But we lived in Florida for a brief time because
Pan Am was based there and my dad was a training

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:39.819
captain. And at that time is when I got sort
of discovered and it was through my horseback

00:14:39.819 --> 00:14:44.709
riding. Actually a photographer saw my sister
and I riding horses and asked our mom if he

00:14:44.709 --> 00:14:49.939
could take our picture and I was like 14 with
braces and everything and my sister was like,

00:14:49.939 --> 00:14:55.350
"That would be cool." So we did it and I became
the tall one and she didn't grow very tall

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.819
and so I had [chuckles] a career [laughs].

00:14:57.819 --> 00:15:03.600
But yeah I so I started working when I moved
back here as a teenager in high school I started

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.739
-- I would take the bus, the BART bus, and
take BART into the city and I would work for

00:15:08.739 --> 00:15:12.860
the department stores and that kind of thing.
And then I went to New York and sort of stayed

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:18.180
there from there and I didn't wanna come back
after experience a little bit of independence

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:23.399
and and the travel I was really hard to go
back to the suburbs [laughs] to high school.

00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:28.339
But my mom pushed me to finish my high school
degree which was smart because then I went

00:15:28.339 --> 00:15:36.329
back to school, to NYU, at 25 when I was kind
of burnt out with my career. And I got a degree

00:15:36.329 --> 00:15:41.920
in comparative religion and Eastern philosophy.
And I started practicing Yoga as a teenager

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.149
but I started to really practice very regularly
at that time.

00:15:46.149 --> 00:15:50.399
And then started a couple of businesses after
that. I started a skin care business that

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:55.759
was based on the principles of Ayurveda, a
sister philosophy to Yoga and also an apparel

00:15:55.759 --> 00:16:01.050
line in partnership with Puma which was also
around Yoga and lifestyle of Yoga. And so

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:05.790
I did that for a while and I wrote a book
about Yoga called "Living Yoga: Creating a

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.429
Life Practice". And what else did I do [laughs]
--

00:16:09.429 --> 00:16:13.459
&gt;&gt;Marisa: And tell us a little bit about Yoga.
So how often do you practice it, for what

00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:17.241
duration? Do you like to do it in a group,
do you do it at home? Tell us a little bit

00:16:17.241 --> 00:16:18.329
about your Yoga practice.

00:16:18.329 --> 00:16:22.499
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: My Yoga practice these
days is really my advocacy. I, seva is a big

00:16:22.499 --> 00:16:26.310
part of, it's one of the principles of Yoga
and honestly I mean I wish I could practice

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:32.040
more of the physical aspect of it, but I just
don't have enough time in the day these days.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:39.170
[laughs] I really view my service and the
work that I do in this area as my Yoga, and

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.819
also the way that I mother my children is
really my Yoga. I mean to me it's really the

00:16:42.819 --> 00:16:47.779
way that I view the world and my perspective
of the world and I do consider it a life practice

00:16:47.779 --> 00:16:53.149
so while I don't get to do as much physical
Yoga at the moment, I do whenever I can whenever

00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:59.379
I have any down time, whenever I am not traveling
as much as I do and I have the skills so it's

00:16:59.379 --> 00:17:03.249
something that I can do wherever I am. I can
meditate, I can sit for a practice and even

00:17:03.249 --> 00:17:09.329
if it's a few minutes, it's integrated into
my daily life. It's been the most meaningful

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:14.590
life practice that I could have and really
what led me I think to the work that I'm doing

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:15.590
today.

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:18.709
&gt;&gt;Marisa: And you've also become a student
at Columbia doing your master's. So tell us

00:17:18.709 --> 00:17:22.260
a little bit about that transition. So you
obviously went back to school at 25 and are

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:26.430
now back in school again. So do you get recognized?
How is it? [laughs]

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:30.750
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: It's funny even when
I went to undergrad at NYU, I didn't get recognized

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:36.400
that much. I think students were pretty much
into their own thing and I also -- I don't

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.170
know -- I'm not a super glamorous person so
I don't know. I don't think I really stood

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:45.140
out that much even though I was eight years
older than most of my classmates. Now I'm

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.660
20 years older [laughs] than all of my classmates,
no maybe not that much, but I'm a lot older

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.070
than most of my classmates.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:55.380
But I also feel that in grad school, at least,
I feel like my professors are my peers like

00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:00.190
those are the people that I work with mostly
in this kind of work. So I feel, I feel kind

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:04.620
of like I have an advantage. I feel lucky
that any time I get to be the UN or really

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.881
at the table with so many of the people that
are really leaders in the maternal and newborn

00:18:07.881 --> 00:18:14.150
child health sector, I feel like my classmates
would be so jealous. [laughs] And I've actually

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:17.670
been able to employ a few of 'em. They been
helping us with some of the education modules

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:22.710
and I really I love the experience. I'm taking
the slow track at the moment so I'll be there

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.180
another year or so but I'm enjoying it immensely.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.500
&gt;&gt;Marisa: Very cool. So after this next question,
we'll go ahead and open it up to the audience.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.350
So if you have a question for Christy you
can go here to the mic so people can hear.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:36.960
But the last question is changing gears to
Google. Do you have a favorite Google product

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.850
and how do you use it?

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:39.850
[laughter]

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:45.500
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: Well the ones that I
use like daily are -- I mean I constantly

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.780
am in the mapping, I mean I'm a big map obsessed
person particularly when it's like global

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:55.540
health. It's so convenient and so user friendly.
So that is one of them. But then the other

00:18:55.540 --> 00:19:01.192
is I mean my alerts. I really could not keep
on top of all of the things that are going

00:19:01.192 --> 00:19:06.680
on all the time in this space with this issue.
And so I really rely on it so heavily and

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.120
then I Tweet like crazy about the different
pieces of information that I get. So it's

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.120
been really useful.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.110
&gt;&gt;Marisa: Very cool. Okay.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:20.050
&gt;&gt;male #1: This is sort of two halves of the
same question. One is you said 90 percent

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:26.700
of these deaths are preventable. What are
some of the key remediations, the key things

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:34.270
to fix? And the second one is, I just imagine
that in most, many of these circumstances,

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:39.600
isn't it really because of the power imbalance
of women do the work and well I don't know

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.470
what the men do?

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.470
[laughter]

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:48.100
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: Well the most important
thing is really prevention. So the importance

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:55.690
of family planning is tremendous. That ties
into education. So education is also incredibly

00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:03.810
important. When a girl has more than a primary
education she will just instinctively delay

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:11.140
a first pregnancy, marriage. She'll understand
better to space pregnancies. That will save

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:17.680
her life just by virtue of holding off starting
a family.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:24.580
Secondly, oh and then obviously having the
ability to control your fertility is tremendously

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:31.580
empowering and incredibly important. So many
women who are pregnant and at a ridiculous

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:37.950
age like 13 or 14 for the first time in much
of Sub-Saharan African and Southeast Asia

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:44.690
-- they have not chosen to be pregnant. They've
not chosen to have sex. So education and working

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:52.420
on that prevention piece and how to empower
girls to protect their own bodies is a critical

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.420
piece.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.070
But then the health care worker piece is also
really important. We will never have enough

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:02.630
doctors to fulfill the burden of most global
health issues. And as you heard our obstetrician

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:08.750
in Tanzania say, he was the only OB for 2.5
million people. Well 2.5 million people were

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:13.090
not seeking care from a doctor because they
don't even think about seeing a doctor in

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:19.740
their daily lives. But when a woman is pregnant,
that's an opportunity for a woman to be seen

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.470
for the first time. And there are tremendous
things being done with not just community

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.360
health workers but midwives and nurses and
midlevel providers.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:33.190
In Tanzania, the teenager that you see at
the end -- she had a C-section in the end

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:37.570
but by an AMO which is the equivalent of a
physician's assistant. And that's who's doing

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:44.310
the majority of the cesarean sections in Sub-Saharan
Africa, and midwives are doing 'em too actually.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:49.920
So I would say the skilled birth attendants,
the prevention piece being the family planning

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.010
and contraception, and education.

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:58.849
&gt;&gt;female #1: I wanted to thank you so much
I mean I thought the film was great and I

00:21:58.849 --> 00:22:05.370
really liked the tone of it. I had worked
in Tanzania a bit before and I liked sort

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:10.300
of the just non-intrusive, I guess, narration.
It just sort of felt like you were letting

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.750
the people there interact the way that you
would observe it.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:21.380
I was curious about the diagnosis the nurse
kept giving some of the patients about their

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:26.860
pelvis bone. So is that linked to I mean is
that a common thing? Is it linked to maybe

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.950
being young or is it something with the Maasai
or what was the issue there?

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.920
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: That's a good question.
It is linked to being too young but also malnutrition

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.920
and nutrition --

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.920
&gt;&gt;female #1: Okay.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.190
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: is a huge factor too.
So these poor women -- they tend to eat last

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:46.370
even when they're pregnant. If they're very
young when they start having a baby, they

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:51.540
don't develop properly. I mean even women
that are older, you just see their stature

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:56.400
as very tiny. And so that was a common I mean
in the amount of time we were in that clinic

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.640
that was commonly the reason why a woman had
to be referred. And what happens is if she's

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.370
not developed enough and her pelvis is small,
then she's a candidate for an obstructed labor

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:11.360
which in most scenarios ends up where the
baby dies. But in many cases, the woman will

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:16.640
die also and at the very least she'll suffer
a complication, a morbidity which could last

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:22.000
her a lifetime like an obstructed fistula
which is a horrible, horrible handicap --

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
&gt;&gt;female #1: Um-hum.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: that so many women have.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
&gt;&gt;female #1: Okay. Thank you.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.600
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: Thank you for the question.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.360
&gt;&gt;Marisa: And we also have a system where
people are putting their questions on and

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.700
voting. So we have a few of those. Some of
these we already asked, but I'll go ahead

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.480
and ask the first one which is: how do you
feel that your career as a fashion model has

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.020
impacted your ability to be an advocate for
women's reproductive health today?

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:44.040
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: You know that's a funny
thing. I don't know that -- well I mean I

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:49.910
guess it has certainly helped in a sense because
I sometimes have an opportunity to get some

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:56.760
media attention. But I don't think like the
job itself had any real effect on it. It's

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.660
just that it allowed me to really travel and
see the world a lot and I think feel a little

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:06.630
bit more connected to a lot of women outside
of the community where I was raised and where

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:13.390
I was brought up. So I guess the experience
of being able to travel definitely had something

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:18.440
to do with it. And then the fact that I do
have some ability to be able to get some media

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:24.440
attention. I think if I didn't have a deeper
knowledge, I don't know that it would be that

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.440
effective.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:30.330
But the fact that I have made the commitment
to go deeper and to go back to school, I think

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.310
will make me a more effective communicator
because it's one thing to communicate what

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:39.400
you see and to tell stories and to go on trips
and to have your picture taken someplace.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:45.140
But it's another thing to take it to the next
level and to continue to go deeper and to,

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.780
for me I really wanna be a part of the solutions
of this problem. I didn't wanna just come

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:55.530
and observe and walk away. I'm deeply committed
to this and I don't know if being a fashion

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:57.970
model has anything to do with that. [chuckles]

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:01.910
&gt;&gt;female #2: Hi I'm Jacqueline. Thanks a lot
for taking on this issue because it's been

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:06.240
a really neglected issue and we really need
people like you to champion it. So thank you.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:12.220
So a few of us also went with CARE on a maternal
mortality learning trip last year and we went

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.930
to Sierra Leone and one of the things that
we learned when we were there is that there

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:21.180
was one pediatrician for all of Sierra Leone.
I mean the country is just so decimated in

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.900
terms of health resources. So obviously the
answer to improving maternal mortality has

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:30.560
a lot to do with increasing foreign assistance
and development assistance and I was just

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:35.870
wondering especially now given the cut backs
and given the sort of climate of fear and

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:42.430
holding on to our resources to tightly, how
that's going. How you and Erin are taking

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:45.000
on this issue and are you optimistic at all
and where do you think that's headed?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.280
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: That's a good point.
I mean right now is an incredibly tough time

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:57.380
and the budgets are getting slashed on a daily
basis here and for international aid. I think

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.930
because we know the next couple years are
gonna be rough, what we're hoping is some

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:04.860
of the momentum that was built around maternal
mortality and maternal health in the last

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:10.250
year, -- it was on the agenda for the first
time at the G8 last summer -- that all of

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:15.560
that and some of the attention that Bill and
Linda Gates have brought to it and Sarah Brown,

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.410
Gordon Brown's wife. I mean some of those
things have escalated the issue to now be

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.470
-- it's on the agenda.

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:28.210
So our priority is keeping it a focus so that
we don't fell back. The idea is like, "Okay

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:32.700
we can't do a whole lot with aid right now
but we can sort of keep pushing along." And

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:37.320
we believe that civil society hasn't really
been a part of this dialog yet. And we hope

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.250
that the film and the exposure on something
like the Oprah Winfrey Network and our partnership

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:47.140
with Starbucks and the CD we've created -- that
those are ways to really bring in everyday

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:53.470
citizens, moms, family members to get to be
a part of this, to participate. And I mean

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:58.520
we really envision us playing a big role -- like
that we actually can be a part of helping

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.670
to bridge some of that funding gap that exists
now.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:06.690
&gt;&gt;Marisa: And we have a question about volunteering
and being able to help. Are there things that

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:07.890
people can do from here?

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.370
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: Yeah -- we often get
that question and we're trying to really identify

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:19.670
a few ways that people can have meaningful
results. And some of those are volunteering.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:25.170
They might not mean you have to leave this
country. There are ways to be able to create

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:30.770
watch parties and host parties and to learn
more so that you can then have a voice within

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:35.710
your community and create your own constituency
around this issue and have your voice heard.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:40.360
Because there are so many women and girls
who do not have a voice and so my, the main

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.050
thing that you can do that anyone could do
is to use your voice 'cause you have one.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:48.870
But the second thing is I mean we have, we're
trying to identify a few very easy ways, tangible

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:53.240
ways and we have identified a few organizations
there you can donate phones, phones that you

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.680
don't use anymore, that you've discarded.
We have ways that you can help support midwives

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:03.240
and the education of midwives to get supplies
into their hands that they are better able

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.240
to do a job.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:10.300
We're gonna have some of those ready for our
launch on May 7th and we do invite you to

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:14.590
come back to the site and to look at it 'cause
we'll give you some very specific ideas and

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.450
ways you can do things.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:21.100
&gt;&gt;Marisa: In addition to being on the Oprah
Winfrey Network, is it also going to be released

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.951
more widely? How will people be able to see
it? They'll be able to see it on May 7th and

00:28:24.951 --> 00:28:25.951
--

00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:29.490
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: Yes, well OWN will be
our broadcast partner here and then they have

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:32.590
the digital and video rights. So it will be
part of -- she's gonna have a documentary

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:37.810
club kind of like her book club and we'll
be a part of that. And then OWN will also

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:43.100
broadcast it in Canada under another network
called CORUS who's gonna be distributing OWN.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:47.630
And then we'll be doing also broadcasts in
France around their Mother's Day which is

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:51.950
at the end of May and that's gonna happen
on Teva which is a women's channel there.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:56.840
We'll try to identify in the G8 markets where
they do celebrate Mother's Day because Mother's

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.980
Day is not an international, an internationally
celebrated event, but those are kind of key

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.820
moments where it could be launched.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.890
And then we're continuing to travel with it
at global health conferences. I've been showing

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:10.120
it for the last year since we launched at
Tribeca to really get it out there amongst

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.120
the community.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.700
&gt;&gt;Marisa: How has making this film changed
your view on motherhood?

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:18.870
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: Hmm. Well I think I
there's not a whole lot that I can complain

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:23.830
about as a mom [laughs] or as a working person.
My mother will tell me all the time, "Oh you're

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:26.870
working so hard. You really have to slow down."
And I said, "You have no idea what hard work

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:31.850
is until you go out in the world." So the
stuff that I do, it's like the very least

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:37.250
I can do because I can do it and I can choose
to do the things that I do and I can choose

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:42.060
to donate my time and my energy to an issue
like this.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:48.480
I think the appreciation of having had the
health care workers that I had that helped

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:53.090
me in my own situation while delivering, I
mean I have tremendous respect and did from

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:59.950
day one for midwives and for doctors and for
nurses because they really are the unsung

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:03.300
heroes around the world and I truly believe
that.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:09.370
And I think for my children, I'm the best
example I can be as a human being for them.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:14.110
Like that's my first priority and I think
by the stuff that I'm interested in, the things

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:18.841
that I'm sort of pursuing, they're seeing
that and they're getting exposed to the world

00:30:18.841 --> 00:30:23.810
and the issues, the real issues that I think
really matter at a really young age. I think

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:27.520
that's like an invaluable thing that I can
give them and I can't wait to be able to share

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.770
more of the world with them and have them
help me. I can't wait to be side by side with

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:36.170
my daughter working on these issues. So she's
seven and a half now I figure I give her another

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.360
couple years and then [laughs] drag her on
the road with me. [laughs]

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:44.060
&gt;&gt;Marisa: Okay well I guess we will have Christy
here to take more questions if you guys wanna

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.220
come up and meet her and ask more questions
in person.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.200
But I wanna thank you so much for coming today
and sharing the film with us and a bit of

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.200
your story. It's really great.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.200
&gt;&gt;Christy Turlington: Thank you so much.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:51.201
[applause]
