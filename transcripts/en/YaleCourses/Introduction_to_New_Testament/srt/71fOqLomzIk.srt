1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:06,150
In the beginning was the word
and the word was with God.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,540
Somebody actually has memorized this.
I'm so proud of you.

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,150
I got me some good Sunday school people
in the class or at least somebody who's

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,270
done the reading for the day

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,640
and the word was with
God and the word was God.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,460
He was in the beginning with God.

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,990
All things came into being through him.
God,

8
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:36,991
what a philosophical sounding term being
it screams to be capitalized like Hagle

9
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:43,910
or someone like that would do being,

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,660
do you sit around in your dorm room
worried about being what is the nature of

11
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:52,990
being was the nature of existence?

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,380
Yeah,
no.

13
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,640
If you do,
you're a good philosopher.

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,730
What has come into being now that's
also very philosophical in traditional

15
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:10,731
classical philosophy from Plato on being
is one kind of thing and coming into

16
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:18,150
being is something else.
Things that are truly, truly,

17
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:23,151
truly being don't come into being because
that means at one time they were not.

18
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,090
Man, this sounds so philosophical and
the life was the light of all people.

19
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:33,210
The light shines in the darkness.
The darkness did not overcome it.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,140
You skipped down a bit.

21
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,980
Verse 14 the word became flesh and lived
among us and we have seen his glory,

22
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,820
the glory as of a father's only
son full of grace and truth.

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,840
That sounds not only philosophical
but downright feel illogical.

24
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:56,620
Okay?

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,670
No one has ever seen God.
Good theological point, right?

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,470
It is God the only son,
God the only son.

27
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,130
Have we heard anything like that kind
of language so far in this course?

28
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,720
God,
the only son?

29
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,053
No,
we haven't.

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,540
That sounds like a Christian creed.
It doesn't sound like Matthew,

31
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:30,250
mark and Luke. It doesn't sound like
acts. It doesn't even sound like Thomas.

32
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,460
We're in a different
world with this gospel.

33
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,700
This is not like anything
we've seen so far.

34
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,200
So from the very beginning
of the gospel of John,

35
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,900
you should know you're in a different
world from the synoptic Gospels, Matthew,

36
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:51,100
mark and Luke, the style, for
example, over and over again,

37
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:52,570
the style is repetitious.

38
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,310
Their phrases and words that come up
over and over again, darkness and light,

39
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,870
light and darkness.

40
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,700
I already did some of that with the the
we're in the beginning was the word.

41
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:07,000
The word was with God. The word was
God. He was in the beginning with God.

42
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,920
All things came into being through him.
Without him,

43
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,840
not one thing came into being what has
come into being come into being repeated

44
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:18,430
three times little clue. Don't write
your exit. Jesus papers like this.

45
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,780
This is not good American
English riding style.

46
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,550
You're supposed to vary your terminology
right a little bit and alter your

47
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:29,680
terms.
That's good English writing style.

48
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,070
This of course is actually fairly
good ancient Greek writing style.

49
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:34,690
It's just that different
writing styles are different,

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,570
but it's also a writing style
that we haven't seen so far,

51
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,030
so there's this repetition of words.

52
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,950
They're memorable sayings in the gospel
of John that you don't have in other

53
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:45,640
places.

54
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,200
There's a whole lot less action in the
gospel of John and a whole lot more talk.

55
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,510
Just flip open the gospel of John almost
any place and it'll start off with a

56
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:56,344
scene,

57
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,540
often a conflict scene with Jesus and
kind of as conversation with other people,

58
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,750
but pretty quickly it will
go into a dialogue in which
Jesus is saying something.

59
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,960
The other person says something,

60
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:12,250
go back and forth a bit and then it
goes even from a dialogue into Jesus.

61
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:15,880
Just being chatty Cathy and
just talking for paragraphs.

62
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,270
We don't have any of this kind of
stuff in the synoptics of Jesus.

63
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:24,271
Just going off on tangents for paragraphs
at a time and talking for a whole

64
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:28,150
chapter sometimes and that's what
you get in the gospel of John.

65
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,360
There are some scenes in the gospel of
John where the characters look actually

66
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:37,060
more lifelike than they do
in this synoptic gospels.

67
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:38,680
Have you noticed in the synoptic gospels,

68
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,600
the characters sometimes are
just a tax collector, a sinner,

69
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,200
a Pharisee,
a Syrophoenician woman,

70
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,880
a centurion who had a slave.
Most of the time they don't have a name.

71
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,330
Most of the time they just say
one or two things to Jesus.

72
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,980
One of the longest conversations with
Jesus that we have a with another

73
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:03,520
character is precisely the
Syrophoenician woman. You've, uh,

74
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,940
you've read about where you remember she's
comes and says she wants her daughter

75
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:10,570
to be healed and she's not a Jew.
And so Jesus says,

76
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,660
it's not right to take bread from the
children's mouths and throw it to the dogs

77
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,010
calling her a dog and
undeterred. She says, yes,

78
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:24,190
but the dogs got to eat the crumbs
from under the master's table.

79
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,890
That's one of the longest dialogues
that Jesus has with another person,

80
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:33,620
not his disciple. In the
synoptic gospels, very different.

81
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:36,430
We get to the gospel of John.
We have this scene,

82
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:40,480
we'll go to it in a minute where Jesus
has a whole chapter talking to Nicodemus.

83
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,800
We're told to nicotine is,

84
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:45,310
is we're told a little bit about him and
then Jesus has a conversation with them.

85
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,260
We have a whole scene in which Jesus
is talking to this woman at the, well,

86
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,220
a American woman.

87
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,430
We know more about this woman that we
know about just about anybody else in the

88
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:56,890
synoptic gospels.
We know that she's had seven husbands.

89
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,510
How many people do we know that about? We
know that, you know, she's a Samaritan.

90
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:05,360
We know where she lives,
we know that she goes out to draw water.

91
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
So there are a lot of places in the
gospel of John where characters actually

92
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:13,961
look much more lifelike and
filled out than they have been in,

93
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,930
uh,
the gospels that we've read so far.

94
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,980
This lecture is going to
focus on the gospel of John.

95
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,750
But as you've already figured out,

96
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,780
one of the main themes of the course is
how were the different forms of early

97
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:33,110
Christianity different from one another.
It wasn't just one movement.

98
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,910
It's not like some new
religion just sprang out of
the earth or fell from heaven.

99
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,270
So one of the things that the course has
been to look at the different kinds and

100
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:44,330
the gospel of John and then the letters
of John First, second, and third, John,

101
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:48,470
which we'll talk about next time, are a
wonderful example of this. And in fact,

102
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,360
what if you look at the syllabus,

103
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,670
today's lecture constitutes a certain
shift in the syllabus because although I

104
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:59,420
am talking about a gospel and I'm talking
and I have been talking about gospels,

105
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,610
I put a little subheading under,
uh,

106
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,860
this week that sort of like the spread
of Christianity and how Christianity,

107
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:09,350
different Christian groups look different.
We talked about that with,

108
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,820
with the book of acts last time,

109
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,110
but this time what we're going to do is
we're going to use Johanan Christianity,

110
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,870
just one of those fancy scholarly words,

111
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,820
just rest verse two different
kinds of John Christianity.

112
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,170
So we've got the gospel of John and we
have the three letters of John and they

113
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:31,430
are similar enough,

114
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,520
although it's quite debatable whether
they're all written by the same person.

115
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,010
We'll talk about that when we
get to the letters of John,

116
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,750
but they're similar enough in their
writing style and in their terminology and

117
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:46,130
their theological themes that we believe
that all four of these documents,

118
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,840
the gospel of John First
and second and third,

119
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:52,520
John Represent one form of early
Christianity and we're going to call that

120
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,320
Johannen Christianity.

121
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,620
Or somebody who might pronounce it
Johannie in Christianity the same thing.

122
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,720
So this lecture is going to focus on that.

123
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,230
So let's first look at the narrative
differences in the gospel of John.

124
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,080
I hope you notice this when
you're reading through it. First,

125
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,320
there's this prologue that I started
reading at the very beginning of the

126
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:10,070
lecture.

127
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,450
It has several major themes that
will occur throughout the Gospel,

128
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,050
and it's just packed into this prologue.
There's first,

129
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:23,220
Jesus is preexistence in no other gospel
do we get the idea that Jesus existed

130
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:26,990
before his birth?

131
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,270
That's counterintuitive to a lot of us
because whether you're a Christian or not

132
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:33,020
a Christian,

133
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,430
you're used to thinking about Jesus
as an eternal divine being who becomes

134
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:40,250
incarnate as a human being,
but always existed.

135
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,950
That's not in the other
gospels if you noticed,

136
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,320
but it's definitely here
in the gospel of John.

137
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,390
So we get the preexistence of Jesus and
his divinity right there in the prologue.

138
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,010
You get this theme of life.
You get this theme of light and darkness.

139
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,830
Jesus comes from light. He
comes into darkness. The
darkness doesn't receive him.

140
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:02,370
He brings light to his followers.
There's the coming into the world.

141
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,320
The world is not simply the
physical world that you and I know,

142
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,520
it's the cosmos,

143
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,880
the Greek Word Cosmos,

144
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,780
where we get the word cosmology,
all the universe.

145
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,150
So Jesus comes into the cosmos.

146
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,810
So the cosmos as a dark enemy,

147
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,120
place in which Jesus
invades it in a sense, uh,

148
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,000
is one of the major things with the
gospels that you get right here in the

149
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:33,420
prologue.
The world is a place of enmity.

150
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,140
The world hates Jesus.
The world hates the disciples.

151
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,430
The word hates you if you're a
follower of Jesus, birth from God.

152
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,640
So there's this idea that
people are born from God,

153
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,520
son and father linkage over and
over again. God is God is Jesus.

154
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,420
Father in the gospel of John Is.
That's true in some of the other gospels,

155
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:58,290
but it's just much more so in the
gospel of John, John The baptist,

156
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,820
as the lesser of the two is introduced
right in the prologue. We don't,

157
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,300
we don't take a while to get to John.
We have John the baptist,

158
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,740
right in verse six, there was a man
sent from God whose name was John.

159
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,610
He came as a witness to testify to the
light so that all might believe in him.

160
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,600
He himself was not the light. This guy
wants you to know from very beginning.

161
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,820
John the Baptist is not Jesus equal.

162
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,820
He's secondary witness just
so you don't get confused. Um,

163
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,470
there's the idea that
the law comes from Moses,

164
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,020
but grace and truth come from Jesus.

165
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,880
And there is this emphasis on seeing
and knowing as we'll talk about later.

166
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,830
And I hit some of the
major themes of the Gospel.

167
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,870
The seeing and knowing are two
definite themes for the gospel of John.

168
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,950
And it's all right.

169
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:48,150
They're wrapped up in the prologue to
the Gospel so that John is different from

170
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:51,570
anything else. Because in this
very, very elaborately constructed,

171
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,470
poetic sounding,
almost philosophical sounding prologue,

172
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,700
you get lots of the major themes of the
Gospel just laid out for you another.

173
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,740
So that's a narrative difference.

174
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,210
Another major narrative difference is
the relationship of Jesus and John the

175
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:10,170
Baptist and the synoptic gospels.
Jesus,

176
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:14,640
his ministry does not begin
until the arrest of John.

177
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,870
Did you notice this?

178
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Jesus goes to John the
Baptist to be baptized and it
looks like Jesus in a sense

179
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:22,890
as almost a disciple of John.

180
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,320
Although the gospel writers
try not to tell it that way,

181
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,400
but Jesus doesn't start his own preaching
ministry and his own healing ministry

182
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,930
until the Ministry of John the Baptist
is over. So for the synoptic Gospels,

183
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,200
John the Baptist Ministry comes here.
John the Baptist ministry stops.

184
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:41,550
Jesus has starts very clear
and the gospel of John,

185
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,570
that's not the way it is.
There two ministries overlap each other.

186
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,340
So for example,

187
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,800
sometimes John the Baptist is
baptizing and Jay and the Gospel.

188
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,850
John tells us that Jesus and his disciples
are baptizing and another part of the

189
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:58,570
Jordan. What we don't hear anything
like that. And the other gospels,

190
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,260
Jesus and his disciples over here in
another part of the Jordan baptizing their

191
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:04,960
disciples while John is
baptizing his disciples.

192
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,290
And then sometimes John's disciples
leave John and go over and join Jesus and

193
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:14,500
then there's some discussions between
them. Sometimes John The disciples,

194
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,510
John did John the Baptist disciples
come and ask Jesus the disciples, well,

195
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,030
you know, what is your master to
do about this or this or that?

196
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,100
So there is an overlap of
the two ministries that you
get in the gospel of John

197
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,130
and you don't get it all in the other
gospels. Another big difference,

198
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,750
Judea and Galilee,

199
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,590
if all you had were the
first three gospels,

200
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,270
the ideas you had had was that Jesus,

201
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:43,271
his entire ministry took place basically
in gasoline until the last part of his

202
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:44,824
life.

203
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,360
And then he journeys to Jerusalem
and according to the gospels,

204
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:53,530
he's only basically in Jerusalem for
one week and then he's crucified.

205
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,200
That's not the way it is. And
the gospel of John, in fact,

206
00:12:57,201 --> 00:13:02,201
did any of you notice where is the
cleansing of the temple incident and the

207
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:07,100
synoptic gospels? When does it
happen? C'Mon, c'mon, c'mon,

208
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,400
wake up. When does the cleansing of
the temple incident happen in Matthew,

209
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:13,660
mark and Luke?
All three of them.

210
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,500
I'm sorry. At the end, right?

211
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,010
Unlike maybe Wednesday
before he's executed,

212
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,880
it happens the last week of his life,
right before he was arrested. In fact,

213
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,390
the Gospel is present that as maybe
one of the reasons that he is arrested.

214
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,470
When does it happen in the
gospel of John Chapter Two?

215
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,970
Is it two? I can't remember.
This is it really too?

216
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,870
Okay it heck yes. It happens at
the very beginning of the Gospel.

217
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:45,550
I couldn't remember exactly
what chapter with that. Good.

218
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,780
So the cleansing of the temple happens
at the beginning of the gospel of John,

219
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,600
not the end. Uh, like in the others, uh,

220
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,250
the length of Jesus's ministry
in the synoptic Gospels,

221
00:13:57,251 --> 00:13:58,930
if all you have is an optic gospels,

222
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,130
it would look like the Ministry of
Jesus probably lasted maybe a year.

223
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,090
Not much more than that. There's just
no indication of how long it takes.

224
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,690
But he goes to Jerusalem only
one time for the Passover.

225
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,600
And that's at the end of his life.
In the gospel of John,

226
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,110
there are three different
mentions of Passovers.

227
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,560
There's the Passover in chapter two,
verse 13.

228
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:24,070
This is when he goes up to Jerusalem
and cleanses the temple there.

229
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,960
There's another Passover mentioned in
chapter six verse four and there's another

230
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:33,580
passive that mentioned in 13 verse one
that is the Passover that's at the end of

231
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,600
his life when he's arrested.

232
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,740
So there's three Passovers that occur
in Jesus's ministry according to the

233
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:39,574
gospel of John.

234
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Have you ever heard the tradition that
Jesus was 30 years old when he started

235
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:50,380
his ministry and his
ministry lasted three years,

236
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,630
so he would've been dead at
33 you may have heard that.

237
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,500
Do you know how people got that tradition?
It's not in the Bible anywhere.

238
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:03,430
They get the 30 year old idea from reading
some passages in Luke and the idea of

239
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:05,840
when he started his ministry,

240
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,650
they get the three years from
lean reading the gospel of John.

241
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,430
So notice how they've taken one little
detail about Jesus' life from Luke,

242
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,290
a different detail from John.

243
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,510
They combined them together
to give you the tradition,

244
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,170
but no gospel actually
has that teaching in it.

245
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,550
Christians have pulled these gospel,
the details from the gospels together.

246
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,960
That's because Jon's the only one that
indicates that according to his reckoning,

247
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,630
do you use this man? Administry
covered at least three Passovers.

248
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,300
The other gospels don't have that.
Jesus has parents and hometown.

249
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,000
According to Matthew,
Jesus is family is simply from Bethlehem.

250
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,010
That's where they start off.
That's where they end up.

251
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,370
So Jesus families from Bethlehem,
Jesus later goes to Galilee.

252
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:54,050
According to the gospel of Luke Jesus,
his family is from Galilee.

253
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,900
They go to Bethlehem only for the census
and then a month or so after the birth

254
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:02,990
they go back to Galilee.
So you've got differences right there.

255
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,830
Matthew simply has used his family from
Judy at in the beginning and they ended

256
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:11,450
up moving to Galilee after they go
to Egypt. Luke has them from Galilee,

257
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,270
go to Judea, go back to Galilee. John
doesn't have anything about this Bethel,

258
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,700
him birth. In fact, he has an,

259
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:21,950
in chapter seven verse 31 people say,

260
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,640
how can you be the Messiah who says the
Messiah supposed to come from Galilee

261
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,440
and [inaudible] have to come to a gallon?

262
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,880
There's massage was come from Bethlehem.

263
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:30,460
Yeah,

264
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,630
and the writer of gospel of John,

265
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:35,320
wouldn't it be a great time if he
could just say, oh, these stupid Jews,

266
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:38,830
they don't know that Jesus actually was
born in Bethlehem and therefore he is

267
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,940
from Judea. He doesn't say anything
like that. He just allows the reader,

268
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,670
you the reader to believe that,
yeah,

269
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,440
Jesus really watched from Galilee and
you know what? That doesn't matter.

270
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,260
They must've gotten it wrong.

271
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,300
They must not have thought that the
Messiah could actually come from Galilee,

272
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,250
but he can. So again, the gospel of John
Different and its narrative structures.

273
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,540
The last supper,

274
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,740
the last supper in the synoptic
gospels is a Passover meal.

275
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,030
The last supper in John
is not a Passover meal.

276
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,503
Yeah.

277
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,391
In fact,

278
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:19,391
also the last supper is not the
institution of the Eucharist and John and

279
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:20,600
Christian churches.

280
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,800
We observe the mass or
the Eucharist and we say,

281
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,800
Jesus established this in his
last supper with his disciples.

282
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,630
Do this in memory of me.

283
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,510
Yeah.

284
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,380
That goes back to Matthew, mark and Luke.
The Gospel of John doesn't have that.

285
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,400
There's no place in the gospel of John
where Jesus initiates the last separate.

286
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:41,800
He doesn't take the cup.
He doesn't take the blood and say,

287
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:44,980
do this in memory of me. What happens at
the Last Supper in the gospel of John,

288
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,430
he has a foot washing.
There's a foot washing ceremony.

289
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,960
Notice again what Christian
tradition has done here.

290
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,760
Any of you know what Maundy Thursday
means and Christian churches?

291
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,320
Monday, Thursday refers to the
Thursday before Good Friday,

292
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,540
which is the Friday before Easter and
on Good Friday, according to the uh,

293
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:11,570
tradition Jesus was executed the
Thursday night before is when the he has,

294
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:13,710
the last step was disciples.
Now,

295
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,680
in many Christian churches on
the Thursday before Easter,

296
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:20,040
not only will they have the Eucharist
service so that our communion service,

297
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,700
but they'll also have a foot washing
service at the church where I go,

298
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:24,534
the priests,

299
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,330
the different priests will actually get
down on their hands and knees and put

300
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:29,490
towels around themselves
and washed the feet. I mean,

301
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:32,730
anybody in the church who comes forward
on Thursday night before Easter,

302
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,040
they're doing that in imitation of
Jesus's foot washing of his disciples.

303
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,630
At the last supper in John, but
notice what we've done here. Again,

304
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:47,160
Christians have combined the last supper
and the Eucharist establishment from

305
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:52,161
the synoptic gospels with the foot washing
service from the gospel of John and

306
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:56,280
they put them together but they
weren't together in our Bible.

307
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,440
They were in two separate documents.

308
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,810
The arrest is also very different in
the synoptic gospels and it's an optic

309
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:04,410
gospels.

310
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:09,030
They come to arrest Jesus and they just
arrested him and there's a few things in

311
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:11,160
the gospel of John is
funny, funny, funny scene.

312
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:14,520
It's actually very humorous where they
come up with the swords and the clubs,

313
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,070
you know it's middle of the
night and the garden and they,

314
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,470
they come to Jesus and a Jesus says
who you are looking for and they say,

315
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:22,470
Jesus of Nazareth and Jesus says, I am
he and they all fall over in the ground.

316
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,310
It's like an Indiana Jones thing.
They,

317
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,760
you know the power of him saying this
knocks them all over and they get up and

318
00:19:29,761 --> 00:19:31,200
do it again and they all fall over again.

319
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,190
The whole scene of the arrest
of Jesus is very different.

320
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,580
The Gospel of John at his trial in the,
in the synoptic gospels,

321
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,880
Jesus says almost nothing.
This an optic.

322
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,530
Some of the synoptics say he said nothing.

323
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,020
Others if they're not going to say
he said something, but he's very,

324
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:48,210
very quiet and the gospel of John,

325
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,680
he just carries on this whole
philosophical discussion
with pilot about what is

326
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:55,350
truth.
He just keeps talking and talking.

327
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,030
Very different scene on the crucifixion.
There's some differences.

328
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:04,620
Remember I'm here for rehearsing just
narrative differences between the first

329
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:05,520
three gospels and John.

330
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:09,060
These are places where just the
story is different and its details.

331
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,450
According to the first three gospels,

332
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,740
the crucifixion takes place
on the first day of Passover,

333
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,720
the Thursday night supper.

334
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:23,520
Remember in Jewish calendar
reckoning a day begins at sundown,

335
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,130
so on sundown of Thursday night,

336
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,400
that's beginning of Friday
and in the synoptic gospels,

337
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,140
that's the beginning of the Passover.

338
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,060
So they wait until sundown and they have
the Passover meal Thursday night and

339
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:40,050
that's the beginning of Friday. The first
day of Passover and it's on the Friday,

340
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:43,020
the first day of Passover that
Jesus is actually executed.

341
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,720
That's not the way it is.
In the gospel of John.

342
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,880
Read the Execution Narrative
in the gospel of John.

343
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,650
According to the gospel of John,

344
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,850
Jesus is not crucified on
the first day of Passover.

345
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,840
He's crucified on the day before Passover.

346
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,490
And how do we know that?

347
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,690
Because it says when they were crucifying
him was the same time they were

348
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:07,240
executing. They were slaughtering
the lambs in the temple.

349
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,020
Notice it's a wonderful little
symbolism, right? Right.

350
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,490
When Jesus being slaughtered,

351
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,880
the lambs for the Passover meal are
being slaughtered because what you do of

352
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:19,390
course,
if you are a Jew and Jerusalem,

353
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,800
you'd take your lamb to
the priests on Thursday,

354
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,180
you'd have them slaughter it, pour out
the blood, that take a little bit of it.

355
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,260
Then you take it back home to your family
or to the hotel where you're staying

356
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:35,660
or to the picnic ground where you're
staying and you cook your lamb and that's

357
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,100
where you have the Passover meal.
So according to the gospel of John,

358
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,330
Jesus is executed at the same time
that they're slaughtering the lambs,

359
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,550
which means he's not executed
on the day of Passover.

360
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:48,790
But the day before Passover,
completely different.

361
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,230
And the last big narrative difference
with the gospel of John from the synoptics

362
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,380
is this guy named the beloved disciple.

363
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,260
Who the hell is the beloved disciple?
We don't know who he is.

364
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,880
According to Dan Brown and the,
what's that awful book? Um,

365
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,840
Davinci Code, right?
According to Da Vinci Code,

366
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,100
the beloved disciple is actually
a girl, Mary Magdalen, I guess,

367
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,760
cause he couldn't believe that Jesus
could be, you know, attracted to a guy.

368
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,880
So he had to invent a girl to be the
beloved disciple and heterosexist.

369
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,120
As you know,
modern novelists are no,

370
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:33,150
the beloved disciple is a man and we
don't even know who he is. He's Jesus,

371
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,660
favorite disciple and the gospel of John.

372
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,470
This character doesn't
exist in the other gospels.

373
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,630
He's just not there. Now, tradition has
said, who is the beloved disciple? Well,

374
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:48,610
it's, it's the John's son of Zebedee,
younger brother of James, son of Zebedee.

375
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,550
And if you go to the art gallery,
which you will later in the semester,

376
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:53,740
we're all gonna take a
tour of the El art gallery.

377
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,840
You'll see that when John son
of Zebedee is depicted in art,

378
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:02,620
he's always depicted as a young man
without a beard. Very beautiful,

379
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:03,790
almost feminine looking.

380
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,360
Cause he's sort of representing
the boy that Jesus loved.

381
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,820
Well we don't know that it was John.

382
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,490
The Gospel of John doesn't
tell us it was uh, John.

383
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,290
It just tells us is the beloved disciple.

384
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,190
So most scholars just willing to say
whoever this beloved disciple was,

385
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:23,340
and maybe it was just a figment of the
literary pretensions of this writer.

386
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,440
Maybe there was no historical
beloved disciple. We don't know.

387
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,700
But he's a strong character in this gospel
and he doesn't appear any place else.

388
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,220
But in this gospel
notice in all those ways,

389
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,580
the gospel of John is very different
from the other three gospels.

390
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,990
That in itself makes it
really interesting to study.

391
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,560
It opens up a window for
us of an different kind of
early Christianity then we

392
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:53,660
would have if we didn't have this gospel.
So it's really wonderful.

393
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,630
Okay,
so major Johanan themes.

394
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,690
I'm going to go through this pretty
quickly because if you just take a

395
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:02,240
concordance and look up these terms,

396
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,170
you can look at all the
different places first.

397
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,750
Notice that some of these main themes,
I've already mentioned,

398
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:10,340
some of them when I was
talking about the prologue,

399
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,210
these main themes occur over
and over and over again,

400
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:16,850
like the ringing of Bells
in the gospel of John.

401
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,510
Every once in a while you'll see one in
one chapter and then you might not hear

402
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:22,220
it to the next chapter,
a few chapters later,

403
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,840
but then they'll just keep coming up.

404
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,280
So this author hits you over the head
several times throughout the gospel with

405
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:30,200
the same themes coming back at you.

406
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,150
One of them is the descending
and ascending redeemer figure.

407
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:41,060
Jesus is, uh, the one
who came down from above.

408
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:43,130
Who's going up.
Look at one 51.

409
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,910
Now we're going to run like
bunnies through the text here.

410
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,550
So get your text out and be prepared.
Lick your finger.

411
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,490
Come on, look your finger. You're not
going to get sick. It's your own finger.

412
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,960
One 51 and he said to him,
very truly, I tell you,

413
00:25:01,961 --> 00:25:06,370
you will see heaven open and the angels
of God ascending and descending upon the

414
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,280
son of man. So the angels are
ascending. Look at three 13

415
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,100
no one has ascended into heaven except
the one who descended from heaven.

416
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:21,140
The son, the son of man. Look at, uh,

417
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:26,060
three 31. The one who comes from above is
above all the one who was up the earth,

418
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:27,980
belongs to the earth and
speaks about earthly things.

419
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:29,810
The one who comes from
heaven is above all.

420
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,570
And I could go on one 30 to six 38,
six 41,

421
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,850
six 58,
2017.

422
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:43,190
Just look up this coming and rising and
you look up these words in a concordance

423
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,740
and you'll find they recur over and
over. And again, the gospel of John,

424
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:50,180
very similar to that one is
the theme of being lifted up.

425
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,360
So Jesus and three 14 and 1232 in
eight 28 you don't need to see,

426
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:58,610
remember these numbers because you've got,

427
00:25:58,611 --> 00:26:01,910
you can look at a concordance and you can
read this and you can just mark out in

428
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:05,180
the margins of your Bible. Whenever
you see this idea and all of those.

429
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:08,660
Jesus is the one who will be lifted up.
And this is a puzzle.

430
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,570
One of things we'll find it the gospel
of John Likes Puzzles. He likes riddles.

431
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,610
So what does this mean when Jesus talks
about the son of man being lifted up?

432
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,880
Does it mean his ascension into heaven?

433
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,390
Does it mean his
resurrection from the dead?

434
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,570
Does it mean his being put on a cross?

435
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:28,220
Because when you nailed
somebody on a cross,

436
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,340
you did it on the ground and
then you put them up like this.

437
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,810
So does the lifting up of the son of
man refer to his crews or fiction or as

438
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:39,920
resurrection or his ascension?
Going back to the father.

439
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,200
It's a puzzle we're never told.
Exactly.

440
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,000
And that's one of the wonderful things
about this Texas that it plays with you

441
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:49,560
all the time. It wants you to wonder
about what's being meant here.

442
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:53,100
So that lifted up is one of the themes
that goes along with this going up and

443
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:55,500
coming down.
And then another part of that theme,

444
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:59,700
see these things get complicated is when
Jesus says, everyone who comes to me,

445
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:04,080
when I am lifted up, I
will lift up. So God says,

446
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,370
so Jesus says he will lift up
people who are his disciples.

447
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,940
So this going up and coming down
is all the way through the gospels.

448
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:15,090
That's one of the main things
I mentioned seeing. Okay,

449
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:18,300
we're going to run like bunnies
through the text. One 18

450
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,720
no one has ever seen God.

451
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:25,710
It is God the only son who is close to
the father's heart who has made him known.

452
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,490
Oh, now see I should told you,
knowing is another theme there.

453
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:32,310
We got two themes right in the
same versus seeing and knowing.

454
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,030
And the relationship between seeing and
knowing and the gospel of John is also

455
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,160
difficult.
It's not always clear.

456
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:43,490
Do you know by seeing or is seeing the
seeing lead to an inadequate farm of

457
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:50,601
knowing these are big exegetical problems
that the gospel of John Poses and

458
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:51,960
scholars argue about.

459
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Look at one 34 and I myself have seen and
have testified that this is the son of

460
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:02,520
God. Okay, I have seen, look at one 39

461
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,330
he came to them,
come and see.

462
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,680
They came and saw where he was
staying and there it's just looking at

463
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,700
concordance for every
time you find the word,

464
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:16,500
see saw seeing and you'll just
find it over and over again.

465
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,310
Uh, chapter three verse three,
Chapter Three, verse 11 chapter three,

466
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:25,020
Verse 32 chapter three, verse 36, several
right there in chapter three, et Cetera,

467
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:29,400
et Cetera, et cetera. And
again, it's always a little
bit difficult to figure out.

468
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:35,450
Do you have to see to have faith in the
gospel of John or because it sounds like

469
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:39,720
one place toward the end of the Gospel,
Jesus says,

470
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,600
blessed are those who
believe without seeing.

471
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,740
Is this the Thomas busted or you, you, you
saw and so you believe so. That's okay.

472
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,680
Blessed are those who
have not seen and believe.

473
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,300
So as seeing an inadequate form of faith,

474
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:01,250
is it better to have faith without
seeing or seeing necessary for faith?

475
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,390
It's a problem. I already
mentioned knowing, but I can
do the same kind of thing.

476
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:10,660
A chapter one verse 18 Chapter Eight
verse 55 chapter 14 verse 17 over and over

477
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:16,631
again where Jesus came from and where
Jesus is going is a major theme with the

478
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:20,930
Jews off. And he'll say, you can't
go. You can't go where I'm going.

479
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,030
And they say,
what is he talking about going,

480
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,670
you're going to go out to the
Greeks and preach to the Greeks,

481
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,010
going to go back to Galilee.
What am I going?

482
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,490
So there people are always
misunderstanding this.

483
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,670
And then one of the other points is signs.
How do sign?

484
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,440
What are signs in the gospel of John?

485
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:42,820
Notice the gospel of John has other that
I haven't even mentioned. For example,

486
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,090
member in the synoptic gospels,
there are lots of exorcisms of demons.

487
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,830
Do you use is going around a lot,

488
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,610
casting out demons from people
and the demons even confess him.

489
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,650
Do you know there's not one
exorcism in the gospel of John.

490
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:03,660
Jesus is not an exorcist in the gospel
of John as he is in the other three

491
00:30:04,991 --> 00:30:06,910
gospels.
Why is that?

492
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,350
Obviously this rider knew that there were
stories circulating around that Jesus

493
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,184
cast out demons.

494
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,150
Why does he not have Jesus doing any
casting out of demons in his Gospel?

495
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,783
I don't know.

496
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,750
There's probably a dissertation.
There's somewhere you can find an answer.

497
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,210
Look at two 11

498
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,880
so one of the things is that in the
other gospels they talk about Jesus's

499
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:40,860
miracles, his healings, but the term
preferred by this gospel writer,

500
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:45,390
his sign, he talks about the things you
use do as sign. There's not a lot of them.

501
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:48,000
Jesus doesn't do a whole lot of
miracles in the gospel of John,

502
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:51,150
he does some big important ones.
They become famous, for example,

503
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,740
turning water into wine,

504
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,100
which is of course every college
student's favorite miracle of Jesus.

505
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,720
If only he had turned it into beer, that
might've been a little bit better, right?

506
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,980
But Jesus is famous for turning water
into wine, one of his major miracles.

507
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,410
It's only in the gospel of John.
It's not in the other gospels.

508
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,220
So some of Jesus' famous Gospel, a famous
miracles are in the gospel of John,

509
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,770
but they're not called miracles.
In John, they're called signs.

510
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:18,950
So look at two 11 Jesus did this,

511
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,450
the first of his signs,

512
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,190
this is the turning the water into wine
in Caina of Galilee and revealed his

513
00:31:26,191 --> 00:31:30,090
glory and the disciples believed in him.
Notice the first of his signs.

514
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,420
Let's look over it a little bit.
Four 54

515
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,450
yeah.

516
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:43,070
Now this was the second sign that Jesus
did after coming from Judea to Galilee,

517
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,953
the second side.

518
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,700
This has actually led some scholars to
say that one of the sources this rider

519
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:51,950
may have had is a signs book,

520
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:56,360
a collection of signs that
his miracles that Jesus did,

521
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:00,170
but notice they're not just a miracle
that Jesus does and then casts off.

522
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,860
I think that the,
this,

523
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,110
the author uses the term sign because
most of the time you can actually do an

524
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,850
exit.
Jesus of these signs,

525
00:32:07,851 --> 00:32:10,460
narratives and they have some
kind of symbolic meaning.

526
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,090
So the signs and and,

527
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:17,060
and gospel of John are not just
miracles to prove Jesus's power.

528
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,060
They seem to have some kind of theological
or symbolic meaning embedded into

529
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,130
them also. So the signs again is one of
the major themes of the gospel of John.

530
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,050
But one of the most important things
that drives the gospel of John is

531
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:31,130
sectarianism.

532
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,270
What do I mean by sectarianism?

533
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,120
According to sociology of religion,
a sect,

534
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,930
it's not necessarily just an insult.
In other words, you don't just say, Oh,

535
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:53,690
you're just a member of some
crazy little sect out there.

536
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,970
Handling snakes are doing
other kinds of things.

537
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,620
A sect is a sociological term
that refers to any group,

538
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:01,760
whether it's religious or not,

539
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:05,990
although we usually can to use us in
religious context that considers itself

540
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:10,070
very well cut off from the rest
of society. So for example,

541
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,780
I grew up in a very,

542
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:15,830
very sectarian fundamentalist
church in Texas.

543
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,510
By sectarian,

544
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:22,511
I mean that we basically believe that
we in my church were the only ones going

545
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:24,830
to heaven.
So in fact,

546
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:28,580
we would call each other brother or sister
and you wouldn't even call a baptist.

547
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:31,130
I mean, we were, we thought the
southern baptist, we're going to help

548
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,480
you know that that's how much we were.
The only ones there were no,

549
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,240
there was nobody who was, who
was right, like we were, right.

550
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,850
So you'd call each other brother, brother
Lamar, all the old men in the church,

551
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:44,900
especially we call brother.

552
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,620
But you wouldn't call people
brother who were outside that group.

553
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,880
So we were the only Christians. You
had to be in our group. In fact,

554
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,910
people would even talk about, you know,
something like if you, if you, if you, uh,

555
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,600
brought somebody to church as a visitor,
somebody might come up and you say, well,

556
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,720
is she a member of the church?

557
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,790
They didn't need to say our church
or our denomination, the church,

558
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:13,010
because the church meant our church.
So this,

559
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,910
what made this group of sectarian
group was we had very firm boundaries.

560
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,270
There were debates about whether it was
okay to marry outside of that boundary.

561
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,690
Could you actually marry
a Methodist? Oh God, no.

562
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,080
And God help you aroma Catholic.

563
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,470
So the stronger the walls,

564
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,820
the stronger the walls between
your group and outsiders.

565
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,670
The more sectarian your social group is.

566
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:43,280
John's church seems to be
a very sectarian group,

567
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,990
and that's one of the things people,

568
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,500
why is he talked so much about dark
and light. These are stark divisions.

569
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,880
Insiders,
outsiders,

570
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,990
up below there are children of
light and children of darkness.

571
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,550
They're children of God and children
of Satan. There's no in between.

572
00:34:58,551 --> 00:35:00,770
There's no gray area.
You're either in or you're out.

573
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:05,180
So scholars define this by talking
about Joe Hannan, sectarianism,

574
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,820
the insider,
outsider divisions.

575
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,950
And we're going to look at
one place where that comes up.

576
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,490
Look at chapter nine.

577
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,630
I'm going to spend a little more time
with this chapter because some scholars

578
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:21,140
have used this to say what's
going on in the gospel of John?

579
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,850
So get chapter nine, get
your bibles out. You know,

580
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:27,643
I may lie to you,

581
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,950
this is a story about Jesus
healing a man born blind.

582
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,700
So I'm going to skip around, do
it. But uh, first he heals him.

583
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:43,980
And then nine verse 10, they
kept saying, Kim, that is this.

584
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:47,340
Arounders then how were your eyes opened?
He answered,

585
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:50,610
the man called Jesus made mud,
spread it on my eyes and said to me,

586
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:53,730
go to salon and wash. Then I went
and washed and received my sight.

587
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,260
They said to him, where is
he noticed this? Where is he?

588
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,470
How do your eyes open?

589
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,240
Yeah.

590
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,830
And he says, I do not. No, no, no, no, no.

591
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:14,070
I now see, see, see where, where,

592
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,933
where is he?

593
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,520
Okay.

594
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,780
They brought him to the Pharisees.

595
00:36:17,781 --> 00:36:20,660
The man who had front of him right now
was the Sabbath Day. That, wait a minute,

596
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:22,830
hit verse 13 for crying out loud.

597
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:26,550
We'd been 12 verses into this chapter
in this story and only at verse 13.

598
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,820
Are we told that it's a sabbath
day. Why not? Why is that? Well,

599
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:34,290
because apparently what started
out as a simple healing story,

600
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,860
this author has decided to
turn into a conflict story.

601
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,470
Have you noticed it in a lot
of the stories of the Gospels?

602
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,410
Some stories just seem to be
straightforward. Miracle Stories.

603
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:49,170
Other stories seem to be nature miracles,
like not just healings, but he, uh, uh,

604
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,310
power over nature.

605
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,140
And then there are lots of stories
that are conflict stories that is,

606
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:56,910
you're told that someone was healed.

607
00:36:56,911 --> 00:36:59,670
But the real important part of the story
not was not necessarily just that they

608
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:01,980
were healed,
but that they were healed on the sabbath.

609
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,330
And that starts a conflict between Jesus
and other Jews about what's permissive

610
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,410
permitted to do on the Sabbath.

611
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,090
By the time you get to verse 13 what
started out as simply a healing story,

612
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,900
although it may have had symbolic meaning
because the man's blind and he comes

613
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:16,411
to see,

614
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:20,430
and those are big important themes for
gospel of John now becomes a conflict

615
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:21,360
story over the sabbath.

616
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:22,850
Yeah.

617
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,910
So He, he tells the story
again to the Pharisees and,

618
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,170
and a chapter and verse 1317 so
they said again to the blind man,

619
00:37:30,171 --> 00:37:34,370
this is the farracies. What do you say
about him? It was your eyes. He opened.

620
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,090
He said he is a prophet.
Okay, so that's important.

621
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,620
The Jews did not believe this is
verse 18 then he had been born blind.

622
00:37:42,621 --> 00:37:45,440
They received a site until they called
the parents or the man who had received

623
00:37:45,441 --> 00:37:48,770
his sight. And ask him, is this
your son who you say was born blind?

624
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,210
How then does he see his parents said,
we,

625
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,170
we know that this is our
son and that was born blind.

626
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,250
We do not know how it is that he now sees,
nor do we know who opened his eyes.

627
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,840
Ask Him. He is of age. He'll speak
for itself. His parents said this.

628
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,180
This is the narrator speaking.
Now,

629
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,860
his parents said this because
they were afraid of the Jews.

630
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,360
Now wait a minute,

631
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,800
okay.

632
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,510
All the people in this story are Jews.

633
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,020
Yeah.

634
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:20,460
Jesus is a Jew. The blind man's
a you. His parents are Jews.

635
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,050
They're all Jews.

636
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:27,480
Why are we talking about some
people being afraid of the Jews?

637
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,840
For the Jews had already agreed that
anyone who confessed Jews to me,

638
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:40,240
the Messiah would be put
out of the synagogue. Now,

639
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,960
I hate to pay her folks,
but that's just outright anachronistic.

640
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:50,430
There was no movement going on during
the life of Jesus where anybody that

641
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:54,160
confessed anybody to be a
synagogue would be x. Communicate.

642
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:57,700
I mean Jesus to be the Messiah would
be excommunicated from the synagogue.

643
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,750
That just didn't happen.

644
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,530
There were all kinds of people
who thought were MSI was around.

645
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:06,340
There were debates about this,
but you didn't have any synagogue.

646
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:08,530
Ruler is going around saying,
well, we're going to make a rule.

647
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:13,630
Anybody who claims that Jesus of Nazareth
is the Messiah will be excommunicated,

648
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:17,590
will take their union card away from them.
They can't come to high holidays.

649
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,390
We will return their dues.
It just wasn't going on.

650
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:28,330
Now, it may have been going on decades
later when this guy wrote the gospel.

651
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:33,190
You see,
so what's now we'll keep reading.

652
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:36,130
What's going on here,
of course is what you believe about Jesus.

653
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:40,270
The Messiah has to do with whether you
will be allowed to stay in a synagogue.

654
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,350
If you take Jews to be just a profit,
you might be allowed to stay.

655
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,010
If you confess these messiah,
you'll be kicked out of the synagogue.

656
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,830
That's the basic conflict of the story,

657
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,750
so we keep reading and there's a,
they go into more and more conflict.

658
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:00,310
Look at verse 30 then the man answered.
There's basically saying, look,

659
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:03,820
we know Moses, this guy can't
immune Asya. He must be wrong.

660
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,310
The manager here is an astonishing thing.

661
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:10,270
This is the man born blind whose now
sees you do not know where he comes from.

662
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,790
Comes from, comes from,
comes from, comes from,

663
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,170
and yet he opened my
eyes. See, I see, I see.

664
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,990
We know that God does
not listen to sinners,

665
00:40:19,991 --> 00:40:21,690
but he does listen to
one who worships him.

666
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:25,540
In no basis will never since the world
began has it been heard that anyone

667
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:27,190
opened the eyes of a person born blind?

668
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:30,880
If this man man were not from God,

669
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,500
Oh God. Oh God, okay.

670
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,350
He could do nothing.
They answered him.

671
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,990
You are born entirely in sins
and are you trying to teach us?

672
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:41,560
And they drove him out.
They kicked him out of the synagogue.

673
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,090
Jesus heard that they had driven him
out any. When he found him. He said,

674
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,420
do you believe in the son of man?
He answered and who is he, sir?

675
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,730
Tell me so that I might believe in him.
Jesus said to him,

676
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,350
you have seen him and the one speaking
with you is he? He said, Lord, I believe,

677
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,130
and he worshiped him. Jesus
said, and this is how,

678
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,520
this is how the story ends.
Okay, so this must be important.

679
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:09,450
I came into this world for judgment so
that those who do not see may see now as

680
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:14,800
Jesus still talking just
about blind people. No,

681
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,800
we can see that the whole
story was an allegory now

682
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,550
and those who do see may become blind.

683
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,400
Some of the Pharisees near him
heard this and said to him,

684
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,320
surely we're not blind are we? Jesus
said to them, if you were blind,

685
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,940
you would not have sin.

686
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:35,750
But now that say we see
you're thin remains.

687
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,680
Some scholars have pointed out that
what's going on with this chapter,

688
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:44,681
chapter nine in John is a wonderful way
to see how the rider himself has taken

689
00:41:45,951 --> 00:41:50,720
what may have been a simple miracle story
that he got from tradition about Jesus

690
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:55,220
healing a blind man and he does a couple
of things with it. For one thing, he,

691
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,590
he pulls up to the surface this,

692
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,760
these themes about blindness and seeing
and coming from God and this is all

693
00:42:03,651 --> 00:42:07,730
plays into the identity
of Jesus as the Messiah.

694
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,950
And then he tells the story like the blind
man is sort of like someone who comes

695
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:16,370
to faith in Jesus as the
Messiah and he recognizes it.

696
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,080
But sure enough,

697
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,320
if he really confesses that he's got
to be thrown out of the synagogue.

698
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:24,480
And so he leaves the synagogue
and he joins up with Jesus. He,

699
00:42:24,481 --> 00:42:28,190
he's thrown out of the
synagogue. He becomes a disciple
of Jesus. In other words,

700
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:29,180
[inaudible] is speaking,

701
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,170
he has to leave the synagogue
and therefore he becomes
a member of John's church.

702
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,920
There are other people who suspect
that Jesus may well be the Messiah.

703
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:43,510
They want to confess them and they don't
do so that cause they're afraid about

704
00:42:43,511 --> 00:42:45,370
being excommunicated from the synagogue.

705
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:52,150
Notice how this story has
become an allegory for what's
going on in the time of

706
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:55,250
the writing of the piece itself.

707
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,310
The Gospel rider is telling
a story about a blind man,

708
00:42:58,311 --> 00:43:03,311
but he's also telling a story about the
conflict that his church is having with

709
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,960
the synagogue in the neighborhood.

710
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:08,220
Yeah.

711
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:13,220
This and the main thing that's going on
here also is that Jesus is the one who

712
00:43:14,131 --> 00:43:18,510
brings about this
division that takes place.

713
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,100
What's the main focus of the division?

714
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:29,340
Christology. Remember I talked last
time about different Christologies what?

715
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:33,450
What Christology is is what do you
believe about the nature of Jesus Christ?

716
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,740
Is he just human? Is it
God? Is he some of both?

717
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:42,330
Is he a prophet? Is He only a
prophet? Is he a moral teacher?

718
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:47,190
Is He only a moral teacher? Is he the son
of God? Is he equal to God the father?

719
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:52,191
All these are options and the first
several hundred years of Christianity is,

720
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:58,130
is all wrapped up in fights over which
of the many different options you have

721
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,220
for what you believe about Jesus is
going to end up being the right one.

722
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,740
What's going to end up as orthodoxy?

723
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:10,580
The Gospel of John is a wonderful place
to see this very thing starting out.

724
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:16,080
So look at chapter five verse 19

725
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,070
Actually No,
we're going to go back and look at,

726
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:26,830
yeah, that's right.
Let's go look at five 19.

727
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:30,160
I'm going to back up in a minute and
go back to some other, uh, dialogues.

728
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,350
Don't worry, I'll on time today, but
we will probably take up again, uh,

729
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:39,090
some of the gospel of John next time
before we talk about the letters of John

730
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,530
Chapter Five, verse
19, Jesus said to them,

731
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,310
very truly, I tell you, the
son can do nothing on his own,

732
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:51,390
but only what he sees the father
doing for whatever the father does,

733
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,770
the son does.
Likewise,

734
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,210
the father loves the son and shows him
all that he himself is doing and he will

735
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:59,580
show him greater works than
these so that you will not,

736
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,110
you will be astonished indeed,

737
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,690
just as the father raises
the dead and gives them life.

738
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,240
So also the son gives life
to whomever he wishes.

739
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:10,230
The father judges no one but has given
all judgement to the son so that all may

740
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:12,090
honor the son just as
they honor the father.

741
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:16,950
Anyone who does not honor the son does
not honor the father who sent him. Verily,

742
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:17,850
truly,
I tell you,

743
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:22,020
anyone who hears my word and believes
him who sent me has eternal life and does

744
00:45:22,021 --> 00:45:25,460
not come into judgment,
but has passed from death to life.

745
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:29,360
Look at five 18 right before that.

746
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,910
For this reason,
the Jews were seeking,

747
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,013
hmm.

748
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,251
Yeah.
For this reason,

749
00:45:37,251 --> 00:45:40,670
the Jews were seeking all the more to
kill him because he was not only breaking

750
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:44,640
the sabbath, but was also
calling God his own father. Now,

751
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:46,380
that's so far we've,
you've gotten in the narrative,

752
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:49,180
but notice what the the author
ads right after that, the law,

753
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:54,210
the next very phrase,
thereby making himself equal to God,

754
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,050
is every son always equal to a father?
Go like this?

755
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,890
Nope.
All sons are not equal to all fathers.

756
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:13,230
The Gospel writer is editorializing
because this is what he believes.

757
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:18,720
He believes that not only is Jesus God's
son in some kind of derivative sense,

758
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:22,980
he believes that by saying that God's,
that Jesus is God's son,

759
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:26,700
he's actually equal to God.
The father.

760
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,650
Look at eight 58 I'm going to come back
and talk about chapter eight next time.

761
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:41,730
There's this chapter eight is one of these
classic scenes in the gospel of John,

762
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:47,610
which start out with Jesus just talking
to someone in what seems to be a cordial

763
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,590
and relatively peaceful mood.

764
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,620
And then as the conversation goes on,

765
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,330
things get more and more heated
and people accused Jesus of things.

766
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:01,720
But Jesus is just as bad.
He accuses people of stuff all the time,

767
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,290
ridiculous stuff.
Some time like they're children of Satan

768
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,030
and the whole thing ends up with this
big division and everybody's starting to

769
00:47:10,031 --> 00:47:11,110
throw things at each other.

770
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,430
And then the next chapter will start
and you'll see them talking again.

771
00:47:15,431 --> 00:47:17,200
And again,
it comes down to a big division.

772
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,850
So this is the end of chapter eight which
is one of these scenes of a discussion

773
00:47:21,851 --> 00:47:25,030
turning into a fight, turning into
a brawl, turning into a division,

774
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,860
and where does it end?

775
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:32,440
Chapter Verse 58 Chapter Eight
Jesus said to them, very truly,

776
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:35,200
I tell you before Abraham was,

777
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,720
I am.
So they picked up stones to throw at him.

778
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:43,100
Yeah.

779
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:47,840
Isn't that interesting?
All he has to say is I am.

780
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,180
Why is that so much of a problem
where it is? I am come from,

781
00:47:53,181 --> 00:47:54,014
yes.

782
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:55,123
Yeah.

783
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:01,630
That's the declaration of what God is.
When God says I am.

784
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,460
To whom and where in the Bible,
Moses in front of the burning Bush,

785
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:09,460
exactly the very name of God,

786
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:13,150
which those of us who are non Jewish,
we use to say is y'all way.

787
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,970
There are only four
letters write in Hebrew,

788
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:19,210
and those four letters don't
have vowels attached to them.

789
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:23,320
So we're not really sure how to
pronounce them. And your English Bible,

790
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:26,590
they're usually translated
by lord in small caps.

791
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:31,000
Whenever you see lord in small caps in
your English translation of the Hebrew

792
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,890
Bible,
that means that the Tetra Gramaton,

793
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,490
the four letters of God's
name or in the Hebrew,

794
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:40,660
but according to Pius Jewish usage,
you'd never pronounced those.

795
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,330
So you'd say something like
the Lord as a substitute.

796
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,670
And that's the way in
the Greek Bible it does.

797
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:48,310
Since the Greek Bible didn't
know what the name was,

798
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,340
it just would say Adonai the
Lord or something like that.

799
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,200
And so we'll use that
in English translation,

800
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:58,620
but that scholars think that perhaps the
best translation for those four letters

801
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,200
as they occur in accidents
is beingness or I am

802
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,300
knows what Jesus' saying.

803
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:11,740
He's claiming to be the one who
spoke to Moses out of the bush.

804
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:13,930
That's radical.

805
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,250
That's way more radical than anything
we've seen in the other gospels.

806
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,060
Jesus could be the son of
God and still not be God.

807
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:26,200
Jesus could be the son of the father
and still not be equal to the father.

808
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:31,150
Jesus could be the the Messiah
and still not be divine,

809
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:35,800
and Jesus could be even the Messiah
and divine and still not be.

810
00:49:35,801 --> 00:49:40,750
I am in the gospel of John.
Nah. Ah. Jesus says, I am.

811
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:45,580
He's the one who spoke to Moses. It's no
wonder that the Jews tried to stone him.

812
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,730
We'll talk about that further next time.
