you cannot live well I'll be agreed in a
world that is swiftly approaching

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410
world that is swiftly approaching
 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.680
world that is swiftly approaching
combined crisis of the shortage of

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690
combined crisis of the shortage of
 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.960
combined crisis of the shortage of
resources of the decline of arable land

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970

of the destruction of its forests of the

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080
of the destruction of its forests of the

of the destruction of its forests of the
changing of the atmosphere and so on so

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
changing of the atmosphere and so on so
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.650
changing of the atmosphere and so on so
we really are at a turning point and we

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660
we really are at a turning point and we
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.830
we really are at a turning point and we
have to do it so the question now is can

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840
have to do it so the question now is can
 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.549
have to do it so the question now is can
we do it without you know living

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559
we do it without you know living
 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.069
we do it without you know living
returning to some more primitive less

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
returning to some more primitive less
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.260
returning to some more primitive less
comfortable less secure life and the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
comfortable less secure life and the
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.619
comfortable less secure life and the
answer is we sure can because the more

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
answer is we sure can because the more
 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.670
answer is we sure can because the more
we learn about how life works the more

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
we learn about how life works the more
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.889
we learn about how life works the more
we learn how we fit into this

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
we learn how we fit into this
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.479
we learn how we fit into this
environment and how we can maintain and

environment and how we can maintain and
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.479
environment and how we can maintain and
then reduce our numbers and our impact

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
then reduce our numbers and our impact
 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.870
then reduce our numbers and our impact
on the planet and the more we learn with

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880
on the planet and the more we learn with
 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.480
on the planet and the more we learn with
sustainable uses of energy and you and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490
sustainable uses of energy and you and
 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.249
sustainable uses of energy and you and
didn't apply that then we will find

didn't apply that then we will find
 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.719
didn't apply that then we will find
ourselves in a much more advanced

human endeavors by quality of life then

I think it would be very wise to do so

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000
I think it would be very wise to do so
 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.929
I think it would be very wise to do so
and I see note no prospect that would

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939
and I see note no prospect that would
 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.609
and I see note no prospect that would
halt a steady improvement of life while

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
halt a steady improvement of life while
 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.640
halt a steady improvement of life while
we settle

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650
we settle
 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.710
we settle
so now we've gotta settle down now as a

so now we've gotta settle down now as a
 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.530
so now we've gotta settle down now as a
species in this century before we wreck

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540
species in this century before we wreck
 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.230
