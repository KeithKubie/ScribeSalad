00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.330
Do you have memories you wish you could hold
onto forever?

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.189
Do you sometimes feel like they’re getting
less vibrant?

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:11.800
That’s probably because our working memory
starts to decline as soon as our late twenties!

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.070
Oh my god it’s all downhill from here, isn’t
it?

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.470
But new neuroscience research says that electrical
stimulation could drastically improve our

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.960
memory performance.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.410
Would you do it?

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.480
In case you hadn’t noticed, your brain is
a complicated place.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.850
It has lots of different kinds of memory,
and working memory is the kind in charge of

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.829
remembering information that’s no longer
directly in front of you.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.149
This can be the temporary preservation of
something that just happened or the retrieval

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.190
of something from your long-term memory.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.280
It’s the part of your cognition that’s
essential for things like processing and understanding

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.999
language, logical and spatial reasoning, planning,
and—of course—remembering where you last

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:50.480
saw your car keys.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.039
Our commonly accepted model for how working
memory works is that it’s the result of

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.469
coordination between different kinds of brain
waves.

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.059
Brain waves are the pulses of electrical activity
in your neurons, and those pulses can occur

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.140
at different frequencies, resulting in different
types of waves.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.290
Gamma waves have a high frequency and are
associated with the storage and processing

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.470
of sensory information.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.450
Theta waves have a longer-frequency, and are
associated with lots of different brain states,

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.780
from an engaged brain that’s actively monitoring
something to a brain during REM sleep.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.320
And when your working memory is activated—say
you’re pulling a memory from long-term storage

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.850
because you’re looking back on a detail
from your wedding day—those two types of

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.400
waves couple and synchronize to build you
a sense-memory picture of the thing you’re

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.600
trying to remember.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.920
They work in tandem to weave your memories
together.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.680
As we get older, our brains change.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.160
We may lose gray matter volume, our circulation
can get worse so our brains get less blood

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.850
and oxygen—there are lots of possible structural,
neurobiological changes.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.300
Another change associated with aging is a
decrease in synchronization between regions

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.360
of the brain.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.210
Whereas before you may have been able to recall
with perfect clarity the look on your spouses

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.659
face as you said "I do," as we get older,
researchers see brain waves start to pulse

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:17.689
out of sync—the coupling and synchronization
of brain waves gets off-beat—and details

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.959
like that may fade away.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.330
And of course, working memory is important
for much more than reminiscing.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.519
It’s required for daily life function—like
remembering where you keep the knives and

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.959
forks or retaining new information from a
doctor’s appointment—so once we start

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.590
to lose working memory like with age-related
dementia, we see a potential decrease in quality

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.060
of life and independence.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.739
Makes sense we’d wanna improve that, right?

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.519
Now you can, for the low, low price of shocking
your brain with electricity!

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.799
It’s actually not as scary as it sounds:
this particular study used a non-invasive

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.770
electrical stimulation method called transcranial
alternating-current stimulation to—for lack

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.520
of a better word—zap the prefrontal and
temporal regions of the brain simultaneously.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.860
This jumpstarted the off-beat gamma and theta
waves back into sync.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.249
The result?

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:14.760
Before electrical stimulation, a group of
test subjects in their 60s and 70s performed

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.989
significantly worse on a visual working memory
task than subjects in their 20s.

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.519
After 25 minutes of electrical stimulation
delivered via star-trek-like headset, the

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.959
older adults caught up to the younger group—both
age groups performed the same on the task.

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.329
Their brains were basically zapped back in
time!

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.120
There was also a group of participants in
the younger group who performed worse than

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.959
their fellow young peers on the exercise.

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.409
After the same amount of electrical stimulation,
their performance on the task had also improved,

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.810
so y’know there’s hope!

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.579
Plus the improvements in cognitive performance
for the older group lasted for at least 50

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.819
minutes, which was the duration of the experiment,
so who knows!

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.879
Maybe the effects lasted even longer.

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.219
People may balk when they hear about electrical
stimulation of the brain.

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.519
It may call to mind electroshock therapy,
a rather blunt instrument used in the early

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.280
parts of the 20th century on patients with
psychosis or schizophrenia, often against

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.680
their will and without much demonstrable therapeutic
effect.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.060
But while those early cases may be infamous
in the world of medical ethics, there are

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.280
now plenty more examples of safe and effective
electrical stimulation of the brain.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.380
Doctors are now using transcranial alternating-current
stimulation (TACS)—the same technology used

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.259
in this memory study—or Transcranial direct
current stimulation (TDCS) to test treatments

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.280
for things like severe depression or to enhance
concentration.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.259
While relatively safe in the context of a
controlled research environment, the hype

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:50.060
around the possibility of electrical stimulation
devices has led to a trend of consumer electronics—brain

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.860
stimulating ones—or even DIY brain stimulation
kits.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.759
Which—it doesn’t take a genius to guess—is
not a good idea.

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.979
Do NOT try this at home because if you do,
you risk seriously messing up your head with

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.030
mood changes, or even inducing seizures.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.900
This study and many others like it working
on what we call the ‘entrainment’ of brain

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.020
waves is just the very beginning of understanding
where and how memory function breaks down,

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.889
and what the long-term solutions might be—the
neuroscience community is just dipping its

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.479
toes into how we could put this into play
as a real-world treatment for the aging brain…preserving

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.409
your memories, and hopefully your quality
of life, for as long as you live.

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.200
You’ve probably seen our new show, Sick.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.000
It's all about what's happening in your body
when things start to go wrong.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.289
We're talking Lyme disease, measles, lupus,
and more.

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.330
Is there a disease or illness you want us
to cover?
