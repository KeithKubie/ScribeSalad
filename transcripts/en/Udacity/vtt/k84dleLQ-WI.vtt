00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Why is it nice to redirect after a form submission?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Because posts can't return HTML?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So that reloading our success page doesn't resubmit the form?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
To remove the form parameters from the URL?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Or so that we can have distinct pages for forms and success pages?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Check all that apply.
