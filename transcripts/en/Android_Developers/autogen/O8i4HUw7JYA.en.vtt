00:00:03.768 --> 00:00:06.600
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.840
ALOK GOEL: India is one
of the fastest growing

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.630
economies in the world.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.040
Every day about 25 million
people travel

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.050
from one city to another.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.490
A lot of those customers
actually need a last minute

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.970
travel options, and for that,
bus is one of the most

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.360
economical and flexible
options for travel.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.890
AMULMEET SINGH: Bus travel
is also one of the most

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.650
unorganized industries, with
thousands of operators,

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.220
varying standards of services,
prices, and promises, which

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.540
makes it highly unpredictable
for a customer.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.810
ALOK GOEL: And we decided to put
an order in this otherwise

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.050
unorganized bus ticketing
business by making it as easy

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.760
and convenient as flight booking
is, and actually went

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.330
beyond that by building an
Android app which stays with

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.680
you throughout your journey.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.200
RAJESH BYSANI: As a bus traveler
today in the country,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.930
there are two problems
that come to my mind.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.710
One is, which is the bus that is
most suitable for my needs?

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.820
And how will my bus journey
experience be?

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.150
There are over a thousand
operators running over 10,000

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.200
buses in the country.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.360
Finding a bus with a confirmed
seat is a challenging task.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.920
Finding a bus is not enough.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.540
You need a bus of
good quality.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.610
ALOK GOEL: Second problem, and
also the hardest one to solve,

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.050
is that of journey experience,
and which is where Android

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.190
plays a key role.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.910
Once you book a ticket, your
boarding point and bus is on

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.930
the map, with real-time
location update.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.630
AMULMEET SINGH: We launched our
app two months back, and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.970
bookings on mobile have
tripled since.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.600
More than 70% of travel
happens last minute.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.500
And with this app, we
are able to tap into

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.120
bookings on the go.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.450
ALOK GOEL: Basically, we have
created a trusted travel

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.350
companion for your
next bus journey.
