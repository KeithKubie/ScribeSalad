00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:14.780
So the Rocket Project at UCLA is an
aerospace engineering club on campus

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.060
we have about 120 undergraduate members at
the moment and we compete at a variety

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.470
of rocket competitions across America. I
think it's definitely a place where we

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.960
have students with a drive unlike any
other.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.340
We've been working with schools and
setting up outreach visits where we

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.020
visit classrooms and we really try to
inspire students.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.480
So Bruin Partners is a student initiated student-led
organization. Students from all

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.600
backgrounds at UCLA volunteer mentoring
both middle and high schoolers.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.580
This partnership that we've been able to make
between Rocket Project and Bruin

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.500
Partners has has been a great way that
we can bring that project-based learning

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.300
to the next level.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.600
We've worked with the Lux
Lab on campus which has been 3D printing

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.420
components for us and we've put together
some modular rocket kits for them that

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.260
the kids will be able to put together
and then actually launch.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.280
We're gonna be going through the three main components of the rocket which we've

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.520
3D printed out here. The nose cone which is the upper section that sort of breaks the wind for

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.490
the rocket and they fuselage or the body
which is the main section, the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.710
cylindrical portion, and then the fins.
The fundamentals are the exact same as

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.940
any aerospace engineer would need we
want to make it clear to them that

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.140
anything is possible and they can also
become rocket scientists.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.140
This is our test rocket. The launch was
completely successful.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.560
(You want to actually grab the one right next to it?)

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.560
(Perfect, we'll come by right now.)

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.480
We're all part of the Rocket Project at UCLA. We are an aerospace engineering

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.000
undergraduate group. So we're basically a club.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.040
There's... there's many disparities in education

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.280
we work towards getting rid of those
disparities.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.880
I love engineering, I love rockets,
who doesn't like controlled explosions, right?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.940
But also while I'm here and I have
the time I really wanted to give back to

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.600
the community.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.940
The outreach really fits with the Rocket Project's vision for the future.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.880
Sharing that excitement that we
have with the next generation that's

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.440
going to be taking our place and
exploring and really doing some amazing things.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.340
The biggest impact we
have is really just kind of showing them

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.100
that engineering and problem-solving can
be exciting.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.360
(Three... two... one...)

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.960
Yeah

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.860
Us coming in and saying hey look how fun it can be and

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.640
showing off some of the work we've done and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.560
sharing our college experiences is
really valuable for the students.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.120
I thought it was pretty cool that we got
to see real rockets in action.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.600
- How did your rocket do?
Amazing

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.540
You're never gonna be able to do something perfect the first time...

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.280
and being able to
continually improve and develop and get

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.820
to a product that makes you happy and
satisfies you is a great thing that you

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.810
can do in engineering and I'm really
excited to continue with the program

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.060
making it better and ultimately seeing
these kids grow up and be the best that

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.580
they can be so...

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.240
Makes me happy.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.380
...Ohhhh! It was a success!
