00:00:07.034 --> 00:00:09.594
Before empires and royalty,

00:00:09.594 --> 00:00:11.764
before pottery and writing,

00:00:11.764 --> 00:00:14.304
before metal tools and weapons –

00:00:14.304 --> 00:00:16.094
there was cheese.

00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:18.974
As early as 8000 BCE,

00:00:18.974 --> 00:00:23.044
the earliest Neolithic farmers 
living in the Fertile Crescent

00:00:23.044 --> 00:00:25.474
began a legacy of cheesemaking

00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:29.184
almost as old as civilization itself.

00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:33.200
The rise of agriculture led to 
domesticated sheep and goats,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.110
which ancient farmers harvested for milk.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.540
But when left in warm conditions 
for several hours,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.160
that fresh milk began to sour.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.740
Its lactic acids caused proteins to 
coagulate, binding into soft clumps.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.520
Upon discovering this 
strange transformation,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.150
the farmers drained the remaining liquid –

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.760
later named whey –

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.510
and found the yellowish globs could be 
eaten fresh as a soft, spreadable meal.

00:01:01.512 --> 00:01:05.942
These clumps, or curds, became 
the building blocks of cheese,

00:01:05.942 --> 00:01:10.602
which would eventually be aged, pressed, 
ripened, and whizzed

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:15.122
into a diverse cornucopia 
of dairy delights.

00:01:15.122 --> 00:01:19.728
The discovery of cheese gave Neolithic
people an enormous survival advantage.

00:01:19.728 --> 00:01:24.468
Milk was rich with essential proteins, 
fats, and minerals.

00:01:24.468 --> 00:01:28.148
But it also contained high 
quantities of lactose –

00:01:28.148 --> 00:01:33.418
a sugar which is difficult to process for 
many ancient and modern stomachs.

00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:39.128
Cheese, however, could provide all of 
milk’s advantages with much less lactose.

00:01:39.128 --> 00:01:42.088
And since it could be preserved 
and stockpiled,

00:01:42.088 --> 00:01:44.478
these essential nutrients could be eaten

00:01:44.478 --> 00:01:48.428
throughout scarce famines 
and long winters.

00:01:48.428 --> 00:01:52.560
Some 7th millennium BCE pottery fragments 
found in Turkey

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.290
still contain telltale residues of 
the cheese and butter they held.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.990
By the end of the Bronze Age,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.050
cheese was a standard commodity 
in maritime trade

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.480
throughout the eastern Mediterranean.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.700
In the densely populated city-states of 
Mesopotamia,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.250
cheese became a staple 
of culinary and religious life.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.250
Some of the earliest known writing

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.340
includes administrative records 
of cheese quotas,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.440
listing a variety of cheeses for different
rituals and populations

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.215
across Mesopotamia.

00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:27.345
Records from nearby civilizations 
in Turkey also reference rennet.

00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:31.340
This animal byproduct, produced in the
stomachs of certain mammals,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.505
can accelerate and control coagulation.

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:40.225
Eventually this sophisticated cheesemaking
tool spread around the globe,

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:44.185
giving way to a wide variety of new, 
harder cheeses.

00:02:44.185 --> 00:02:48.245
And though some conservative food 
cultures rejected the dairy delicacy,

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:54.105
many more embraced cheese, and quickly
added their own local flavors.

00:02:54.105 --> 00:03:00.882
Nomadic Mongolians used yaks’ milk to
create hard, sundried wedges of Byaslag.

00:03:00.882 --> 00:03:07.293
Egyptians enjoyed goats’ milk cottage 
cheese, straining the whey with reed mats.

00:03:07.293 --> 00:03:11.623
In South Asia, milk was coagulated with a
variety of food acids,

00:03:11.623 --> 00:03:14.633
such as lemon juice, vinegar, or yogurt

00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:18.303
and then hung to dry into loafs of paneer.

00:03:18.303 --> 00:03:22.223
This soft mild cheese could be added to 
curries and sauces,

00:03:22.223 --> 00:03:25.903
or simply fried as a 
quick vegetarian dish.

00:03:25.903 --> 00:03:29.903
The Greeks produced bricks of salty brined
feta cheese,

00:03:29.903 --> 00:03:34.563
alongside a harder variety similar to 
today’s pecorino romano.

00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:37.178
This grating cheese was produced in Sicily

00:03:37.178 --> 00:03:41.158
and used in dishes all across the 
Mediterranean.

00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:45.297
Under Roman rule, “dry cheese” 
or “caseus aridus,”

00:03:45.297 --> 00:03:46.857
became an essential ration

00:03:46.857 --> 00:03:53.397
for the nearly 500,000 soldiers guarding
the vast borders of the Roman Empire.

00:03:53.397 --> 00:03:56.238
And when the Western Roman 
Empire collapsed,

00:03:56.238 --> 00:03:58.308
cheesemaking continued to evolve

00:03:58.308 --> 00:04:02.388
in the manors that dotted the medieval
European countryside.

00:04:02.388 --> 00:04:06.362
In the hundreds of Benedictine monasteries
scattered across Europe,

00:04:06.362 --> 00:04:10.872
medieval monks experimented endlessly 
with different types of milk,

00:04:10.872 --> 00:04:12.222
cheesemaking practices,

00:04:12.222 --> 00:04:17.202
and aging processes that led to many 
of today’s popular cheeses.

00:04:17.202 --> 00:04:20.955
Parmesan, Roquefort, Munster 
and several Swiss types

00:04:20.955 --> 00:04:26.085
were all refined and perfected 
by these cheesemaking clergymen.

00:04:26.085 --> 00:04:29.815
In the Alps, Swiss cheesemaking was
particularly successful –

00:04:29.815 --> 00:04:32.897
producing a myriad of cow’s milk cheeses.

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:34.737
By the end of the 14th century,

00:04:34.737 --> 00:04:39.727
Alpine cheese from the Gruyere region of
Switzerland had become so profitable

00:04:39.727 --> 00:04:43.097
that a neighboring state invaded the 
Gruyere highlands

00:04:43.097 --> 00:04:46.507
to take control of the growing 
cheese trade.

00:04:46.507 --> 00:04:49.237
Cheese remained popular through 
the Renaissance,

00:04:49.237 --> 00:04:52.977
and the Industrial Revolution took 
production out of the monastery

00:04:52.977 --> 00:04:54.587
and into machinery.

00:04:54.587 --> 00:04:59.647
Today, the world produces roughly 
22 billion kilograms of cheese a year,

00:04:59.647 --> 00:05:02.327
shipped and consumed around the globe.

00:05:02.327 --> 00:05:05.097
But 10,000 years after its invention,

00:05:05.097 --> 00:05:10.377
local farms are still following in the 
footsteps of their Neolithic ancestors,

00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:14.457
hand crafting one of humanity’s 
oldest and favorite foods.
