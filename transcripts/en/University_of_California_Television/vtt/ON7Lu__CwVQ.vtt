00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.340
Bipedal, naked, large brained,

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.713
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.913
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.883
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.273
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.020
We shape the future

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.693
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.463
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.960
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.713
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.523 --> 00:01:18.273
(relaxing music)

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.513
- Thank you, Tim.

00:01:40.513 --> 00:01:43.810
And thank you to Carta for their vision

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.493
in sponsoring these wonderful symposia.

00:01:48.406 --> 00:01:53.210
I want to start with one picture here.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.080
Which is a picture of what was intended

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.080
to inculcate into the
readers of this magazine,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.360
Time Magazine, that DNA did everything

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.910
that you would want in a car.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.020
And, unfortunately for this ad, of course,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.440
Volvo was taken over by Ford.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.130
So, there's been a cultural
change since this ad came out.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.250
We don't know yet what
that cultural change

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.810
actually will bring about.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.173
It hasn't been long enough.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.810
But the general problem that we face

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.810
is how important are the genes
relative to the other things

00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:41.730
that go on in the human life.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.694
And what I'm going to do is to
start quite a bit of time ago

00:02:46.694 --> 00:02:50.820
with a picture that tells you about

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.640
what my colleague, Cavallie-Sforza,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.840
who just died four weeks ago, and I call

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.430
the serial founder effect
of people leaving Africa

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.900
between 50 and 100,000 years ago.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.900
And what you see here, the
people who are the most variable.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.380
They have the most variation
in terms of colors and genes.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.120
And, when they leave Africa,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.620
a small number of those individuals

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.130
approach this area here,
probably the Levant,

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.630
and then they diverge into groups that

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.840
go to Africa and Asia.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.940
Some go down into the Oceanic area.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.520
And the final group to move

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.300
moves across this Bering
Bridge here into the Americas.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.080
And you can see the
pattern of variation here

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.053
is much less variable than here.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.533
Now, some economists,

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:55.438
and I'm referring to
these particular ones,

00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:58.540
think that there's
something else going on.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.090
And that they claim that the
pattern of human variation

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.090
has been associated with
economic development.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.450
And they did it by doing
the following picture.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.450
Which is this infamous paper
by Ashraf and Galor where,

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.160
if you look at this graph here,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.930
which is essentially population
density in the year 1500,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.190
which the economists chose.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.190
And this is a pattern of
lack of genetic variation.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.240
So, the people who lack most
of the absent variation,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.210
or the people who are the most
variable, are the Africans.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.427
And the people who are the least variable

00:04:45.427 --> 00:04:48.560
are the indigenous Americans.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.758
And they concluded that having

00:04:50.758 --> 00:04:53.323
an intermediate amount of variation

00:04:53.323 --> 00:04:57.000
was conducive to economic development.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.820
And this is just one population density.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.783
Just one of the silly things that they do.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.940
But the idea behind bringing
this to your attention is that

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.917
this is published in

00:05:08.917 --> 00:05:12.040
the most eminent economic
journal in America.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.010
In the world, in fact.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.823
And not only is it silly, but it's wrong.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.090
They claim that a one percentage
point decrease in diversity

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.740
for the most diverse society

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.320
would be associated with a rise

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.193
in its population density by 64%.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.360
So, this kind of misuse of numbers.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.890
Not only was it in that paper,

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.660
but it also was brought over
into another paper they wrote

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.303
about cultural fragmentation.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.390
And it's trying to point out that

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.220
genetic diversity actually is

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.663
a cause of these social phenomenon.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.060
Not only were they silly,
but they were wrong.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.640
And there were a series of papers

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.320
published shortly after
this one came out that

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.690
addressed that their population
estimates were wrong.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.580
Their time of getting
agriculture was wrong.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.200
Whether there was
cooperation in the societies

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.320
they were looking at was wrong.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.610
And, of course, how much genetic diversity

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.610
was related to innovation was wrong, too.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.010
Because fruit flies have

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.393
a lot more genetic diversity than humans.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.596
Their innovation is not nearly
as great as far as we know.

00:06:29.596 --> 00:06:31.550
(laughter)

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.240
So, in the human genome
diversity cell line panel,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.220
which Luca Cavalli-Sforza and I

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.460
started to develop in the early 1990s,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.640
we looked at genomic variation

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.350
in people from around the world.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.640
52 populations.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.640
And where they're located is
marked with these red X's here.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.867
And those peoples,

00:06:58.867 --> 00:07:01.740
we would love to have a lot more

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.380
in the human genome diversity cell line.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.417
And people now have,
in their laboratories,

00:07:07.417 --> 00:07:10.610
hundreds of populations
from around the world

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.550
where the DNA is currently
available for analysis.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.000
Our idea was to have this
panel available in Paris.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.477
And any lab in the world
could just get the DNA

00:07:20.477 --> 00:07:21.803
and do their studies.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.790
And this was the first study
that we did on those people.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.340
In that study, these are
indigenous Americans.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.830
These are indigenous Africans.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.090
And these are Europeans.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.180
But the interesting thing about this slide

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.050
is how many of these
populations around the world

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.270
have ancestry in more than one place.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.943
Including these people who
have ancestry in three places.

00:07:45.943 --> 00:07:50.070
And the Uyghurs in China have
ancestry in three places.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.220
And the Hazara in Pakistan and Afghanistan

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.690
have ancestry in three
different continents.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.160
So, ancestry is a much better idea

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.673
about describing populations than is race.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.300
Now, if we go back to that
silly economics slide,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.760
when you look at the data that

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.620
we've produced from that study.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.920
They were using my data.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.578
That's what made me so mad.

00:08:16.578 --> 00:08:17.411
(laughter)

00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:22.411
And these were the data they were using.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.737
We plotted mean diversity

00:08:25.737 --> 00:08:29.420
as a function of distance
from Addis Ababa.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.250
And what you can see here is that

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.030
the Africans have the highest diversity

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.240
and the indigenous Americans
have the lowest diversity.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.900
And we're gonna ask why.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.760
Well, I showed you why
in that migration trait.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.140
It was a property of
prehistorical migrations

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.060
that the African population
was the population

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.760
from which everybody else was derived.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.890
They have the most variation.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.090
They've been there the longest.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.350
They've cumulated the most mutations.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.553
And indigenous Americans have been in

00:08:59.553 --> 00:09:03.270
this small group that came
across from the Bering Bridge.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.890
That group's only been in
position for 15,000 years.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.870
As opposed to the 100,000 years

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.823
before the indigenous Africans left.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.620
Now, to prove that, we looked at the DNA

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.440
of peoples around the world to find out

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.400
how long the stretches of DNA were

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.150
without any variation should be there.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.204
And what we see is that

00:09:27.204 --> 00:09:32.204
there are two kinds of reasons
why people lack variation.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.420
One is the historical
phenomenon that I told you about

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.100
of small population size.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.020
That these are the
indigenous American people.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.960
And the other one is
a cultural phenomenon.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.720
And these are all the Islamic
populations in our study.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.480
And they have the same
level of homozygosity,

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.470
or lack of variation, as
the indigenous Americans.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.960
And the reason is these populations

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.120
practice first cousin marriages.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.630
These are highly inbred populations

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.040
from Pakistan, Afghanistan,
and the Middle East.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.810
So, the cultural explanation

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.310
is the explanation for this part.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:13.940
And the historical explanation

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.960
is the explanation for that part.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.600
That's the demography side.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.343
Now, since that study,

00:10:20.343 --> 00:10:24.439
there have been 189 populations studied.

00:10:24.439 --> 00:10:27.693
And I'll ask you to focus on this list.

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:31.280
What we see here are the
indigenous Americans.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.860
And what we're looking at here is

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:37.570
having five million nucleotides
without any variation.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:41.040
And we see mostly that the
populations in the Americas

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.819
have a very high rate of homozygosity.

00:10:43.819 --> 00:10:48.450
The populations of Islamic extraction

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.040
have a very high rate of homozygosity.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.130
And these populations here
are really interesting.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.180
These are the Jewish populations.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.720
And one of those populations
is particularly interesting.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.400
This one here.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.250
That's a population in
Israel called the Samaritans.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.560
And most of you have
heard of the Samaritans,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.317
'cause there was a good one.

00:11:12.317 --> 00:11:14.567
(laughter)

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.930
Now, the Samaritans are
an interesting group,

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.003
because they don't believe that

00:11:22.003 --> 00:11:25.610
they should be separated
from the other Israelites.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.470
They have a very interesting history.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.040
This is the high priest of the Samaritans.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.970
Currently there are about 850 of them.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.830
Half live in the center of Tel Aviv

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.080
and half live in a
village in the West Bank.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.080
But, in 1917, there were
150 Samaritans left.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.670
They spoke Aramaic.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.070
And they did not believe
in any of the Bible.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.840
Except the five books of Moses.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.010
The rest of it, the
prophets and the writings,

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.550
they didn't care about.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.740
And part of the reason is their history.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.633
This is the Assyrian Empire
between 900 and 607 BC.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.330
And this is the history.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.597
Everybody can read this for themselves.

00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:12.776
(laughter)

00:12:12.776 --> 00:12:16.403
This is called the Nimrud Prism
in which Emperor Sargon II,

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.300
who conquered the
northern kingdom of Israel

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.230
in the year 722 BC,
wrote down what he did.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.750
And this is the story.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.120
Now, if you want an easier bit,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.705
you can read the translation here.

00:12:31.705 --> 00:12:35.128
He tells that he took out the people,

00:12:35.128 --> 00:12:38.010
as was his custom, from
the northern kingdom.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.930
Moved them to what is now Iraq.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:44.930
And replaced them with people
who he had already conquered.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.210
And this was his pattern.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.570
However, the Samaritans believe that

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.470
they descend from people who never left.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.960
That they are the descendants of

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.650
the children of Manasseh and Ephraim.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.880
Two of the children of Joseph.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.420
Two sons of Joseph.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.800
They never left.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.920
Now, the Bible actually has

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.620
a contradiction about these people.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.700
Because, if you look at the book of Kings,

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.710
it says exactly what
the Nimrud Prism says.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:11.800
That he took.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.730
The kind of Assyria
brought men from Babylon

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.842
and these other places

00:13:15.842 --> 00:13:18.520
and placed them in the cities of Samaria

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.806
instead of the children of Israel.

00:13:20.806 --> 00:13:24.580
Unfortunately, the Chronicles
says exactly something else.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.420
Because Hezekiah is the king
of the Solomonic Empire.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.830
And this is in the year 700.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.880
This is after the conquest.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.620
So, if the Israelites had
been taken over and left

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.700
and there were none there,

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.600
why would he be writing
to Israel and Judah

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.400
and the children of Ephraim and Manasseh?

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.530
And asking them to come to
Jerusalem to keep the Passover?

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.130
So, there's a contradiction there.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.060
And the scholars say,
"Oh, Chronicles is written

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.720
a lot longer after."

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.370
It goes to about 400 BC.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.100
And the book of Kings is really kosher.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.170
We've got to believe that one.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:07.120
So, either way, there's
something to explain here.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.013
And so, we tried to explain it.

00:14:10.302 --> 00:14:14.750
Being a Samaritan is passed
down along the male line.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.140
Male Samaritans can marry anybody.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.590
And the children is a Samaritan.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.600
There are only four families.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.090
Cohen, Joshua-Marhiv, Danfi, and Tsedaka.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.220
And they are endogamous.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.722
They marry within the line.

00:14:29.722 --> 00:14:32.490
So, it's not unexpected that

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.860
they have the highest
inbreeding coefficient

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.760
of any population in the world.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.670
They're the only population I know of

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.420
where a quarter of the mothers and sisters

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.220
of color blind men are also color blind.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.970
Because, as you know, color
blindness usually in males.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.630
So, the Samaritans are
really quite interesting.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.860
But, as a consequence of
this cultural phenomenon

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.760
of preferring to marry within the line,

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.130
within the marriage line,

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.250
they have these genetic properties.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:05.060
Which we can get at by
looking at the Y chromosome.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:09.880
Because the descending gene
which defines you as a Samaritan

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.760
is your Y chromosome.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.173
Because only males can pass
being a Samaritan down.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:16.890
So, we did that.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.380
We looked at the Y
chromosomes of the Samaritans

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.450
and compared them to

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:25.450
all the other populations
of Jewish people in Israel.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:30.387
And, in addition, to Palestinian
and to Ethiopian Jews

00:15:30.387 --> 00:15:32.970
and to Druze and Bedouin.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.970
And, lo and behold, they're
the closest, by far,

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.150
to today's Cohens.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:43.730
And Cohens are the high
priests of the Jewish religion.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.960
So, it turns out that Samaritans

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.090
are actually related closer
to the Jewish people.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.150
And they're Israelites.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.350
They must be Israelites to
have this close relationship

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.050
on the Y chromosome.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.100
If you study mitochondrial DNA,

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.360
it's a totally different story.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.660
Because the women are
coming from everywhere.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.170
They're not from the Samaritans.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.220
So, you won't see anything
like this, which we did.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.790
Which is an interesting phenomena.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:15.195
So, the culture has
again defined the pattern

00:16:15.195 --> 00:16:17.453
of genomic variation.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.450
Why did this happen?

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.110
Well, this guy Josephus,

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:26.140
an interesting fellow who was
hated by the Jews of the time,

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.668
because he was a turncoat.

00:16:28.668 --> 00:16:32.270
He joined the Romans and
became a writer and reporter

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.800
for the Romans.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.790
And the Romans who were in Israel

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.850
and destroying the Temple.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:40.230
He particularly attached
himself to Vespasian

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.932
who destroyed the Temple in the year 70.

00:16:43.932 --> 00:16:47.390
And he writes about a time of history

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.120
300 or 400 years before him.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.110
And he mentions Sanballetes,

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:55.980
who is that Persian governor
of Samaria and Judea,

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.860
and Manasses, who is the brother

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.460
of the high priest in Jerusalem.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.739
Now, he'd have to be a Cohen,

00:17:02.739 --> 00:17:06.380
because only Cohens were high priests.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.270
And Josephus says that Sanballetes

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.740
gave Manasses his daughter.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.840
And, along with other of the high priests,

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.840
they converted to become
essentially Jewish Samaritan.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.630
So, they were Cohens.

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:28.000
So, the male lineage descends,
according to Josephus,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.040
from that line.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.660
So, we don't know whether
there's any truth to this.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.366
This is the only evidence that

00:17:34.366 --> 00:17:39.180
I and my religious scholars
have been able to find

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.290
to say why the Samaritans
should be related to the Cohens.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.553
The high priests of the Jewish religion.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.290
Now, my final example of
how culture affects genes

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:56.290
concerns the Canadian fur
trade and tuberculosis.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.440
This is a pattern of the global
incidence of tuberculosis.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.640
Right from the United Nations documents.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.680
It hasn't changed much since then.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.850
Maybe gotten a little worse
down here in southern Africa

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.683
with the advent of HIV.

00:18:11.653 --> 00:18:15.600
This is a story from the famous book

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.900
written by Ferguson in 1928 about

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.360
how many deaths occurred from TB

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.620
in indigenous American
Canadian populations.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.470
And these two peaks,
which tell you over 10%,

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:34.200
maybe 14% of indigenous
Americans in Canada

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.590
died in those times.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:40.250
They died because they
were put into reservations.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:45.220
And the reservations were
extremely badly designed.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:50.220
The people were dying like
flies of infectious diseases.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.150
They had no blankets, no ventilation.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:57.470
So, the question is, if these
people had that problem,

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.290
then why is it the case that

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:04.620
so many indigenous Americans
in that part of Canada died?

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.610
This lady, who's pictured here

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.910
in the canoe of the fur traders

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.160
going down this long river here,

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.900
this river zone here from Quebec.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.310
We found out that, if
we actually looked at

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.686
the DNA of the bacterium that was

00:19:19.686 --> 00:19:22.890
in the Canadian indigenous peoples,

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.758
it was exactly the same DNA that

00:19:25.758 --> 00:19:28.350
was in the people from Quebec.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.765
Those people, the French Canadians,

00:19:30.765 --> 00:19:35.610
were in the Northwest Fur Trading Company.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.110
And the French had a different
culture from the British.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.540
The French cohabited with
the indigenous people.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.130
And they passed on their TB bacterium.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.740
The British never homesteaded.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.820
They never passed on anything.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.010
They were hands off the indigenous people.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:53.750
So, what we see is this culture

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.350
of cohabiting with the indigenous people

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.780
that the French Canadian fur trappers did

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.240
was the reason why that bacterium

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.240
passed these 1500 kilometers
into the indigenous people.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.850
So, in conclusion, it's obvious that,

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.890
if you look at the cultural context

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:19.340
around these human behaviors
and the variation of the DNA,

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.110
you can see that you can't say that

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:26.066
it's the DNA that's
causing these variations.

00:20:26.066 --> 00:20:26.961
Thank you.

00:20:26.961 --> 00:20:29.211
(applause)

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.433
- So, I have something
that predates the stone.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.363
These are palm nuts.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.540
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.450
I'm pleased to be here to
speak at this Carta event.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.330
And I thank Doctor White
and Doctor Churchland

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.513
for the invitation.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.370
Like you, I'm passionately interested

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:52.470
in the human mind and human behavior.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.183
And my particular interests

00:20:54.183 --> 00:20:57.080
are in what humans
share with other species

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.613
and how they are different.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.190
Understanding humans as
members of the natural world

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.693
is critical to understanding
human origins and our future.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:11.460
Let's start with how
humans use hand tools.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.720
Now, humans use hand tools like these now.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.030
And how our ancestors used
them in the deep past.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.650
We can see some continuities.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.670
We can use chopper cores, too.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.850
Even though we might not
be able to manufacture

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:27.090
a chopper core like this
one without practice.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.500
What about nonhuman primates?

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.270
Jane Goodall gave compelling reports

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:34.760
of wild chimpanzees fishing
for termites with grass stems.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.714
Prompting Louis Leakey's famous quote.

00:21:36.714 --> 00:21:40.581
"Now we must redefine tool, redefine man,

00:21:40.581 --> 00:21:43.027
or accept chimpanzees as humans."

00:21:43.027 --> 00:21:44.410
(laughter)

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.840
But the idea that scientists
in the mid-20th century

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.310
were unaware of nonhuman primates

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.500
naturally using tools is inaccurate.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.840
Darwin, citing a report published

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.240
more than 100 years before
Jane Goodall's report,

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.540
mentioned wild chimpanzees
cracking nuts with stones

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.090
in his book The Descent of Man.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.180
Goodall's discovery should
not have come as a surprise.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.530
Even if earlier reports

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:13.772
of chimpanzees cracking nuts
with stones had been forgotten

00:22:13.772 --> 00:22:16.420
Because psychologists had studied

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.340
chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.608
spontaneously using objects as tools

00:22:20.608 --> 00:22:23.660
in captive settings for decades.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:27.060
Wolfgang Kohler and Yerkes
studied captive apes.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:31.683
And Heinrich Kluver
studied capuchin monkeys.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.350
Studies with captive
nonhuman primates using tools

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.150
have continued since then.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:40.070
And we've learned much from them.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.570
I'm going to focus, however,

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:42.560
on what we know about

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.120
nonhuman primates' behavior
in natural settings.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.196
In keeping with the
situations of human ancestors

00:22:49.196 --> 00:22:53.380
and contemporary humans
whose behavior and brains

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.430
we're hoping to understand.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:23:00.040
I'm going to focus on those species that

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.440
have been found to use
hand tools regularly

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.670
in their daily lives as humans did and do.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:06.910
So, what can we learn from

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.620
nonhuman primates' use of hand tools

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.919
that helps us understand human origins

00:23:10.919 --> 00:23:14.260
and our contemporary minds and behavior?

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.373
First, we can learn what is shared

00:23:16.373 --> 00:23:19.221
and we can deduce what is not shared.

00:23:19.221 --> 00:23:23.380
And then we can work to
explain the differences.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.060
So, let's start with the forms of tooling

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:30.129
that we find in nonhuman primates.

00:23:30.129 --> 00:23:32.328
And I use the word tooling to mean

00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:34.423
using an object as a tool.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.670
Four genera of nonhuman primates

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:39.240
regularly use hand tools.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.257
And, in each genus,

00:23:40.257 --> 00:23:43.170
one species has been most
studied in this regard.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.423
And I'm going to focus on those species.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.030
Two species are apes.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.240
Two are monkeys.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.250
Two are Asian.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.210
One African.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.680
One South American.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.690
Thus, they come from across the regions

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.240
in which nonhuman primates live.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.150
They most frequently use hand tools

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:03.089
to hammer, puncture, scrape, probe, rake,

00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:05.484
and in a few other ways.

00:24:05.484 --> 00:24:07.960
In these forms of toolings,

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.310
nonhuman primates perform simple actions.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.230
They produce a change in a
substrate or a fixed object

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:15.210
with one object.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.010
A stick or a stone.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.260
Here, a chimpanzee punctures the soil

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.890
to get at an underground termite nest.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:25.210
A macaque hammers an oyster with stone.

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.390
And a capuchin monkey is scraping the sand

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.270
away from a tuber in the ground.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.910
They use a hand tool to
alter one loose object.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.390
To pound a loose gastropod.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:38.710
In this case, by a macaque.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:42.350
Or a chimpanzee or capuchin
monkey cracking nuts.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:46.134
They generate novel combinations
of actions with objects.

00:24:46.134 --> 00:24:49.830
Some of which plausibly could
lead to achieving their goal.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.520
But often they don't.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.660
This young monkey stacked
a nut on a small stone

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.180
on a larger piece of stone

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.390
and then prepared to strike
it with his third stone.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:02.743
And that didn't work.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.920
They use simple toolkits.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.840
That is, they use two or more items

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.470
in a sequence for different subgoals.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:13.010
On the left, a chimpanzee
uses a stout branch

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.960
to break into a bees nest.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.270
And then, on the right,
she uses a smaller branch

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:18.833
to dip for honey and larvae.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.810
They select and transport materials.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.840
Taken as evidence of planning.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.920
That was a capuchin monkey
transporting a stone

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.433
bipedally several meters to an anvil.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:34.710
Here, we see.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.200
I think I have to click again.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.950
Another monkey.

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:39.830
He's selecting a heavier stone.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:42.440
Which, in this case, is the smaller one.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.538
He taps and handles both stones

00:25:44.538 --> 00:25:48.630
before selecting the heavier
stone to carry to the anvil.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:51.613
This is Elisabetta Visalberghi
narrating in Italian.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.870
The lighter one, although larger,

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.100
was too light to be an affective hammer.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.033
We manufactured the stones
for that experiment.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.847
They modify materials and
manufacture tools by subtraction.

00:26:11.847 --> 00:26:13.800
Breaking sticks from branches

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.420
and twigs from sticks, for example.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.895
Here, we see a chimpanzee
fishing for termites

00:26:18.895 --> 00:26:21.960
using a stem that she
collected from a plant

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.820
like those shown on the left.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.220
Which she then modified by

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.830
chewing on it to have a brush tip.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.340
The lower right image shows how

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.803
the brush tip helps to
collect the termites.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.330
They use skilled movements to achieve

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.780
a good mechanical effect with the tool.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.890
By skill, I mean achieving the goal

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.480
with minimal effort and
maximal effectiveness.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.710
This capuchin monkey can crack nuts

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.610
far more skillfully than I
can using the same stone.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.997
And I can tell you I've tried many times.

00:26:50.997 --> 00:26:53.247
(laughter)

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.030
He does it in three strikes.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.270
And he was cracking a nut like this.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.933
The monkey weighs three and a half kilos.

00:27:00.933 --> 00:27:02.320
This is a big stone.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.303
Or a big nut for monkey that size.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.560
They learn to use stone tools with others

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.700
and from artifacts left by others.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.140
In other words, they have
technical traditions.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.552
They learn these skills
over a very lengthy period.

00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:19.700
Chimpanzees learn to crack nuts

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.470
over about a three year period.

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:23.449
Progressing from actions with one object

00:27:23.449 --> 00:27:26.870
to combining objects and then percussing

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.110
and finally cracking nuts

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.490
when they're about three years old.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.154
Burmese macaques learn to harvest oysters

00:27:33.154 --> 00:27:36.730
and crack loose gastropods
in a similar timeframe.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.520
With somewhat different
order of appearance

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.923
of the elements compared to chimpanzees.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.750
Bearded capuchins similarly
begin handling objects

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:45.820
soon after birth.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.370
But do not begin to place
an object on a surface

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:50.333
and then work on it with another object

00:27:50.333 --> 00:27:52.560
until they're around two years old.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.660
And they begin to crack nuts

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.320
some months or even years after that.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.260
All in all, the developmental timelines

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.800
are quite similar across these species.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.850
Orangutans may develop their
tool using skills more slowly,

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.850
but we really don't have
good ontogenetic data

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:08.650
on this point yet.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:12.610
These primates, like
humans, forage extractively.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:14.870
That is they collect food that is

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:16.159
hidden in wood or soil

00:28:16.159 --> 00:28:18.844
or protected by tough shells or rinds

00:28:18.844 --> 00:28:21.660
or by thorns or irritating latex.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.440
Some way they're defended.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.334
We see, on the right, a
capuchin monkey extracting

00:28:26.334 --> 00:28:29.210
a plant underground storage
organ from the soil.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.520
He's not using a tool for that.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.844
He's digging in the sand with his hands.

00:28:32.844 --> 00:28:37.844
They use tools to process
abundant, high-quality foods.

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.360
Here, we see palm nuts eaten by

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.160
capuchin monkeys on the left.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.740
Coula nuts, also called African walnuts,

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.990
eaten by chimpanzees in the center.

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:50.820
And a diverse array of
gastropods and marine organisms

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.130
cracked by the macaques.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.690
These are all abundant foods.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:54.523
They're nutritious.

00:28:54.523 --> 00:28:56.063
Good, high-quality foods.

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.100
They all spend a lot of time on the ground

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.170
and forage on the ground.

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.730
Except for orangutans.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:03.780
And this is an interesting point.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.810
And one that Meulman and van
Schaik have commented on.

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:09.220
If you're looking for a book about

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.530
tool use in nonhuman primates,

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:12.760
this is actually about not just primates.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.620
But it's called Tool Use in Animals.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:19.290
Edited by Sanz, Call, and Boesch.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:22.190
It's a good book if you're
interested in this topic.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.141
The shared features I have mentioned.

00:29:24.141 --> 00:29:28.033
And some others that I list here.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.330
Bimanual actions,
complementary bimanual actions,

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.590
modulating movements,

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.120
hierarchical organization
of action sequence,

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.690
preparatory movements
with a tool before use,

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:41.357
and others that I don't
have time to talk about.

00:29:41.357 --> 00:29:44.090
These are all things that reveal

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:47.710
shared perceptual, motor,
cognitive, and social foundations

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.990
for tooling in primates.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:54.260
And yet nonhuman primates do not use tools

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.350
as shown in these pictures

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.842
that are very common actions for humans.

00:29:59.842 --> 00:30:01.870
They don't do it spontaneously.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:05.134
And, to my knowledge, they don't
do it with training either.

00:30:05.134 --> 00:30:07.710
Why not?

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:09.220
They don't seem to be limited

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.280
by gross sensory or motor characteristics.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.290
Here, we see a drawing of a chimpanzee

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.820
delicately and dextrously
handling a plant stem

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:19.930
and holding a rigid stick.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.343
These were drawings taken from video.

00:30:23.355 --> 00:30:27.385
Instead, they differ from
humans in more subtle ways.

00:30:27.385 --> 00:30:29.580
Humans perceive spatial relations

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.770
between objects differently.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:33.930
For example, from two years of age,

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:37.270
we can align the axes of objects
and surfaces to each other

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:38.650
accurately and easily.

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:41.333
As when you insert a key into a keyhole.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.280
And nonhuman primates do not.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.763
As far as we now know.

00:30:47.968 --> 00:30:51.030
Nonhuman primates align points.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.790
They can align align a probe to a hole.

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.610
That's a point alignment.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:58.870
But they don't align axes to each other.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:01.480
So, here, we see a bar, a cross,

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.402
and a kind of tomahawk shape.

00:31:03.402 --> 00:31:06.590
And a corresponding cutout in a tray.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:10.490
And two year old children can
put in the bar and the cross.

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:11.890
And three and four year old children

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.270
can manage that tomahawk shape.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.277
And nonhuman primates,
with a lot of effort,

00:31:17.277 --> 00:31:19.230
can get the bar in.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:20.780
And they actually can get them all in,

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.460
if you just give them long enough.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.900
But they don't just pick it up, rotate it,

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.313
position it, and place it in.

00:31:26.313 --> 00:31:30.510
They do it by smearing the
thing around on the surface.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.461
And, eventually, they get it in.

00:31:32.461 --> 00:31:35.512
It's a very different strategy.

00:31:35.512 --> 00:31:39.640
Nonhuman primates move
one object at a time.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.920
Managing a few degrees of freedom.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.690
Humans manage two objects
concurrently and sometimes more.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:46.523
As when knitting.

00:31:46.523 --> 00:31:48.942
I think knitting is an
underappreciated skill.

00:31:48.942 --> 00:31:50.270
(laughter)

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.360
In some, humans can coordinate

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.220
movements in space more precisely,

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.640
especially movements
organized with respect to

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.570
the target object or objects,
than nonhuman primates.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.790
Humans can manage a
greater number of relations

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:07.343
between objects concurrently
than nonhuman primates.

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:10.810
Humans also have more
elaborate social cognition.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:13.090
And this plays out in many ways.

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:16.528
Without teaching and without
intentional scaffolding,

00:32:16.528 --> 00:32:19.490
nonhuman primates learn
their technical skills

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.983
less efficiently than do humans.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:24.860
Turning to the question that

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.300
Doctors White and Churchland
asked us to address,

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.880
how did the use of tools contribute

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.520
to the origins of our
species' brains and cognition?

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.190
I would say, as a primatologist,

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.870
that I want to turn the question around.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:42.537
I want to know what features
of ancestral hominins

00:32:42.537 --> 00:32:45.313
and their ecological and
their social circumstances

00:32:45.313 --> 00:32:48.800
set the stage for humans to expand into

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.050
a specialized foraging niche
that increasingly relied

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:54.463
on using tools?

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:59.460
My suggestion is that
natural selection for

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.588
perceptual and behavioral attributes

00:33:01.588 --> 00:33:04.530
associated with extractive foraging,

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:06.710
particularly the perception and management

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.366
of spacial relations among objects

00:33:09.366 --> 00:33:12.140
and the precise control of the movements

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.520
of the body plus object system,

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.290
slowly but eventually
enabled ancestral humans

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:21.420
to expand into a
specialized foraging niche

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.430
that relied on using tools.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.320
Humans are obligate tool users.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:29.053
No nonhuman primate is
an obligate tool user.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.870
In other words, I suggest that

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.220
the key evolutionary
shifts that got humans

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:39.530
started down this path were
perceptual and action components

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:43.840
associated with handling and
moving objects during foraging.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.520
These shifts enable humans to use tools

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:51.123
far more flexibly than
can nonhuman primates.

00:33:53.473 --> 00:33:56.160
Of course, other aspects
of human biology that

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.633
are associated with tool
use were coevolving.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.970
Including morphology, social cognition,

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:05.843
attentional control, memory
strategies, and so on.

00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:10.247
So, our next speaker is going
to tell us something more

00:34:10.247 --> 00:34:15.247
about how these features
played out in human evolution.

00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:17.270
I want to take just a few moments,

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.060
the remaining time that I have,

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.930
to tell you a bit more about
the work that I do in Brazil

00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:25.350
and the monkeys that I think
are so interesting to study.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:26.645
And I do this work collaboratively

00:34:26.645 --> 00:34:30.020
with Patricia Izar and
Elisabetta Visalberghi

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.420
who are shown in that photo.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.050
These monkeys collect palm nuts.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:38.080
They take them to anvils
and they use stone hammers

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.060
to crack them at those anvils.

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:42.760
You've seen a few clips
of what these monkeys do.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:47.760
This one shows a female
positioning the nut very carefully

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.940
and working on that stone.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.844
And this is completely characteristic.

00:34:53.844 --> 00:34:55.555
What she's doing looks.

00:34:55.555 --> 00:34:58.290
It's not chaotic or random.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:01.290
There's actually quite
a bit of method there.

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:03.100
In the end, she arrives at the nut

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.820
in a very stable position on the anvil.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:06.740
And then she whacks it.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.250
Even though it does
sometimes fly off the anvil.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:11.948
That's just one of the
hazards of the occupation.

00:35:11.948 --> 00:35:14.198
(laughter)

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:18.313
Very slow motion.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:23.570
There's really beauty in that action.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:26.395
I think these monkeys
are Hercules with a tail.

00:35:26.395 --> 00:35:28.645
(laughter)

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.590
Capuchins have all the characteristics

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.740
we associate with tool use in primates.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.210
They're quite terrestrial.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:39.660
They use bipedal stance
occasionally on the ground

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:40.840
to look around.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.770
They transport things bipedally.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:44.450
They're extractive foragers.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:46.280
They percuss objects during foraging.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.210
Even when they're not using tools.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:50.380
They're tolerant to
young monkeys near them

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:51.520
while they're foraging.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.600
They're generally social cohesive.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.060
Their habitat has features that

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.360
make the monkeys' nut cracking
likely and of use to them.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.370
Nuts and anvil sites are abundant.

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:02.570
The hammer stones are not.

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:04.680
Those are the restricted resources.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.894
The nuts and the larvae
that they often contain

00:36:06.894 --> 00:36:09.740
are both preferred and nutritious.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.416
And they're available all year long.

00:36:11.416 --> 00:36:13.790
So, it makes a lot of sense,

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:16.180
if you're a capuchin
monkey living in this area,

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.202
to crack nuts.

00:36:17.202 --> 00:36:18.991
Thank you very much.

00:36:18.991 --> 00:36:21.433
(applause)

00:36:21.433 --> 00:36:23.130
- I'm very happy to be here today

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:26.460
to talk about a topic that's
very near and dear to my heart.

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.427
Which is the role of
technology in human evolution.

00:36:30.427 --> 00:36:35.270
In fact, if you go back about 60 years,

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:39.670
it was pretty much a
widespread viewpoint that

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:43.470
technology and toolmaking
was absolutely central

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.300
to human evolution.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.722
And, in fact, perhaps
definitive of our species.

00:36:48.722 --> 00:36:53.722
But this was graphically
represented in a film in 1968.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:57.850
2001: A Space Odyssey.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.593
Which depicts this turning point.

00:36:59.593 --> 00:37:02.150
A critical turning
point in human evolution

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:05.580
when this Australopithecine,
male, of course,

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.840
realizes that he can use a bone as a club.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.855
And then proceeds to
slaughter his rivals with it.

00:37:10.855 --> 00:37:13.430
From then, our future was assured.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.370
And, virtually inevitable, in triumph,

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:18.790
he tosses the stone up in the air.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.230
It spins around.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:23.570
And then, on the way back
down, it, very smoothly,

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:28.550
at least in 1960s cinematography,
turns into a spaceship.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:31.074
So, you get the picture, right?

00:37:31.074 --> 00:37:34.470
But, already, by the time
that this film had come out.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.180
And you saw this quote
in the last presentation.

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.910
This vision of Man, the Toolmaker

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:40.880
had started to unravel a bit.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.647
As Louis Leakey famously quipped,

00:37:43.647 --> 00:37:46.040
"Now we must redefine man, redefine tool,

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.150
or accept chimpanzees as human."

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:51.250
And, in fact, now we know
it's not just the chimpanzees.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:52.750
It's not even just the primates.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.185
If you're willing to accept

00:37:54.185 --> 00:37:57.260
kind of covering yourself
with a coconut as tool use,

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.410
it goes into molluscs even using tools.

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:03.210
And, as archeologists, we also know that

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:05.813
the earliest appearance
of flaked stone tools

00:38:05.813 --> 00:38:09.070
was not really a
transformative breakthrough

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:10.330
that we thought.

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:13.720
The first stone tools appear
around 3.3 million years.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.200
And then nothing happens.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.920
In fact, the graph should
probably look more like this.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.920
You have a little bit of a
flash or a flash in the pan.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.040
Let me get the laser pointer up here.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.870
At 3.3 million years ago.

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:29.480
Then a whole lot of nothing.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.060
Until about 2.6 where you
have some low intensity

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.520
mucking about in tool making.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.330
But it doesn't really take off

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:37.290
until after two million years.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:39.180
So, maybe early stone tools really

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.880
aren't that much of a big deal after all.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.703
But, obviously, I don't believe that.

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.170
And, in fact, you could say that

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:50.640
the termite probe here is a tool.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.400
The phone is a tool.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.810
They are the same thing qualitatively.

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:56.060
But, quantitatively,

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.920
there's a massive difference in complexity

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.953
that we need to explain.

00:39:02.207 --> 00:39:04.470
So, take this famous scene

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:08.210
from the Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo.

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:11.126
Arguably, there's not a single
natural thing in sight here.

00:39:11.126 --> 00:39:15.020
Even the people, even the bodies,

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.960
the human bodies have been transformed

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.470
by this long engagement with technology.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.900
The reduction in the size
of our jaws and teeth

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.740
and our gut from external
processing of food.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.490
The adaptations to the hand and arm

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:29.620
for dextrous manipulation.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.950
Of course, the very large,
energy hungry brain.

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:34.930
But the other thing to
notice in this picture

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.770
is how many people there are.

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:39.970
Despite this really expensive brain,

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.390
the very long development,

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:43.620
the heavy investment that children require

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.586
that you may be familiar with,

00:39:45.586 --> 00:39:46.840
(laughter)

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:51.200
there's more than seven
billion of us on the planet.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.830
Compared to the other apes,

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:56.300
human mothers have the
shortest interbirth interval

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.780
and the highest total fertility rate.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.070
Despite having these
really expensive offspring.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.410
So, basically, they should not
be able to afford to do this.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:05.120
Human women should not be able to afford

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.610
this rate of reproduction.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:07.770
So, how do they do it is

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.360
they do receive assistance from others.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.110
This could be fathers.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:13.070
It could be siblings.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:15.350
It could be grandparents,
other members of the community

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:17.060
in a strategy that's been called

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.460
a human biocultural reproductive strategy.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.290
But, obviously, for
these other individuals

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:25.613
to provide assistance to human mothers,

00:40:25.613 --> 00:40:28.090
they have to produce more than

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.498
just what they themselves need to survive.

00:40:30.498 --> 00:40:32.080
And, throughout the life course,

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.140
chimpanzees pretty much
produce what they can consume

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.220
and consume what they can produce.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.670
Except for maybe a little bit of nursing

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:39.180
right here at the outset.

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.370
It tracks closely.

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:44.520
Now, humans, we have this
long, very expensive childhood

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:48.073
in which we are producing much
less than we're consuming.

00:40:48.073 --> 00:40:52.180
But, eventually, we're able
to start producing a surplus.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.790
And the reason for this
is what I call technology.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:59.350
These culturally inherited,
passed on techniques

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:01.360
for exploiting the environment.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:05.170
Alright, so, this describes
a human technological niche.

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.120
What you've got here is

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.479
a powerful biocultural feedback cycle

00:41:09.479 --> 00:41:14.000
where technology can increase production,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.180
which provides the resources for sharing.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.960
Which can subsidize long,
expensive development

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.100
and population growth.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:24.680
Which makes it possible to
grow and educate a large brain.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.610
Which makes it possible

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:28.201
to have further technological
innovations and so forth.

00:41:28.201 --> 00:41:31.020
Now, as I articulate it there,

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:34.480
this suggests a very
powerful, as I said, feedback.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.160
Or even a runaway feedback curve.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.570
So, maybe we're back to

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:40.670
the guy tossing the bone
in the air after all.

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:42.454
Once it gets started, how do you stop it?

00:41:42.454 --> 00:41:45.410
But, in fact, not every
technological innovation

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:47.430
is necessarily gonna be a game changer

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.854
that is going to increase your production.

00:41:49.854 --> 00:41:52.230
Increase in intelligence may lead

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:55.170
to a greater refinement of tool making

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.070
rather than some kind of innovation.

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:59.290
And so, models that take the interaction

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:00.940
between some of these
variables into account,

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.440
they can produce this exponential curve.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.790
But they can also produce a
series of steps and plateaus

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.830
that's a lot more like what
the archeological record

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:10.348
actually looks like.

00:42:10.348 --> 00:42:13.020
So, unfortunately, things are complicated.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.050
Life is complicated.

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:16.640
And we have to turn to the
actual archeological record

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.957
and try to figure out what
happened, when, where, and why.

00:42:19.957 --> 00:42:23.490
So, why didn't the earliest
stone tools take off?

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:25.433
Why wasn't this a game changer?

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:31.240
So, if you've ever loosened
or tightened a screw

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.550
using the knife you happened
to have in your hand

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:36.000
rather than digging
through your tool chest

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.462
to get a proper screwdriver

00:42:37.462 --> 00:42:40.300
or if you've weighed
the costs and benefits

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.901
of updating your operating system,

00:42:41.901 --> 00:42:46.741
you know that technology comes
with both costs and benefits.

00:42:46.741 --> 00:42:49.570
So, for instance, technology might

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:52.270
increase your rate of return.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:53.790
But, before you can start employing it,

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:55.400
you may have to gather raw materials.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.180
You may have to actually
produce and maintain the tools.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.500
And, critically, you've got to learn

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:00.680
how to do all of these things

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.430
before you can even start
harvesting from the environment.

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:06.230
And, in some circumstances,
you'd be better off

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:08.400
to just start right in
with a simpler technology

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.470
rather than wasting all of this time.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:11.483
I'm going to focus.

00:43:11.483 --> 00:43:13.240
Actually, the argument here.

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.890
I should make it explicit,

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:16.810
is that this could help to explain

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:17.760
some of the patterning that

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:20.076
we see in the archeological record.

00:43:20.076 --> 00:43:23.320
I'm going to focus in
particular on skill learning.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:24.560
The cost of skill learning,

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.600
because this is something
that, evolutionarily,

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.910
brain evolution could mitigate
the costs of skill evolution.

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:31.743
Of skill learning.

00:43:31.743 --> 00:43:32.660
I'm sorry.

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:36.460
And also changes in our
donation of time and energy

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:37.460
in the form of teaching.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:39.671
So, sharing our time and
energy to teach others

00:43:39.671 --> 00:43:43.030
could alter the costs and benefits

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:45.533
of investment in skill learning.

00:43:45.533 --> 00:43:50.533
Alright, so, chimpanzees,
apes, can make stone tools.

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:53.950
But they don't do it in the wild.

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:56.960
And, in fact, it takes
them a really long time

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.660
to learn how to do it and
how to make tools that are,

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.283
frankly, not very good.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.330
So, it's really no wonder that

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:05.050
they don't bother to do this.

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:06.540
Now, part of the reason.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.190
Doctor Fragaszy talked about some of this.

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:10.370
Part of the reason is probably
has to do with their hands.

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:12.740
So, they have these very long fingers that

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.400
make some of the manipulations of stones

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.740
that we do for stone
tool making difficult.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:21.090
But I think that there's more
to it than just the hands.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:26.090
So, for reference, here
is a skilled modern human

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.370
making simple stone flakes.

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:31.210
These pieces, these sharp pieces of rock

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:34.290
that are coming off are
surprisingly effective knives.

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:35.700
Actually, you can use them to butcher

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.710
a wide range of animals.

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:39.470
And what's required here is to identify

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.772
the appropriate geometry on the stone

00:44:41.772 --> 00:44:45.270
to very dextrously
manipulate and support it

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:47.530
with the left hand while delivering

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:51.750
very forceful and accurate
strikes with the right hand.

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:53.580
Now, this is not rocket science.

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.826
But it does require some
pretty sophisticated

00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:57.780
spatial relationships.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:02.780
As well as some highly skilled
manual movements and control.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.900
So, I don't think it's just the fingers.

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:09.200
But I think it's also the
brain that's involved here.

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.690
That makes this easier for humans

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:13.240
than it is for chimpanzees.

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.470
And, in fact, humans have
an expanded neural system,

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:18.610
a dorsal stream, for relating things

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:21.095
like spatial relations, body positions,

00:45:21.095 --> 00:45:22.970
object identification,

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:25.776
and kinematics to technological goals.

00:45:25.776 --> 00:45:28.830
That I think makes it
easier and less costly

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:32.120
for humans to learn these kinds of skills.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.506
And, in fact, this is exactly.

00:45:33.506 --> 00:45:36.340
If you do a functional imaging

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.190
of the systems that are activated

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:40.050
during simple stone tool making,

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.780
this is the same network of structures

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.983
that you see involved there.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:49.111
So, if we turn to Australopithecines,

00:45:49.111 --> 00:45:51.187
with their small brains,

00:45:51.187 --> 00:45:54.486
with large jaws and teeth and guts

00:45:54.486 --> 00:45:59.486
adapted for digesting
unprocessed kinds of foods.

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.410
With hands and arms that
may or may not have been

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:02.430
up to the task.

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:04.560
It's probably the case
that stone tool making

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.700
just wasn't really worth it
for them as an investment.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.161
The exception, then,
that proves the rule here

00:46:10.161 --> 00:46:12.610
is the Lomekwian stone tool making.

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:16.000
Which actually is produced
using less demanding techniques.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.910
Like indirect percussion against a rock,

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:20.742
a stationary rock like this.

00:46:20.742 --> 00:46:23.720
Or bipolar shattering on an anvil.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:27.090
And you can see that the experimenter here

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:31.480
actually has their fingers bound together

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.400
to make this point.

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.520
It requires a lot less
demanding manipulation.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.180
So, less investment in skill,

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.590
but, perhaps, also,
less payoff in terms of

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:42.583
the effectiveness of the technology.

00:46:43.825 --> 00:46:47.220
By 2.5, 2.6 million years ago,

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:50.500
we do have evidence of
more skill intensive,

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.360
more dextrous freehand flaking.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.780
Like what we saw in that video.

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:59.820
From the site of Gona in Ethiopia.

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:02.356
Where I work with Doctor Sileshi Semaw.

00:47:02.356 --> 00:47:04.390
And you can see some of these tools

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:05.930
are made very finely.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:06.763
Very small.

00:47:06.763 --> 00:47:07.990
Some very delicate flaking

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:10.200
and precise gestures involved there.

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.273
And arguably could then be
a more efficient technology

00:47:13.273 --> 00:47:15.550
that might have a better payoff.

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:18.430
We don't really know very
much about early Homo

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:20.180
that was around at this time.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.410
Except the teeth maybe
are a little bit smaller.

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:24.250
We could speculate the
brain's also bigger.

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:25.236
But we don't know.

00:47:25.236 --> 00:47:29.060
Australopithecine's also around
at the right time and place

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.030
to make these tools.

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:32.891
Don't show any obvious
adaptations for tool making.

00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:36.610
And the sites on the landscape remain rare

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:37.930
and somewhat ephemeral.

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:40.507
And so, this is maybe sometimes worth it.

00:47:40.507 --> 00:47:42.820
And it's only after about
two million years ago

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.735
that we see what I'm going to loosely call

00:47:44.735 --> 00:47:46.849
habitual tool making.

00:47:46.849 --> 00:47:48.670
Habitual tool making.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.959
I think John Shay, who we'll hear from,

00:47:50.959 --> 00:47:53.950
has a different definition of habitual.

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:55.340
But I just mean in the sense that

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:56.540
they're doing it much more frequently.

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.910
The sites are larger.

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:59.180
They are denser.

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.510
They occur across more of the continent.

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:02.410
It persists.

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:04.200
And this is interesting,

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.440
because there's a pretty loose.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.190
We like to do these correspondencies

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:10.047
between this shift in the technology

00:48:10.047 --> 00:48:11.720
and the appearance of evidence of

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.470
larger brain and body size.

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:15.735
And it's pretty rapidly after that,

00:48:15.735 --> 00:48:18.723
by 1.8, 1.7 million years ago,

00:48:18.723 --> 00:48:20.920
that we see the invention of
an entirely new technology.

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.520
That's what we call the Early Acheulean.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.664
Where, for the first time,
tools were being made

00:48:25.664 --> 00:48:29.100
to an intentional shape
and posing a point.

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.830
These things we call picks and hand axes.

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:35.020
Which are often made by
striking a really large flake

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:36.330
off of a boulder core.

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:37.970
Which requires a whole different technique

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:39.730
and different kind of manual skill.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:41.014
And seems to go hand in hand

00:48:41.014 --> 00:48:44.570
with the appearance of Homo erectus.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:48.453
In the loose sense with
larger brains and body size.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.670
This then appears to be a
fairly stable adaptation.

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:57.670
With or without hand
ax, hominids are able to

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:01.309
inhabit diverse environments
throughout Eurasia.

00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:05.221
Even up to the edge of
the boreal zone here.

00:49:05.221 --> 00:49:08.670
And, in places where hand
axes were made consistently,

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:11.260
like throughout this
period, like in East Africa,

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.260
there is some evidence of
incremental refinement.

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:16.380
But, overall, things
seem to be pretty stable,

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:17.213
if variable.

00:49:17.213 --> 00:49:21.057
Stable but variable for about
a million years or more.

00:49:21.057 --> 00:49:24.270
And it's by then about
half a million years ago

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:25.540
we see clear evidence that

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:29.040
we've entered into another
period of abrupt change

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:33.230
indicated by rapid encephalization.

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:35.470
By the expansion into new habitats.

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:39.270
And by the appearance of new
forms of technology, as well.

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:43.007
And one of these that I've
studied in some detail

00:49:43.007 --> 00:49:46.750
are Late Acheulean style hand axes,

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:50.340
like this one from Boxgrove in the UK.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:55.210
And, in contrast to earlier
tools, earlier hand axes,

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:57.640
these are very nicely shaped.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:02.640
And especially made very flat
and thin in cross section.

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:05.230
And I emphasize that
because that's actually

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:07.438
a very difficult thing
to achieve with a rock

00:50:07.438 --> 00:50:09.850
by hitting it with another rock.

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:11.830
You start off with a big nodule.

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:13.220
Irregularly shaped.

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.920
And you have to flatten that thing down.

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.110
And the only way you're
going to be able to do that

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:18.710
is if you can strike flakes that

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:22.460
travel more than halfway
across the surface of the rock.

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:25.730
And, to enable that kind of fracture,

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:28.210
you really need to be
able to delicately adjust

00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:30.310
the angle, the placement, and the bevel

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:32.510
of the edge relative to the midline

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:34.220
in order to ensure that
the flake you strike

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.370
is actually going to
to travel some distance

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:37.900
along the core face.

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:41.160
Archeologists call this
striking platform preparation.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.270
And this entire technology
is a very demanding one.

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:47.040
So, in order to find out
a little bit more about

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.020
exactly what goes into
learning how to do this,

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.590
we recently ran an experiment

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:55.340
training modern people to make
these kinds of stone tools.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:56.402
About 20 people.

00:50:56.402 --> 00:50:59.590
They received close to
100 hours of training.

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:03.730
Each from an expert stone tool
maker, Doctor Nada Khreisheh.

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:04.710
Their products.

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:07.280
And we've collected all
kinds of information

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.820
about these people and their behavior.

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.530
Their lithic products I'll talk about.

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:12.790
The actual tools they
made have been analyzed

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:16.330
by Doctor Justin Pargenter
in my lab, as well.

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:17.693
He's my current post-doc.

00:51:17.693 --> 00:51:22.693
And what we found is a
classic power learning curve.

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:28.120
In which early progress is rapid.

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:31.470
But then it asymptotes off
to pretty much a plateau.

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:33.550
Diminishing returns from practice.

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:35.830
You may be familiar
with this kind of effect

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:37.490
in sports or anything like that.

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:40.378
It's found across a wide
range of different skills.

00:51:40.378 --> 00:51:44.400
Things being as they are in life,

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.200
although we tried to
control training time,

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.020
there was some variability in how often

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.170
people were able to make it

00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:52.080
into the lab for training sessions.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.280
And we found that not only is it

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.520
the total amount of practice
that you've racked up,

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.260
but it's actually the density,

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.830
the frequency and
intensity of your practice

00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:02.800
that helps to determine
individual differences

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.784
in the progress of skill learning.

00:52:04.784 --> 00:52:07.460
I want to point out here that

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:09.770
this scale is actually a five point scale.

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:11.860
So, the top is not even
being shown on the graph.

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:15.340
Because nobody even got
close to it in 90 hours.

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:18.310
We could extrapolate from
individual learning curves that

00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:21.122
people in our study we
expect would have taken

00:52:21.122 --> 00:52:23.860
anywhere from 121 hours to over 400 hours

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:26.414
to achieve mastery
comparable to what we see

00:52:26.414 --> 00:52:29.140
at Boxgrove in this kind of tool making.

00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:33.570
This is a very substantial
investment of time.

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:34.640
Especially considering that

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.730
we've given these people everything.

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:37.060
They don't have to gather their tools.

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:38.140
Don't have to make their equipment.

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.170
It's all right there for them.

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:41.360
And we're still talking
several hundred hours

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:42.970
of dedicated practice.

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:45.565
And this, to us, begins to suggest that

00:52:45.565 --> 00:52:50.210
we may be starting to see
some of the kinds of support

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:52.700
that modern humans provide for

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.640
the transmission of
complex technical skills.

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:58.370
Everything ranging from
intentional demonstration,

00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:00.080
perhaps explicit teaching.

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:03.060
Certainly social support,
coaching, scaffolding,

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.163
and encouragement.

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:06.310
So, the social context.

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:09.099
A very important part of what's evolving

00:53:09.099 --> 00:53:10.361
here in the technological niche.

00:53:10.361 --> 00:53:11.970
The other thing, of course, is that

00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:16.063
learning complex skills does
require complex cognition.

00:53:17.974 --> 00:53:19.210
And, during this initial
jump in performance here,

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:20.820
we found that individual differences

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:23.680
in how rapidly you kind
of learn this skill

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.010
were related to your performance

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:29.187
on a classic neuropsychological
test of set shifting.

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:33.990
Basically, you have to match
this card to one of these.

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:37.310
You can match either on
shape or color or number.

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:38.950
And your ability to do that.

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:40.190
They keep changing the rules.

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:42.160
Your ability to recognize
when a rule has changed,

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.234
it's your set shifting ability.

00:53:43.234 --> 00:53:45.920
And, if you temporarily mess with

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.470
the part of the brain that controls this

00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:50.150
in the right inferior frontal
gyrus with a magnetic pulse,

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:51.600
it slows people down in being able

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:54.000
to put together complex action sequences.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.490
Not coincidentally, this
very same part of the brain

00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:58.235
is what we consistently find to be active

00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:01.010
in functional imaging studies

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:02.800
of people making stone tools.

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.770
It also experiences changes
in white matter conductivity

00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:07.100
during training.

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:10.360
In fact, these changes are paralleled

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:14.930
by species differences between
humans and chimpanzees.

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:16.810
And, particularly, it's
the right hemisphere

00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:18.180
inferior frontal gyrus.

00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:20.270
So, we can say that evolutionary changes

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:22.800
to this system in humans

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.000
parallel the effects of
tool making training.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.250
The remaining question is

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:29.900
whether this is genetic
adaptation to tool making ability

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.140
or whether it's the developmental context

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:34.050
of growing up in a technological niche

00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:35.910
or some combination of those two,

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:38.610
which is obviously the most likely thing.

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:39.928
Anyway, it's going to be complicated.

00:54:39.928 --> 00:54:44.460
But, hopefully, by continued study

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:47.560
of the archeological record
and focused experimentation,

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.728
we can begin to sort out
some of these details

00:54:49.728 --> 00:54:53.225
of the very extended
and multistage process

00:54:53.225 --> 00:54:57.090
through which the modern human
technological niche evolved.

00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:58.357
Thank you.

00:54:58.357 --> 00:55:00.607
(applause)

00:55:01.899 --> 00:55:04.649
(relaxing music)
