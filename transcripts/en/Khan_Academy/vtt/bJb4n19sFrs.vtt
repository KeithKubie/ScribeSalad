00:00:00.404 --> 00:00:02.981
- [Voiceover] Today, Nate has 100 bananas.

00:00:02.981 --> 00:00:06.050
He will eat two of them every day.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.454
Is the number of bananas Nate has left

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:14.499
proportional to the number of days that pass?

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.030
And I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.741
and think about this.

00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:18.700
And what's interesting here,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.976
they're not saying, is the number of bananas eaten,

00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:23.304
they're saying the number of bananas Nate has left,

00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:26.244
proportional to the number of days that pass.

00:00:26.244 --> 00:00:27.777
So let's draw a little table here to think

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.913
about this a little bit more.

00:00:29.913 --> 00:00:32.025
So I'm gonna make three columns.

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:34.416
I'm gonna make three columns.

00:00:35.926 --> 00:00:37.157
So in the first column,

00:00:37.157 --> 00:00:39.688
this is gonna be the number of days that pass.

00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:43.449
So number of days...

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:47.479
that pass.

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:48.650
So that's this right over here,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.532
the number of days that pass.

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:51.553
And this middle column,

00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:54.316
I'm gonna write the number of bananas Nate has left.

00:00:54.316 --> 00:00:57.428
Number of bananas...

00:00:58.588 --> 00:01:01.881
bananas left.

00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:05.044
And over here, I'm gonna make the ratio between the two.

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:07.140
In order for this to be a proportional relationship,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.267
the ratio between these two has to be constant.

00:01:10.267 --> 00:01:12.260
So bananas left.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.072
So I'm gonna divide the second column by the first column.

00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:18.658
Bananas left...

00:01:19.798 --> 00:01:24.013
left, divided by days passed.

00:01:24.013 --> 00:01:28.146
Days passed.

00:01:28.146 --> 00:01:31.049
All right, so let's think about it a little bit.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.531
When one day has passed,

00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:36.621
how many bananas will he have left?

00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:39.245
Well, in that one day he will have eaten two bananas,

00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:42.449
so you're going to have 98 bananas left.

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:44.748
And so what's the ratio of bananas left to days passed?

00:01:44.748 --> 00:01:49.718
Well, it's 98 over one, which is going to be equal to 98.

00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:50.715
All right.

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:53.107
When two days have passed,

00:01:53.107 --> 00:01:55.034
how many bananas is he gonna have left?

00:01:55.034 --> 00:01:57.148
Well, he's going to consume two more bananas,

00:01:57.148 --> 00:01:59.206
so he's going to have 96 left,

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:00.444
and so what's the ratio?

00:02:00.444 --> 00:02:03.323
It's going to be 96 to two,

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:07.387
which is equal to 48.

00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:09.500
So clearly this ratio is not constant.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.357
It changed just from going to one day to the next day.

00:02:12.357 --> 00:02:14.074
So we don't have a constant ratio

00:02:14.074 --> 00:02:15.956
of bananas left to days passed,

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:17.557
so this is not,

00:02:17.557 --> 00:02:19.971
this is not a proportional,

00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:23.872
proportional relationship.

00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:25.521
Now, things might've been a little bit different

00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:29.259
if they said the number of bananas Nate has eaten,

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.852
is that proportional to the number of days that passed?

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.228
Well, yeah, sure, because then,

00:02:34.228 --> 00:02:37.363
if this was the number of bananas eaten,

00:02:37.363 --> 00:02:39.313
if this was the number of bananas eaten,

00:02:39.313 --> 00:02:41.078
then it would always be two times the number

00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:43.145
of days that pass, so that would be two,

00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:44.537
and then that would be four,

00:02:44.537 --> 00:02:47.625
and then these ratios would always be two.

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:50.040
But that's not what they asked for.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.362
They wanted us to compare number of bananas left

00:02:52.362 --> 00:02:54.545
to number of days that pass.
