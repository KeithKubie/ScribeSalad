00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.490
Feeling groggy, tired or
unmotivated in the afternoon?

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.620
Using coffee, soda and
energy drinks

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.480
we often try to push
through the dreaded long day

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.030
yawning through the hours
and fighting the fatigue.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.920
But it just so happens that
the solution

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.690
is the very thing we've been trying
to avoid all along,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.350
sleep.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.070
Truth is, the power nap

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.750
is perhaps the most effective way

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.800
to rejuvenate your brain.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
There are four main stages of
your sleep cycle.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The first two are relatively
light sleep,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.970
while the third brings you
 into a deep slumber.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.100
The final stage known as
rapid eye movement,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.430
or REM for short,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.070
is where most of your dreams begin.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.000
The benefits of napping are 
tied to the length

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.770
of time in which you are asleep.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.300
Naps 30 minutes in length

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.970
generally only allow time to enter
these first stages.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.130
In stage 1, slow eye movement begins

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.540
and if woken you often feel as though
you didn't even sleep.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.450
But as you continue into
stage 2

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.480
your brain begins to inhibit processing.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.500
and ignores external stimuli that
it deems non-dangerous

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.950
in order to relax you 
and give you a tranquil sleep.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.170
It also begins memory consolidation,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.440
in which information you learn
is processed.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.080
Waking out of these stages has
shown benefits including;

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.440
increased productivity,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.850
increased cognitive function,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.800
enhanced memory,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.000
boosted creativity

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.427
and most importantly,
feeling less tired.

00:01:07.472 --> 00:01:09.887
Beyond 30 minutes you
enter stage 3

00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:12.854
and experience something known as
sleep inertia when awakened.

00:01:12.854 --> 00:01:15.181
Because your body is 
coming out of a deep sleep,

00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:16.925
motor dexterity is decreased

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:20.255
while grogginess and the longing
to go back to sleep increases.

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:23.713
Many people falsely deem naps
non-beneficial for themselves,

00:01:23.713 --> 00:01:26.334
but the truth is,
they have simply napped too long.

00:01:26.334 --> 00:01:28.576
As the benefits of napping
become clearer

00:01:28.576 --> 00:01:30.500
many nap salons have opened
throughout Japan,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.003
where workers can pay to have a
brief lunchtime nap on a daybed

00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:35.361
to increase alertness at work.

00:01:35.492 --> 00:01:38.459
So maybe it's about time we all 
start sleeping on the job a little more.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.667
Just tell your boss "Science said so".

00:01:42.096 --> 00:01:43.904
Got a burning question you want answered?

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:46.339
