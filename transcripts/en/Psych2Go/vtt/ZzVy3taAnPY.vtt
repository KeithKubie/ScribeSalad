[intro]

00:00:07.867 --> 00:00:14.356
Hello, everyone! And, welcome to the Psych2go YouTube channel. I'm Ashley, and I'm one of

00:00:14.356 --> 00:00:19.786
the main members of this channel. You may have seen me from videos such as, 'Nailbiting: A

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:25.487
Problem Deeper than Skin Deep' to 'Benefits of Singing and Music Therapy'.

00:00:25.487 --> 00:00:30.093
Now, if you're new to this channel, what we do is we feature videos contributed by our lovely

00:00:30.093 --> 00:00:35.341
community of followers who wish to further explore the content from our main website,

00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:36.887
Psych2go.net.

00:00:36.887 --> 00:00:41.968
Today, the topic is: Why do we get the best ideas in the shower? And, I'm here with Psych2go

00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:45.386
today to talk about anti-social behavior versus asocial behavior.

00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:57.130
 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.330
We make videos based on the community contributed articles on the website.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.905
"I'll be going off the article, Art Therapy by Dancia Cecilia"

00:01:05.905 --> 00:01:08.391
"All eyes on me, the spotlight effect by Jenny Kang"

00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:13.188
"Today's article is about people tend to sleep late tend to have a higher IQ by Risha Mae"

00:01:13.188 --> 00:01:18.460
We have videos talking about 10 psychological facts about human feelings, to articles debunking

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.616
psychological myths.

00:01:20.616 --> 00:01:24.971
"So today, we're going to be talking about 5 harmful myths about mental illnesses."

00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:31.833
Our videos come in 3 formats. Whiteboard animations, such as "10 Benefits of Being Shy".

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:37.319
Casual vlog style, such as the one you see me do. And, in the future, our third format will be

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.065
taking on interviews of psychology professors.

00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:47.656

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:53.971

00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:58.972
Ashley. If you have any questions, don't be shy. Let us know in the comments below. Feel free
