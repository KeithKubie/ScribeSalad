00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
People often stereotype generic brands
as less tasty of poor quality or less...

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.510
effective than their brand-name
counterparts, but given that trusted...

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.309
brands demand more of your money, is
there really a difference between...

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.420
brand-name and generic food or drugs?

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.920
When it comes to food, while there are...

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.970
many companies dedicated to producing
generic brands, the truth is that many...

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.939
large brand-name manufacturers often
use their excess capacity and expertise...

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.199
to produce generic label products as well.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.299
In fact, in 2007, the Peter Pan brand...

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.829
of peanut butter was found to be
contaminated with salmonella and...

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.969
recalled and, as a result, Wal-Mart's
Great Value brand of peanut butter was...

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.669
also taken off the showels.

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:42.940
Next time you're at the grocery store, try compare the...

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.420
ingredient list and nutritional information of a generic item with its brand counterparts.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.000
Even if they aren't
identical which they sometimes are,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.220
it'll give you a sense of how similar
they can be.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.060
And studies show that on average generic brands run 30% cheaper.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.240
Furthermore, many staple food products

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.739
like sugar and salts are regulated by
the FDA and think about it

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.340
table salt also known as sodium chloride
only contains two elements from the

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.920
periodic table how variable could it
really be? Think they taste different

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.900
Fancier brand name packaging may
play a role. In one study, university

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.700
students were given free coffee and
asked to rate it. It turns out that if

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.280
the cream and sugar were placed in fancy
containers on a silver tray vs placed in

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.659
styrofoam cups with haphazardly written
labels, they would prefer the fancy brew

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.479
despite the coffee being the exact same
the placebo effect can be quite strong

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.790
when it comes to your taste preferences
but when it comes to drugs

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.440
things are a little different

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.420
in fact generic drugs have to be the
same as the brand name for example

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.380
ibuprofin is a non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug that treats

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.880
headaches fevers and minor aches and
pains it's also sold under brand names

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.600
like Advil and Nurofen but at the base of
these pills is the exact same thing. two

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.290
hundred milligrams of ibuprofen the same
dosage safety strength and intended use

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.110
the generic drugs go through a series of
stringent regulatory testing to prove

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.720
their bioequivalence to the brand name
the only way in which the pills meet

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.320
difference between their filler
ingredients which may include starch or

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.490
gelatin, flavoring or different colors so
while they aren't exactly the same they

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.880
are effectively the same and studies
routinely prove that generic drugs are

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.170
as effective as the brand name in fact
some studies show that individuals are

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.980
more likely to stay on course with
generic drugs because of the lower cost

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.040
of course there are some very specific
drugs that have a narrow therapeutic

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.850
index which requires certain brands in
these cases a doctor can help you decide

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.950
and yet many people still remain
skeptical in one study participants were

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.720
given painkillers that were actually
just blank placebo pills and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.440
administered a small electric shock when
they were told that the pill costs $0.10

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.180
only 61% of people felt pain relief but
if they were told that the pill cost

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.130
$2.50 a whole 85.4% participants claimed
to feel relief from the pain at the end

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.640
of the day

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.560
generic products whether food drugs or
otherwise can be but aren't always equal

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.420
to their branding counterpart so save
those dollar bills and buy something

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.280
special we actually put together our own
taste test to see if anyone could tell

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.640
the difference between their favorite
brands and the generic counterpart in
