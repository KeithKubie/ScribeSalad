00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:16.883
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it is to

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:18.852
build a Google Gadget.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.821
The challenge: making it
original, useful,

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.723
and customizable. 

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:25.859
I'm Dan Le, with
the Google Gadgets team.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.661
I'm here to brief you
on your mission.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.331
Googe Gadgets can give you
the time, weather,

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.300
sport scores, or pull feeds
from YouTube.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.536
They gather information from
around the internet and

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:39.172
display it for you
in a convenient way.

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.707
You can find many other
gadgets in the

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.343
iGoogle directory.

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.512
Now let's look at how
you build a gadget.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.380
We'll start with a simple
version and get more

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.050
complex as we go.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.153
This gadget fetches and
displays multiple RSS and Atom

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:55.221
feeds from all over the web.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.223
It uses multiple
API features and

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.892
is highly configurable. 

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.094
Let's select the
basic parameters.

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:04.297
Say you really like R&amp;B music.
You might then customize this

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:07.033
gadget to pull together the 
latest R&amp;B music editions

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:10.870
on YouTube, Amazon, and
iTunes, as well as pull the

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.506
latest entries from
your favorite music blog.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:16.176
You can create a
separate tab for each feed.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.945
You should start small by
creating a simple gadget XML

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.914
that just has the basics.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:24.417
You can make the gadget
more complex as you go.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.286
The code here determines the
title and height

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:30.123
of the gadget.

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.625
Now you need to
add tabs to the gadget.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.427
Add
'&lt;Require feature="tabs"/&gt;'

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:37.130
to the gadget XML, which
enables the use of

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.199
the API tabs library.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.401
You will generate unique
content for each tab in

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:44.204
the callback function.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:47.107
Now you have the basic
gadget shell with four tabs.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:51.344
The next step is to pull an
RSS or Atom feed for each tab.

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:54.080
You will define the default
value for each URL feed that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.117
will be loaded, but you will
add UserPrefs so that users

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:01.020
can configure their own data
when they use your gadget.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.923
From the data you can display
different types of information

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:07.026
about the feeds, such as its
name, display name,

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:10.830
description, feed entry,
and summaries.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.366
Once you have completed this
step, users will be able to

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:16.836
change the input feed URLs.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:20.740
Next, within your gadget, you
should perform the fetch.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.612
We have an API method
called "_IG_FetchFeedAsJSON."

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:28.848
This is used to perform a
fetch to the feed and return a

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:31.017
"JSON" response back to the
callback function

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:33.119
that you define.

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.455
Within the callback, use a
"JSON" object to

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.357
read the feed.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:39.526
The second parameter is where
you specify the

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:41.494
callback function.

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:43.796
The third parameter defines
the number of entries

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.298
you want to fetch.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:48.168
The fourth parameter is a
simple true or false depending

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:51.838
on whether you want to include
summaries for each entry.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.507
This large code snippet shows
the callback function that

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.476
generates the HTML based on

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:59.412
the "JSON" data
that is returned.

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:02.215
Let's see what the
gadget looks like now. 

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:05.084
Now the gadget is able to
execute the basic functions

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.520
you've set for it to perform.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.591
How can you improve its
appearance and performance.

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.227
First, you'll be responsible
for formatting the

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.695
UI of the gadget.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.431
You can add CSS rules to
stylize the output

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:19.599
for the gadget.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.069
But keep in mind some key
points about UI design.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.905
Gadgets should be
as compact as possible.

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:28.708
Real estate on
iGoogle is limited.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.744
You can keep gadgets compact
by using single boarder lines,

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:34.247
decreasing margins, and
applying formatting to the

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:37.817
tabs, such as
smaller font size.

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:39.919
Take another look at the
gadget to see what difference

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:43.189
these CSS rules have made.

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.158
Since the amount of
information from your feeds

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:48.494
will change often, you can
combat the changing need for

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:52.265
space this creates with
the "Dynamic-Height feature."

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:54.234
This feature will
automatically resize your

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:57.070
gadget so that it will best
fit the amount of information

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.205
coming from your feeds.

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:01.140
It will prevent your gadget
from taking up

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.977
unnecessary space.

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:07.146
You can also add the analytics
feature, a single function

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:09.549
call to "_IG_Analytics."

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.818
All you need is a Google
Analytics account, which is

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:13.653
completely free.

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:17.457
Passing your Google Analytics
ID as a first parameter.

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:20.660
For the second parameter, you
identify a unique path

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.462
specific to your gadget.

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:25.164
This function will report a
page you hit back to your

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.200
account, and lets you know how
many hits are coming

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.301
from your gadget.

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:31.371
Now you can put the final
touches on the gadget.

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:34.307
The more customizable it is,
the better.

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:37.277
When deciding what to add,
just keep in mind the features

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:40.747
you would like to have if you
were using this gadget.

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:43.383
For instance, you might want
the ability to change the

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:48.421
titles, tab labels, and number
of feed entries to display.

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:51.391
Here are a few code snippets
that show what's required to

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:57.330
make the gadget title
and tab titles customizable.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.099
The last customizable feature
you can add is to allow the

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.769
user to specify how many feed
entries the gadget

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:04.137
should accept.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.372
Before, the code has specified 
specified there will be

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:08.041
three feed entries.

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:11.844
You can also define a drop
down menu for the feeds.

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:15.048
We replaced the hard-coded
part of the number of entries

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:17.150
with this user pref.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.285
So now you've built
your gadget.

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:22.188
The last step is to
put your gadget into action.

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:24.657
How do you get it in
the gadget directory?

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.826
Submit your gadget to iGoogle.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.562
In order to be able to submit
this gadget, you need to

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:32.365
add some metadata
about your gadget.

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:34.701
This information is what will
be used to help make your

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:37.870
gadget more searchable
in iGoogle's directory.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.040
Remember, users will have
thousands of gadgets to choose

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.142
from in the gadget directory.

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.211
So you must attract the user
to your gadget when

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.879
they are browsing.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.982
Some key ways to do so are to:

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:52.185
Find a catchy title
for your gadget.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.454
Make it short and descriptive.

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:56.989
A user should be able to know
exactly what your gadget

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:59.025
does by the title.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:02.128
Design an attractive thumbnail
and screenshot.

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:05.064
Images are important, as this
may be the only thing that

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:07.400
attracts the user to
your gadget.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.602
Make the thumbnail stand out
and encourage the user

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:11.404
to click on it.

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:14.607
Once its listed on the iGoogle
directory, get to work on

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:16.709
promoting your gadget.

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:20.546
On your own website, you can
add the "Add to Google" button.

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:24.050
There's also a share gadget
feature on iGoogle, which lets

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.119
you send it to your friends.

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:29.288
If you have questions about
the gadget's API, there's a

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:31.257
public discussion group that
we encourage you to

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:33.259
become involved in.

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.795
Members on my team moderate
this group and answer

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:37.563
questions as they come up.

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:41.000
There are more than 3500
members in this group, and

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.202
its a great resource.

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:48.441
You have now been briefed
on your mission.

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:58.384
Good luck.

00:06:58.384 --> 00:07:00.586
Submit your gadget soon.

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:01.986
The clock is ticking.
