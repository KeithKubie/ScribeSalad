00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.880
Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.295
I'm Appie.

00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:13.590
I have never talked
before in front of people.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.900
So please forgive me
if this is really bad.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.400
OK.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.650
So I work at DeNA.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.310
It's a Japanese company,
but we're growing

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.740
our global presence in gaming.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.930
We had about $2 billion worth
of virtual currency spent

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.780
in our titles in Japan last
year, and around $270 million

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.244
spent around the
rest of the world.

00:00:32.244 --> 00:00:34.160
So internally, we've
released a lot of titles.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.785
And we just launched
"Blood Brothers 2"

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:37.530
in former San Francisco office.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.215
We work with licensed IPs,
like Transformers, Star Wars,

00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:40.715
Marvel.

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:42.300
I'm really excited
to mention we're

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.756
bringing over a huge hit in
Japan-- "Final Fantasy Record

00:00:44.756 --> 00:00:45.255
Keeper."

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:47.600
It's made us around $10
million a month there,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.374
so we're really
excited about it.

00:00:50.374 --> 00:00:52.290
We track a lot of different
data in our games.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.570
Of course, the standard KPIs
so we can compare our titles.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.180
We get ad-vendor data and
do marketing analysis.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.080
We also look at custom
game logs to tune

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.300
our games, improve our design.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.410
So that leads to a lot of data.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.860
On busy days, we get up to
60 megs of raw logs a minute

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.540
and around 50 gigs
of raw logs per day.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.550
And that's given
us some headaches

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.150
in the past that I'll get into.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.870
So all this data
that's coming from all

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.050
these different titles,
different studios,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.722
we've been storing
in a Hadoop cluster.

00:01:23.722 --> 00:01:24.805
That was our old solution.

00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:26.780
Our version of Hadoop
is a little outdated.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.260
But we've been
accessing it via HiveQL.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.670
And last I checked, the
table we store that data

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.120
is around 42 terabytes.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.300
This is a diagram of
our old infrastructure.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.440
15 seconds and a slide
is not enough time

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.120
to describe all
these blank boxes.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.885
But I will say that
as we've grown,

00:01:43.885 --> 00:01:45.630
it's gotten more and
more complicated.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.840
And we've had a lot of
bottlenecks and failure

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.640
points, the first of which is we
have a really slow ETL process.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.227
From the point a player
triggers an action in our game

00:01:54.227 --> 00:01:56.060
to when we would actually
be able to analyze

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.242
that data was about three
hours, sometimes more.

00:01:59.242 --> 00:02:01.200
And we run a lot of live
events at our company.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.230
So that made it really
hard to iterate quickly.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.370
We've also grown our size quite
a bit in terms of the analysts

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.199
in our studio.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.020
So we've clogged
our systems a lot,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.400
time to time-- brought it down.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.400
And it's been really hard
to control permissions

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.100
effectively, especially with
an older version of Hadoop.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.780
And this is my
biggest pet peeve.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.492
If I was trying to answer
some question with data--

00:02:23.492 --> 00:02:25.200
running some query--
I would kick it off.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.783
And then I'd wait,
and wait, and wait.

00:02:26.783 --> 00:02:28.802
And it would take like
forever to get data back.

00:02:28.802 --> 00:02:30.260
And you'd forget
what you were even

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.390
looking at when you started.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.500
So our solution to deal
with all these issues

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.150
has been to just simplify
the common tech in our games

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.190
in the West.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.080
We've done that by using
Google App Engine as a platform

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.230
server for our titles and to
use Google BigQuery for the data

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.700
storage and analysis.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.426
So in terms of data ingestion,
it's become much quicker.

00:02:51.426 --> 00:02:53.300
We've played around with
Google Streaming API

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.740
into BigQuery, cloud
logging, some other setups,

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.150
and we've managed to get the
time from users triggering data

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.520
to us being able to analyze
it down to seconds instead

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.920
of three hours.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.390
We also have been able to
scale without any worries.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.040
If we launch 10 more titles
or hire 10 more analysts,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.890
we don't need to worry about
us bringing our systems down.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.870
If something bad happens,
we just blame Google

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.753
and call them up--

00:03:14.753 --> 00:03:15.252
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:15.252 --> 00:03:18.900
--and sort it out.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.247
And it's been really easy
to control permissions.

00:03:21.247 --> 00:03:22.580
This was a huge headache before.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.510
We work with a lot of
external developers.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.070
And we couldn't effectively
share their own data back

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.830
to them.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.430
And so now with just
a couple clicks,

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.310
we can share their
projects, their data

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.890
sets with people outside
and within our own studio.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.200
And here I am running a query.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.110
It's processing them
out-- 170 gigs of data,

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.830
grouping by a couple
things, coming up

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.470
with tutorial completion rate.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.360
Took about eight
seconds in BigQuery--

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.510
the same query over less data in
Hadoop took about two minutes.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.160
So lessons learned-- it hasn't
been totally smooth sailing,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.000
mostly because we've had to
look at some things differently.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.450
We've hit some quotas.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.182
We have to work around a
different cost structure.

00:03:59.182 --> 00:04:00.890
And it's a little bit
of a newer product,

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.190
so some features haven't
always worked as expected.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.730
But Google has been great
with helping us with that.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.780
So for us, it's really
been a good solution.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.110
We want to be able to have
the control of our own data

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.010
in-house to do our own analysis.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.740
And we don't want to have
to worry about maintaining

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.630
the actual infrastructure to
make that happen because we're

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.379
a games company, after all.

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:21.670
So I wanted to show you,
playing around with some data,

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.580
this is connected with Tableau.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.727
And I'm diving into
an example of when

00:04:25.727 --> 00:04:28.060
players were losing missions
early on in our game "Blood

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.520
Brothers 2."

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.420
We made a change, and
I wanted to drill in

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.740
by day to see if it worked.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.060
And I can see here it did.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.390
Here's another example.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.700
We reduced the entry price
for a live event gotcha

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.890
that had unlocking steps.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.880
And we increased
conversion early on,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.890
though we decreased revenue
early in the funnel.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.223
But overall, if you look at
the green line on the right,

00:04:48.223 --> 00:04:51.480
we increased revenue compared
to other past events.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.630
So at DeNA, we really try
to drive actions with data.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.714
We prioritize our
engineering effort based off

00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:59.005
of monitoring game performance.

00:04:59.005 --> 00:05:00.912
We'll optimize our funnels.

00:05:00.912 --> 00:05:02.245
We'll tune our games' economies.

00:05:02.245 --> 00:05:04.810
And we iterate really
quickly on live events.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.780
So in sum, BigQuery has
really helped us actually

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.630
focus on using this data instead
of just exhausting ourselves

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.430
trying to get to
the data itself.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.150
So I'm excited to see what
our analysts at the company

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.160
push ourselves to now
that we have great tools.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.116
And I'm glad I got to share
our experience with you today.

00:05:20.116 --> 00:05:20.616
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:20.616 --> 00:05:22.504
Thank you.
