00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.429
&gt;&gt; Water scarcity is one of the biggest challenges
facing the world

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:06.279
today.
I work for a big brewer, SABMiller, and this

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.020
morning we have a session
with lots of large businesses, with NGOs,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.740
and with government ministers
from different departments to talk about how

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.280
water unpins economic
growth.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.970
And it's important that all businesses challenge
themselves to become

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.169
much more water efficient.
We have a stretching target to improve our

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.730
water efficiency by 25
percent by 2015.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.730
But we need to go much further.
And that's why we are working with partners

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.340
like WWF, who were there in
the session this morning, to protect watersheds

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.820
that communities depend
on, businesses depend on, and farmers depend

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.050
on.
And it's still a big challenge.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.560
Water scarcity will be a big challenge.
By 2030, we'll have a demand/supply gap of

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.440
about 40 percent.
And we must work together to be water smart

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.329
to make sure that doesn't
effect development and it doesn't effect growth.
