have brain to brain communication and

have brain to brain communication and
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.830

that me gives us the possibility of

that me gives us the possibility of
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990

have serious proposed a brain net

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710
have serious proposed a brain net
 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.160
have serious proposed a brain net
whereby you would exchange not just

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
whereby you would exchange not just
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.679
whereby you would exchange not just
information like typing but also

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689

then what comes beyond that well of

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
then what comes beyond that well of
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.960
then what comes beyond that well of
course beyond that is science fiction

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970
course beyond that is science fiction
 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.300
course beyond that is science fiction
and science fiction gives us all sorts

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
and science fiction gives us all sorts
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.520

maybe one day the internet will become

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
maybe one day the internet will become
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.770
maybe one day the internet will become
sentient maybe one day the internet will

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780
sentient maybe one day the internet will
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.200
sentient maybe one day the internet will
think that humans are in the way and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210
think that humans are in the way and
 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.749
think that humans are in the way and
perhaps the internet will take over just

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
perhaps the internet will take over just
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.420
perhaps the internet will take over just
like in the Terminator series well I

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
like in the Terminator series well I
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.480

don't think so the Internet is simply a

don't think so the Internet is simply a
way in which minds can communicate with

the internet now some people say well

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
the internet now some people say well
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789
the internet now some people say well
what about some kind of collective

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799
what about some kind of collective
 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.910

consciousness that arises by an emergent
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.130

phenomenon well that's a lot of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140
phenomenon well that's a lot of
 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.200

gobbledygook that's a lot of nice words

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210

that one of our most advanced computers

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190
that one of our most advanced computers
 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.090
that one of our most advanced computers
was the IBM computer Watson which
