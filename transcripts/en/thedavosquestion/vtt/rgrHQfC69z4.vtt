00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
&gt;&gt; Well Haiti is now facing an emergency.
It was one of the worst disaster that mankind

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.269
faced in the last
centuries.

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.009
So this is the most immediate thing.
But as you deal with this question which implies

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.669
food, implies medical,
implies shelter as you deal with these -- water

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:20.920
 -- as you deal with
these more immediate questions you must also

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.840
think in the medium and
the long term.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.689
A lot progress has been made before the earthquake
in the political

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.750
front, in the security front, in the -- even
in the economic front

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.420
because there was more interest of business
people.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.050
We have to now harness all these interests
and make it come again and

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.660
you see because there is no way that you can
separate completely the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.360
emergency from the long term.
So I -- the sooner the business people come

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.900
there also, and start to
make their plans as people said here in the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.340
tourism industry, garment,
Brazilian industries are very interested -- ethanol

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.920
is very [INAUDIBLE]
in Brazil can help but in order help Haiti

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.660
there we have the technology
and we have even the disposition, but you

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.590
have to have the market.
So you have to have facilities in the U.S.,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.710
Canada, or European markets
so they we can do that as well.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.980
That's just as an example.
