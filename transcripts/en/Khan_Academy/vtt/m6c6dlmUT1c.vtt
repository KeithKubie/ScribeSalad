00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
 

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.060
Let's say I have a cliff.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.340
Let's make this cliff, I
don't know, let's say

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.280
it's 50 meters high.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.310
 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.940
And on this cliff,
I have a car.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.780
And this car is not just
sitting on the cliff,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.686
it's driving off of it.

00:00:16.686 --> 00:00:18.310
A very dramatic problem.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.860
So let's see, I have
this car here.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.760
And it's driving off of this
cliff at 5 meters per second.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.060
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.040
And I want to know, what is
the path of this car as it

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.110
falls off of the cliff?

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.590
So let's set up a little
coordinate axis here.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.400
 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.480
So let's say that this is
the y-axis right there.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.520
And then this will
be my x-axis.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.266
 

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:56.590
So this is y, this is x.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.290
Let's say that this is the
point-- well, we know that this

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.780
is a 50 meter high cliff.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.760
Maybe y equals 0 is sea level.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.280
So this would be 50 right here.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.460
And let's say that this point
right here on the cliff,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.820
that's at x is equal to 10.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.840
So this point right
here's the point 10, 50.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.770
And let's say the car's right
at this point, right about

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.200
to drive off the cliff.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.840
And time is equal to 0.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.420
So this is that
time equal to 0.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.070
 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.890
So t for time.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.830
Time is equal to zero.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.620
So my question is, what
happens to this car as

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.810
it drives off the cliff?

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.870
So this is a bit of a physics
problem, and I won't go

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.100
deep into the physics.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.240
And I won't prove some
of the equations.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.370
And I encourage you to
watch the kinematics

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.930
videos, the projectile motion
videos, if you want to know

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.360
where the equations come from.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.520
But the point here is just to
get the equations and see

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.520
what the graph looks like.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.430
So if I want to know x as a
function of time-- a suitably

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.440
vibrant color-- so x as a
function of time is

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.430
going to be what?

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.005
Well, we're going to assume
that we're on a planet

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:08.080
that has no air.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.180
We're in a vacuum.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.270
So if we start off in the x
direction at 5 meters per

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.260
second to the right, we won't
be decelerated by air or

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.730
friction or anything else.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.870
Newton's laws of motion:
an object in motion stays

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.330
in motion, unless it's
affected by a net force.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.690
And there won't be any net
force in the x direction.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.600
It's just going to keep
moving to the right at

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.050
5 meters per second.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.810
And position, or distance,
is just equal to

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.270
velocity times time.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.840
Our velocity is 5 times time.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.190
And, of course, it didn't
start at x is equal to 0.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.390
This is at time equals 0.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.200
So it started at x
is equal to 10.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.090
So you want to know-- it's
kind of x of 0, where it

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.360
started off, so plus 10.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.070
And this should be a little
intuitive for you, right?

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.180
At time is equal to 0, this
term cancels out, where

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.590
x is equal to 10.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.670
That makes sense.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.050
At time is equal to 1, we
should be a little bit-- we'll

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.900
be 5 meters further out,
so on and so forth.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.440
Fair enough.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.490
That's x as a function
of the parameter time.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.660
As you probably realize, that
this is a video on parametric

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.920
equations, not physics.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.900
So it's nice to early on
say the word parameter.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.295
Parameter.

00:03:19.295 --> 00:03:23.080
 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.600
And time tends to be the
parameter when people talk

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.840
about parametric equations.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.780
Although it could be anything.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.310
It could be radius or angle
or who knows what else?

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.970
So let's figure out what y
is as a function of time.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.900
So y as a function of time,
it's going to be equal to

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.450
the initial y position,
or y of 0, which is 50.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.340
We're 50 meters up in the air.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.860
 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.230
Plus our initial velocity
in the y direction.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.272
And we don't actually have
any initial velocity

00:03:56.272 --> 00:03:56.990
in the y direction.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.430
The car isn't jumping,
or isn't diving.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.340
It's just moving
horizontally to the right.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.180
And the cliff is supporting it.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.070
So it has no y velocity.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.460
But if you were curious,
it would be the y

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.490
velocity times time.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.820
But since there's no y velocity
times time, at least initially,

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.510
I'll put nothing there.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.110
Plus the acceleration
of gravity times

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.720
time squared over 2.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.370
We want to figure out the sine.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.080
And just so you know, I mean,
it's nice to touch on the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.940
physics a little bit, just so
you know where these formulas

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.750
come from and you know the
motivation behind why you would

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.920
even use a parametric equation.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.580
Gravity goes downwards in this
example, and downwards in

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.430
this example is in the
minus y direction.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.050
y is decreasing.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.370
And the real-- and you know,
it's not exact-- but gravity is

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.370
normally 9.8 meters per second
squared in most textbooks.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.560
But for the sake of simplifying
this, we'll say that it's

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.250
approximately 10 meters
per second squared.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.690
That's how fast everything
will be accelerated

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.790
downward on this planet.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.580
Since it has no air, let's
assume it's a planet with

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.510
a little bit more
mass than earth.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.170
And since it's going downwards,
its direction is negative.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.180
So in our formula up here, it's
our initial position-- we had

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.630
no velocity times time, so I
won't put that there-- minus 10

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.600
meters per second squared
times t squared over 2.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.310
And you can watch the
projectile motion videos to

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.640
figure out how I got these
formulas right there.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.760
But that's not the
point of this.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.450
The point of this is to graph
what happens to the cars and

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.610
learn a little bit about
parametric equations.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.170
So what is the path of this car
as it falls off the cliff?

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.450
Let's make a table here.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:40.600
 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.980
So x and y are a function of
this third parameter, t.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.050
So we're going to set t at
different values and we're

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.700
going to figure out what
x and y are equal to.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.460
And I'm just going to
arbitrarily pick some t's.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.030
T is equal to 0.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.560
T is equal to 1, 2, and 3.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.970
At time is equal
to 0, what is x?

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.750
x of 0-- this is 0-- x
is equal to 10 meters.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.850
At time is equal
to 1, what is x?

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.110
And this is x of 1, right?

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.560
If I wanted to write
that notation.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.185
So 5 times 1 is 5,
plus 10 is 15.

00:06:13.185 --> 00:06:15.900
 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.920
x of 2?

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.770
5 times 2 plus 10, that's 20.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.480
And it makes sense.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.625
Every second we're getting 5
meters more to the right.

00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:26.420
Or x is increasing by 5 meters.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.890
So when t is equal to
3, 15 plus 10 is 25.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:31.800
Easy enough.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.720
The y is a little bit
more complicated.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.590
And just to simplify this, it's
the same thing as 5, right?

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.520
10 divided by 2.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.150
So 50 minus 5t squared.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.210
So time is equal to 0,
this term cancels out.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.310
We just have 50 meters
up in the air.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.940
At time is equal to 1, 1
squared is 1 times 5, is five.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:07:00.190
50 minus 5 is 45 five
meters in the air.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.970
Is that right?

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.910
Right, yeah, time 1, 50.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.730
Right.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.880
And then at time is equal
to 2, 2 squared is 4.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.100
4 times 5 is 20.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.980
50 minus 20 is 30.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.270
And then finally, at time is
equal to 3-- and I just say

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.530
finally because that's the
last number we picked--

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.570
time is equal to 3.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.200
3 squared is 9.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.280
9 times 5 is 45.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.170
50 minus 45 is 5.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.810
So let's plot these points.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.380
So the time is equal to 0.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.530
That's what we got right there.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.050
At time is equal to 1,
we're at x is equal to 15.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.090
That's roughly, you see this
is 5, 10, 15-- let me do

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:44.380
all of them-- 15, 20, 25.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.830
And then the y-axis-- let me
label that while we're at

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:53.890
it-- this is roughly
10, 20, 30, 40, 50.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.770
So at time is equal to
0, we're at 10, 50.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.040
That's that point right there.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.700
At time is equal to
1, we're at 15, 45.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.200
So x is 15, y is 45, which
is right about there.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.550
So this is t is equal to 1.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:15.070
At time is equal to 2, or
at the coordinate 20, 30,

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.890
it's right about there.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.480
So this is at time
is equal to 2.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.170
And then at time is equal
to 3, we're at 25, 5.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.240
So we're right there.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.840
 

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.240
And if we kept going on,
at some point we're

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:31.950
going to hit the ground.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.860
And you can figure out,
actually-- set this equal to 0

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.600
and you figure out the exact
time you hit the ground.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.720
Actually, let's do that.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.470
If this is equal to 0, 50,
you get t is equal to

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.470
the square root of 10.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.500
Which is a little
over 3 seconds.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.830
Which makes sense, right?

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.220
A little over 3 seconds, we're
going to be hitting the ground.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.940
But anyway, what's the
path of this car?

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.420
Well, it's going to look
something like this.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.610
 

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.690
Ooh, it starts getting
accelerated downwards,

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:57.510
and then plunk!

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.830
It hits the ground at 3
point something seconds.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.820
Now what was interesting here
is that by setting the

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.600
parameter, not only did we
get the curve-- right?

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.710
We got this curve, which is
kind of half of a parabola,

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.800
half of a downward shaping
parabola-- and we could

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.150
actually eliminate the t,
and just get the equation

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.960
for that parabola.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.480
And we'll do that
in future videos.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.360
But what was interesting,
by making it a parametric

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.310
equation, we know the
direction of the car.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.430
If you just saw this graph
without the car and everything

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:24.800
else I drew, you wouldn't know
which way the car was falling.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.920
But now we know that as
t is increasing, we're

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.850
going in that direction.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.870
So we can draw
some arrows here.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.600
So because it's a parametric
equation, we can

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.600
draw some arrows.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.590
And then the most important
thing is we know exactly where

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.910
the car is at any time t.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.600
You can substitute t is equal
to 1.25 seconds and you'll know

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.520
exactly where the car is.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.850
So you can plot these points
and you can kind of get a sense

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.250
that as time goes on, we're
getting accelerated downwards.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.950
And that's why, for every
second further, especially

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.070
the y distance gets
further and further apart.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.590
Anyway, I just wanted to
give you this example.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.240
Although this was a good
physics problem, the intention

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.245
wasn't to teach you physics.

00:10:04.245 --> 00:10:07.100
The intention is to give you
the motivation behind why

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.190
parametric equations
even exist.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:13.860
 

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.390
These two things are
parametric equations.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:22.000
We defined x and y as a
function of a third parameter,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.910
t, instead of defining y in
terms of x or x in terms of

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.250
y like we've done every
other time since then.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.240
And this is super useful.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.030
I mean, you could imagine when
you have really hard physics

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.410
problems where you want to
figure out the three

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.630
dimensional position of
something, then you'll have x

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.420
as a function of t, y as a
function of t, z as

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.400
a function of t.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.450
All sorts of interesting
problems come out of using

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.020
parametric equations,
not just in physics.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.980
But anyway, I thought
a good place to start

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:46.720
is the motivation.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.380
Because the first time I
learned parametric equations I

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.500
was like, why mess up my nice
and simple world of x's and

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.630
y's by introducing a
third parameter, t?

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.550
This is why.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.240
Because you can figure
out the path of things.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.760
You can figure out the
direction of something as it

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.120
moves along a curve, and you
can figure out its exact

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.110
position at any, in
this case, time.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.734
