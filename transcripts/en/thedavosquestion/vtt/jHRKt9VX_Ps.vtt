[Background voices]

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.819
&gt;&gt; Hello, YouTube. Ah-this is Achim Steiner.
I head the environment program of the United

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.080
Nations that has its home in Nairobi, Kenya.
I wanted to respond to this question because

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.250
much of what you may be hearing and reading
in the headlines of newspapers and TV reports

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.990
about Davos this year is about economic slowdown,
recession, the worries of the financial markets,

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.330
subprime rates; and some have been wondering
what happened to the discussion about the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.609
state of the planet and issues such as climate
change, global warming, our earth's _____.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.610
I think for 2008 there are great opportunities
to show that as we respond to the challenge

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.340
of global warming we can do so also in the
context of perhaps some of the economic indicators

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.290
now pointing towards a slowdown.
Responding to climate change is about doing

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.660
things more efficiently-about investing in
your markets. It's about creating new jobs.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.820
It's about bringing new technologies in. And
I think we need to speak to our leaders-the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.760
political leaders, the economic leaders-this
year to make sure that we don't fall back

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.370
under the old trap of arguing that doing something
about climate change is a luxury and if the

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.060
times economically become harder we can't
afford to do it. I think the opposite is true

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.970
and it will depend on a lot of you speaking
to your senators, congressmen and appease

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.820
local leaders and mayors because they can
do a lot this year, and in particular with

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.634
a view to reaching a new agreement on climate
change which is what we now have to worry

00:01:21.634 --> 00:01:24.640
about for the future. Bye-bye.
