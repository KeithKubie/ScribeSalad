00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.867
NARRATOR: See this?

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:04.934
This is a samurai, an
elite Japanese warrior.

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:08.934
And this is his sword,
his samurai sword.

00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:10.033
Watch out!

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.567
It's super sharp.

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:14.767
They've been around for
over 1,000 years, as iconic

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:16.934
to Japanese culture
as cherry trees or Mt.

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:18.200
Fuji.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.700
And thanks to, of all things,
a blacksmith, a potter,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.767
and an ancient scroll, you
can still buy a totally 100%

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:29.700
custom-made katana blade today.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.367
Seriously awesome.

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:34.000
So, random question--
how exactly

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.800
is this ancient knowledge of
making iconic Japanese samurai

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.300
swords still around?

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.266
Well, it's a pretty
incredible story

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:43.133
of ancient scrolls, fiery
forges, and the most

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.100
expensive steel on the planet.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.600
Let's take a deeper look at
how the sword and the scroll

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.033
are linked.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:54.967
The Shimane Prefecture in
Japan is wild with plunging

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:57.433
cliffs and volcanic islands.

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:00.200
It's full of sacred Shinto
shrines and waterfalls,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.633
believed to bring victory
to bullfighters and sumo

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:04.367
wrestlers who drink its waters.

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:07.834
And sometimes, its rivers
run red, blood red.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.166
But not with blood.

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.367
That's disgusting.

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:12.066
With iron deposits.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.500
And that's how the blacksmith
made a living in this region.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.000
He smelted that iron
into steel until he

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.033
and his buddy, the potter,
found an ancient scroll.

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:22.567
That taught them how to make--

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:23.467
drum roll please--

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:25.200
[drum roll]

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.133
--samurai swords.

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.900
Total job upgrade.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.500
Nowadays, there are only about
200 traditional swordsmiths

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.834
left in Japan.

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:35.700
Shunji Kobayashi is one of
them, thanks to his grandfather,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.900
the blacksmith.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.867
So why is his
craft disappearing?

00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:41.133
Never mind that society and
warfare have totally changed.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:44.567
Making real swords
is a long process,

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:48.066
and they'll cost you
upwards of $25,000 a pop.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.900
But remember those
iron deposits?

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.867
That iron sand is put into it
tatara, or a clay tub furnace.

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:56.000
This is the only
one left in Japan.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.400
It's heated, mixed with charcoal
to add carbon, and voila!

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.800
Steel.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.567
Tamahagane steel, the most
expensive steel in the world.

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:07.500
And that curved shape comes
from layering two kinds of steel

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.867
and submerging that red
hot, fresh from the forge

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:12.000
sword directly into the water.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.867
Contracting metals
bend inward to form

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:15.967
that lethal, legendary blade.

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:18.266
And when you're holding one,
you're holding a millennium's

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:19.900
worth of trade secrets.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.266
No pressure there, Shunji.

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:25.367
Shunji Kobayashi says it takes
six months just to make one

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:28.333
sword, and it takes five
years of training just

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:30.400
to polish a katana properly.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.967
The whole swordsmithing thing
requires patience and attention

00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:35.767
to detail, much like
the samurai themselves,

00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:40.400
which is why the katana is known
as the soul of the samurai.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.800
But that's not the whole story.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.633

sword and the scroll,
