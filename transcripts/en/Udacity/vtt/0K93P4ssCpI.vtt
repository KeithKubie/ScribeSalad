00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.110
a part of the abstraction process is deciding that for the purposes of,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.990
our, our understanding of the radio here. That, we're not going to

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.530
be concerned with as if there were any states between the two. Now if we were,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.190
went down to the electronic level, there would be some voltage levels and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.650
there would be, you know, transitions going on there.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.070
But that's that's not what we're concerned with here.
