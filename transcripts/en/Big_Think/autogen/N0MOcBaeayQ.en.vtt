got there and one of the things there
are lots of young people in labs there

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740
are lots of young people in labs there
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.849
are lots of young people in labs there
if you talk to many people who are in

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859
if you talk to many people who are in

science you'll find out that they were
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.810
science you'll find out that they were
in the lab from a very young age we had

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820
in the lab from a very young age we had
 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.580

started in the lab at 16 and I though I

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910
started in the lab at 16 and I though I
 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.209
started in the lab at 16 and I though I
was the youngest person one of the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219
was the youngest person one of the
 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.130
was the youngest person one of the
wonderful things was I was treated just

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
wonderful things was I was treated just
 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.310
wonderful things was I was treated just
like anybody else I was expected to do

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320
like anybody else I was expected to do
 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.350
like anybody else I was expected to do
my work and I did it and it was included

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
my work and I did it and it was included
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.990
my work and I did it and it was included
in the discussions and mostly I just

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
in the discussions and mostly I just
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.940
in the discussions and mostly I just
listened which isn't my nature but at

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950
listened which isn't my nature but at
 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.049
listened which isn't my nature but at
that point I was smart enough to know I

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059
that point I was smart enough to know I
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.069
that point I was smart enough to know I
didn't really have much to contribute

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
didn't really have much to contribute
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.200
didn't really have much to contribute
but as I began to have things to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210
but as I began to have things to
 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.770
but as I began to have things to
contribute I was allowed to and it's one

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
contribute I was allowed to and it's one
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.260
contribute I was allowed to and it's one
of the lovely dynamics of even now how

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
of the lovely dynamics of even now how
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.130
of the lovely dynamics of even now how
labs work you know we have young people

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140
labs work you know we have young people
 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.670
labs work you know we have young people
coming right out of college who work is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
coming right out of college who work is
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.070

research assistants for us with us for a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080
research assistants for us with us for a
 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.090
research assistants for us with us for a
couple of years before they go to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
couple of years before they go to
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.620
couple of years before they go to
medical school or grad school and their

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
medical school or grad school and their
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.090
medical school or grad school and their
members in the lab they're expected to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
members in the lab they're expected to
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.469
members in the lab they're expected to
attend lab meeting they're expected to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
attend lab meeting they're expected to
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.260
attend lab meeting they're expected to
read the papers and it's really in many

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
read the papers and it's really in many
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.390
read the papers and it's really in many
ways an apprenticeship and I think it's

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
ways an apprenticeship and I think it's
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.410
ways an apprenticeship and I think it's
not perceived so much by by the outside

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
not perceived so much by by the outside
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.510
not perceived so much by by the outside
world of that sort of apprenticeship

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
world of that sort of apprenticeship
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.880
world of that sort of apprenticeship
mentorship dynamic and we now you know

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
mentorship dynamic and we now you know
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.660
mentorship dynamic and we now you know
there were lots of us sort of you know

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670
there were lots of us sort of you know
 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.030
there were lots of us sort of you know
in various labs at the University who

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
in various labs at the University who
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.560
in various labs at the University who
had just come there one way or the other

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
had just come there one way or the other
 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.810
had just come there one way or the other
I guess because of the holiday lecture

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820
I guess because of the holiday lecture
 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.280
I guess because of the holiday lecture
series you know that must have been a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290
series you know that must have been a
 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.620
series you know that must have been a
way of attracting people as long as it

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
way of attracting people as long as it
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.350
way of attracting people as long as it
existed but there is now a formal

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
existed but there is now a formal
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.270
existed but there is now a formal
program so we have high school students

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280
program so we have high school students
 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.830
program so we have high school students
who come and they spend the summer with

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
who come and they spend the summer with
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.660
who come and they spend the summer with
us and they do a project and they're

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670
us and they do a project and they're
 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.899
us and they do a project and they're
expected to write it up and it's I think

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
expected to write it up and it's I think
 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.090
expected to write it up and it's I think
it's a wonderful introduction because i

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
it's a wonderful introduction because i
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.319
it's a wonderful introduction because i
do think one of the great challenges

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
do think one of the great challenges
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.880
do think one of the great challenges
still is how you teach science in its in

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
still is how you teach science in its in
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.889
still is how you teach science in its in
with its dynamism and you know the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
with its dynamism and you know the
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.069
with its dynamism and you know the
aspects of discovery in a regular

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
aspects of discovery in a regular
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.170
aspects of discovery in a regular
academic environment

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180
academic environment
 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.950
academic environment
I think it's very hard

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960
 
 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.020
