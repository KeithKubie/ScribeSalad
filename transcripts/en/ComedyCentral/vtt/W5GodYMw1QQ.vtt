a toast to Chase

on his big VMA performance

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:07.774
no matter what Burger King
says.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:09.542
- No.
- Where is Chase?

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:12.445
- Oh, uh, he's over there
talking to Michael Che.

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:14.247 line:92%
The grind never stops.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.582
- But Chase isn't the only one
I'm proud of.

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:21.120
To my CareBear, who's gonna be
in a big, fancy Hollywood movie

00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:24.424
with Chase called
"Debra's Missing!"

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:26.259
- Nope. Uh, it's not called
"Debra's Missing."

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.828
It stars Debra Messing,
but thank you.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:32.098
- And Brookey,
little Miss Manager!

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:35.068
To think that six months ago,
I would cry myself to sleep

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.137
so worried about you,
but look at you now!

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.107
- Aw, thanks, Mom.
Always great at toasts.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.209
- Pat, why don't you tell them
your big career news.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:45.411
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
It's nothing.

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:48.081
Tonight is about my kids.
Oh, wait, where's Lance?

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.216 line:92%
I wanted to toast his shoes.

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:53.152
- Oh, um.
He couldn't make it.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:54.854 line:92%
- Aw, that's too bad.

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:56.556 line:92%
- Is everything okay?

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.257
- What?
Oh.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.860
Yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:03.229
- Hi, can I get a card
for the table?

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:04.864
- Oh, you can just put
it under Billy Eichner.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:06.866
- Of course.
- Actually, no.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.403
I'm a proud, single
businesswoman.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.371
You can put it
under Brooke Dubek.

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:13.840
- Of course.
- Actually, no.

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:15.374
- Guys, it's really busy
tonight.

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:17.110 line:92%
- I love this family.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:21.214
And I hope to always
be a part of it.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:24.317
So take this
and put it on my card.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.252 line:92%
- Of course, Mr. Peters.

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:28.554 line:92%

all: Chase.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:39.599
- Hey, buddy.
What's going on?

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:41.868
- I'm glad you're all here
because I've been thinking

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.636 line:92%
and I have a big announcement.

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:46.205
All this singing stuff
has been really cool,

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:47.540 line:92%
but this fall

00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:49.675 line:92%
I'm gonna go

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:52.145 line:92%
to college.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:54.747

Here's an idea.
How about we sleep on it?

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:46.365
And if you still want to go
tomorrow, we can apply then.

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:48.968
- I don't need to apply.
I already got into NYU.

- [clears throat] What?
- Oh, Cary,

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.272

- Yeah, I tweeted at them,

00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:56.676

- Oh.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.679
Well, uh, what about all the

- Hey.
- Did you just, um,

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:27.840
tell my brother, Chase, that
he should go to college?

00:03:27.873 --> 00:03:29.709
- Yeah, I thought that'd
probably be the best thing

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:31.377
for him to do.
- Yeah, well,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.012
as his sister,
I just wanted to say

00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:36.249
I agree because I think
education is important.

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:38.551

you're a real piece of shit.

Where did that come from?
Why?

what it is that
I wanna do with my life

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:49.695

- No, definitely not.

I want him to go to college

to tell anybody, yet.
