1
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.590
Do you believe in aliens?

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.910
I'm assuming they mean extra terrestrial aliens.
Yeah.
I assume you mean that I,

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.260
my opinion on aliens is that I'm sure in this vast unknown world and universe

4
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.420
there is likely to be other life forms that have some level of intelligence.

5
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.410
Interesting.
How sure.
On a scale from one to 10 how sure you are.

6
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.040
Obviously you can't be tagged very
um,

7
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.220
over five but well actually when you take the entire universe yeah.

8
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.380
Which is so massive,
we can barely even comprehend it.

9
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.830
The chances are decent that there is some other,

10
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.850
some how intelligent life form out there and you almost,

11
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.420
I mean you kind of have to ask wait like at this very time,

12
00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:52.600
but then when you think about it there's really no time in a way.

13
00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:56.830
Like that's kind of relative to so in the whole existence would you say what

14
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.340
nine are you level nine?
Sure.
Isn't that nice?
That's matter of opinion.

15
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.720
Don't know.
I think nine I think like 9.0 so you're a believer.

16
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.000
Yeah,
I'm a believer.
I would be vast.
Like if said some wizard guy was like,
okay,

17
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.680
you get to make a bet.
Do you think there is or isn't?
I know the answer.

18
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.810
You do think there is or isn't,

19
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.570
you know the wizard be proof of concept right there.

20
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.660
Unless you're talking to it anyway.
What if he was the guy from the future?
Okay.

21
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:28.720
And somehow figured it out.
I Dunno.
They map the whole universe.
I don't know.

22
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.640
Whatever.
I would bet.
Oh,
the cost is your life too,

23
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:36.990
by the way.
Like you have to make a bed,
you have to make a choice and you,

24
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.710
if you get it right,
you live,
you get it wrong,
you die.
I would would bet.

25
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.390
Yes,
I would bet.
Yes,
I would bet.
Yes.
Yeah.

26
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.900
The thing is is you would also,

27
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:54.730
it'd be interesting to have a scientists or talk to a scientist about the

28
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.710
probability of human life.
Like how credibly

29
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.550
tiny,
tiny,
tiny,
tiny,
minuscule,

30
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:07.150
like all the little things that had to happen for us to end up here and it's

31
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.420
okay for them to have them again.
Oh yeah.
It happened again.
So,
but then again,

32
00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:13.890
you,
you,
you compare that to the unknown world,

33
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.720
this universe that is so large,
it's been comprehensible.

34
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.650
The chances are it's happened somewhere else.
And even,
and just,

35
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.260
and that's in a way,
a different point where it's like,
you know,

36
00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:27.400
what would it take to,
to make humans and wind up being humans?

37
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.570
If you look at it backwards,
it seems really like,

38
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.770
oh my gosh,
this is this crazy like,
you know,

39
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.890
almost impossible.
Yeah.
Miracle kind of thing.
But you,

40
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.690
you can say that with everyday thing if you look at it backwards.

41
00:02:46.691 --> 00:02:50.740
So like let's say I had,
um,
like the Lego's,
right?
Okay.

42
00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:53.370
We had this big bucket of Legos.
It was more the,
you know,

43
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.150
it's one of those big plastic tubs full of years and years and years of Lego

44
00:02:58.151 --> 00:02:59.740
sets.
And there's all in there.

45
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.970
If I were to take that to full legos and fucking

46
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.770
tore it out on the ground on a marble surface.

47
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:12.610
So they scatter everywhere and then it'll,
you know,
when they all settle,

48
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.410
it'll be a little pattern,
right?
Legos,
various colors,
shapes,

49
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:21.010
sizes,
all kinds,
different places,
spaces.

50
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.160
And to take that exact pattern down to the nanometre,

51
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.310
that exact pattern and be like,

52
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.340
this is the most special pattern in the entire world ever in existence.

53
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.840
This one is,
there is no way anyone ever,
ever,

54
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:44.860
ever could recreate this exact pattern down to the nano meter.
It's impossible.

55
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.140
That's why this pattern is so special,

56
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.000
but it's just one of many potential eventualities,
probably infinite.

57
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.850
You know,
and when you end up at something and then say,
okay,

58
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:58.780
that what we happen to end up as is special it,

59
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.710
that's looking at it backwards.
Like I said,
so it's like the lottery winner.

60
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.090
You know the guy who wins the lottery,
you,
it's like,
oh my gosh,
I'm so special.

61
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:10.530
I want to let know freaking if I took a ping pong ball and I saw in,

62
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.710
I had a mosh pit of 1 million people.
If one ping pong ball,

63
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:18.490
I throw it in the mosh pit and then somebody catches it.
Oh my gosh,

64
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.590
I'm so special.
Breast,
someone's gonna get it.

65
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.790
Someone's going to get the ping pong ball.
That's affirmative.
Yeah.

66
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.600
So it doesn't make it necessarily special unless you look at it backwards.

67
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.180
You know,
if that guy's like,
I'm going to go into another one.

68
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.340
The other alien life form could be something that we could barely even imagine

69
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.510
of what it's like.
And that's that.
That probability wise is what it is.

70
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.220
Or it's going to be something like so small and but it,

71
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.360
if it's like more a superior intelligence,

72
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.160
it's going to be something we don't recognize the same way.

73
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:53.161
Like if you have a caterpillar on a leaf and I see it from 10 yards away,

74
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.390
oh,
I see that little cow caterpillar rate right there.

75
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.100
Hey Caterpillar yelling at it.
You know,

76
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.850
the vibration from my voice are hitting it.
It got up into the capitol.

77
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.970
The capitol has no idea that you even exist.
I don't even know what a human is.

78
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:07.690
Doesn't know about your problems,
doesn't know about your podcast,
you know.

79
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.320
Meanwhile,
you know a lot about your podcasts.
You know,
listen to the podcast.

80
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.670
I can say with a fair amount of,
and again,
I don't know,
maybe he does.

81
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.570
I don't know.
He has big butterfly plans for the future.

82
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.670
Jocko.
Next question.
Next question.

83
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.080
How can I incur bro?
We can talk more about the aliens,

84
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.940
aliens or Legos.

85
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:34.810
I'm telling you they go patterns cause you know when people see you at foes,

86
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:38.410
they go straight to that's an alien.
Even though it's an unidentified,

87
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.340
you can't do that.
Remember I was telling you that kid's book ideas.
Yeah,
you did.

88
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:45.340
Tell me about that.
Tell me again.
Either it goes deeper than that telling you.

89
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.770
Telling me
actually,

90
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:52.771
it's more about the flaws of all people consider or regarding liens potentially.
