00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.180
Okay, let's see if I remember how to do this, let me go to Attendee, New

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.085
Field, Formula, Total

00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:15.020
Spent, Return type;

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.540
currency probably makes sense. &gt;Yep, yep. Alright so we want to add our formula

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.360
and I'm trying to figure how to do this, like, you know, 50 times

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.000
ticket sold,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.482
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:29.090
&gt;&gt; Or 100 times ticket sold, but it depends on the ticket type.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so before this we've been dealing with pretty simple formulas

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.190
where it's just addition or multiplication. But in this case we're adding

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.810
a little bit of conditional logic, where we're trying to figure out

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.100
if it's one value, do this, if it's another value, do this.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.821
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:45.370
&gt;&gt; So, let's go to the advanced formula tab,

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.830
and then look at some of the functions we

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.200
have available to deal with that kind of stuff.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.635
On the right hand side, we have all the different

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:52.370
functions you have available. If you click on that little

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.260
pick list, you can even change it to functions on

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.270
specific things. In this case it'll be a logical function

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.630
we want. Because we're logically trying to figure out if

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.230
one thing or if the other. So, immediately it's like

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.550
if statement makes sense, right? But if you didn't know

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.280
what you needed, you could Google it or go to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.450
the forums. All that's totally fine way to find it.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.850
&gt;&gt; Okay, what does this part mean? The

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.670
if logical test value if true, value if false.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.680
So that's a little sample of the syntax of how to use the if statement, and what

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.160
the logical test means is you provided some

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.500
sort of function that will be true or false.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.760
&gt;&gt; Like ticket type equals VIP.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.360
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.940
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.250
&gt;&gt; And so, if ticket type is VIP, it'll.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.290
&gt;&gt; Do this first thing.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.010
&gt;&gt; Do the first thing, which is

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.690
&gt;&gt; Like 100 times the number sold.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.670
&gt;&gt; Ticket. Number sold. And then, if it isn't VIP,

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.860
then it'll do the second parameter.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.850
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, 50 times tickets sold.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.560
&gt;&gt; Yes, so that would be the general mission.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.220
&gt;&gt; So, that's what I do.
