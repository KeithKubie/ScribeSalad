Okay, so we got four points on a graph, let's fill in a few more and see if a shape starts to emerge.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I want to know when X=1/2 Xmax, so that would correspond to this position right here

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or this position here on the graph and the mass is moving to the right,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
what is V/Vmax.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now you maybe thinking but Andy, you haven't given me k, you haven't given me Xmax.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
How can I calculate anything? Well, you have two options--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You could make up those values and I promise you when you calculate this out

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
it won't matter what values you chose or you can just manipulate these algebraic symbols

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
until you solve for V/Vmax.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That could be a little trickier--you've either option to shot.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I know they are both tough. If you need help, don't be discouraged.

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
These are tricky topics we're dealing with. Feel free to go to the forums.
