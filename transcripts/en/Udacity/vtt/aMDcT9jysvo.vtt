00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.980
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Speaking of fractions, here's another equation, with yet another fraction

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.006
involved. We've just been talking about how many different ways there are to

00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:12.240
start problems, especially those involving fractions. So for this problem in

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.465
particular, if we'd like to solve for z, what do you think our first step should

00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:20.566
be? Should we start off by simplifying the fraction? Should we multiply both

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:24.670
sides by z? Should we multiply both sides by 3? Or should we multiply both sides

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.285
by 3z plus 6?
