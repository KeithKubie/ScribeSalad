thnkx enabled the next question is from
Bobby term fats question is on content

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
Bobby term fats question is on content
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.710
Bobby term fats question is on content
providers is it possible to build a file

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
providers is it possible to build a file
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.649
providers is it possible to build a file
content provider to access and ftp

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
content provider to access and ftp
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.679
content provider to access and ftp
server okay so content providers are

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689
server okay so content providers are
 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.190
server okay so content providers are
basically a mechanism for multiple apps

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
basically a mechanism for multiple apps
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.300
basically a mechanism for multiple apps
on the same device to share data and

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310
on the same device to share data and
 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.190
on the same device to share data and
theoretically the answer is yes you can

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
theoretically the answer is yes you can
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.370
theoretically the answer is yes you can
use a content provider to in interfaces

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
use a content provider to in interfaces
 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.449
use a content provider to in interfaces
to build a wrapper on top of accessing

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
to build a wrapper on top of accessing
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.410
to build a wrapper on top of accessing
ftp so

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420
ftp so
 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.080
ftp so
on the grout now the concept of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090
on the grout now the concept of
 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.430
on the grout now the concept of
accessing ftp a using FTP protocol is

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440
accessing ftp a using FTP protocol is
 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.050
accessing ftp a using FTP protocol is
very different from the way the content

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060
very different from the way the content
 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.240
very different from the way the content
provider interfaces are filled so you'll

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250
provider interfaces are filled so you'll
 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.170
provider interfaces are filled so you'll
have to think and design in a way where

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180
have to think and design in a way where
 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.970
have to think and design in a way where
the sequel kind of interfaces like

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980
the sequel kind of interfaces like
 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.910
the sequel kind of interfaces like
insert query delete and update are

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920
insert query delete and update are
 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.870
insert query delete and update are
translated to relevant queries or

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880
translated to relevant queries or
 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.180
translated to relevant queries or
commands in the 50 protocol and it will

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190
commands in the 50 protocol and it will
 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.550
commands in the 50 protocol and it will
be interesting if limitation to look at

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560
be interesting if limitation to look at
 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.610
be interesting if limitation to look at
but yeah the answer is yes you can do it

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620
but yeah the answer is yes you can do it
 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.740
but yeah the answer is yes you can do it
but you have to think about how you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750
but you have to think about how you
 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.100
but you have to think about how you
translate sequel life and I'm to active

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110
translate sequel life and I'm to active
 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.500
translate sequel life and I'm to active
easy for the corner you can be

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510
easy for the corner you can be
 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.600
easy for the corner you can be
interesting to see how what use case I

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610
interesting to see how what use case I
 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.890
interesting to see how what use case I
was going to say the same thing I'd be

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900
was going to say the same thing I'd be
 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.750
was going to say the same thing I'd be
really interesting to hear what what's

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760
really interesting to hear what what's
 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.070
really interesting to hear what what's
one really wants to do this know why

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080
one really wants to do this know why
 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.190
one really wants to do this know why
they want to create this case that by an

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200
they want to create this case that by an
 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.800
they want to create this case that by an
episode yeah don't drop us a comment in

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120
question is um I have a list of shaked
 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.900
question is um I have a list of shaked
robots that I am adding to a view and

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910
robots that I am adding to a view and
 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.509
robots that I am adding to a view and
after each addition I am calling

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519
after each addition I am calling
 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.050
after each addition I am calling
invalidate on the view I thought that

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060

fresh canvas at each other oh ok the
 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.599
fresh canvas at each other oh ok the
Christian here is that I think it is

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609
Christian here is that I think it is
 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.539
Christian here is that I think it is
important to understand that there's no

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549
important to understand that there's no
 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.220
important to understand that there's no
guarantee that ah yes there is no

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230
guarantee that ah yes there is no
 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.340
guarantee that ah yes there is no
guarantee on when we are calling on the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350
guarantee on when we are calling on the
 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.120
guarantee on when we are calling on the
road from the platform and so the you

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130
road from the platform and so the you
 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.240
road from the platform and so the you
can invalidate the view anytime but

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250
can invalidate the view anytime but
 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.539
can invalidate the view anytime but
there is no guarantee as to when I'm

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549
there is no guarantee as to when I'm
 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.229
there is no guarantee as to when I'm

you can expect that on the record will

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510
you can expect that on the record will
 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.099
you can expect that on the record will
happen every time before actual visual

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109
happen every time before actual visual

or don't already have and so the another
question where we under give me a fresh

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640
question where we under give me a fresh
 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.330
question where we under give me a fresh
canvas at each 10 that's true yeah so

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340
canvas at each 10 that's true yeah so
 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.250
canvas at each 10 that's true yeah so
the kind of object itself may be

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260
the kind of object itself may be
 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.010
the kind of object itself may be
recycled yeah but the canvas itself will

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020
recycled yeah but the canvas itself will
 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.410
recycled yeah but the canvas itself will

handle this within threats so you're

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830
handle this within threats so you're
 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.550
handle this within threats so you're
absolutely right that an activity can be

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560
absolutely right that an activity can be
 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.950
absolutely right that an activity can be
used as a context but you can't

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960
used as a context but you can't
 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.960
used as a context but you can't
guarantee that that activity is always

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970
guarantee that that activity is always
 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.810
guarantee that that activity is always
going to be around for the entire

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820
going to be around for the entire
 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.230
going to be around for the entire
duration of your your apps lifecycle

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240
duration of your your apps lifecycle
 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.650
duration of your your apps lifecycle
especially if you have multiple

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660
especially if you have multiple
 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.510
especially if you have multiple
activities so what you should be doing

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520
activities so what you should be doing
 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.850
activities so what you should be doing
in this situation is for context you

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860
in this situation is for context you
 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.720
in this situation is for context you
should actually be getting the

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730
should actually be getting the
 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.390
should actually be getting the
application context and not passing

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400
application context and not passing
 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.700
application context and not passing
around the activity as your context so

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710
around the activity as your context so
 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.710
around the activity as your context so
it's a simple call to get application

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720
it's a simple call to get application
 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.880
it's a simple call to get application
context on the activity itself or you

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890
context on the activity itself or you
 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.350
context on the activity itself or you
know it's available on a number of

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360
know it's available on a number of
 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.740
know it's available on a number of
classes and from there you can pass that

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750
classes and from there you can pass that
 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.190
classes and from there you can pass that
around and use it how you wish so then

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200
around and use it how you wish so then
 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.830
around and use it how you wish so then
option you can look at this maybe you if

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840
option you can look at this maybe you if
 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.540
option you can look at this maybe you if
you really want to pass it and there's

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550
you really want to pass it and there's
 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.010
you really want to pass it and there's
no other option you can pass a week

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020
no other option you can pass a week
 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.500
no other option you can pass a week
reference of the activity context so

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510
reference of the activity context so
 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.550
reference of the activity context so
even if activity is killed so your dick

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560
even if activity is killed so your dick
 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.650
even if activity is killed so your dick
reference will be there is no memory

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660
reference will be there is no memory
 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.560
reference will be there is no memory
leak right right and your preference

pattern i've seen is by using the

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260
pattern i've seen is by using the
 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.320
pattern i've seen is by using the

your code and that's basically my

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650
your code and that's basically my
 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.800
your code and that's basically my
limitation of your application and you

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810
limitation of your application and you
 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.720
limitation of your application and you
can put a matter then get context as a

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:51.730
can put a matter then get context as a
 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.670
can put a matter then get context as a
static so you can always say application

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680
static so you can always say application
 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.020

don't get context which will give you

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030
don't get context which will give you
 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.580
don't get context which will give you
your application context so that's

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590
your application context so that's
 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.900
your application context so that's
that's another way of obtaining the

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910
that's another way of obtaining the
 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.580
that's another way of obtaining the
application context anywhere even if

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590
application context anywhere even if
 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:05.280

your activity context it is okay so um i

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.290
your activity context it is okay so um i
 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.750

would take a little questions so the

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:09.760
would take a little questions so the
 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.550
would take a little questions so the
next question is also coming from

no there is no programmatic way to do it
 

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.120
no there is no programmatic way to do it
so it's a short answer it can't be done

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.130
so it's a short answer it can't be done
