00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.060
You're sitting on a plane trying to relax when a terrible thought crosses your mind:

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.560
What would happen if that airplane door opened?

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.300
Commercial airplanes pressurize their cabins to match the atmospheric pressure of 8,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.460
even though the cruising altitude of the plane you're in is 30,000 to 45,000 feet in the air.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.060
As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.020
This is due to Earth's gravitational pull on the air molecules in the atmosphere.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.100
The closer to the Earth's surface the stronger the force exerted on these molecules.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.180
If the door were opened the plane would depressurize in less than 0.5 seconds.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.160
Unless your seat belt is fastened you and any loose objects would immediately be ejected

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.660
due to the difference in pressure.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.600
During such a scenario survival rates are very slim given the possibility of the entire plane breaking apart.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.820
Because the air is substantially thinner at high altitudes there is substantially less oxygen.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.660
A gradual decompression in the cabin will cause the oxygen mask to drop from above

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.760
and on average you have 18 seconds to put the mask on before hypoxia kicks in.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.800
Hypoxia occurs when oxygen levels decrease, causing symptoms of nausea, dizziness and unconsciousness

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.960
leading to death.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.360
The oxygen reserves on the plane would last for only 10 minutes.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.080
Enough for the pilot to descend rapidly to 8,000 to 10,000 feet

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.780
to match both the internal and external pressures and give you hope for survival.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.840
Freaked out yet?

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.600
Don't worry, the chances of the door opening are so small

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.840
because there's eight to ten pounds of pressure exerted on every square inch of the plane.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.820
Remember there's more pressure inside the cabin than outside.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.480
Using the largest commercial airplane the Airbus A380 as an example,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.020
the main door measures 4288 square inches,

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.920
meaning a 38,592 pounds of force would be required to even begin to open it.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.540
To compare this would be equivalent of you trying to move 3 African bush elephants -

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.760
the largest land mammals on earth.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.820
Additionally, plane doors are almost always electronically locked by the pilot

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.720
through functions accessible only from inside the cockpit.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.360
And to ease your worries more:

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.660
It would also be nearly impossible for someone to punch and break through an airplane window.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.460
These windows can also be made with up to six layers of various types of strong polymers and are bulletproof.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.860
Furthermore, these windows are almost always rounded to decrease drag while in flight,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.160
thereby preventing cracks and decompression.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.900
You're more likely to die in a car than during aviation with a 1/114 chance of car accidents

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.600
compared to 1/9821 for air travel related accidents.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.780
So fasten your seat belts, pay attention to your safety videos, and above all enjoy the flight.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.320
Thank you so much for watching! Make sure you subscribe,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.740
because we make new science videos every Thursday.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.180
And click the bell because apparently it does something.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.700
If you want to watch more right now, we'll link a couple videos over here that you can check out

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.520
to satisfy your science needs,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.920
Otherwise we'll see you next Thursday for a new video.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.280
Peace!
