00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.340
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Hello.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.070
My name is Stephen Winick, and I'm
here at the Library of Congress

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.370
with the band BeauSoleil,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.220
or the BeauSoleil Quartet,
as they're called today.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.330
And I'm interviewing them for
the American Folklife Center here

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.990
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.730
So, I'm going to sort of
address some general questions

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.530
to all of you.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.760
In particular, a question about
what the Cajun music scene was

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.480
like when you were growing up.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.630
So to sort of set the scene
for how Cajun music has changed

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.620
over the last 30 years or 40 years.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.920
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Keep going.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.810
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Fifty years.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Well, I
don't think it was ever a scene.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.000
You know, the music was created for
the community, just for the people

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.860
in Southwest Louisiana, as a way
of communicating news, and I mean,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.130
it's very, Louisiana,
it's a beautiful state,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.890
but it's very hard,
and you work hard.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.360
But you play hard too.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.050
So the music was very
much a part of that.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.230
My father had five sisters, and
you know, two of them sang ballads.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.970
And then we would have
these parties, you know,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.600
family get togethers where
there was a meal or whatever

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.730
where everybody would show up and
everybody would play something.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.690
It didn't matter what,
whether it was a violin

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.580
or a trumpet or piano, whatever.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.880
And I think everybody
just really liked the fact

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.880
that it was still sung in French.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.670
The old people liked it because
it was called old people's music.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.190
We never called this
Cajun music growing up.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.450
And, it was French music, or la
musique Francaise [phonetic].

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.690
And it was just something,
you know, me personally,

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.800
just kind of took for granted.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.780 position:56%
It was like, you know, somebody said

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.370
when did you learn
your first Cajun song?

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.010
I said, when did you learn your
first Christmas song, you know.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.040
It was kind of the same thing.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.900
But everybody did it, and I'm
talking about the 50s now, 1950s.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.390
And there was 22 civil
parishes in Southwest Louisiana,

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.960
it's like a triangle,
that speak French.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.400
And all those different
parishes had different songs

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.000
and different people.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.930
A lot had been forgotten because
the original recordings, you know,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.010
with the RCA victor coming in,
they wanted to sell Victrolas,

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.870
so they were recorded
for commercial use.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.760
That was from like '28 to '36.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.780
And then World War II happened.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.150
A lot of people, you know, realized
what they had when they went away.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.550
Because we were so, it was
different, like no other place,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.890
obviously, speaking French.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.540
And so I think there was a
resurgence, always a resurgence

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.050
that happened then
in the 50s, the 60s,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.300
and then of course,
it was television.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.180
And when we had our first
local station in Lafayette.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.480
It was KLFY TV.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.210
And every Sunday morning they
had [inaudible], which was a show

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.860
that Aldus Roger played on.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.690
It was like this big band.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.090
I mean we used to hear
like an accordion

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.520
and fiddle player or somebody.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.620
There was like twin fiddlers, steel
guitar, electric guitar, drums,

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.920
you know, bass and the whole bit.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.510
So that was like another
resurgence I think.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.480
But I think music has
always been in our culture.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.590
So that wasn't, you know, that
was something that was just there.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.360
What happened sort of in the
30s, people were punished

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.250
for speaking French
on the school grounds.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.620
So either they left school.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.950
You know that joke, right.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.220
You know, when they went to
math class they said say one.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.260
One. They say, say
two, they said bye.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.920
So, but it like happened,
it's not really a joke.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.220
It happened.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.520
But a lot of people preserved it.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.210
And in Southwest Louisiana
growing up,

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.340
a lot of people didn't
speak English in the pier

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.630
because they didn't have to.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.500
And so that was that.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:08.780
Now, what happened to us, for me,
is that when someone died that was,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.880 position:56%
you know, a proponent of this music,
you know, not only did you grieve

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.130
for the death, physically death,
but whatever history they had

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.710
because our history was basic oral.

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.510
With the music too, but our
history of our culture too.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.710
So for us, I mean, it's like
we didn't want to see that.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.640
So we decided, well we have
to do something about it.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.230
How do you do something about it?

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.900
You learn the music.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.200
And just like that.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.530
I mean it's not for no
reward or no end result,

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.850
the thing was just
it needed to be done.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.150
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
So you got a sense

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.470
that the older generation
was passing away

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.400
and you decided it was
time to [inaudible] yeah.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Because nobody
was looking at it as it should be,

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.890
as we thought it should be, because
it's not just two-step and waltzes.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.240
I mean there's a lot of
information in there.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.060
There's a lot of cultural
information.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.360
And we thought we were isolated.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.940
We though nobody in the
world knew about this stuff.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.840
And that started to change
a lot in the 60s too,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.980
when some groups went
to Newport, etcetera.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.180
It happened to us when we
were invited to go to France.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.990
But anyway, I don't want to
be long-winded about this.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.050
But it was something that I
just want to say that the people

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.740
who held the music did
it because they had to.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.040
I mean, it was just a passion.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.900
It was a remarkable passion,
not because of any kind

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.860
of reward except the fact
that they knew these songs.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.230
And people, like fiddle
players, like [inaudible].

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.590
I mean he would sing song
about kings and queens,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.180
and we knew he never
knew any kings or queens

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.480
or even knew what that was.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.130
But the fact the music keeps
on going, regenerating.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.530
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So you mention
that early period when, you know,

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.230
in the 20s and 30s when there
were commercial music made

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.530
of Cajun music.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.980
Were those still influential on
people when you were growing up?

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.500
I mean, were they still
listening to those records, or?

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Well, you
don't have those machines, 78s.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.110
What happened, a lot
of, this is one example.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.250
This is like, I mentioned
Amede Ardoin,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.480
who was the first creole really
accordion player and real prolific.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.640
And we play about 80% of his songs.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.570
I mean Cajun repertoire,
well creole repertoire now.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.670
There was a blind, almost
blind Cajun guy, white guy,

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.750
who learned all his songs.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.610
And most people thought, this
guy has really earned his name,

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.910
came up with all these songs.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.560
And nobody could reference
back to the 78s.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:30.220
The first time I really listened
to a 78 was on a 33 1/3 LP

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.590
from Chris Strachwitz,
Arhoolie Records.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.700
We did this, a five series
that we just went crazy.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.910
Because we thought, oh
this is a long time ago.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.300
It's ancient history.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.520
And then when I first met Dennis,
the first time I met Dennis,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.190
I said I thought you were dead.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.830
He said not yet.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.610
So that's a big jump too.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.040
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And I mean, you
also mentioned that sort of moment

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.180
in the 60s when groups started
going to places like Newport.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet:
But they were not,

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.210
I mean at home they
didn't believe it.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: You know,
it wasn't like they were going

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.110
to make a living about
this, you know.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.860
It was just, it was regular people.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.210
You know, people, nobody
really made a living at this.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.310
I mean you played Saturday
nights or whatever.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.470
I mean we had a lot of people
came from there like Vin Bruce

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.860
and Jimmy C. Newman
who went to Nashville.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.200
Doug and Rusty Kershaw, etcetera.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.500
But you had to get out.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.800
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right, right.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.100
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Of Louisiana.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.400
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.430 position:56%
Well tell me about some of the guys
that you sought out and worked with.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.670
You know, start with Dennis
since you already mentioned him.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Well
Dennis, like I said,

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.270
I first met him I thought
the was dead.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.570
You know, it was a joke.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.870
And he says, no.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.810
So I went to study with
him where I had a grant

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.180
for the National Endowment.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.990
And with his brother-in-law
Sidney Corville [phonetic].

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.880
Because, to me, that was the
oldest form of Cajun music,

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.200
what we call French music.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.670
And it was so, the
twin fiddles styles.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:54.550
Which was not popular and
not played by anybody else.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.760
This recorded in the
20s, or late 20s and 30s,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.060
so this style was not there.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.960
A lot of modern musicians
would always say,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.370
why are you wasting your
time learning that music.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.670
I said, are you kidding?

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.970
This is the essence.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.800
But it wasn't the popular country
and westernized Cajun music.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.210
It was dance hall at that time.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.710
I was very much interested
in the blues in this music,

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.800
and there was two bluesy
creole musicians.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.060
One was Canray Fontenot, and
the other was Bebe Carriere.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.960
Because they had a certain
style that you didn't,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.340 position:56%
there was always blues in our music.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.600
I was always interested,
where did this come from?

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.900
You know, in Louisiana.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.750
Because Louisiana blues
is different.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:38.170 position:56%
I mean there are 12 bar, 16 bar, you
know from the Delta in Louisiana.

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:41.780
But these Cajun French
blues is a little different.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.990 position:56%
And I guess the, and of course, the
Balfa brothers, both Will and Dewey,

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.890
you know, they were very influent,

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.400
because that totally,
we love their music.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.760
Because there was acoustic,
when it was away from Louisiana,

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.200
[inaudible] Louisiana
it was electric.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.500
But nevertheless.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.110
And another man that I found,
he name was Varise Conner.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.630
And I said Conner, what is that?

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:02.930
It's Britain.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.720
He says oh no, my grandfather
was an O'Conner.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.050
So, O'Conner.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.900
And he played a certain style
very lilting fiddle style

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.950
that he had never played
with an accordion.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.200
So it was kind of, you know,
because when you play a fiddle

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.390
and accordion, people like
Hector Duhon, he was another guy.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.690
And he played a certain sickening
style that was pretty amazing.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.920
But he, the accordion that was the
main instrument because it was loud

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.590
and etcetera and a lot
of things like that.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.460
So those are the people basically.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So Mitch,
why don't you mention Dewey,

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.050
because I know you
worked with Dewey as well.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.240
So what was that like?

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.600
How did you meet him, and how
did you start to play with him?

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.860
&gt;&gt; Mitchell Reed: I used
to go to Marc Savoy's Jam

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.900
when I was learning,
when I was a kid.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.160 position:56%
And I played string bass over there,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.310
and one time when Mac Savoy was
like, hey Mitchell, come over here.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.800
Dewey's on the phone.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.100
I was like what?

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.400
Dewey Balfa?

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.700
Yes. He needs a bass player.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.390
His bass player got in a
wreck the night before.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.690
&gt;&gt; That's terrible.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:06.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mitchell Reed: And I had a gig
at the Liberty just all of a sudden.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.150
And so Marc hands me
the phone, he was like,

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.040
alright, do you know Cajun music?

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.340
I said yeah.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.970
He said you know the chords?

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.270
I said yeah.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.810 position:56%
He said okay, don't mess up tonight.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.610
I'm going to trust you.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:24.730
So I got to the Liberty, and my
family's all from Mamou, and Dewey,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.660
the Balfas are all from Mamou.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.660
And so when he found
out who my family was,

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.590
then I became part of
the family, you know.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:34.890
And it was awesome.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:40.250
And then we came here in '98
and played for two weeks.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.880
And it was like Jamie Berzas.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.270
There was a guy, Dudley
Abair [phonetic] maybe,

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.970
I think, that played guitar.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.120
But we played with
the Lawtell Playboys.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.490
And Dewey was awesome.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.250
I never took fiddle lessons
because my hero was Dennis McGee,

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.270
and I never could really pick up
the way Dewey wanted me to play.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.110
He was a really strict teacher
like when he'd teach you,

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.870
you have to learn the chords first.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.740
And it was that Balfa style.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.690
And I was learning more
the melodies from Dennis.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.250
So he'd get fed up and
say okay, go practice.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.510
So I was mainly his bass player.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:23.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well you
had talked about the difference

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.360
between Cajun fiddle and
other regional fiddle styles.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.110
I mean it's quite different.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:30.410
And I think people can hear it

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:34.210
but maybe not understand
what they're hearing.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mitchell Reed: Yeah, it's a lot
of different styles, like Mike said,

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.260
creole like you have
Canray and Bois Sec.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.940
And they played creole
and the Cartier family.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.140
They played the same tunes that
the white players were playing,

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.590
but it just had that, it had that
kind of different groove to it.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.960
And I always like creole.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.260
That was kind of my thing.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.820
And to me, Dennis McGee, although
he was a white, Irish guy,

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.760
he played more of that creole style

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.660
because he'd play with
Amede, you know.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.960
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.910
Well, I mean, just the purposes of
people who might be watching this,

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.380
of course, we use that word creole,

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.540
and it means so many
different things.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Yes.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.420
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So in this
context, explain what we're talking

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.720
about when we say creole.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.020
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Well Creole is

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.800
like rural French-speaking
people of color.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.830
I mean that's the easiest
way to do it.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:28.390
And, because there were a
lot of free people of color,

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.710
even though they were black,
in Southwest Louisiana.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.010
And they were side-by-side

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.750
with whoever was there,
but mostly French.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.300
Not only Cajun, but
they were French too.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.800
But they learned, there
was American songs.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.660
I mean, there was a lot of, you
know, in the Library of Congress

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.730
when Alan Lomax went down,
and he recorded Wayne Perry.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.770
Anyplace like [inaudible] hen.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.070
What other songs?

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.370
And Sittin' on Top of the World.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.850
But it doesn't sound
like that at all.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.720
So it's, you know, wherever it
comes from, whether it's Appalachia

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.670
or whatever, the music is a
reflection of the landscape.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:05.400
And Louisiana, it's
definitely, it's muggy, it's hot,

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.300
it's muddy and the pace is slower.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.560
So I think that adds to it.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah,
I think I hear more drones

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.990
in the fiddle playing than I
do in most of the other styles.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Yeah,
and that's the early style.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.000
They said they played in
Nova Scotia or [inaudible],

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.920
but also there was a Frenchman, I
believe his name was C. C. Robin,

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.730
you know, Robin, who came
through and mentioned

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.620
that he heard these twin
fiddles in Louisiana.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.920
He said it sounded like
something you'd hear in France.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.620
This is pre-accordion.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.960
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.290
Well the scene changed a
lot in the 70s and 80s.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.240
I mean Cajun music went through
a sort of acts of development,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.600
and people outside Cajun country
came to even know that there was

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.200
such a thing as Cajun music.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.760
How did that affect people who
were playing it in Louisiana?

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.670
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: That's
a good question.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.970
I don't know.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.980
There's a lot more people
got interested in it.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:03.340
See I always remember, Mike was
talking that in 1968 they started,

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.520
that's when I first
took French in school.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.570
I was in fifth grade.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.700
And there was an organization
called CODOFIL,

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.640
the Council for the Development
of French in Louisiana.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.390
So they had these signs everywhere.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:16.730
You know, speak French.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.030
It's your heritage.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.330
Everywhere.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.630
It was all in French.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:21.930
And apparently, the
culture was going,

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.230
you know, I was too young to know.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:30.630
But when I was in high school and
Mike started BeauSoleil and Coteau.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.930
I got interested.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:35.350
He called me up one day and said
come, let's go record a record.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.440
I'd never really played.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.470
I was learning guitar, you know.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.800
I was into folk music,
acoustic, all that.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.400
But I know that we did that, and
people looked at us like weird.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.700
They thought we were all Canadians.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.000
I swear to God.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.700
They still think we're Canadians.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.000
&gt;&gt; You're young, you
play this music.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.870
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: It got, you
know, in the 90s, 80s and 90s,

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.510
we played and played and played.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.460
And I think that younger people
got interested in playing music.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.760
They thought it was neat.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.060
I don't know if they speak it.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.360
We're losing the language.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.660
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.960
&gt;&gt; But I think that was part of it.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.140
And also, what I've discovered now
is that people that had heard us

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.300
and the older people play that
live elsewhere, outside Louisiana,

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.890
they're all retired now, and
they want to learn how to play.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.050
So there's a lot of
interest in these camps

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.350
where you go and you learn.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.240
And they come to Louisiana, they
retire there, and they dance.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.540
And some of them try to tell you
what you're doing isn't right

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.840
and all that.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.140
But that's beside the point.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.940
They have a better way.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.680
But that's, I think that's
the popularity of it.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.830
The kids, at home, there's, you
know, you go to the festival

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.110
at Cayenne at Lafayette, and
there's all these people,

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.210
they play, and their good.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.360
They don't sing very
well, I don't think.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.660
But they play.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.960
It used to be just accordions.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.080 position:56%
Because apparently an accordion is a
little easier to play than a violin.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.920
Now it's all violins and
fewer accordion players.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.860
It's really interesting
how it does that.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.440
So, you know.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.950
&gt;&gt; So I don't think, you're
not going to lose the music.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.250
But I don't hear any
of them singing.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.550
They all can play.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.850
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
That's interesting.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.710
So is the language going as well?

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:07.010
I mean.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:11.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Well as
I say, in the 1970 census,

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.810
they said there were a
million French-speaking people

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.450
in Southwest Louisiana.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.440
That may be an exaggeration.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.650
In year 2000, there were less
100,000 French-speaking people.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.470
So that says it right there.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.520
But it goes through like
different windfalls.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.820
I mean you got to, like I said,

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.510
on the first television
station, there was French there.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.380
They had an announcer by the
name of Jim Olivia [phonetic],

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.030
who got up every morning
at what 5:30?

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.330
&gt;&gt; 5:00 in the morning.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet:
And he had groups on.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:37.930
Yeah, French royalty.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.230
He had groups on.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.530
It was all in French.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:43.080
And so it was there because
that was the main population.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.210
And then, you know,
Louisiana, because it's been,

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.840
basically it's basically
agriculture.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.700
And then when they found oil, then
you have the influence of a lot

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.770
of other people, which
changed the music, etcetera.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:00.010
And the transition happened
in the 60s basically.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.360
I think that the early 60s
you started seeing that.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.340
For us, we were like, it
was the young people born

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.500
in the 50s who can remember it.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.410
And then we kind of got
together, it was about 12 of us.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:14.380
It when it was like, you know,
Barry Ancelet, because he went

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.380
on to become a professor
and a folklorist.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.670
I mean, there were so many
people, some French people

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.960
who were there that helped us out.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.790
The [Inaudible] used to
write in French and English.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.090
And this was young people.

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:29.280
And when we were, when
we were young.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.190 position:56%
But that influenced that in a group,
like Dave mentioned, like Coteau

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:35.200
and BeauSoleil, we weren't
a first young people.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.270 position:56%
I can't even remember people my age.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:42.640
I mean I think, oh what's his
name from Kaplan, you know,

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.950
Jessie Lashay [phonetic], he
and I are about the same age.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.820
And that's about the
only person my age.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.300
So it was fully, so you'd
have to go through Marc

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.760
because he was an accordion
player and maker, and Marc Savoy.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.080
And he was, he's 11
years older than I am.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.840
So he was really at that
point where he saw more

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.960
of the French than we did.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.220
And Marc and I obviously
played together for,

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.700
still play together basically.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.140
But it was people like
that who had this vision.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.260
And so we always strived
to do it right.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.780
I mean it was, for no
reason, we we're trying

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.100 position:56%
to be popular or anything like that.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.780
We were trying to get the song out.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.320
It was like the first, the first
record we recorded was in France.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.620
It was just happened.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:22.920
I mean we were in [inaudible]
and this guy came up

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.890
and says, I like your music.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.190
Do you have a record?

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.490
I said no.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:28.790
Would you like to make a record?

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.090
I said yeah.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.390
And he was like the
head of [inaudible].

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.550
So I said we don't
have too many days.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.850
No problem.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.570
But the really first record

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:40.760
in the United States we
did we did for Floyd.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.860 position:56%
I tried to do the whole gamut of it.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.980
First of all, we had the French
and English translations.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.510
And the second one it wasn't
just two steps and waltzes.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.810
There were ballads.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.110
They were tin pan alley songs.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.410
They were creole songs.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.710 position:56%
They were reels and stuff like that.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.710
Because that's what we were
learning after uncovering this

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.870
where they just go to a dance,
let's get drunk or try to get laid.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.440
You know, it's like a
whole different picture.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.730
So we played what we call, I guess,
back porch music or kitchen music.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.160
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So when you
said Floyd, that's Floyd Soileau?

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.460
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: Yeah.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Yeah.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.060
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.360
Okay.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Yeah,
it was called The Spirit

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.960
of Cajun music, the
Cajun Spirit Music.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.260
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.300
So David, something that you
said, you said, you know,

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.730
you weren't really playing the
music, you were learning guitar.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.030
And that sort of brings
up that question

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:30.400
of how much guitar has changed in
the way it's played in Cajun music

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.960
over the last little while and
you being a big part of that.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.350
What, you know, what did you do

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:40.950
to integrate different guitar
styles and to Cajun music?

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.360
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: Well, I
had a couple of heroes.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.670
The old Doc Watson's
my hero, you know.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.080
But at home, there weren't
that many people that played.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.730
There was three guitar
players, three or four.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.680
One was Rod, I loved the
way Rodney Balfa played.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.110
And then D.L. was there,
D.L. Menard.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.870
And then Preston Manuel who's
always played with Dennis.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.780
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: So he had some,
impressed, by this time, you know,

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:08.210
as a teenager or just, you know,
I just graduated from high school,

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.550 position:56%
you go to Fred's Lounge in Mamou
and, Saturday morning, what, 8 a.m.,

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.550
something like that,
go to a radio show.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:18.590
And these guys, they'd be drunk at
8:00 in the morning playing music.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:19.890
But I'd watch him.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.190
You'd see Nathan Abshire
would be there,

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.490
would be the accordion player.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.790
So you got to see these guys.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.670
So you see Preston interact.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.170
And I thought the stuff
he did was good.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.560
And the guy played the
chords, what I heard.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.860
So for me it was like, when
you blend all that together

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.620
and the stuff I was learning,
the folk, I liked folk music.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.920
That was my thing.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.220
I listened to Paul Simon.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.120
Then I said, well I discovered
Doc and a couple of blues guys.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.230
I said this is like
really cool stuff.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.930
And I thought, you
could put them together.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.230
I really don't know what
people are doing now.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.530
I don't live in Lafayette.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.820 position:56%
I don't really go see that many
bands, so I don't know what they do.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.510
And occasionally someone
says, well I heard, you know,

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.810
they say I'm trying
to play it like you.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.720
I learned this from Mitchell,
because Mitchell teaches.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.880
So he tells me that people
are interested in that.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.310
And I think it's really hard to do.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:10.480
It's hard to actually be heard
and set up to play acoustic,

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.400
like what we do is very difficult.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.940
And it takes a lot of patience.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.260
And like we have our
own sound guy usually.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.270
It's hard, and not
everyone can afford

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:19.770
to do that or want to do that.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.490
And acoustic guitar
is just not allowed.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:22.790
It's not loud as an accordion.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.530
It's definitely not
as loud as a fiddle.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:26.460
You know, to make it
fit and try to do stuff.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.760
So, you know.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Fit that sound.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.360
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: That's what we do.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.590
And when I play solo I play it
all finger style in open tuning.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:34.720
So that's, from a Hawaiian
influence, believe it

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.890
or not, which is really bizarre.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.190
You know.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
That makes sense, yeah.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:40.790
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: But the
whole deal was the rhythms.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.760 position:56%
I thought the rhythms were cool, you
know, getting into it, learning it.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.710
When he called up it's
1977, in August,

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.010
we're going to make a record.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.380
Come practice.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.050
You know, I'd never really
thought about it before.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.350
Never really listened to it.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.370
You see it on TV and kind of
laugh at the old people dancing.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:56.670
That's what, you know.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.680
These people are like what
30 years older than me.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.980
They were old, you know.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.650
They were like 45 years old.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:03.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: That's old.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.770
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: You know, and
they were dancing, and it's like.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.010 position:56%
Folks would make fun of it because I
think they made fun of the language.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:11.310 position:56%
If you spoke French you were stupid.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.270
You know, you were uneducated.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: But
they both spoke French.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.300
And my father always [inaudible].

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.600
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: But
if they didn't want us

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.900
to know what they were
talking about,

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.200
what do you think they'd speak?

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.500
French.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: You see that'
show you learn how to speak French,

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.100
because I'd say, hmmm,
they used to play cards.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.970
And you could only stay in the
room where they played Bourre.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.250
And you could only stay in the room
if they tell you something to do,

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.590
and you knew what it was and
you'd answer back in French.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.540
So I was adamant about
learning that, because I wanted

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.610
to learn all the dirty
words, you know.

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.160
And so I did.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.560
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: That's the truth.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.860
That's how it was.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.160
It was different.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.460
They want you to go
learn French in school

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.590
but not French, what
they spoke at home.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Yeah,
but they kept it up.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.050
I mean it was, Paulette
and I both spoke French.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.350
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: Oh yeah.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.650
We all understood it.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:52.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: That's
what was, people our age were.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.250
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: Well the
old people in the country,

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.550
if you see the old people,
that's all they spoke.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:56.850
They just spoke French.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:58.680
The gardener my grandmother had,
he didn't speak a word of English.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.700
But you have to understand
what he was saying.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.000
You know, stuff like the guy

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.870
that lived next door
can come wind my watch.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:07.400
He'd say that in French because
he couldn't, he had arthritis.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.690
He couldn't, Arthur-itis
[phonetic] like they called it.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.880
It's like, you know, that is weird.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.560 position:56%
When you think of it like now, it's
like, man, what a weird time it was.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.500
It was like in the late
60s early 70s was a mess.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: There was no,
it was not about commercialization.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.370 position:56%
When Paul Prudum [phonetic], who
had a small restaurant in Appaloosa,

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.660
moved to New Orleans, burned the
red fish, it became a phenomenon.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.950
And then people started
looking at it.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.070
And then Glenn Pete did a movie.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.720
I think movies had
a lot to do with it.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.480
He did one called [inaudible].

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.090
And then there was another
movie called The Big Easy,

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.390
which was terrible.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:46.240
But nevertheless, it took place
in New Orleans and brought out,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.120
you know, the Louisiana music.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.640
And that began this whole
thing of Cajun restaurants

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.500
in all parts of the country.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.410
I mean, we got some stuff,
I don't know what it was,

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.370
but it wasn't what we were used to.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:03.710
So we have it in our contract,
do not serve us Cajun food.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: Under absolutely no
circumstances feed the band Cajun.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: And so we were
in St. Louis, outside of St. Louis,

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:17.680
anyway, this little
town, and the guys says,

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.980
somebody's cooking for you.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.280
I said oh no.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.270
And we walk in there and
it's like a magna light,

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.990
and it's got about ten
pounds of crawfish.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.880
And I said oh, this might be good.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.770
Well, you know, ten pounds
of crawfish would feed

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.060
about 20 people if
they weren't Cajuns.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.360
Well, we ate the whole thing.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.660
So that kind of thing.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.960
But then, that gradually changed.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.680 position:56%
And of course, it became commercial,
you know, blackened chicken

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.980
and stuff like that, you know.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.540
But that all, with that,
we're excited about the music

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.550
because they would have
to have the music with it.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.640
So that influenced a lot too.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:50.590
And my wife always says, you know,
well you're the reason why it's

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:53.340
like this because we'd go
out and say, you know, come.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.690
Well, they came, and
they didn't leave.

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:59.150
And what's odd about it is
that you can't go to the Cajun

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.890
or a zydeco dance and have just
people from Louisiana there.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.350
That's, when we played we said
just people from Louisiana.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.380
Check their licenses, you know.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.610
Because I mean it's
changed that much.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:13.540
It's become a thing, like David was
beginning to have his tirade about.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.850
But it's, we caused it in a way.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.250
And it's good because
it helped people.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:22.300
But it's, I can't even tell
you how different it is now.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.740
I mean just the fact.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.420
I mean Marc Savoy says,
there's no more Cajun.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.020
They're just rednecks.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.070
You know, and so that's
a whole different story.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.580
Let Marc answer that one.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.750
But I mean, that's his
perspective and, you know.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.630
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: But I
mean, that also opens up kind

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.470
of another question which is,
so you were saying, you know,

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:41.760
check their licenses, only
people from Louisiana.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.670
But not everyone from Louisiana
is a Cajun, and not everyone

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.580
who spoke French in
Louisiana was a Cajun.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Exactly.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.180
Exactly. But that's what I mean,
the name, it doesn't exist.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.480
It's all a myth, you know.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right, yeah.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: So we
don't exist, you know.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.380
I don't know why we're talking.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.680
Why are we talking?

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.980
Anyway, yeah, you're right.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.560
And that's because people,
you know, they have Romeros,

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.370
they have Hoffpauirs [phonetic],
that only speak French.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.670 position:56%
That was something amazing about it.

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.230 position:56%
But that was a predominant language.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.220
And that was the strength we had,
which is the strength in language,

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.460
which is the strength in community,
which evolves into music, okay.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.380
And when that stuff
gets breaking out,

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.010
or like David was saying, put down.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:18.270
I mean, we thought we were
second class citizens.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:23.510 position:56%
When Nick Spitzer told me in 1973
that I could get a grant, I said oh,

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.120
they give grants to Cajuns?

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.100
That's how naïve we were.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.360
Because it was like, you know,
nobody, they'd just make fun of us.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.660
I mean we, they made fun of us.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.320
We were from a little
town called Scott.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.390
We went to school in Lafayette,
and people would make fun of us

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:38.960
and laugh, yeah, you know,
much less go out in the world.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.030
And then we realized oh, people

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.510
in France love this stuff
and Canada, etcetera.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.630
So it has a different meaning.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.300
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So you mentioned
another band that you were in,

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.320
Coteau, talk a little
bit about that.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.620
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Coteau, Coteau.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.990
You want to see a picture?

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:55.290
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sure.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Sure.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:00.010
This was the, they called
it the Cajun Grateful Dead.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:06.640
What happened, it was Gary Newman,
whose father was Jimmy C. Newman,

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.300
and Jimmy C. Newman
was from Ville Platte,

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:14.010
and he played on the Hayride.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.550
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: He
was in a hayride, yeah.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:17.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: As did Elvis.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.430
He was there when, Elvis ruined it.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.700
Nobody would come after
Elvis was there.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:27.520
But he found his way to Nashville,
and he did really, really well.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.990
I mean, he wrote this
song called Cry, Cry, Cry.

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:32.720
And it became, you know, his song.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.420
And anyway, so he decided,
he was on the Grand Ole Opry.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.150
What was the question?

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:39.450
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Coteau.

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:40.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Oh Coteau, okay.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.970
So his son, Gary, okay this
was I was, Gary came down.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.610
This is hysterical.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:49.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Very nice.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: That's us.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:55.770
And then Andy Wallace just gave
me this other picture that,

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:59.220
this is at Wolf Trap, 1976.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Very nice.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: You see that
skinny guy with the red shirt.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet:
We're dressed up, yeah.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.040
And anyway.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.380
So Coteau is, Gary, he
got some people around.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.800 position:56%
He's got Bessel de Young [phonetic],
who was, you know, a friend.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.530
My mother used to play
cards with his mother.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.540
And my mother used to say,
don't hang around him.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.840
Of course, I did.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.500
Because Bessel's father
played, recorded in 1936

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.270
with a string band,
Cajun string band.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:29.630
But Bessel was a musician,
a great musician.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:30.930
And so we played twin fiddles.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:33.050
And it was twin guitars, drums.

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:35.210
And we brought the
young people together.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:36.760
It was like this thing happening.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.730 position:56%
This was like from about '74 to '77.

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.210
And we really united
a lot of people,

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:44.500
because the old Cajuns would
come, what are you all doing?

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.430
I mean we played a
song like Mardi Gras,

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.580
which was one of the oldest songs.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.880
And people had never heard that.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.190
Of course, our rendition
was a little long.

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:55.370
But you know, it was
like, it was fun.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:57.570
It was a happening time.

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:02.080
And it was kind of like, I
mean we're very creative,

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.410
but it was kind of like Spinal Tap.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.780
You know, like the drummers
would like evaporate.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.130
We lost, three of our
guitar players died.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:13.610
So that's why David didn't want
to go in the group, you know.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:15.190
But was just, you know.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:17.810
I mean it's a hard, it's same.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.410
So that brought a lot of awareness.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:22.870
And so it also brought
a rock influence into it

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:25.300
but at the same time,
a folk mentality.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.340
And that's where, when we
play, what Andy just said,

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.210 position:56%
we played the National Folk Festival
it was both Coteau and BeauSoleil

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:36.090
because my whole idea was to do
this acoustically, like I heard it.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.390
You know, we didn't need rock.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:38.690
We didn't need a drum.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:44.590
We just needed, you know, a guitar,
fiddle, accordion and percussion.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.660
So this is the original
BeauSoleil group.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.810
And that was enough.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.800
That's sort of what Coteau did.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.330
But a lot of people
still remember that.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah and
so, and then after that,

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:59.560
some of those influences did get
absorbed into the BeauSoleil.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Yeah.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.430
That was in the '80s, because
that's what they wanted.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.270 position:56%
That's what Kenner with the round
the one, he wanted the Coteau sound.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:08.420
I said well, we're not
getting Coteau again, you know.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.030 position:56%
I mean it happened when it happened.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.480
And then we tried to do it again.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:16.020
In fact, we got together to do
another Coteau album, only one.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.800
But it was like, because, anyway.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:25.040
And then the guitar player
dies, and it was like, you know.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.010
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: But I mean,
it's worked for BeauSoleil though,

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:28.340
to have those influences.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Yeah, of course.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: It sort

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.990
of made you the Cajun
band that anybody knows.

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Well, I
don't know what that did.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.260
But we just, we played.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.970
I mean, you know, our thing was
to play this music in the schools.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:43.610
And we had a, Dewey and I had
a grant together to do this.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:45.920
And we did a lot of the
schools, taught all the way

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.060
to the university level,
you know, to educate people

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.660 position:56%
about this before it's totally gone.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.130
And I'm not talking about my
generation, people way beyond me.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.670
And that was our, what
we really wanted to do.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:00.010
But then people, like the
first year of BeauSoleil,

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.440
we played Natural Folk Festival.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.740
We played Jimmy Carter's
inauguration in '77.

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:10.310
We had all these gigs,
and you know, anyway.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:16.380
And so it got to the point in the
mid-80s that it was hard to hold

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.790 position:56%
down a regular job and go out on the
weekends and play these festivals.

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:24.930
So in '85 we decided, let's
try this, let's try it.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:28.320 position:56%
And everybody going to jump in, give
it six months, see what happens.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.470
So we did that in '86, and
we've been doing it ever since.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:37.610
I mean it has its ebbs and flows,
but it's, we were very lucky to be

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:39.760
at a certain time and to know
these people and be able to play

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.380
with these people and learn
their music firsthand.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.870
Nowadays, I mean, kids, you go on
YouTube and hear whatever you want.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:48.650
But in those times,
you had to be a person.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:51.910
And when you knock on a door
and somebody you don't know,

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.880
you know it's a whole
different thing to do that.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.230
Because you don't want
to take their music,

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:56.990
you just want to learn their music.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:00.930
So you befriend these people,
and you're friends for life.

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:02.230
You can't do that YouTube.

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.410
They don't [inaudible] back.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.960
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So we
haven't talked to Bill much.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.810
So, you know, a lot of
what we're saying applies

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.110
to percussion as well.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.420
There's been a lot of
changes over the years,

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:15.980
and I think that integration
of new sounds,

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.140
and I suppose it must
have changed what you do.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.050
So talk a little about
that if you would.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:21.350
&gt;&gt; Billy Ware: Well sure.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:25.090
I mean I was in the, on that
original Swallow Record recording.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:28.890
And I had been doing, I hadn't
been playing Cajun music.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:32.520
I had been doing, with a group
of people, small group of people,

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.940
and we improvised music for
choreographers at the university.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:41.060
And we would continue going through
this process and codify it so it's

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.130
in its final form for
the performances.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:46.800
And I was doing, I was playing
in different size jazz groups

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.450
from a quartet to a quintet to
a septet, doing real book stuff.

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:54.720
And that's what I was
doing when Mike,

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.940
I get word from a mutual
friend of ours, Michael and I,

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.240
Frances [inaudible] the artist.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.420
I'm an old friend of his.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.660
The word was, Michael was
going to do this record,

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.910
and he wanted to know if
I wanted to participate.

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:13.680
So I did. So, you know, I
brought some of this to that old,

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.270
to the party, so to speak.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:19.100
And I was trying to figure out
what to do basically, you know.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:25.010
And because there was a certain
lightness to a lot of the way

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:26.310
that these songs were played.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:29.860
I mean I had heard some English
folk music and things like that.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:33.010
So that was part of my thinking
for those songs, you know.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:38.040
And I would just apply things where
I thought percussion made sense.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.360
You know, if we need this for
drive or color or whatever,

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.490
I would use it there, you know.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.510
But I didn't just gratuitously
add something.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:48.680
And I still don't do that.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.770
But as far as being,
adding percussion

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.510
to Cajun music, nobody does that.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:56.030
I'm the only guy, I'm standing
alone out in my field, you know.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:34:00.570
Nobody's come after me, so I
don't know what to make of that.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:01.870
But.

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: It didn't make
any sense to me that you had Billy

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:05.300
who was so talented,
and played triangle,

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.710
we had to get triangle from.

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:08.950
&gt;&gt; Billy Ware: I didn't even
have one for that recording.

00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:10.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Yeah.

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.910
But the thing is, all our
music, we would play, you know,

00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:16.010
exotical music, some
exotic, some creole song.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.310
Why didn't they use drums?

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:19.090
That's like the basic thing.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:21.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: And Billy
had, you know, in his hand,

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:22.990
and all this kind of stuff.

00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:24.290
And I said, that's good.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:25.590
That gels the music.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:26.890
That brings it all together.

00:34:26.890 --> 00:34:28.190
It is very unique.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:29.900
&gt;&gt; Billy Ware: Yeah,
and you can change off.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.150
If you have a very kit, you
can change off during a song.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.980
And it's like, and frankly, I
took that approach from looking

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.930
at early weather report stuff.

00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:42.090
You know, from the beginning
of the 70s, you know.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:45.440
And that's, I wasn't quite as
interactive and spontaneous

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.510
in my approach to applying that.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:50.340
But still, just the idea that
you could use different things

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:53.560
in different places to articulate
and whatever, expand upon.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.400
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, it just
changes the texture during a song.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.660
&gt;&gt; Billy Ware: Yeah, yeah, but
that's where I was coming from.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.890
Frankly, that's where
I still come from.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:04.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: With that
weather report it's going to rain.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.340
&gt;&gt; Billy Ware: Not today.

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.760
It looks like, feels like 82,
mostly cloudy at night, you know.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.930
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So did you
even play triangle at first,

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:12.230
or did you have to learn that?

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:13.530
&gt;&gt; Billy Ware: No, I didn't
even own one, you know.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:16.020
As matter of fact, when we
went to Floyd's Swallow Studio,

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.320
there was one lying around.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.620
They said here, you can use this.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.920
That was great.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.220
It's a relief.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.520
I've got something to play here.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.890
And I put, you know, I don't know
if you've heard their record,

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:25.190
but I put all kinds of stuff on it.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:28.880
It's like, well I just brought a
bunch of things, and we had to pile

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.480
in a van as I remember,
David, Michael and I.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet:
That's pretty much it.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:34.130
&gt;&gt; Billy Ware: It was
wild, you know.

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:36.400
At the end of the day, we
would drive up there and work

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.060 position:56%
into the night, and then we'd finish

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.030
and then drive back
afterwards, you know.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:42.080
I don't even know how
long that took.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: It
took us a long time.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:45.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Billy Ware: Yeah, it seemed like.

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:46.570
It seemed like weeks to me.

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:47.870
You know, so.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:49.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: With Billy,
you got to see us trying,

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:51.800
Don Montece [phonetic] is an
accordion player and a bus driver,

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.820
and he's a welder, so
he made these beautiful,

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.000
beautiful triangles from rakes.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.300
And you'd have to go to him.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.600 position:56%
And Billy's got one that's extended.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.170
Don said, I messed up on that one.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:02.470
Billy says, I love that one.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:05.480
And he played it, what
was it a tractor like,

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.780
some kind of wrench or something.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.660
&gt;&gt; Billy Ware: Well the triangle
is, actually Don Montece had made

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.980
that for a certain individual,

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.980
a custom [inaudible]
as they say, you know.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:17.280
And I saw that.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.770
And as Michael said,
I want that one.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:21.830
He said, well, you know, that
guy, he just recently died,

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:23.730
so he's not going to be using it.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:25.250
So I bought that one from him.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:29.290
And the striker, when I was in
college, I was going walking

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:32.690
into a building in a field, and my
foot hit something, and I looked,

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:36.720
and it was a gear shift from
apparently like, you know,

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.860
like a tractor or something.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.850
And you see this threading on
the end where the ball went,

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:45.910
with still like the
catalog number on the part.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:48.860
But, you know, the thing is,
it's got a great balance.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds good.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.820
&gt;&gt; Billy Ware: Because it
tapers towards the end.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.170
And you can do that, and
it balances beautifully.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:58.520
And because it's tapered, and
because it's not completely round

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.900
or flat, you can get a lot of
different tonalities out of it.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:06.360 position:56%
So you get like a capable Cajun
triangle like that or a [inaudible],

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.930
you can use this thing and
apply it in different ways,

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:14.390
and turning it this way, and you
can get subtle shifts in tonality,

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:17.110
which can mirror the
melody of the song.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.410
So.

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:19.710
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Excellent.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.010
Well, we got more about
the different tonalities

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:22.800
of the triangle than the fiddle.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: The
fiddle just sounds the same.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:27.510
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:29.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So I also
wanted to talk to Mitch about some

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:32.420
of the other groups that you've
been in, like Taso [phonetic]

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.720
and some of those groups.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:37.940
What was the philosophy there
with other bands you've been in?

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.950
&gt;&gt; Mitchell Reed: Oh
yeah, with Taso,

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:43.180
in fact Mike produced our
record, it was to just try

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.500
to sound like the old 78 records.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.740
And we had, we found this guy
in the swam, Philip Alamo,

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:54.780
he was spraying water lilies
for Wildlife and Fisheries.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.020
But he sounded just
like these old guys.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:01.840
And his accordion even, he played
one of Errol Verret's accordions.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:06.440
But Mike has like the first
accordion Marc Savoy ever made.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.540
And it's this wild accordion.

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:13.930
So Mike let us borrow it, and we
did a record, and Mike produced it.

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:17.530
And it was just really to sound
like those old 78s, you know.

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.110
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: I think
I've got that record.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:22.830
&gt;&gt; Mitchell Reed: Oh, okay, yeah.

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:24.130
Oh good, good.

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:25.430
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Excellent.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:26.730
So good job from all of you.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:28.030
&gt;&gt; Mitchell Reed: Thank you.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.330
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So great.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:30.930
And the other person that's now
come up a whole bunch of times

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:33.610
and has also been a
musical partner of yours

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.320
for a long time, is Marc Savoy.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.740
And so talk a little
about the Savoy influence

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.750 position:56%
on Cajun music but also on you guys.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet:
You mean the dynasty?

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:43.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah,
the dynasty, the band.

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:45.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Well,
the thing about Marc,

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:47.110
Marc is a super intelligent person,

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:50.490
which is unusual around
where we live.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.920
And he's very special.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.760
Like I said, he was born at
a certain time here he was,

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.310
one foot in one time era, the
other foot in the modern time.

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:05.050
And he decided, I think he's
celebrating his 50, his 50th year

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:09.380
or something like that,
of opening his door.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:13.510
And he did that because, after he
heard that people went in Newport,

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.760
he said oh, it's going
to be popular.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.920
So there was only one or very few
accordion makers at that time.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.140
So he started making, because
he graduated in engineering.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.040
And he starting making accordions
because we didn't have that,

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.580
I mean they would fall
apart, you know.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.080
They had these old Hohners or
monarch of Sterlings for sure,

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:34.480
made pre-World War II Germany.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.720
And so he started doing that.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.950
So he was like, he was the
focal point where you find it.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:42.780
And if you want to have a
[inaudible] you bring it to him.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.420
Because it'd bring it to life.

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:45.720
[Inaudible].

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.800
Marc was just, and it
is, is a treasure trove

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.760
of what was going on at that time.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:55.070
It just so happens it was at
that 1976 National Folk Festival

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:57.060
where Marc just showed up.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.650
He actually played with us.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.260
But he would pull me to
the side, come on Mike,

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.560
let's just jam, you know.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:07.310
So we'd go to some, wherever, and
lo and behold this young woman

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:11.480
by the name of Ann Allen Savoy
from Richmond, Virginia, showed up,

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.730
and like was totally
enamored with the music.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:15.500
And she went, and she
and Marc got together.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.840
And that's Mrs. Savoy.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.980
And of course, they
had kids all along.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.090
And their kids have done, I mean
from Sarah, who's in France.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.000
She's a chef and plays accordion.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.130
To Joel, he was kind
of, music label.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:32.500
And Wilson who plays boogie
woogie and all this stuff.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:37.400
And you know, it's like
it's a very solid family.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.730
But I mean, they're crazy
like everybody else.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.830
And they just, it's just fun.

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:45.780
And the thing with this,
Marc is just very aware

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.630
about what is right, what is wrong.

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:51.810
I mean we've had long discussions
about, you know, in the early days,

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:56.060
I'm talking about in the early
70s about really the influence

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.610
of the creoles, the black creoles.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:03.100
And I was always been a proponent
of Amede Ardoin because, you know,

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.130
because I just love his music.

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:07.540
And people in Cajun said
oh, he played too many notes

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.170
and choppy and stuff like that.

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:13.420
But the quality of what he played
and the creativity is just amazing.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.150
And a lot of us didn't have
access to these things.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:21.340
Although Marc, his parents, Amede
played at Marc's parents' house.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.040
I mean and Dennis used to live
in the house he's living in now.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.890
So it's a funny thing that happens.

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:31.010
So he is one of those people
that's just, it's a cornerstone,

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:32.730
he's a cornerstone of our society.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:36.050
And that's just the way it is.

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:40.160
And he didn't try to be.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.690
He doesn't want any kind of
accolades or anything like that.

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:46.450
And a lot of people,
oh I can do this.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:51.260
And that's another lesson that, you
know, Octa used to say, Octa Clark,

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.320
he'd say, well you can't do it
wrong if you do it right, you know.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.220
And I think that's, you just try to
do it right for the right reasons.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.440
And so Marc has been a
great example of that.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.450
And people sometimes are scared.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.210
Because if he doesn't like you.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:05.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: I mean,
don't touch that guitar.

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:08.110
You going to buy it?

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:09.410
It's time for you to leave.

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:10.710
You know, he doesn't care.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.010
I mean he goes beyond
what most, anything.

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:17.150
You know, it's like, he's got
a sign in his shop that says,

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:19.960
Stradivari made 661 instruments.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.030
The Cajuns have 2,000 of them.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:24.510
You know, it's like [inaudible].

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.990
And other philosophies.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:28.400
So yeah, he's quite an individual.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.700
And the family is great.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:33.010
And still, I had dinner with him
last Saturday, so alive and well.

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:34.310
Say hello.

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:35.610
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Alright.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:37.350
So another thing I wanted
to ask about was songwriter.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:40.350
Because you played a couple
of songs today that you wrote.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:41.650
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Yeah.

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:42.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
But they, you know,

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:45.020
they sound like they could be
traditional songs, and certainly,

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.420
they have traditional
expressions in them.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.950
Just the way that you
wrote them is really

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:51.610
in keeping with the tradition.

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:54.370
What's your philosophy on
that, on the songwriting?

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:57.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Well, I haven't
written that many songs, you know,

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:00.300
a hundred or so, but anyway.

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.110
You know, it's nice
to do an expression.

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:04.410
I love traditional music.

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:05.850
When David and I got
together, that was it.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:10.220
I mean we're just going to learn as
much as we can, different styles.

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:13.980
But there's a certain point, and
I use the metaphor as a wheel.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:17.470
Sometimes there's a cog
missing, and you get,

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.070
you're not saying exactly
what you want to say.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:25.040
So creating a song or writing
a song gives you that element.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.780
And so you perpetuate that.

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:30.570
And a lot of the songs
that I like to write,

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:34.290
or did at some points,
was about musicians.

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:36.620
Like Bebe Carriere or
Freeman Fotno [phonetic],

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.150
people that most people don't know.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:41.760
But to us, they're
like, they're revered.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.060
And so songs about that.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.250
Other songs are more modern songs.

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:47.180
And sometimes they work.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.480
Sometimes they don't.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.600
And it's wonderful to hear
people play them, you know.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:54.920
But I don't write them for other
people, I write them for us.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.070
And because it just works
really well with, like I said,

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:58.680
this key and things like that.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.830
David sings this song, and
you know, things like that.

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:03.870
So I enjoy writing.

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:05.280
I don't write as much anymore.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.650
But I still do, you know.

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:09.630
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well on the
other end of that you mentioned,

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:13.170
there were times when people
didn't have access to some

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:15.880
of the older music, and they
weren't able to get them either

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.410
because they were on old 78s

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:19.690
or because they were
old archival recordings.

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.180
And we have an interest
in that because, you know,

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.480
this is the Library of Congress.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.780
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Oh,
that's where we are?

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.080
I knew it looked familiar.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.380
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
The recordings for.

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.330
So talk about the influence of
archival recording on [inaudible].

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.370
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: I came
here when we got a grant,

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:35.340 position:56%
it's called the [inaudible]
studies grant at, at that time, USL.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.440
And it was amazing grant
is that we had music.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.060
We had language.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:41.860
There's no such thing
as a Cajun dictionary.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:45.000
They had been Cajun dictionaries
in the 30s and things like that.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.790
People who studied [inaudible]
amazing stuff that we found.

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.710
Architecture, women,
creole, [inaudible].

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:55.530
So I was asked to teach
the Cajun or French music.

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:59.350 position:56%
The name of my course was French
music in Louisiana, opera to zydeco.

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:01.140
So that' pretty vast.

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.650
One of those things that we
knew about, and I was befriended

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:07.700
in the early 70s, was a woman by
the name of Irene Whitfield Holmes

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.010
who wrote one of the first books.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:15.280
It was her 1939 LSU thesis on
folk songs of French Louisiana.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.370
And you know, another one,
I thought she was dead too.

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:20.370
My aunt says, no, she lives
right behind over there.

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.780
So I went, and we became
really good friends.

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.740
And she's the one who gave
me my first Amede Ardoin, 78,

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:27.830
which you could play in those days.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:29.520
And she played violin.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.160
So we played these
terrible duets together.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.240
But she, her book, I
learned a lot in the book.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:37.240
And some of my first records
where she translated Alan

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.780
and John Lomax's recordings,
transcribed.

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:44.520
I'd never heard it, and from her
transcriptions we recorded there

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.820
of their songs.

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.060
And then finally in
1979, I came down here

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.790
to collect the whole
Lomax collections,

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:54.130
and that's when Hickerson was here.

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.290
And I just, I couldn't leave.

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:58.910
I had never heard anything
like this.

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:00.370
It was so amazing.

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:02.270
So thanks to the Library of
Congress, and Al, of course.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:05.100
We met Alan Lomax when he
came down, blah, blah, blah.

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:10.660
But yeah, I mean I think it, when
Alec Jabor [phonetic] was here too,

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:13.340
it kind of, we kind of shy.

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.400
You know, it's like
Washington, but, you know, hmm.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.240
But once you get here, you realize
it's all run by human beings

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.810
who have the same passion
that we do.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:24.010
So it kind of knocked
down those walls.

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:28.360
So yeah, very much appreciate being
here and being able to perform.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.660
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick.

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.340
Well we love to have you here, and.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:32.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Well
we're free next week.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Alright.

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:40.080
So yeah, so you know, it's now
time when I'm going to ask you guys

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:43.840
if there's anything else
you feel that should be said

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.170
about your tradition
about Cajun music.

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:50.300
&gt;&gt; Billy Ware: I don't
think it's dying.

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet:
It's alive and well.

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.000
It's different.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.300
It changes.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.600
It's not the same thing.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.380
Like David was saying, you know,
it's never going to be the same.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:58.900
People have to accept that.

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:03.830 position:56%
Cajun music kind of changes, that's
why it perpetuates itself like that.

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.520
You find more people
singing it in English.

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.170
And that's going to happen.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:10.220
Because people can understand it.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.760
You know, You're not
going to sing a song just

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.140
because people can't understand it.

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.440
That's not the point.

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.010
The point of it was
to sing in French

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:18.150
because that's who
your audience was.

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:22.390
And you know, it's hard to
deal with this to see a change.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:27.650
We saw the changes in the 70s,
you know, when, well first of all,

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:32.260
when Will and Rodney Balfa
died February 9, 1979.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.490
That's like the day the music died

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:37.440
because it was never really
the same, even for Dewey.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.650
And then Nathan died
the year after that.

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:41.280
And Dewey's wife died.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:46.600
And so anyway, it's
like, you, you know,

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.850
you play it because you love it,
and you live life to the fullest.

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:51.150
And that's what it is.

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:52.450
And that's still the same.

00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:53.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.050
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: People
only hear stories now.

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:59.290
That's what I, you know, I play
with a couple of little bands,

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:04.720 position:56%
and I done one in a town called
Morris, Louisiana, about a month ago

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.470
with one of the Pine Leaf Boys.

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:11.450
And these guys are all, they
all played, but they hired them

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:14.150
to do this Knights
of Columbus thing.

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:15.490
But what they wanted to hear,

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:18.240
because I was there, I
knew Canray Fontenot.

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.560
They wanted to hear stories
by Canray they don't know.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.430
They wanted to hear a
couple of stories about,

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.360
even Dewey, but also Dennis.

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.720
Nobody knows the story about
Dennis when we took him to New York

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.020
and he almost had a heart attack

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:30.320
when Michael stole
him out of a hospital.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.620
And still had his electrodes on.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:32.920
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Hey Gladys.

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.220
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: But
things like that.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:37.740
That's what people, because
they don't, there's no contact.

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:39.040
Those people aren't there.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.500
We lived through that.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.010
And so we saw this.

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:45.490
And it's like, you tell the
stories today and people say, no.

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:46.790
They don't believe any of them.

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.810
Mitchell has stories of
some of the old timers.

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:51.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: But you know,
yeah you got, the time when,

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:54.240
you know, James Booker
is a great piano player.

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.090
And we were just happen
to be in New Orleans.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:58.460 position:56%
So there were about 15 people there.

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.110
And he'd play a song,
and he'd say okay.

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:01.410
He had a new album.

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:02.710
Okay, who wants to buy an album?

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:04.890
Well, after 15 songs,
we all had his album.

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:06.590
It was his last concert.

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:07.890
&gt;&gt; He didn't play no more.

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:10.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Fifteen people,
I've talked to about 100 people

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:11.550
who told me they were there.

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:12.990
And I said, funny I
don't remember you there.

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:16.200
And so you have this, even though
it's folklore and people want to.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.920
I heard this, anyway.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.460
So that's changed too.

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:23.920
So the thing is to set
it straight, you know.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.220
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winnick: Well
now you have to tell a story

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.520
about Canray, because you.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.870
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: There's
a lot of them.

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:31.380
&gt;&gt; Billy Ware: Well,
let me tell you.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.740
[ Overlapped Speaking ]

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.780
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: Michael had
an emergency kidney stone,

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.010
and couldn't make the trip.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:39.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.430
So it's like, oh, he's
hurting and all this.

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:42.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: So who
you going to get to replace?

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.030
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: Get
Canray to take his place.

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:45.330
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet:
Like who else, man.

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:46.630
They said, what?

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:50.110
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: Yeah so, you
know, Canray, we got him a ticket.

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:51.410
You know, those were the old days.

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:53.310
You could change the
name on the ticket.

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:54.720
And I remember calling up.

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.420
Michael gave me his phone
number, and I talked to his wife.

00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:58.900
She said, he's so excited, David.

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:00.560
He's drunk in a ditch somewhere.

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.610
I said oh my God, is he
going to show up for the gig?

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:06.040
We go, I don't even know
if Michael knows this.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.030
He was my roommate.

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:10.430
And we'll get to that later.

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:13.100
We play the gig, and you know,
Canray liked to drink a little bit.

00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:17.150
And for some reason the
promoter had a half gallon

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:19.150
of Early Times backstage.

00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:21.950
And we were playing in
Charlotte, North Carolina.

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:24.980
And Canray, we all talked about it,
and said alright, we're going to go

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.400
and play two or three
songs, and you come out

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.700
and play the rest of the set.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.110
We'll introduce you and all this.

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:30.410
No problem.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:34.580
We played the three songs, Canray
come, so we play another song.

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:39.500
Canray. He comes out and
talks for the next 45 minutes.

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.850
Yeah, that reminds
me of another story.

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:42.150
Another story.

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:43.450
Okay, so he's a little drunk.

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:44.750
And we haven't eaten yet.

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:46.460
So we ended up, the only place
that was open in Charlotte,

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:50.180
North Carolina, and this is
the truth, was a Hooters.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.760
And our agent at the time took us,
and we went to eat at a Hooters.

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.680
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: And
of course, it was awful.

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.190
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: But then we
all go to the hotel and it's

00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:01.830
like Canray's my roommate, and I
didn't know he had false teeth.

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:04.180
And he took out his teeth
and he looked like ET.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:07.160
I woke up, who are you?

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.460
Something else, man.

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:09.960
But he was a character.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.240 position:56%
These are stories, there's a lot of.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.290
&gt;&gt; It's the right place
at the right time.

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:16.590
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: Or the time
we played for Dutch Morial

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:20.140
who was running for mayor, the
first black mayor of New Orleans.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:21.760
And Canray was somehow
involved with this.

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.910
I do not know how, but we
had to play a fundraiser.

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:26.730
We all get on the stage.

00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:30.530
Well Canray's tuned in between
standard pitch and somewhere.

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:31.830
&gt;&gt; Billy Ware: He's
like [inaudible].

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:33.130
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: You know, he was
our accordion player in the key

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:36.700
of C, and Canray is like
in C sharp or above.

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.000
Who knows.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.560
And we play songs in
double keys the whole night.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.860
It was very strong.

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:46.620
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: That's the way
it's supposed to sound, right.

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:50.070
But Canray was very, I mean he
was born, he lost his father.

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:51.370
He father was an accordion player,

00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:53.420
just the same caliber
as Amede Ardoin.

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.710
But he chose not to record.

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:58.950
And he had to work and support his
mother and his sisters, etcetera.

00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:00.250
So he had a hard life.

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:02.430
You know, he just kind
of had that on it.

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:05.000
And one of the, I mean there's
so many story like David says.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.740
But one of the times is
when Chris called me up,

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:11.070
we went to get Canray
just to record him.

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:13.140
And we had to, and we went
to where he was working.

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:17.940
He was lifting feed seed, I mean
seed sacks, feed seed sacks.

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:19.860
Feed seed sacks.

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.160
Yeah, okay.

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:24.320
Anyway, you know what I mean.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.820
And people who, the
proprietors of the place said,

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.540 position:56%
why are you interested in, you know,

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:31.130
I'm not going to use the
term, but you can imagine.

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:32.940
And I said, well basically,
he's a genius.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:35.290
And they just, you know.

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:38.540
And we went there that night, and
it was very, we had a great meal.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:40.060
And we did the record.

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:42.630
And he took off his
shoes, and just his foot

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:44.370
like that against the floor.

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:48.220 position:56%
So that was one of the high
points, just playing that, he and I.

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:52.640
But I mean he was, we played
in poor towns in 1980.

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.360
And you know, a lot
of white people there.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.840
So Canray hits the
bottle again, and he says,

00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.940
this is how he opens the concert.

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:04.890 position:56%
I feel like a fly in a bowl of milk.

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:07.980
And so, but, you know, it's like.

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:10.460
That's a whole different
interview, man.

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:12.380
I'd rather get started like that.

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:13.680
And you know, everybody knew him.

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.980
Everybody's got their stories.

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:16.840
&gt;&gt; Billy Ware: Basically,
we were there active

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:20.620
in this transition point in
which we, what was fundamental

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:23.430
in the 19th century and the
20th century for that culture.

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:25.710
You know, and all those
old guys are going away.

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:27.010
You know.

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:28.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: But
he was amazing to know.

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:29.610
Several different.

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:32.070
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: Or the time we
were playing at Carnegie Hall.

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:33.370
We're all in the cab.

00:53:33.370 --> 00:53:39.100
He gets out of the cab and
says, I've played here before.

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:40.400
&gt;&gt; I've been here.

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.160
Yeah. I remember that place.

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.460
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: He was a genius.

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:44.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Oh yeah.

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.060
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: That's just him.

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:47.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Yeah.

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:48.860
&gt;&gt; David Doucet: There's
countless others.

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:50.410
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well
one thing that, you now,

00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:53.620
this was something you said earlier
reminded me of, you were talking

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:56.410
about how playing, you know,

00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:58.270
playing English songs
is becoming more common

00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:01.290
because people don't
understand the French songs.

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:04.050
But that sort of made me
think about the influence

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.130
of other French-speaking places.

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:08.450
You know, you recorded
your first album in France.

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:12.270
And Canada is sort
of a big place too.

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:18.040
So how is that sort of global
French community affected you guys?

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: Well, we used to,

00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:21.080
they didn't have a
category for Cajun music.

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.010
We were world music rather.

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:24.310
They didn't know where to put us.

00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:29.210
It is really world music when you
think about all the influences.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:34.320
You know, it's like what
happened, it wasn't just now.

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.540
It happened in the 50s.

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:39.340
And a certain genre
of music that's mixed

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.730
with rockabilly and
New Orleans music.

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:43.690
And it's called swamp pop.

00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:47.210
This guy, Broden [phonetic]
came up with that.

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:48.640
And it's rock and roll.

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:52.550
And one of the guys, Rod Bernard
saying [inaudible] rock and roll.

00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:55.760
He was actually on
American Bandstand.

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:59.560
So it's always, you know, we
wanted to make the transition,

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:00.900
but they wanted to do it

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.450
with electric guitars
and things like that.

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:04.330
So it wasn't done with accordions.

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:05.630
That came later.

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:06.980
And Jimmy C. Newman,
you know he sings

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:08.570 position:56%
in English too, etcetera, like that.

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:12.490
So you know, all that,
Kershaw, [inaudible] too.

00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:15.290
I mean it's slowly it's there.

00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:20.160 position:56%
And I think for it to survive, it
has to regenerate to something else.

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.700
As long as it's real, you know.

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:25.200
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well you
guys definitely play real music.

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.500
I think we can all say that.

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:27.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet:
That's all we know.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.100
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yeah, well alright.

00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:30.950
I want to thank you very
much for this interview.

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:33.360
It's been a great time
sharing stories about

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: My pleasure.

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:35.960
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Cajun
music and French music.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Doucet: That's
what we talked about.

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:38.560
That's right.

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:41.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Alright,
thank you very much.

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:45.050
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
